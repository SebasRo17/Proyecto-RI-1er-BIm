I have a custom made Framework (written in PHP). It all works very good, but i have some doubts about a certain thing. Right now when a user call this url for example:               http://host.com/user/edit/12      Which would resolve to:   * user = userController   * edit = editAction() in userController   * 12 = treated as a param But suppose the controller 'userController' doesn't exist. Then i could throw a 404. But on the other hand, the url could also be used as params for the indexController (which is the default controller). So in that case:   * controller = indexController   * user = could be an action in indexController, otherwise treated as a param   * edit = treated as a param   * 12 = treated as a param That is actually how it works right now in my framework. So basically, i never throw a 404. I could ofcourse say that only params can be given if the controller name is explicitly named in the URL. So if i want the above url:               http://host.com/user/edit/12      To be invoked by the indexController, in the indexAction. Then i specifically have to tell what controller and action it uses in the URL. So the URL should become:               http://host.com/index/index/user/edit/12        * index = indexController   * index (2nd one) = the action method   * user = treated as a param   * edit = treated as a param   * 12 = treated as a param That way, when a controller doesn't exist, i don't reroute everything as a param to the index controller and simply throw a 404 error. Now my question is, which one is more preffered? Should i allow both options to be configurable in a config file? Or should i always use one of them. Simply because that's the only and best way to do it?
