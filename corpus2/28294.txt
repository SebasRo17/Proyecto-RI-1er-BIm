![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DKgUA.png) I have a `Graphics` element which I edit with Drawing Tools. I have determined a technique using `NotebookWrite` to add hyperlinks to the selected shape. My question is, how might I disable and enable the hyperlinks so that I can edit the current shape and surround shapes without invoking the links. **Other usability ideas are welcome**
