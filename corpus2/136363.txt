I'm a PHP developer and I recently started to work with CodeIgniter. It seems that whenever I search for something related to CodeIgniter, the blog posts and what not are usually from '09 or '10, so it got me thinking, is CodeIgniter still relevant and is it going to be in the future? Is there another framework that is taking it's place? The same goes for other languages and frameworks as well. At what point do you abandon learning certain languages or frameworks? Is there any easy way to find those that are emerging and worth picking up?
