I don't have much knowledge of the subject but as I know, when servers receive an email they have two sources of data to classify it as SPAM or not. The contents of the message (subject + body) and the metadata that goes with it (from who / to who / server that sent the message, etc). I know you can do basic filtering by blacklisting emails list and other sorts of metadata. But is it possible to do decent spam filtering without checking the contents of a message? Defining 'check the contents' as using any function that relies on data found on the body/subject of the message to classify it as spam or not spam. **Edit** : The reason I ask for this because of the "scroogled" campaign where Microsoft accuses Google of scanning the contents of emails for advertising purposes, and I think that they do the same for spam prevention purposes. So I asked them and they said: > We have tools and system set up to filter spam emails to and from > Outlook.com email accounts. However, we are not allowed to disclose how > these spam filters work for security purposes. > > ME: So can you assure me that no content from my personal email is being > analysed and cross referenced with other data in any way? > > ...In response to your question, its a yes, we can assure you that.
