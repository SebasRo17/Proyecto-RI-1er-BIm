I have a book which mentions: > "There are many types of testing, including unit testing, integration > testing, functional testing, system testing, performance testing, and > acceptance testing". It is often noted that many developers carry out unit-testing only, or no testing at all. From the types of testing above, which ones are to be conducted by the developer? What are the responsibilities of a developer when it comes to testing?
