Is it possible using `FinancialBond` function to calculate the yield of a bond paying a gradual coupon ? An example : > A bond with maturity of 7 years pays 4.125% the first 3 years, then 6% the > next two and finally 7.75% the last two. The actual price of the bond is > 102.35% and it is redeemed at par. I know the answer using `TimeValue` and `Cashflow` functions. It is 5.14601% But I want to know if it is possible to calculate it straight from the `FinancialBond` function.
