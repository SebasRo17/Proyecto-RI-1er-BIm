Toady,I learn a function **`ListCorrelate`** ,and I can understand **`process of execution his result in one-dimensional`**. However,the documentation gives a **`two-dimensional correlation example`** (shown as below)               ListCorrelate[{{1, 1}, {1, 1}}, {{a, b, c}, {d, e, f}, {g, h, i}}]      > {{a + b + d + e, b + c + e + f}, {d + e + g + h, e + f + h + i}} To understand it,I replace `{{1,1},{1,1}}` to `{{u,v},{x,y}}`.               ListCorrelate[{{u, v}, {x, y}}, {{a, b, c}, {d, e, f}, {g, h, i}}]      > {{a u + b v + d x + e y, b u + c v + e x + f y}, {d u + e v + g x + h y, e u > + f v + h x + i y}} ### My trail to figure out how his result be generate: > I think two-dimensional correlation is the **`composition`** of two one- > dimensional correlations, but,unfortunately, from the results that > _Mathematica_ executes it is not what I think.               ListCorrelate[{{u, v}}, {{a, b, c}, {d, e, f}, {g, h, i}}]      > {{a u + b v, b u + c v}, {d u + e v, e u + f v}, {g u + h v, h u + i v}}               ListCorrelate[{{x, y}}, {{a, b, c}, {d, e, f}, {g, h, i}}]      > {{a x + b y, b x + c y}, {d x + e y, e x + f y}, {g x + h y, h x + i y}} ### Question: **How to understand the process of`ListCorrelate` when it in two-dimensional condition?**
