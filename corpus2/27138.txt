How can I define working precision for each variable individually for example:               Maximize[x y< 100, {x, y}]      where the working precisions for `x` and `y` should be `2` and `7` respectively. Say `x` is some real life quantity that is _ONLY available to 2 decimal places_ and we need `y` to be as precise as possible (say 7 decimal places) regardless of the precision of `xy`. How can I do this in Mathematica? **here is exact problem**                  Maximize  hsum + isum + jsum + ksum + lsum + msum + nsum + osum      constraints are:                  0 < hsum,isum,jsum,ksum,lsum,msum,nsum < 10000       -5000 < osum < 0             a*x1 + b*x2 + d*x4 - h*(x1 + x2 + x4) = hsum        a*x1 + b*x2 + d*x4 - i*(x1 + x2 + x4) = isum        a*x1 + b*x2 + e*x5 - j*(x1 + x2 + x5) = jsum        a*x1 + b*x2 + e*x5 - k*(x1 + x2 + x5) = ksum        a*x1 + c*x3 + f*x6 - l*(x1 + x3 + x6) = lsum        a*x1 + c*x3 + f*x6 - m*(x1 + x3 + x6) = msum        a*x1 + c*x3 + g*x7 - n*(x1 + x3 + x7) = nsum         a*x1 + c*x3 + g*x7 - o*(x1 + x3 + x7) = osum            > X1,X2,X3....X7 are integers               a=100          b = (a + u1) && c = (a - u2) && d = (b + u3) && e = (b - u4) &&      f = (c + u5) && g = (c - u6) && h = (d + u7) && i = (d - u8) &&      j = (e + u9) && k = (e - u10) && l = (f + u11) && M = (f - u12) &&     n = (g + u13) && o = (g - u14)                0.1 <= u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9, u10, u11, u12, u13, u14 <= 3      in the above problem `a` is `100` rest of the variables `b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o` can be derived by adding or subtracting `u1,u2,u3....u14` now i need to define that value of u must be upto 2 decimal places.
