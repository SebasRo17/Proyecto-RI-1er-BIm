I'm working a PHP 5.5/MySQL web application. If a class depends partly on some global GET and POST variables for its members, should I just refer to them directly from within the class, or should I have them as arguments in the constructor or some other initiating function?               class myclass {       protected $id;       public function __construct() {         $this->id = (int)$_GET['id'];       }     }     $myclass = new myclass();      Or               class myclass {       protected $id;       public function __construct($id) {         $this->id = (int)$id;       }     }     $myclass = new myclass($_GET['id']);      How do MVC frameworks handle this issue?
