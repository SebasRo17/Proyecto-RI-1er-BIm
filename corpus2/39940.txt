I'm working through exactly what the best approach is to being asked by an employer as a team to put in extra hours both during weekdays but also an additional day on weekends (6-8 hours). No additional compensation (overtime, additional time off, etc...) is a part of the arrangement; I think from their perspective it's about being able to keep the job. We work in 6 week cycles, so the duration of this "crunch time" is the length of the cycle. The entire project team are salaried (exempt), not hourly. After the cycle is complete if it is judged that the project is in "better shape" then we will go back to our normal expected hours of the typical 40-hour work week. Any thoughts, advice, or previous circumstances like this from which you might have emerged the better?
