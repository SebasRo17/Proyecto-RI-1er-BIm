I have currently used "Save Selection As" after highlighting the graph and legend and then saved it as a PNG file, but the quality isn't brilliant. I am using TeXworks on Windows 7. The "Copy As LaTeX" gives an error message as well, guess it doesn't like the legends. Saving it as a PDF or EPS file messes up the title in the plot, which are some recommendations I saw on different questions.
