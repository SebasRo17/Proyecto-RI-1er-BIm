I've noticed that one rather well-known open source project (which I won't name so that noone focuses too much on that specific project) offers sources for download as a .zip via FTP instead of having them on GitHub. To me looks like GitHub would be more convenient.   1. It's free for open source projects   2. It has change history and many other perks of a version control system   3. If I want to change something I can just fork-change and then make a pull request instead of writing a long email explaining what to change in which file That's just what I could think of in one minute. Now what problems are there with Github that would make me prefer shipping sources as an archive via FTP?
