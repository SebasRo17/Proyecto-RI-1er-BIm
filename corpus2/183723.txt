Most low latency/high frequency programming jobs (based on job specs) appear to be implemented on unix platforms. In a lot of the specs they make particular request for people with "low latency linux" type of experience. Assuming this does not mean a real-time linux OS, could people give me help with what this could be referring to? I know you can set CPU affinity to threads, but I am assuming they are asking for much more to it than that. Kernel tuning? (although I heard manufacturers like solarflare produce kernel bypass network cards anyway)? What about DMA or possibly shared memory between processes? If people could give me brief ideas I can go and do the research on google. (This question will probably require somebody familiar with High Frequency Trading)
