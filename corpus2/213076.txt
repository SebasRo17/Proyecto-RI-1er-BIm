We lease an appliance to our clients (4 physical servers running 12 VMs). One of the servers exposes a website which in turn uses the other VMs. Clients have no access to the VMs or the software which runs on them. One of the reasons is that we process classified documents (and while security through obscurity is no defence, why make anything easy for an attacker?) So the appliances are owned and maintained by us but can be accessed across a network by clients. I'd like to use some functionality which is in a library licensed under the GPLv3. If needs be, I can implement the library myself without needing to refer the the library in question, but I'd obviously prefer to use the existing code (to avoid reinventing wheels). With the caveat that none of us are lawyers, can someone clarify if, in their experience, this counts as distribution under the definition of the GPLv3?
