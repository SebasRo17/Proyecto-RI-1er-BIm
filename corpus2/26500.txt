I am trying to show the wind streams in a geographic area as following code for a range of time.Even if it works for realtime data but it doesn't work for range of time.I am filtering and also taking mean and it has no problem there.Could somebody help me please?                ListStreamPlot[Table[{{x, y},Through[{Cos, Sin}[Mean[DeleteCases[WeatherData[{y, x},      "WindDirection", {{2013, 5, 28}, {2013, 5, 29}}][[All, 2]],          Missing["NotAvailable"]]] \[Degree]]]}, {x, 20, 56, 4}, {y, 32,57, 4}]]
