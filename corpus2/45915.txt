Im running ubuntu 12.04 and sometimes mathematica 9.0 crashes when I have Dynamic Content or graphics 3d. I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else? I wouldn't be surprised if this is a problem specific to the settings on my machine but i figured it is worth asking. I get the following error message:               X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext       Major opcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)       Minor opcode of failed request:  6 (X_GLXIsDirect)       Serial number of failed request:  93197       Current serial number in output stream:  93196          X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)       Major opcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)       Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)       Serial number of failed request:  93192       Current serial number in output stream:  93197          X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext       Major opcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)       Minor opcode of failed request:  5 (X_GLXMakeCurrent)       Serial number of failed request:  93198       Current serial number in output stream:  93198          Mathematica has received the signal: SIGSEGV and has exited.     If possible, please report this problem to support@wolfram.com     describing in as much detail as possible what you were doing     when the problem occurred.      Usually I can fix the problem by restarting the notebook between 1-10 times. Eventually, it works and stops crashing.
