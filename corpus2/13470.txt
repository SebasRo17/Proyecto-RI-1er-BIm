I'm thinking about leaving my current employer and wondering how one goes about that process in the programming world. We have a lot of projects on the go at the moment and I'm the only developer. We have 4-5 projects that are fairly big and need to be done in the next few months and even a few longer than that. I'm leaving because I'm the only employee and that's doing me no good. I'm young and want to learn, so a team would be nice. It's also too much work and the company is managed horribly. I have no contract to worry about so I could theoretically quit and just not come back without notice. Just wondering how this is _normally_ handled.   * Should I write a resignation letter   * How much notice should I give   * Should I give a reason for leaving   * Should I go to my boss who is the main reason I'm leaving or go to his boss? **Overview of replies** From the feedback here, it looks as though it's best to give 2-4 weeks of notice, and present a written resignation. Don't go into detail explaining why you're leaving in most cases. Don't burn bridges. Be professional.
