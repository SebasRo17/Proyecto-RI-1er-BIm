I can install the file and run the component functions from within Mathematica without any problems. But, when I try to use Mathematica's inbuilt parallelization with calls to my binary, I get an error that says               LinkObject::linkn: Argument LinkObject[/path/to/binary/file.binary,14,8] in      LinkWrite[LinkObject[/path/to/binary/file.binary,14,8],CallPacket[1,{1,2066455,5.,200000}]]      has an invalid LinkObject number; the link may be closed.      I understand this to mean that MathLink cannot set up links to my binary for some reason? How does one get this to work? # System Details I am on a system with 8 cores running x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu. # Mathematica Code that Produces the Error Assume `SwitchTimes` is a function defined inside my binary. It takes a number of inputs, but I want to loop over values for one particular input.               f[x_] := Module[{A, ma},         A = SwitchTimes[x, RandomInteger[10000000], 5.0, 200000];        ma = Mean[A];        ma        ];          B = ParallelMap[f, Table[i, {i, 1, 100, 2}]];      # Code that runs fine               f[x_] := Module[{A, ma},         A = SwitchTimes[x, RandomInteger[10000000], 5.0, 200000];        ma = Mean[A];        ma        ];          B = Map[f, Table[i, {i, 1, 100, 2}]];
