I have this `DynamicModule` which is basically a form of input fields that are parameters. My two final functions are `H1` and `H2` which I also define as disabled `InputFields`. Edit: I've only included one input field but this H1 and H2 variables depend on other variables that I've created input fields for in my code. In an effort to save space, I've removed those other variables. The new question is basically: WITHIN this dynamic module, after I've gotten this H1 and H2, I want to access them and plot them. But anytime I try to access them and manipulate them, nothing happens. Thoughts?               DynamicModule[{R = .005, a = .015, To = 310 , Tb = 310, wb = 0.0064,        cb = 4180, c2 = 3600, phi = .0002 , c = 670, k1 = .502, k2 = .502,        pb = 1000, P = 1.95*10^5, p1, p2 = 1060, c1, l1, l2, f1, f2, H1,        H2, r = .0001, C1, C2, No, N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N0},           Panel[       Grid[         Transpose[{{            Style["H1", Green], Style["H2", Green]   }, {            {            InputField[             Dynamic[H1 =                C1*(Exp[Sqrt[l1]*r] - Exp[-Sqrt[l1]*r]) + (f1/l2)*r],              Enabled -> False],            InputField[Dynamic[H2 = C2*(Sqrt[l1]   )], Enabled -> False]            }}] , Alignment -> Left] , ImageMargins -> 50]      ]
