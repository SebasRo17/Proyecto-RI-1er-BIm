I'm reading this series on Laravel, and it's in great depth dealing with making everything testable, using _Repository_ instead of just using the _Models_ , using _Dependency Injection_ and other obscure techniques. I've got a feeling that adding all this extra complexity in the name of Testability may not be the right thing. Writing unit tests for everything, that sounds plain silly. I have used Laravel before, without all this "testability" stuff, and it just worked. Is "testability" worth the effort and making code harder to understand? (note that I'm posting here instead of StackOverflow, for this is kind of opinion based. I hope I won't be frowned upon for asking it.)
