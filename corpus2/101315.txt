The number of Linux distributions is large. Someone wanting to volunteer with one of them might have a hard time picking between them, because it's hard to sense the culture, environment, and level of community and esprit de corp. Also, some might be very strict with long processes before you are trusted, or else much looser with a smaller community with more trust. It's hard to tell where to look for information. Maybe one is in great need, and others are well-established with less need. How would I find out who is in greatest need? Joining a Linux distribution's team of writers, developers, testers, coordinators, and administrators is a big decision. This is an extremely sensitive question, and I hope nobody is slighted by either the question or responses.
