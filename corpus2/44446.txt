When we deal with the vector product problem, we usually should define some fixed form for the vector product. For instance, I define it in this way,                  Unprotect[Times];        R[x1_] Rp[x2_] := RRp[x1, x2];        R[x1_] R[x2_] := If[x1==x2,R[x1]^2, RR[x1, x2]];         Rp[x1_] Rp[x2_] := If[x1==x2,Rp[x1]^2,RpRp[x1, x2]];        Protect[Times];      Here, R[ _] and Rp[_ ] are vectors. In some simple cases, it works. For example,                  (R[1] - Rp[3])^2 // Expand        =R[1]^2 + Rp[3]^2 - 2 RRp[1, 3]      However, in the following case, something is wrong.                  (R[1] - Rp[3])^3 // Expand       =R[1]^3 - 3 R[1]^2 Rp[3] + 3 R[1] Rp[3]^2 - Rp[3]^3        The expected result is                 R[1]^3-R[1]^2Rp[3]+R[1]Rp[3]^2-Rp[3]^3-2 R[1]RRp[1, 3] +2 Rp[3]RRp[1, 3]      So, how to find a simple way to fixed the vector product in the complicated expand form ?
