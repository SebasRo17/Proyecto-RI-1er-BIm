I am writing an admin panel in cakephp I got a question the panel will have the functionality to add items to the main website (images specifically) so I am wondering if I should put all the functionality (add,edit,view,delete) to the main admin controller or should I make a different controller for that? As the admin panel will most likely be extended with more features such as adding new users, modifying them etc. What do you recommend?
