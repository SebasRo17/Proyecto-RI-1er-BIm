I'm currently working on solving an SEIR model with data from the CDC. I've created a function to calculate the Square difference for the model and want to create a table of values for the 4 variable combinations, along with their Goodness of fit characteristic from the square difference. I'm getting this alert when running the function:   " _NDSolve has computed initial values that give a zero residual for the differential-algebraic system, but some components are different from those specified. If you need them to be satisfied, giving initial conditions for all dependent variables and their derivatives is recommended._ " It sounds like something I could ignore, but I don't want to mess anything up by doing so. Also... the big question. Is there any recommendations to make creating this table of values more efficient rather than waiting a half hour for this to work itself out?
