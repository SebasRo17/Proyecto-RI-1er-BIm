I've got two functions at the moment:               suspendGroupsAndUsers($groupId){}     enableGroupsAndUsers($groupId) {}      But the difference between the two is one variable/string. Should I just have:               setStatusGroupsAndUsers($status,$groupID) {}      This feels more DRY... Or have the above two functions actually call the setStatus function? Gut says use setStatus ...
