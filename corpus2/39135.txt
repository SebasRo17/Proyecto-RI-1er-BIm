As part of a larger program, I need to solve $A x^2+B x+C \equiv 0 \mod p^k$ for prime $p$. Right now I'm doing this by calling `Reduce[A*x^2+B*x+C==M*p^k,{x,M},Integers]` and then parsing this to find what I need (i.e. usually just assigning `C[1]->0` and ignoring `M` results). But when $A$, $B$, $C$, and especially $p^k$ start to get large (e.g. $A,B,C \approx 10^{30}$ and $p^k \approx 10^{70}$), there is quite a lag. Is there a faster way to find solutions for $x \mod p^k$? Thanks!
