I was wondering what the situation is regarding a sub-contracted programmer using our project in his portfolio. He has dragged an 8 week build to over a year, messed us around, disappeared for 3 months in the middle of it and has cost us money. We have had to pay someone else to correct all his mistakes. He is assuming he can, and is kicking up a fuss when we implied we may not let him. I feel we are well within our rights to refuse, based on this guys quality of work and timescales, he has caused the project to stall. In our work agreement we stated that we didn't want him to have an actual text credit on the product itself, but that we would happily write him a reference if he wanted to pitch for work on the back of it. That he signed and agreed to. As the ones who designed the product, and all of the front end, we feel we should have the right to not allow him to display our product on his website. Maybe we don't want the world to know that our expensive high-end product was built by one guy in India. Perhaps we are trying to place ourselves as a company who delivers the whole package, including the programming side. Is it considered good etiquette to ask permission first before displaying software in a portfolio?
