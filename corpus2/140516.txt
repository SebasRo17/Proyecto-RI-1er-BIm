I had a discussion about OO programming today and by browsing the internet I found a lot of different specifications for object oriented languages.   * What are the requirements for a language to be object oriented? For myself an object oriented language must have classes, inheritance and encapsulation.   * Is C an object oriented language just because you can use structs and program with an object oriented design? Why/ why not? Are there any good sites/articles about this? And please, no Wikipedia links because I've already been there.
