I heard many people saying that when developing algorithms you should first use pen and paper, flowcharts and what not, so that you can focus on the algorithm itself, not worrying about the implementation of said algorithm (i.e., you deal with one problem at a time). However, most of the time I find it easier to actually develop my algorithm on the fly. That is, I think a bit about the problem until I know the general direction to take, and then I start writing code and making changes until the algorithm emerges and works. Is this a bad habit that I should try to change?
