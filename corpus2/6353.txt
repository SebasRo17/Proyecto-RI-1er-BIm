I am having a strange issue with `PathGraph`. Executing               PathGraph[{a, b, c}]      or `PathGraph[{1,2,3}]`, etc., returns a path-graph with three vertices as expected. However, executing:               In[10]:= PathGraph[{v1, v2, v3}]     Out[10]= PathGraph[{v1, v2, v3}]      That is, it stays unevaluated instead of returning the `Graph` object. I tried several variations and apparently the issue occurs whenever `v2` is among the vertices. That is all of `PathGraph[{a1, v2, a3}]`, `PathGraph[{v2, x}]`, `PathGraph[{1, 2, v2, x}]`, etc. remain unevaluated after execution. I tried this on two computers, both with clean Kernels (with no definitions made or packages loaded, etc.). Mathematica version: 8.0.0.0 Can anyone reproduce this? Is this a bug? **Update: This is working correctly in version 9.**
