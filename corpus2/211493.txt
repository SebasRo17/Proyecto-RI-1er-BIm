Assume that I'm a front-end developer (HTML, CSS) And some one who got their website built using ASP.NET came to me and asked for a new design and I don't know about ASP.NET. Then, how can I change the design of their website without affecting their code? Do I have to learn a little bit of server side languages to be able to change to the look of sites without affecting the original server code?
