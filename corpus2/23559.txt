I can choose 2 letters from the four letters $\\{A,B,C,D\\}$ in 6 combinations using the combination formula $$\frac{n!}{ r! (n-r)!}$$               {A, B}, {A, C}, {A, D}, {B, C}, {B, D}, {C, D}      Consider now the collection of all _subsets_ of a set of $n$ elements and restrict to those having exactly cardinality $k$, such as $k=2$ above. How can I find all combinations of groups of 2 or 3 or ... or $n$ (should be dynamic) of these which do not have letters in common? So, for example, I am expecting the result for combinations of two groups of $k=2$ elements to be the three collections below:               {{A, B}, {C, D}},          {{A, C}, {B, D}},          {{A, D}, {B, C}}      This is just a small example but I would like the algorithm to work for a large number of sets (I have more than 35000 sets).
