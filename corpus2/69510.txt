I am interested in the amount of usage of freeware (closed source) running under Windows, which is not preinstalled on PCs. The closest I expect to get to such statistics is the amount of freeware downloaded by an average user. A good answer refers to a source, which says something like: "The average Windows user downloads 2.3 freewares per year". An even better answer is: "An average Windows user spends 0.04 hours per day using freeware". Edit: I see this as the equivalent of: "How many kilos of chocolate does an average russian eat per year", which is the sort of statistic widely used for initial market analysis. I agree that you still do not know whether a mint chocolate with a slight taste of banana will sell, but you have a better idea.
