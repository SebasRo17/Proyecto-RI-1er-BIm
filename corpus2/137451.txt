When writing tools for the CLI of UNIX, how should I make the program print out help and/or usage? I usually use `fprintf(stderr, "help text here");`, but there are several issues with that.   * First, I'm not sure, whether I should use `stderr`. Is that OK, or should I use `stdout`?   * As you can imagine, the help text is quite long, depending on how many options the tool has. Now, I usually, just put several `"strings like that\n"` in the second parameter. This however, fills my source code with fifty or more lines of help text. It is not easy manageable at all. What should I do instead?   * When a tool is not written in C or a C-like language, I tend to use here-docs where possible (most prominently with Perl). I can't use that in C, but is there something like that, that I could use?   * I was considering putting it in a `headerfile.h` inside a `#define HELP "help text here"`, I've never seen it in the wild, don't know whether I should actually use that. Ideally, I could put the text in an external file, and include it. Using `#include` for that seems wrong, though. What should I do then? The idea is, to have a help text, that is easily manageable. Having it inside the source code isn't really convenient.
