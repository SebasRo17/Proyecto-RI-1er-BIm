I want to set up a PDE model, which takes a two-dimensional diffusion equation into account. The key problem is that I have some trouble in solving the two- dimensional diffusion equation numerically. Consider the following code:               L = 10;     T = 10;     system = {        D[c[x, y, t], {t, 1}] == D[c[x, y, t], {x, 2}] + D[c[x, y, t], {y, 2}],        Derivative[1, 0, 0][c][0, y, t] == 0,        Derivative[1, 0, 0][c][L, y, t] == 0,        c[x, 0, t] == c[x, L, t],        c[x, y, 0] == 1        };     sol = NDSolve[system, c, {x, 0, L}, {y, 0, L}, {t, 0, T}];     Manipulate[Plot3D[Evaluate[c[x, y, t] /. sol], {x, 0, L}, {y, 0, L}], {{t,T}, 0, T}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gwrOZ.png) As you can see for `t = 10` there are artifacts at the two edges where the Neumann conditions were applied. Obviously, `c[x, y, t] = 1` solves the system and since this is the initial condition Mathematica should have no trouble to compute it numerically. It tried various ODE solvers (`"ImplicitRungeKutta"`, `"BDF"`, `"Adams"`), but it seems that there is some problem with the spatial discretization, perhaps because of the Neumann boundary condition for the variable `x`. Any suggestions how to fix it?
