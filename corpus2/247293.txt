Excuse my ignorance but we've got an application that we'd like to sample out on a mobile app The app is a C#/asp.net application connected to our sql server database. If we are going to write an android application for this app how exactly does one connect to the sql server instance? I've tried to find many articles, some say via a web service others say jdbc drivers, etc. I don't know too much about this because we've never done mobile development. If we were to write up a web service, is the web service simply responsible for connecting to the database layer and fetching records? Any examples would be greatly appreciated.
