I'm doing a basic quantum mechanics problem and am trying to learn how to do it in _Mathematica_. Any help would be much appreciated. $\vec{L} = \vec{x} \times \vec{p}$ where $\vec{x}$ has components: $\begin{align*} x &= r \sin \theta \cos \phi\\\ y &= r \sin \theta \sin \phi\\\ z &= r \cos \theta \end{align*}$ and $\vec{p}$ has components: $p_x = - i \hbar \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}$ etc. Show that $L_z = -i \hbar \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \phi}$
