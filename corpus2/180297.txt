I am taking a C++ class in my school. Since I've programmed in Ruby I know some OOP stuff. But in C++ there are member functions, member variables, and static functions. In Ruby we have instance methods, instance variables, and class variables. And there are more... Any reason they're different? Are they quite different levels of OOP? Or just some differences in tradition these ecosystems have?
