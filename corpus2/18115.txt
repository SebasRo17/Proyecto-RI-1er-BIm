I'm trying to reduce transfer time when accessing rows of a mysql table over a network, where each row has a lot of data. Is there a way to enable client- server compression when accessing a mysql database via ``DatabaseLink```? As a workaround, I could request a column with `COMPRESS(column_with_lots_of_data)` in my `SQLExecute` query, but it is not clear how to uncompress the result on the Mathematica side.
