Here is my code:               ClearAll["Global`*"]          f = OpenRead["****"]     data1 = ReadList[f, {Number, Number}]     a = BarChart[Last[#] & /@ data1, ChartLabels -> (First[#] & /@ data1),     TicksStyle -> {Directive[0.1      , Opacity[0], FontOpacity -> 1],      Directive[12, Opacity[1], FontOpacity -> 1]},     BarSpacing -> Large, PlotRange -> {0, 2}, ImagePadding -> 10]     g = OpenRead["****"]     data1 = ReadList[g, {Number, Number}]     b = BarChart[Last[#] & /@ data1, ChartLabels -> (First[#] & /@ data1),     TicksStyle -> {Directive[0.1      , Opacity[0], FontOpacity -> 1],      Directive[12, Opacity[1], FontOpacity -> 1]},     BarSpacing -> Large, PlotRange -> {0, 2}, ImagePadding -> 10]     h = OpenRead["****"]     data1 = ReadList[h, {Number, Number}]     c = BarChart[Last[#] & /@ data1, ChartLabels -> (First[#] & /@ data1),     TicksStyle -> {Directive[0.1      , Opacity[0], FontOpacity -> 1],      Directive[12, Opacity[1], FontOpacity -> 1]},     BarSpacing -> Large, PlotRange -> {0, 2}, ImagePadding -> 10]          Fig = GraphicsRow[{a, b, c}, ImageSize -> 1000]     Export["*****", Fig]      Here is Fig: ![My fig](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZARcp.png) Here is what comes out of Export: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YxqrN.png) You might not be able to see it so clearly, but the 5 in the x-axis is out of alignment with the other numbers, and under magnification looks odd (Zoom in!!!). This is true of the image after Mathematica exports it as a .pdf. 1) Why? 2) How can I avoid this?
