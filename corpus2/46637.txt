Is there a way to do any similar to               Do[Print["Iteration...", j]; Pause[1], {j, 1, 6}]      with `Manipulate`? (to show the evolution of each iteration slowly) What I have viewed is all with `Table`, and all the data is showed without no pause. Using `Pause[1]` or wating for `"click a button or to press any key"`. I was trying               Manipulate[Do[Print["Iteration...", j];   Pause[1], {j, 1, 6}],                {{k, 5}, {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}}]      or similar things with `Row`, `Column`, `Style`,... but... no success!
