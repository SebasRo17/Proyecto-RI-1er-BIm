When one evaluation is running, if I want do another evaluation, Mathematica will put the second one in the queue and run it after the first evaluation finish. However, the first evaluation may take very long time and the second one may just a easy calculation. It is possible that running the second evaluation without giving up or waiting the first evaluation? BTW, I am using Mathematica 9 in Windows 8(64 bit), but I am also happy to use Ubuntu. Any suggestions are welcome.
