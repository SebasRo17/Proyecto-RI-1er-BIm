We are small start-up now, we don't have a DBA.   if our project succeed, it will have a lot of data that will likely need to be distributed over several machines.   So we want to make that step easier, so what we should take in consideration now to make it so?   What we can think of now is using uuid instead of autoincrement ids, but even that we don't know how much that will affect performance? So i using uuid is right choice? and what else we should do?
