Let's assume that my client ( _C_ ) has a corporate website, created by an agency ( _A_ ). _A_ created a pretty simple, yet well designed website which uses plain HTML and no backend to edit any of the data. _C_ has to issue (and of course pay) _A_ every time they want any changes to their website which has become pretty expensive. Now _C_ asks _Me_ to write a dynamic module that integrates into the existing website. This module should be an event-planner that enables _C_ to change at least that part of the website on his own. I am a little bit worried whether it is ok for me to simply take some of _A_ 's graphics and HTML/CSS to use on my project (since I need the new module to be a part of the website). Is there any legal stuff to be considered? Who's property is the already existing website? Can one make a general assumption at all or is this something that necessarily needs to be issued in a contract?
