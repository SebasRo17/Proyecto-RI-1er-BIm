I have a system of expressions, in which each expression is an equality or inequality expression of the following form:   * Var = Var1 + Var2   * Var $\odot$ number   * Var $\odot$ Var1   * $\odot$ = $\leq | \geq | == | > | <$ I want to find the range of values for each variable, is this possible to do that by Mathematica? **Update example** I tried with `Reduce` but it didn't work as I expected. For example, I tried `Reduce[a == b + c && a >= 2 && b <= 10 && c == 5, {a, b, c}]`, it returned `2 <= a <= 15 && b == -5 + a && c == a - b`. What I expect to get is `2 <= a <= 15 && -3 <= b <= 10 && c == 5` Thanks,
