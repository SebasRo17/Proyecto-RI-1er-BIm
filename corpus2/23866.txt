I would like to Import and Convert a *.txt file which looks like: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw-308nJcF01Yl92RURCLUg4VzQ/edit?usp=sharing and turn it into a Matrix which I can use to make computations which looks like this one:                example = {{"DATE", "KEY", "C1", "C2", "C3"},                 {{2013, 04, 01, 00, 00, 1}, 1, Null, 12.23,  Null},                 {{2013, 04, 01, 00, 00, 2}, 2, Null, 2,      Null},                 {{2013, 04, 01, 00, 00, 3}, 3, Null, 10.2,   Null}}
