I live in South America, and here the translation for "Software Engineering" is a knowledge for the SWEBOK (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge) subjects, such as: Requirements, Development methods (Waterfall, Spiral, SCRUM, etc..), Tests, Quality, Maintenance, etc.. **Why do English materials such as classes, articles, and even stackoverflow questions about Software Engineering just address (basically) programming?** Example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/131571/recommended-books-for- software-engineering Most of recommended books in the answers above are basically programming, and the Software Engineering 'bibles' that have SWEBOK items written by Pressman and Summerville are almost unnoticed. Actually, most of SWEBOK items doesn't have focus in the programming code. Secondary Question: What is the English name for the profession/subject that really needs to know all SWEBOK subjects? (not only 'good programming').
