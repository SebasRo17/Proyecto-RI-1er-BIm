I struggle with learning. I have to practice, and keep practicing, in order for something to stick. I don't do much C++ (once every month maybe) so I am constantly going over the same stuff. I need some tasks to do so I can really understand pointers and their uses in the real world, rather than reading scenarios. I've created my own link list, but I want more advanced stuff like using pointer arithmetic and pointers and functions. If anyone could provide some real world tasks to deepen my knowledge and experience with pointers I would be thankful. I'm ok with data types because of my Java experience. Look forward to some challenges (not too hard mind).
