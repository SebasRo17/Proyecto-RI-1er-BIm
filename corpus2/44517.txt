I'm trying to programme a random walk on a sphere with _Mathematica_. I found this code while I was searching, but I'm not getting results from it. I waited an entire day, but my pc didn't finish evaluating `rw`. I would like some help please (:               rotateWithAxis[p_, a_, theta_] :=        #/Norm[#] & @ ((1 – Cos[theta]) (a.p) a + p Cos[theta] + Cross[a, p] Sin[theta]);      Using the function, the random walk on a unit sphere is written as follows:               rw =        With[{stepLength = 0.03, num = 10000},         Module[{rotateWithAxis, p, a, q},           rotateWithAxis[p_, a_, theta_] :=              #/Norm[#] &@((1 – Cos[theta]) (a.p) a + p Cos[theta] + Cross[a, p] Sin[theta]);           a = {1., 0, 0};           q = {Cos[stepLength], Sin[stepLength], 0};           Table[p = a; a = q; q = rotateWithAxis[p, a, RandomReal[{0, 2 Pi}]], {num}]]];
