Say I have a number of files in a directory at some location (C:\dir1\dir2\dir3...), and I pull an array of strings corresponding to the file names with the command:               fileList = FileNames["*", "C:\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3"]      Here, the files are named with consecutive integers (`1` through `N`) and the output is automatically sorted like the following:               C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\10.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\11.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\12.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\13.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\14.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\15.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\16.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\17.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\18.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\19.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\1.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\20.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\2.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\3.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\4.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\5.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\6.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\7.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\8.tif     C:\dir1\dir2\dir3\9.tif      For any value `N`, is there an ordering function `p` I can apply to `fileList` (using `Sort[fileList,p]`) to arrange the entries in fileList to obey to proper integer ordering of the file names? Can I supply this ordering function directly to `FileNames`?
