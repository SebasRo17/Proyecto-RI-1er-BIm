I have a personal project I'm going to start working on soon. It will be database driven and have various screens that the operator may want to use. First thing I thought of was an MDI interface would be perfect for what I want. I work with Then I started investigating WPF - partly because one of the controls I want to use is a WPF control. I haven't worked with WPF much at all, and I'm wondering whether or not it's worth the effort to try and learn it instead of going with WinForms and MDI? In my current situation I use WinForms and MDI for my day job. There's a possibility I may work with WPF in the future, but if that happens I'd have time to learn on the job. Am I better off just sticking with what I know to get my project off the ground, or is WPF a much better improvement that it's worth going that route? If so, what exactly are the advantages I may find from WPF?
