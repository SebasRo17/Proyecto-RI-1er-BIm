This works without any warnings: `O[Log[x]]`. This raises a warning: `O[x^2]`. I have a few questions around this:   1. Why is it a good idea for `O[x^2]` to raise a warning when `O[Log[x]]` does not?   2. Is `O[Log[x]]` meaningfully useful in _Mathematica_ given the semantics of its `O[]`?   3. How does one represent $\mathcal{O}(\log(x-x_o))$ naturally in _Mathematica_? (Probably there is no way because it is useless...)   4. Why is `O[x, x0]^2` the representation chosen by _Mathematica_ authors instead of something like `O[(x-x0)^2]`?
