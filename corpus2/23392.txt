10 years ago at college I had some UML lectures. From these I remember and use only some basic part of class and sequence diagrams and how our teacher was trying to convince us that in the future, we won't be coding but we will be using (bloated at the time) UML tools to generate software ! What a laugh ! Today I think I can have a better use of UML than only reverse engineering my code to have some nice diagrams to illustrate a documentation. I feel than I can use it to design some part of my code and avoid late problems. But each time I want to really use UML to design something I get lost: too much diagrams, too much obscure jargon, too much text field and options in UML editor with dark meanings... So I want to know how do you have learn UML in order to know enough to use it in design phase without being drawn by its complexity. Note:   I already have this book: UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language from M. Fowler. What I miss is more a practical approach with one or many real world examples of how to model a real project using UML.
