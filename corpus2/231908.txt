My Android app needs javax.activation and javax.mail (both GPLv2 licensed). However, I don't want to make my app GPL-licensed. What are the possibilities to not break the license requirements regarding the classpath exception? Currently, I use maven-dependency-plugin to pull those packages' source code and merge the compiled stuff with my own into one apk. Is that ok? If not, what is?
