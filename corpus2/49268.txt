There are tons of resources on the web referring to and listing code smells. However, I've never seen information on _architectural smells_. Is this defined somewhere, and is there a list available? Has any formal research been done into architecture defects, and their impact on project speed, defects, and the like? **Edit:** I wasn't really looking for a list in the answers, but documentation (on the web or in a book) about architecture smells.
