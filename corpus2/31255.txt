Mathematica has a bug in that `BarChart`s and `ListPlot`s with `Filling` will export as a pixelated bitmap, not a vector graphic when exporting as EMF format. There is a workaround, which is to set `ImageResolution` to be 1300 or higher in the `Export` command, like this:               testdata = RandomReal[{5, 10}, 20];     bg1 = BarChart[{testdata}]     Export["bg1400.emf", bg1, ImageResolution -> 1400]      (No, you don't get a huge file if you set `ImageResolution` this high. It somehow tricks it into using vector graphics. However the workaround is a bit unreliable, depending on the graph in question.) How can I make this option the default? `SetOptions[Export]={ImageResolution -> 1400}` produces an error message that it's not a recognised option to `Export`. I also tried:               SetOptions[$FrontEndSession, ConversionOptions -> {"ExportOptions" -> {"EMF" ->        {"IncludeSpecialFonts" -> True, ImageResolution -> 1400}}}]      But that doesn't seem to do anything. How do I set these export options as the default, e.g. in a package? Alternatively, how do I force this hidden vector capability?
