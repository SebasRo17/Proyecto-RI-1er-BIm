What is the recommended workflow to learn HTML5? What tools should I install? What SDK? Where to start? How to test? How to debug? What do I read? I understand that what is often labelled as "HTML5 development" is in fact a mixture of HTML, CSS, JS and more, however I don't believe that bigger projects are developed in Notepad. That is why I am asking you to reveal your tips and tricks about your workflow.
