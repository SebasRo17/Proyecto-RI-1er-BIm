In the documentation for `GeneratingFunction`, the following example is given under Examples -> Properties & Relations -> Derivative:               GeneratingFunction[n f[n], n, z]     (*z (GeneratingFunction^(0,0,1))[f[n],n,z]*)      When I evaluate the input, however, I obtain something different, namely:               GeneratingFunction[n f[n], n, z]     (*z GeneratingFunction[(1 + n) f[1 + n], n, z]*)      For me the first output would be preferable; indeed I would like Mathematica to express any expression of the form               GeneratingFunction[p[n] f[n], n, z] (*p[n] an explicit polynomial in n*)      in terms of derivatives of the generating function of the sequence `f[n]`. I think this is the intended behaviour of `GeneratingFunction` and certainly what I remember from v8. **Question:** Is there a way to achieve this behaviour? I am currently using version 9.0 on a 64bit Linux computer.
