I have a sublist from `Tuples[{1, 2, 3}, 2]`, say for example `L={{1,2},{2,1},{2,2}}`, and a 3 x 3 matrix `M`. My goal is to create a new list of matrices that has the same length as `L` and these matrices are the same as `M` except in the position indexed by elements of `L`, that is replaced by some constant number `s`. As I am used to Matlab, I did in an iterative way:               j=1;     While[j <= Length[L],        State = M;       State[[L[[j, 1]], L[[j, 2]]]] = s;       If[MemberQ[NewList, State] == False, AppendTo[NewList, State]];       ++j;     ];      but it would have be nicer to use the function `Map` I guess. So I'm looking for an elegant synthax since a little while. Thanks.
