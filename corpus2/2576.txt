Selecting a Free-Form input cell with the mouse I can query something like:               convert 1 atm to pascals      and get as a result               101\[ThinSpace]325\[ThickSpace]Pa (pascals)      I can take that number and manually enter it into a variable (I can't cut and paste it since the space turns the cut and pasted value into (101)(325)). Is there a way to just extract the numeric portion of the result and assign it to a variable?
