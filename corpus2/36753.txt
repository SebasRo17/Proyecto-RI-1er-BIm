If I use `Epilog->Inset` within a `Plot`, the coordinates specified within that `Inset` match those of the plot's axis and scale:               Plot[y = 2 x, {x, 0, 5}, Epilog -> Inset["Text", {3, 3}]]      ![Plot Epilog Inset](http://i.imgur.com/0pKPcAO.png) Note that "Text" is placed at x=3, y=3. Different thing happens for when `Inset` is used within `LogPlot`:               LogPlot[y = x^x, {x, 0, 5}, Epilog -> Inset["Text", {3, 3}]]      ![LogPlot Epilog Inset](http://i.imgur.com/nt4vqNv.png) The coordinates are still (3,3) but "Text" is positioned at what appears to be (3,20) with respect to the on-axis coordinates. What is it about and how do I counter it? Thanks in advance, r.
