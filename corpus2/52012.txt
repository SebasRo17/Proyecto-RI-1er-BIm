I have a piece of code which looks like this:               ParallelTable[            Monitor[         Table[         <code here>         ,{i,i1,i2];       ,i];          ]      so basically a `Table` which I parallelize. Each element of this parallelized table being itself a `Table` which I want to monitor. I receive this error message: > FrontEndObject::notavail: A front end is not available; certain operations > require a front end. This error originates from the `Monitor[]`. I suspect that because my first `Table` is parallelized, somehow the dynamic cell into which `Monitor[]` will write to is not connected to any Front End or something... How would I solve this issue?
