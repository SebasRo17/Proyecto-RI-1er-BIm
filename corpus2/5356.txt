When you are setting up your system landscape for large and/or multiple application deployments, do you consider mainframe? If not, why not? If so, what factors are you considering. If you take a _real_ TCO look at large ERP and/or consolidated application landscapes, mainframe is actually quite cost-effective. My own consultations have included recommendations for scale-up/mainframe/mid- size systems on some specific needs. Honestly, I've never had a customer take said recommendation, rather defaulting to countless scale-out VMs on Intel boxen (in non-trivial cost) and yet still to this day have system management and performance issues. Curious your take on this. We need to remember that the virtual machines we manage (and apparently love in IT departments) today have been done for decades on mainframe. Most mid-size and mainframe shops have small fractions of support persons managing larger and more complex applications. Your thoughts appreciated.
