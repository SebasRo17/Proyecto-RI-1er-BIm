I know a similar question is answered somewhere, but it doesn't work for my case for some reason. I have the following problem in Mathematica. I want to compute f[h[x]]= x^2 + D[h[x],x]. Here, h[x] can be some function of x, say Sin[x]. I have written the following code in Mathematica,               SetAttributes[{f, D}, HoldAll]     f[h_, x_] := x^2 + D[h[x], x]     h := Sin[x]      But then the output of               f[h, 10]      is an error "General::ivar: 10 is not a valid variable." Any better way of doing the composition of functions in Mathematica?   * Sarah
