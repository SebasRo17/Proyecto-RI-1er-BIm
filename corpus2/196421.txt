I need to build a web service API for our mobile app to interact with our server & database (in ASP.Net MVC 4, but that's hardly relevant). Wile most actions do not need users to be registered with our service, we would like to restrict access only to users of our app. What are the methods to make sure that calls made from somewhere else (e.g. someone wanting all our data, or building an unofficial app) are rejected? My initial idea is for the device to ask the server for a token, which is randomly generated and sent as is. All other methods will check that the request headers contain a specific one that will be md5 hash of the salted token. The server knows the token and salt and is able to compute the hash and compares it with the one sent. In addition, the token as a limited lifespan, and the device must get another one every other hour. That seems quite easy to implement and although probably not 100% proof, that seems to be a good idea. What do you think?
