On my projects where the repository is shared between me and other programmers, I always write commit messages even if I'm the primary developer. But on those projects where I'm the solo developer working on a project, and the repository is hosted on my personal laptop, and is not even hosted by the client, hence no one except myself would see the commits, should I still write commit messages? So far I have been writing them, but I've found that I've never gone back and viewed my commit messages. I take time off development to write down the messages, but then they're never seen again even by me. Are there any good reasons for writing commit messages as a solo developer, or should you just skip them in favor of staying focused on development?
