_Note: In this question I am concerned only with real-valued variables and functions._ * * * DLMF, §9.8 _Airy Functions, Modulus and Phase_, formula $9.8.4$ defines the phase of Airy functions: $$\theta(x)=\arctan\frac{\operatorname{Ai}x}{\operatorname{Bi}x}.$$ The corresponding _Mathematica_ definition is               θ[x_] := ArcTan[AiryAi[x]/AiryBi[x]]       Apparently, in this form the phase has a countable infinite number of jump discontinuities for negative values of $x$. I need to construct a _Mathematica_ expression that represents a continuous monotonic version of the phase $\theta(x)$ (let's name it $\vartheta$), where all pieces between discontinuities are properly shifted and stitched, as shown on the following graph: ![Phases](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7M8Uo.png) One approach would be to get the derivative of $\theta(x)$: $$\theta'(x)=-\frac1\pi\frac1{\operatorname{Ai}^2 x+\operatorname{Bi}^2 x},$$ so that all information about jumps is lost, and then consider the definite integral: $$\vartheta(x)=\frac1\pi\int_x^\infty\frac{dz}{\operatorname{Ai}^2 z+\operatorname{Bi}^2 z}.$$ Or, in _Mathematica_ notation:               1/π Integrate[1/(AiryAi[z]^2 + AiryBi[z]^2), {z, x, ∞}]      Unfortunately, _Mathematica_ leaves this integral unevaluated, even if an explicit value for the boundary $x$ is provided. > Is it possible to write a closed-form _Mathematica_ expression, possibly > containing special functions, that represents the continuous monotonic phase > $\vartheta(x)$?
