Currently there are a few OSS projects that I would like to create and then use, but I just don't have the time to put into the creation of them, or in the case of some projects (e.g. Emacs packages), don't have the experience with the language. I would be happy to pay someone else to do the development, but probably not to the tune of the whole development (assuming the minimum someone would work for is ~$5000). However, whilst discussing one of these projects with another programmer they expressed interest in using it, leading me to believe that there would be others similarly interested in the successful creation of one of these projects (or possibly not, but for arguments sake assume that the project would be useful to more than just me). It seems like the kind of thing that something like a cross between gun.io and Kickstarter would be suited to, in that it would both attract developers and allow others interested in seeing the development occur to suggest projects and put money towards the effort. Is there a platform that exists for this sort of crowdfunding to occur? NB. Kickstarter and its ilk seem more suited towards discrete products (like CMS systems and various applications), but maybe that is the best marketplace for it.
