> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Best practices for retrofitting legacy code with automated tests I've been working on a project in Flex for three years now without unit testing. The simple reason for that is the fact that I just didn't realize the importance of unit testing when being at the beginning of studies at university. Now my attitude towards testing changed completely and therefore I want to introduce it to the existing project (about 20000LOC). In order to do it, there are two approaches to choose from: 1) Discard the existing codebase and start from scratch with TDD   2) Write the tests and try to make them pass by changing the existing code Well, I would appreciate not having to write everything from scratch but I think by doing this, the design would be much better. What would be your approach?
