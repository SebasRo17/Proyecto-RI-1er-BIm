Is there a way to force Mathematica to convert an already rendered Graphic to the simplified Directive form of that Graphic. **Background:** I am currently editing Graphics using Drawing Tools and then calling `InputForm[gr]`, but this often doesn't work well because the output of `InputForm` are much larger then the original input. For example I am looking for the following code               gr = Graphics[{Red, Circle[]}];     InputForm[gr]      To output the simplest form possible. For example `HoldForm[InputForm[gr]]` could print `Graphics[{Red, Circle[]}]` or `Graphics[{Red, Circle[0,0]}]`. **EDIT:** There are a lot of Graphic directives listed in the docs, so there probably isn't a direct answer, but simply answers that get closer to respecting the original input. The best technique IMO would somehow create a trained function which evolves based on the version of Mathematica that you are currently using. Obviously manual transformation are less then ideal.
