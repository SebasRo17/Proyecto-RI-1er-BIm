I am not sure what is the best way for the tasks below: threads, AsyncTasks, Loopers, services? Why? Are there other candidates? I need threads/Tasks/Services/other for:   * Plotting data, (refreshing should be done let's after after specific amount of data has been read)   * Generating data, (must being done during whole application runtime indefinitely)   * Reading data, (as above)   * Saving data on SD card / doing some logs   * Interacting with UX **More detailed scenario** I must emulate communication between an external device and Android. External device (I don't have access to that device for some time - I am waiting for it to arrive, that's why I want to emulate the communication - which is a control and measurement system board with ARM microprocessor) generates some data packed in frames in ASCII format. Android needs to pool? (Maybe there's a way to say: "Hey I have generated data for you. Take it!"? - If yes, could you advise me?) the external device to read data.
