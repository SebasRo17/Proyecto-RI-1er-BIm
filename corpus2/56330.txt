In job interviews I am frequently asked if I know the company, explain why do I think I would be the best choice for this company, etc and I have never liked this kinds of questions. Using your experiences in job interviewing, what do you think it would happen if I ask the interviewer to explain me why he think the company is the best company for me and why I should accept their answer? Do you think it would be a good think or bad thing to do? Edit: the idea of the question would not be to "challenge" the interviewer. The idea of the question would be to see what he thinks about the company, what values he thinks are given importance inside the company and what are the strong points of the company.
