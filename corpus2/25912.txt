I have a plot but the x and y axis need to be switched. The problem is that I can't explicitly solve for the other so I can change the axis.               e = .65;          Ec[M_] = M +        Sum[(1/2^(n - 1)*           Sum[((-1)^k*(n - 2*k)^(n - 1))/((n - k)!*k!)*             Sin[(n - 2*k)*M], {k, 0, Floor[n/2]}])*e^n, {n, 1, 3}]     Plot[Ec[M], {M, 0, 2 \[Pi]},       PlotRange -> {{0, 2 \[Pi]}, {0, 2 \[Pi]}}]      Basically, I want Ec to be on the x axis and M the y axis. As of right now, they are swapped.
