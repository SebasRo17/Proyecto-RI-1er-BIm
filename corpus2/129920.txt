Currently I'm working a bit with ASP.NET and trying to find the best way to navigate through pages. Right now I have an `UpdatePanel` which has a `Placeholder` inside it. This `Placeholder` will then add the `usercontrol` I need. I've been looking around on the internet and some say that this is a really bad thing to do, while others use it without trouble. Is this whole `UserControl` inside `Placeholder` inside `updatepanel` good/bad? While I've been trying to implement this I run into a problem with `postback`. When I click a button on my "Main page" to add a new `UserControl` to the `Placeholder`, the Page. `IsPostback` is of course the same on the `UserControl` and therefore it will always be true here. Am I doing something wrong or do I need to use a session variable to keep my `UserControlPostback` perhaps? I'm open to all options, just need to find the preferred way.
