I am going to make a website for a client that wants to be able to alter the site about every week (changing pictures and textual information mostly). It is for a restaurant and so the client wants to alter the menu and images on an almost weekly basis. I've always made my websites and web apps from a framework or from scratch and have never worked with a CMS, but would a situation like this warrant the use of a CMS? What are some other options? Edit: I would really like a CMS to be a last resort option, but if it is most likely the best option I will use it.
