can anyone please help me with this problem? I am trying to estimate parameters of gamma distribution (fitted into a set of data). Following are my command and the output produced by mathematica:               In[41]:= EstimatedDistribution[data, GammaDistribution[alpha, beta], ParameterEstimator -> "MethodOfMoments"]      and it gives me:               During evaluation of In[41]:= EstimatedDistribution::ntsprt: One or more data points are not in support of the distribution GammaDistribution[alpha,beta]. >>      I do not understand the message above and what is the cause of it? Is it because of my command or my data? *note: if i am using binomial, NB, poisson and geometric, I can get the results. my data:               data = Join[ConstantArray[0, 96978], ConstantArray [1, 9240], ConstantArray [2, 704], ConstantArray [3, 43], ConstantArray [4, 9]].      Thank you!
