I'm currently building a web API for popular piece of forum software (XenForo). What kind of things do developers find important in a web API? Are there certain architectures (REST, SOAP, etc.) that are much better than just doing my own thing? The API I have the most experience with is MediaWiki's API, but that doesn't seem to follow any sort of standard. What should I be planning to include (e.g. output formats, OAuth) and what are some good examples to follow?
