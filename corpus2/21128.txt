First off, I apologize cause I don't know how to make a community thread; so someone help me out please. As a developer, across many platforms, technologies and even on an infrastructure level; I always find myself asking, when am I doing TOO much?!? It's been a never ending learning process, since I started. One (1) thing I learned is that requirements are barely valid for an extended period of time, and as such a little foresight may go a long way. But where is the balance, and how do you know when you're losing time, not gaining it?!
