I want to parse a multipart form twice: Once to grab the incoming fields, and later to process the file upload. I am trying to maintain a proper separation of concerns within my Node app:   * Controller is responsible for handling the incoming fields   * Model is responsible for the upload file logic. I need to pass the fields data into the model to create a new instance, so the fields data needs to be available _before_ the file upload starts. Currently every form.parse() or equivalent function parses both fields and files _together_. Example: req.pipe(busboy) handles both file and fields together. I have checked modules like node-multiparty, formidable, busboy, multer. Nobody seems to have a solution for this. An example of what I would like to achieve is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22336177/node-js-busboy-parse-fields-and- files-seperatly Is this even possible?
