I have defined:               Qq[T_] := Exp[-w/(2 T)]/(1 - Exp[-w/T])       Uq[T_] := T^2 D[Log[Qq[T]], T]      Can someone explain why this expression work:               Plot[Evaluate[Uq[T] /. w -> 1], {T, 0, 2}]        (As result the plot is created) But this does not?:               Plot[Evaluate[Uq[T]] /. w -> 1, {T, 0, 2}]        (As result a General::ivar error is displayed)
