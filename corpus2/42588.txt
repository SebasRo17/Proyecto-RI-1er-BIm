I am trying to label a plot with an equation. The problem is that Mathematica formats things _almost_ well but not exactly. The parenthesis are of the wrong size, and the powers are not high enough. For example:               testplot = RegionPlot[x^2 + y^3 < 2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}];     Overlay[{testplot,              Text[(10^-3/\[Beta])^2  (("1")/g') < 2, BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 18}]},              Alignment -> {0.9, 0.85}            ]      I need the equation to look like it would on Latex, but here is what I get instead: ![Mathematica evaluates the expression instead](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z9mBL.gif) I tried putting the equation between "" but the parenthesis would be the wrong size and the powers are off. Just like this: ![Formatting the equation as text](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ND436.png) Any suggestions? Thanks! L.
