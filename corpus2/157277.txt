At the company I work for, we're trying to standardize our development practices, and we want to make the right call regarding indentation. **Is there any empirical evidence (preferably research articles in HCI or something) which demonstrates the effect that whitespace can have on code readability?** Alternatively, I'd be interested in a study which evaluates various styles of indentation in code for use in a team environment, across editors, screen resolutions, and operating systems.
