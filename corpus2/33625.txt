I wanted to ask your opinion on anti-depressants, since I took them daily for 3 years now, but I can't be sure if I'm less perfomant with them or without, since I never withdrawed. I'm still at school at the age of 25, still having some motivation problems (for example I can't get used to do something at school if I don't think it will teach me something), but I'm quite motivated to work in the video-game field, since I have some personnal projects in mind. I know C++ programming etc, I'm still learning techniques, but do you think I should try more to do my project instead of just following the work I'm assigned to ? Have you had experience with depression or anti-depressants ? How did it affect your work ? Do you think that being depressed or half-depressed can improve creativity ? Do you feel it has affected the way you end up writing your algorithms ? EDITED
