I have seen many frameworks and modules and their standard they follow is like this   1. `UserInterface` which have some predefined methods   2. `AbstractUserClass` which implements `userInterface`   3. Then `GenericUserClass` which extends from `AbstractuserClass`   4. Then other classes extending from that generic Now I have seen that abstract class has additional functions to the interface, and the generic class also has additional functions.   1. So I am confused which methods should go where   2. Sometimes I see `class A extends Abstractuserclass` and sometimes `class A extends Abstractuserclass implements UseraInterface`. What is the difference if `Abstractclass` already impelements `Userinterface`
