I was reading another thread where a guy asked about C++ books for beginners, and one of the programmers answering wrote this: > Some warnings: avoid all books that present an "hello world" stating with >   >   >     #include <iostream.h> >   I opened my C++ book and sure enough it included the iostream header like the example above. Why is that bad? What other pointers should I keep in mind when learning C++? Background: I am proficient with C and I'll start to learn C++ this next semester.
