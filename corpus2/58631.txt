I am (partly as an exercise to understand _Mathematica_ ) trying to model the response of a damped simple harmonic oscillator to a sinusoidal driving force. I can solve the differential equation with some arbitrarily chosen boundary conditions, and get a nice graph;               params = {ν1 -> 1.0, ω1 -> 10.0, F -> 4.0};     system =        {D[x1[t], {t, 2}] == -ν1 D[x1[t], t] - ω1^2 x1[t] + F Cos[ω t], x1[0] == 1, x1'[0] == 0};     soln = DSolve[system /. params, x1[t], t][[1]][[1]];     Plot[x1[t] /. soln /. ω -> 8, {t, 1, 20}, Frame -> True, Axes -> False]      ![SHM transients](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tRS4H.png) But I don't care about the transients - I just care about the steady state situation. I tried using Limit to extract this;               amp = Table[Max[Limit[x1[t] /. soln, t -> ∞]], {ω, 1, 20, 1}]     ListPlot[amp]      ![response](http://i.stack.imgur.com/df9l9.png) Looks a bit peculiar to me. Also, this is incredibly slow, and doesn't work symbolically. I thought I could do something along the lines of forcing it to take as a solution of the DE $a Sin(\omega t + \phi)$;               params = {ν1 -> 40.0, ω1 -> 10.0, F -> 10.0};     x1 = a Sin[ω t + ϕ];     system = D[x1, {t, 2}] == -ν1 D[x1, t] - ω1^2 x1 + F Cos[ω t]     amp = Solve[system /. params, a]     phase = Solve[D[a /. amp, t] == 0, ϕ][[1]][[1]]      but this just turns into a mess and doesn't give the right result either. Is there a canonical way to tackle this sort of problem? I don't really know what I'm doing with Mathematica yet, so any explanations would be gratefully received.
