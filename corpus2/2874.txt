In working on a custom stock screener, I often need to run mathematica code like this:               {#, FinancialData[#, "DividendYield"]} & /@ Take[FinancialData["NYSE:*"], 30]      In this example, I've limited the result set to 30, but ideally I'd like to get the dividend yield for a much larger set. This is a specific example of a more general problem I have with mathematica, which is that sometimes I need to run a large number of distinct network IO calls and this blocks further computations. Is there some workaround for writing calls like this that won't block further computations? I am a fairly competent programmer and therefore can implement a system in my Mathematica code to compute results one at a time, but I am trying to avoid reinventing the wheel. I feel this must be a very common problem for Mathematica users who use the built in data sources/Wolfram|Alpha integration.
