I was recently given the task of creating an implementation plan document. When I asked for an example of one that I could look at, I was told to look at the Project Plan that had already been created an use that as a base. I'm still a bit confused on what I should be creating. Can anyone point me to a good example out there or to something that explains what this is and more importantly the details about what it should contain.
