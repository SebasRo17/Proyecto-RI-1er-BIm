Below is an example of a gaze sequence I recorded during a 3 seconds display. That is, where the eye was at every millisecond. While we should have 3000 points, we are missing some due to blinking. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O3CXlm.png) **Fixation or visual fixation is the maintaining of the visual gaze on a single location.** I need to extract those fixations. That is group of gazes that are both contiguous in time and space. Below is the location of fixations. Of course we'll have to implement thresholds. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Io08Vm.png) In this file available for download, you will find 7 sequences there if you simply open and run the attached notebook. `gazeSeq[1]` is the first out of 7 sequences made out of 3000 sublists representing each gaze record as `{x,y,time}`:               gazeSeq[1][[1]]      Out[1]= {-0.562, 0.125, 1000.}      where `time` goes from 1000 to 4000 corresponding to the 3 seconds of display. As said above some data points might be missing. While I tried to use `GatherBy`, I could not manage to include the condition of "time contiguity" and would get grouping of gazes that did not happen during the same interval during the trial.
