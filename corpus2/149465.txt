while (1) {           if (1+1==2) {                  print "Yes, you paid attention in Preschool!";           } else {                  print "Wait... I thought 1+1=2";           }      }      As a developer, we **all** have to use loops _very_ frequently. We know that. What I was wondering was, who thought of the idea to have loops? What language introduced loops? What was the first loop construct? Was it a `while` loop? A `for` loop? etc?
