I can connect to the local `Database`(installed in my system) from `Mathematica` via               SQLConnection[JDBC["Microsoft SQL Server(jTDS)", "localhost:1433/TestDatbase"],      "Catalog" -> Automatic, "Description" -> None, "Name" -> "DemoSql",      "Password" -> "test", "Properties" -> {}, "ReadOnly" -> False,      "RelativePath" -> False, "TransactionIsolationLevel" -> "ReadUncommitted",      "UseConnectionPool" -> False, "Username" -> "DemoLogin", "Version" -> 2.]      But When I try to connect to remote database I can't. I have following details               Sever Name: xxxx7ezff6.database.windows.net     User Name: xxxxxxxx     password: password     Database: AdventureWorks2012      I can see this remote database in my SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) by using server name, user name and password. But I don't know how can I connect to this remote database from Mathematica. I tried like this               SQLConnection[JDBC["Microsoft SQL Server(jTDS)",      "xxxx7ezff6.database.windows.net:1433/AdventureWorks2012"],      "Catalog" -> Automatic, "Description" -> None, "Name" -> "AdvTest",      "Password" -> "password", "Properties" -> {}, "ReadOnly" -> False,      "RelativePath" -> False, "TransactionIsolationLevel" -> "ReadUncommitted",      "UseConnectionPool" -> False, "Username" -> "xxxxxxxx", "Version" -> 2.]      It's end up with error. I think there is problem with hostname and port, But I don't have these details. How can I connect to this remote database? Note: I don't have IP address as well. The port Number I have given here has been set by `mathematica` as default. I tried without port number as well, but no use.
