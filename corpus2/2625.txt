Is there any way (other than the manual one) to grab all the functions a notebook uses from the different user-defined packages and putting everything into one file to deploy the code for e.g. CDF? I understand that this involves a recursive search through a possibly large number of package files, and the discovery of heavy interrelations between functions, but it is definitely not impossible to be done (I've done it myself many times by hand), and thus _Mathematica_ should be able to do it. Perhaps Wolfram Workbench?
