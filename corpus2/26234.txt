I have 1 GB of data that I would like to add to a CDF file, but I would like to avoid it being loaded into memory when someone opens the file (Free Player). One gigabyte of info takes a lot of computer memory, and the user of the file doesn't need to have it all in memory (specially when the way Mathematica or Player manages the opening of the file originates, for a couple of seconds, a double memory consumption which will go above a 32 bit process limit). So, this would work as something like a DB included in the CDF file. A dynamic structure interface will then allow the user of the CDF file to load only a part of the data into memory (`Set` a variable to a part of the total data).
