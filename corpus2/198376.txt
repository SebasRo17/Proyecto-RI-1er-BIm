I've been working as a Java developer for a while now. I usually work on business applications and I recently realized that my work mainly consists of   * writing an endless stream of _facade_ classes   * followed by an infinite array of _jpa queries_   * paired with countless hours of typing `mvn clean install -U` and waiting for the build Sometimes I get to work on more enjoyable stuff, but it's only 5-10% of my time spent at my workplace. I think that I should move on to some other segment of the industry because business application development usually lacks challenges. My problem is that after googling for a while, I couldn't find any exhaustive source about the distribution of programming jobs nor information regarding the supply/demand and/or segmentation of the industry. Does anyone know about some source of information about these matters? Even some pointers will do. I think there are others out there thinking about something like this. Don't constrain yourself to Java if you are answering because I'm willing to learn new technologies. **I do not want general information but grouped statistics across different segments of the industry.**
