I have 2 equations which are;               To[x_] := c1 E^(-a1 x)/2 + c2 E^(a1 x)/2 + a2          Tu[x_] := c3 E^(-a3 x)/2 + c4 E^(a3 x)/2      Tu equals almost zero `(10^-6)` at end of the wires. To must be equal to Tu at +-L/2. Also To has to be continous at +-L/2 by using Drichlet boundary condition which is `To'[L/2] == a4 Tu'[L/2]`. In order to understand easily, Tu shows ends of figures, and To shows middle of the figure.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JfBty.png) All things considered, I have 4 coefficient and 4 boundary conditions which have to satisfy each other. Functions have to be symmetric , therefore I wrote a trigonometric form as a Cosh[x]. How can I find c1 and c2 to satisfy all boundary conditions ? I wrote a program with Mathematica. But it is wrong. I think that something is wrong on finding c1. Can anyone help my code ? Here is my code:               To[x_] := 2 c1 Cosh[x a1] + a2     Tu[x_] := 2 c2 Cosh[x a3]           ff = Solve[Tu[Le] == 0.000001,c2]          bcs = {To[L/2] == Tu[L/2], To'[L/2] == a4 Tu'[L/2]};     s = First@Solve[bcs[[1]], c1]     Quiet@Solve[bcs[[2]] /. s[[1]], c1]
