I've always found it daunting and confusing how an OS hacker sets up their workflow. As a web-developer I find it easy to set up a workflow because web- sites run on servers and as such my OS is never touched. But an OS programmer, how do you do it? Do you develop on one machine and then somehow transfer code to the other machine? Do you develop on the OS you are developing, that last option seems rife with paradoxes? So how you do it? P.S. My similar Quora question still has no answer to this question...
