Hi I'm very new at Mathematica. My real problems concerns a much more difficult equation with many parameters, but I want to check that the method is good, so I made up a test equation. My test equation and roots:               equ = (5 x^3 + z + x z + x^2 (1 + z) == 0)       sol = x /. Solve[equ, x]      Here is problem. I'm looking to the parameter `z` such that all the roots of the equation are less than zero (edit: real parts less than 0, where, `z` is a real number and the roots can be complex:               Reduce[Re[sol[[1]]] < 0 && Re[sol[[2]]] < 0 && Re[sol[[3]]] < 0 && Im[z] == 0, z]      The answer is (I think) `z > 4`, but the function `Reduce` doesn't calculate this in a reasonable time. How do I proceed? * * * EDIT after few days: In equation with more parameters:               equ=-11.8193 + 12.0482 b - 59.0964 x + 12.0482 a x - 11.8193 d x + 12.0482 b d x + 0.320482 x^2 + 12.0482 c x^2 - 59.0964 d x^2 + 12.0482 a d x^2 + 1. x^3 + 0.320482 d x^3 + 1. d x^4      Reduce[ForAll[x, equ == 0 \[And] Element[{a, b, c, d}, Reals], Re[x] < 0], {a, b, c, d}]      It is good code? I waiting and waiting for a response from the Mathematica. Maybe it would be faster if the program could write only one/few numerical answer?
