I'm against compiled stuff going into version control, specially when it comes to compiled binaries, however, my principles are now in question after adding doxygen support for a project. Should the hundreds of files generated by doxygen go into version control?, what is the recommended practice here?, I think the ideal would be automating the process in a server that publishes that documentation at the same time, however, there is no such server now nor there will be for some time.
