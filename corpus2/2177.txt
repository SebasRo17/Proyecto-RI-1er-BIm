Suppose we have a list of values and a function `f`. I want to find which of the elements maximizes the return value of the function in Mathematica. Let call the function `ListMaxArg`. On the following example,               ListMaxArg[Total, {{1, 2, 3}, {10}}]      it should return `{10}`. Is there any such function in Mathematica's library? If not, what is the simplest way to write it? I can for sure write the function using a loop, but I am looking for something more functional style.
