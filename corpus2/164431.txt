For instance, I was making my first mobile web-application about a year ago, and half-way through, someone pointed me to jQuery Mobile. Obviously this induced a total revolution in my app. Rewrote everything. Now, if you're in the field long enough, maybe that seems like common knowledge, but I was totally new to it. But this set me wondering: there are _so many_ libraries and extensions and frameworks. This seems particularly crucial in the category of security. I'm afraid I'm going to find myself doing something in a professional setting eventually (I'm still a student) and someone's going to walk over and be like, _My god, you're trying to secure user data **that way?** Don't you know about the Gordon-Wokker crypto-magic-hash-algorithms library? Without it you may as well go plaintext._ How do you know what the best ways are to maximize security? Especially if you're trying to develop something on your own...
