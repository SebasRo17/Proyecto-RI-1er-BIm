I read an article that says Scala handles concurrency better than Java. http://www.theserverside.com/feature/Solving-the-Scalability-Paradox-with- Scala-Clojure-and-Groovy > ...the scalability limitation is confined specifically to the Java > programming language itself, but it is not a limitation of the Java platform > as a whole... > > The scalability issues with Java aren't a new revelation.

How is this possible? Doesn't Scala use Java's core libraries which brings all the threading and locking issues from Java to Scala?
