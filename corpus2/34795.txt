Say, I have a list               stuff={{eat,tea,now},{how,did,you,say},{the,cat,ate,was,can},{win,din,sin}}      I have a nested list and I want to find the list that has the most words in it and then I want to find the length of those words. How would I do that? I thought it was               Max[StringLength[stuff]]       and               Length[Max[StringLength[stuff]]]      but `StringLength` doesn't do me any good here since the length of each letter is the same.
