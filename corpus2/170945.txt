According to the research done here http://imageoptim.com/tweetbot.html, Xcode's conversion of PNGs to the proprietary Apple CgBI format does not create a noticeable performance improvement. Their claim is that the conversion only reduces PNG loading speed by 1 nanosecond. If this is true, why does apple bother with the CgBI format at all? Has anyone else benchmarked loading CgBI images vs regular PNG images on iOS devices to see if they perform differently?
