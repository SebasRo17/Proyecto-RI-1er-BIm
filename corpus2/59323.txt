Data:   * three categories A,B,C   * values in each category: `{median-semiIQR, sIQR (such that this value = median), sIQR (such that this value = median + sIQR)}` e.g. `{{90, 21, 21}, {57, 14, 14}, {117, 69, 69}}` What I want: Preferably, just bar indicating the median value, then an errorbar added, indicating the sIQR, but how is this done in a PBC? Else: cat. A is Red, cat. B Blue and cat. C Green. The last two values of each category have to be Blended, so that they are Pinkish, Lightblueish and LightGreenish, to indicate that these are sIQRs. In addition, I would like to display the median value for each category
