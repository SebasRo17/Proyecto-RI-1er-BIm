The major online IDEs are hosted on the service provider's server. Examples are Kodingen, Cloud9, ShiftEdit. Hence they would be unavailable if the external server was down for some reason, and I prefer to do my computing on my own computer anyway. Does anyone know of an online IDE or editor (preferably just an editor - a simple implementation of the Ace or CodeMirror JS editors) which can be downloaded and run on localhost (on a local LAMP server)? I've found two so far - Eclipse Orion and Wiode, but I don't like either of them very much, and I'm looking for alternatives. Also suitable are browser extensions which run natively on the browser (offline) without going to some external site. An example would be SourceKit for Chrom(e/ium).
