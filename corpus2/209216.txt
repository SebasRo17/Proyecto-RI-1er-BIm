If it was a 2-point story for one person, would you double it if people are pairing? Pairing isn't always necessarily done 100% of a dev task, so it seems that doubling the story points seems wrong. And it might not be obvious how much of the task will require pairing until the end, so you wouldn't know what the points the story should be until you've finished - and it seems strange to change an estimate midway through a sprint. However, if velocity is going to be an accurate representation of how much work we can get through during a sprint, it seems right to change the estimates if more than one person is working on a task. But also, this seems like it adds a lot of admin overhead. Thoughts?
