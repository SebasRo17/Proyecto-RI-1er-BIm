Please see this response I'm creating a website that has the potential to become extremely reliant on its data, and would need to be, eventually, serving up lots of data fast. When I read the above answer, I feel that perhaps MySQL isn't the best DB for me to be using. The problem is that I don't really know much about databases in general. I'm this atypical "Web 2.0" programmer who thinks MySQL is great because, well, it's all I've ever used. I have some questions:   * What should I know about databases so that I may make a more informed decision in the future? What resources would you recommend?   * Can I still use a PHP Framework, such as CakePHP, while choosing "alternative" databases? Is this a recipe for disaster?
