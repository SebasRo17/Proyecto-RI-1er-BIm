I am studying an infinite square well in the context of quantum mechanics.               ClearAll["Global`*"];          (* Length of the well *)     L = 1;          (* The eigenfunctions, n=1,2,3,... *)     u[n_, x_] := Sqrt[2/L] Sin[n π x / L]          (* Probability density function, ρ[x] = |u[n,x]|^2 *)     ρ[n_, x_] := Simplify[u[n, x]\[Conjugate] u[n, x], {n ∈ Integers, x ∈ Reals}]          (* Plots of ρ[n,x] for various values of n *)     Table[ Plot[ρ[n, x], {x, 0, L}, PlotLabel -> "ρ[" <> ToString@n <> ",x]"], {n, 1, 4}]      And here is the output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LpGgM.png) **My questions is** : Can I use Mathematica pattern magic to rewrite `PlotLabel -> "ρ[" <> ToString@n <> ",x]"` ? For instance, I tried (although I knew it wouldn't work): `PlotLabel -> HoldForm@ρ[n,x]`, but that of course leaves `n` unevaluated as well, although I would like `n` to be evaluated and then the result to be held.
