Coming from a native development background, I'm used to my unit test runners outputting the file and line that caused the test failure. This allowed me to run the tests as a post-build step, and if any test failed the build would fail. Also, I could press the hotkey and jump directly to the offending line. What I'm discovering in the .Net world is that no one appears to work this way. I'm willing to admit that perhaps there is a different, better way of doing things in this alternate universe, but I would like to know what that is. I don't want to need an external tool (awful), and I don't want to have to remember to compile and then run my tests. What I really want is what I used to have: failing tests also fail the build, and a quick press of a hotkey would jump me to the test that failed. Edit: I should add that I'd like to see some sort of integration with Visual Studio's csproj file format. Having a custom MSBuild Task would be great, but I'd be perfectly happy with a console command that I put inside an Exec or AfterBuild.
