I want to build a similar notification mechanism that Facebook handles. ![enter image description here](http://www.techlicious.com/images/computers/facebook-notification- icon-100px.jpg) I actually store the user's notification in an SQL table (actually it's a graph database but everybody master RDBMS terms). I'm interested in the case where the user clicks on the icon: The counter should get a value of 0 internally and visually disappears. How the clearing of this counter should be made?   * On clicking, call a Rest API that flags each notification as being `read` (table's column `READ`)?   Drawback would be that it would take some time if there was huge amount of notifications to flag in order to get the counter to 0 and making it disappear.   * Having a kind of column for each user called `HAS_NEW_NOTIFICATION` that is valued as `false` each time the icon is clicked (through a REST API call), if the counter was present.   Thus, the counter would be present only if the flag value is `true`. What would be a good practice?
