I've always felt lucky to work in a small programming team. I think the most I've worked with is 11 programmers. What is it like working on a project with hundreds of developers? Thousands? What does scale and what doesn't? EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! There seem to be very few positives:   * possible to work on mega-large codebases   * better internal career development   * employee protection against abusive management (this is more -ve on small than +ve on large) Is there any other benefit to large teams?
