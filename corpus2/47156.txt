I'm trying to study the sign of an expression, having information on some of my parameters. I don't know how to code these conditions. For example, I want to know when this expression:               k (2(a'[x])^2 - a[x]a''[x]) / (a[x]^2)       is positive given that `k > 0`, `x > 0` and that my function `a` is positive and increasing for all `x > 0` (`k` is a constant, `a` is a function) So basically, since `a''[x]` is the only term of the equation that I don't know anything about, I want _Mathematica_ to give me:               (* a''[x] < a'[x]^2/a[x] *)
