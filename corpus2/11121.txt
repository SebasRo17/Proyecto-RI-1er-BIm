Often some element of a path is variable, but the path as a whole needs to be documented in some manner for later programmers. Especially when using *nix systems, almost any character is a valid symbol for the path. Given that, I would like to delimit the variable portions of my path to prevent misunderstanding, but in a way that also survives best across different display environments (especially the browser). Methods I have seen include (example path in users home directory):   * /home/<username>/foo - needs special escape for web browser context   * /home/your_username/foo - unfortunately the variable element tends to be overlooked   * /home/{username}/foo   * /home/:username/foo Which have you seen most often or had the most success with and why? If a double delimiter method (which seems to be the most common/successful), what lead your choice of delimiters?
