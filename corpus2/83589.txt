There was a PC game released in 2001 called Black & White by Lionhead studios in which there was a lengthy statistics page which updated in real-time. There were stats such as how many people killed, how much money you've earned, etc... but the really puzzling one was Total lines of code executed, which was into the billions and counting. How would they have known this, how would they have calculated this at runtime? Did they make it up?
