Suppose I have a Table:               tab = {1., 2., 3., Indeterminate}      When I type `Max[tab]` I get `Indeterminate`, I would like instead to get Max of all points except the `Indeterminate` (i.e. `Max_new_version[tab] = 3`). NB: As a secondary case the answer should also provide a method to do a conditional replacement such that `tab` will end up looking like (i.e. `Indeterminate` is replaced by zero).               tab = {1., 2., 3., 0.0}
