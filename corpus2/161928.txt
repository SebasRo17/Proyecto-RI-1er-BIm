I'm looking for tools that will help me write test cases to cover all paths through a function in Javascript. Ideally, I'd like something that will spit out a list of combinations of parameter and property values that should be tested. However, if the tool simply told me which parameters and properties have an effect on the function, that would be very useful as well. Thanks! edit: I'm not certain that "branch coverage" is the correct term for what I'm describing. If "code exploration" is a better term (or anything else), please add a comment.
