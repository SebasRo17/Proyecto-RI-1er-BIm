I'm trying to understand the difference between non-functional requirements and quality attributes. Are they the same thing? You can find a set of quality attributes in the ISO9126 standard. I know that each system is defined by a set of functional requirements and every of this requirements has associated one or more quality attributes. For example, suppose that you have the requirement that describes the login functionality of a system. You can associate to that requirement the attributes of security and performance. If i say that the system can not take more than 1 second to respond, I'm talking about a constraint. So, where the concept of non-functional requirements kicks in? Are they defined by the users? How can I identify them?
