I'm in the elections division of my county and am trying to simplify a voter lookup method for our poll judges during election time. Currently we are using a clunky heavy application that the judges must install, and we only support Windows. My goal is to have an offline (client-side) browser based solution that will work on any browser for any operating system. I think, based on research that I've done through google searches and w3 forums, that I should be using JavaScript + SQL Lite. I have read that HTML5 has a good solution, but please keep in mind that election judges are typically elderly and don't upkeep their updates, or deviate from the preinstalled browser (typically IE), so HTML5 is not a plausible solution for our needs. I've done a days worth of research on the subject and just come up empty handed, because honestly I'm NOT certain what I should be looking for. But as I said, the JS/SQLlite combo seems to be the solution. Unfortunately I can't find any tutorials that will help me reconcile these two systems. Do you have any suggestions? Anything is helpful at this point. Thanks!!!!
