I've been programming for a while, I've written some rudimentary programs, and I want to keep learning. I've reached that point where you just don't know what to learn next, and I'd like to ask a question for my own curiosity. The question, in a nutshell, is if you can combine multiple programming languages into 1 result? For example, can this code be possible?               <html>     cout << "Hello world!";     </html>      or               import java.util.Scanner;     cout << "Insert a number from 1 to 10";     Scanner n = new Scanner(System.in);     System.out.println("The value you entered was" +n.newLine());      This feels like a silly question but I can't possible know if it's possible or not, so that's why I'm asking it. In this question I notice he is using Python code in html code, if my above example is not possible, what did he do?
