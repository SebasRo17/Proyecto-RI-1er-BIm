I am trying to visualize a list of positive integers using a bar chart. In general, integers in that list may appear more than once. For example, I may have               list=Sort@RandomInteger[{1,10},20]      > >     {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10} >   The bar chart I have in mind has the shape of               BarChart[DeleteDuplicates[list], BarSpacing -> 0, ChartBaseStyle -> EdgeForm[]]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mf8bH.png) It basically forgets about the multiplicity of each integer. I prefer to have the multiplicity reflected in the color of the bars, so               BarChart[Tally[list][[All, 2]], BarSpacing -> 0,          ChartBaseStyle -> EdgeForm[], ColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jLY8r.png) has the color scheme I want on my first bar chart. Here is a slightly more general problem: > Given two lists containing the same number of positive integers, to produce > a bar chart with heights and colors determined by the respective lists.
