I have this systems of equation:               kt = Sqrt[h/(π (y1 - y2))]*Integrate[p[y]*Sqrt[(1 + y)/(1 - y)], {y, -1, 1}]       kb = Sqrt[h/(π (y1 - y2))]*Integrate[p[y]*Sqrt[(1 - y)/(1 + y)], {y, -1, 1}]        In which: `y1` and `y2` are two variables that I need to find, `-1<y2<0`, `0<y1<1`, and `y1` and `y2` are real. The problem is that `p[y]` is a piece-wise function and is defined by:               p[y] := Piecewise[{         {p + a*(y1 + y2)/2 - a*2 h y/(y1 - y2) - t1, y2 < y < y1},          {p + a*(y1 + y2)/2 - a*2 h y/(y1 - y2) - t2, y1 < y < 1},          {p + a*(y1 + y2)/2 - a*2 h y/(y1 - y2) - t3, -1 < y < y2}}]        In which: `a`, `p`, `t1`, `t2`, `t3`, `h` are constants. I need to find `y1` and `y2` so that:               kt==c1&&kb==c2        where `c1` and `c2` are two constants. I had tried to solve this integration manually and the answer was lengthy and involved the inverse trigonometric equations. I also tried to use `Solve`, `NSolve`, `Reduce`, `FindInstance` and `NIntegrate` but _Mathematica_ usually hangs. Since I have to solve this system of equations repeatedly, I really want to know how can I perform these calculations in _Mathematica_ automatically?
