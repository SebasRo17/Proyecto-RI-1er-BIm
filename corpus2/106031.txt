Lately I've been developing a web-based management system for a gym. Their previous app was developed in Visual Basic. For the new app, all the front-end scripting uses jQuery, the server is running PHP & MySQL... you know, the typical el-cheapo linux based stack. Anyways, I was wondering why JavaScript's prompt, confirm and alert message dialogs are so underused nowadays. There a lot of jQuery plugins for modal windows and alert messages that try to mimic something that the language already offers and every browser is forced to support properly. Using hand-made or plugin-based solutions is ok for complex forms and special needs, but if you just need to ask for a single value or confirm the deletion of a record, why would you add such overhead to your web app? Furthermore, iOS and Android offer nicely adapted message dialogs when you use prompt, confirm and alert.
