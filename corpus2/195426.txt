I notice that a property of codebases that I like hacking on is that it's quick to find the relevant code for some feature, without knowing much about the code base at all. For example, searching for a label in the GUI, and immediately hitting the code that implements that feature. This seems to be in direct tension with abstraction layers, where the label is probably buried behind an I18N module, and the business logic is probably further removed in an MVC framework. (It can be mitigated by including GUI labels in comments though, for example.) It's obviously part of maintainability, but is there a name for this specific, desirable, property?
