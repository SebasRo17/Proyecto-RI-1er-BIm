From my experice in web development, I know that languages like PHP,Java,Python..etc is used for backend development stuff (software that running on server), and for front end stuff languages like JS/HTML/CSS is used. But i see many companies say that they use for example PHP for front-end development and say python for the backend. Does that mean PHP is front-end for calling other services written in other languages via REST,RPC ..etc?
