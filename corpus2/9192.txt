I have my _Mathematica_ code in a `.m` file and I run it from the command line with some parameters. I was wondering, if there is no overlap in input and output files, can I run the same `.m` file simultaneously with different inputs? Will this create any problems? My code is pretty huge, so I don't want to try that unless I am sure. I use the following command on the unix/linux commandline:               for i in $var     do     math -noprompt -script "scriptname.m" "parameter1" "parameter2"     done      I would like to run something like:               for i in $var     do     math -noprompt -script "scriptname.m" "parameter1" "parameter2" &     done      So that they would run in parallel. Is this possible?
