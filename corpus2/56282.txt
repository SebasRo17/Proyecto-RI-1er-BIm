How to get the solution from DSolve in such way that there is no need to copy the result. When for example solving:               f[x_, y_] := a y + x^2      DSolve[{D[y[x], x] == f[x, y[x]], y[0] == c}, y[x], x]      I get the solution:               {{y[x] -> (-2 + 2 E^(a x) + a^3 c E^(a x) - 2 a x - a^2 x^2)/a^3}}      How can I make a function of this let's say sol[x] so I can use it in such context:               Manipulate[      Plot[sol[x], {x, 0, 5}], {a, -5, 5}, {c, -5, 5}]      EDIT: not interested in:               sol[x_, a_, c_] =       y[x] /. DSolve[{D[y[x], x] == f[x, y[x]], y[0] == c}, y[x], x]
