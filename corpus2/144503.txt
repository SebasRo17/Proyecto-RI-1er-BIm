Is there a preferred/recommended Internet Media Type for RESTful POST requests? For example, if I want to add a new user, should I send the data as a URL encoded string like:               name=Foo&otherData=Bar      or does REST recommend I send the data as whatever format the response is going to be sent as (e.g. JSON/XML)?               <user>       <name>Foo</name>       <other-data>Bar</other-data>     </user>
