I'm a QA guy and designer and i'm coming to development. How do most developers architect programs? With design I build up with a vague idea of what I have in mind and adapt my design to keep in moving forward and looking good. With coding, I'm trying the same methodology. I'm constantly testing and debugging my code and I make forward moving tweaks to my code. The problem is, I dont think this is how it's done. When I look at good Javascript for example, everything is broken out into evenly distributed functions. I don't architect my code in this way. Do you normally have to sit out and draw out your classes and functions before you start writing?
