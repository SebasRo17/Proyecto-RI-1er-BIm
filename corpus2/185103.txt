I've written an extension to RequestTracker for a client, but he says the performance isn't good enough. I'd like to do some profiling, but I'm not sure how to connect up a profiler (say NYTProf, for example)? I tried what the man page says and put `PerlModule Devel::NYTProf::Apache` in my apache config, but all I get in the results are Apache2:XSLoader, Devel::NYTProf::Apache and ModPerl::Util modules in the results, and neither my own nor RT's modules.
