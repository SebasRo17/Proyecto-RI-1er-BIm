Following a standard framework of project management, for a software development project we will provide deliverables (documents and software) at the end of each month : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bf945.png) My question is:   * From May to June, while software is in development, what would be the deliverable for each month?   * Each document starts as version 1.0. Is it possible to deliver same document one or two months later as version 2.0? Because it could happen changes on the way.  Users and clients ask me they want to see something as deliverable for each month, so they won't feel that the project is going without direction.
