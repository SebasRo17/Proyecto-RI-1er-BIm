I have developed a web application using zend framework, mysql, and other client side technologies like javascript, jquery ajax, kendo grid, and so on. I have completed development and have done several rounds of testing to make sure the functional part is correct. Now I would like to check for the vulnerabilities in my application - vulnerabilities such as                          * sql injection                 * ajax vulnerabilities                * others       which I don't know of. I would like to ask you guys how to check this and make the application secure. What methods should I use to secure my application?
