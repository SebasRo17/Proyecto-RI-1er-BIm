We are developing a product at work which interfaces with basic I/O and sends data to a webserver over a GPRS connection. What i need to know before we commit to a product, is which language is more suited for this task: Java or Python? (or any language to be honest) As i said, it will run on a wireless module and open serial connections, read values, send data through GPRS connections to a webserver...
