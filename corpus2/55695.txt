I have a function given as a parameterized definite integral:               f[a_] := Integrate[BesselJ[0, x - a] BesselJ[0, x + a], {x, -∞, ∞}]      I suspect it has a root near `a = 0.8`. How can I evaluate this root to an arbitrary precision? Unfortunately, _Mathematica_ cannot evaluate this integral symbolically, and I don't know if it's possible at all, but I would be glad if anybody could suggest how to do it. * * * _Update:_ It seems that the integral is actually divergent except some isolated values of `a` (when `a` is an odd multiple of `π/2`, see http://math.stackexchange.com/a/878420/19661), and it's never zero when it converges.
