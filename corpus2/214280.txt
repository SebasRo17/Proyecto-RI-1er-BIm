I am currently employed as a software developer using C# and C++. However, I want to find a new job for personal reasons and applied for a job ad that listed PHP, CSS, and Javascript as the skills the company is looking for. I am interested in learning about PHP, CSS, Javascript. That company wants to interview me. However, I have very little experience with those so I don't know how to prepare. Is it likely that I won't even be asked questions about PHP, CSS, Javascript? What kinds of technical questions do you guys think I will be asked? To succeed, I just need to demonstrate that I am really eager to learn PHP, CSS, Javascript?
