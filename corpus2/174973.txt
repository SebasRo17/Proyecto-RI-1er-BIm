I'm extremely new to cloud-computing, Linux, and PostgreSQL, so if this is a stupid question, I apologize. I've managed to create an m1.large instance running Ubuntu 11.10, connect via Putty SSH, and install PostgreSQL (`sudo apt-get install postgresql`), but that is as far as I've gotten. My goal is to run several python web-scraping scripts that I've written on this instance (so as not to eat up all of our bandwidth (smaller company at the moment)) and insert the scraped data into a PostgreSQL table on the instance and later retrieve that data to store on our local server (as I've heard AWS EBS is unreliable and I don't want to take chances). How can I configure PostgreSQL on my AWS instance? How can I access the data from my machine? I currently use PgAdmin3 to manage PosgreSQL on our local server. Can I use this same interface to manage PostgreSQL on my AWS instance? Any suggestions, solutions, links, etc is greatly appreciated. And again, if this is a dumb question, I apologize. Thanks!
