As I got the feedback of developers about scrum methodology in this question, on whether it turns active developers into passive developers or not, I encountered the word **micromanagement**. However, Wikipedia doesn't explain this term in the context of specific and tangible examples, and this, can result in different interpretations of micromanagement. Can anyone point to some well-known micromanagerial issues in the world of development (of course, with reference)? What practices could be regarded as micromanagerial? How can we get sure that we're not implementing micromanagement in our working environment?
