A 'bad code' interview is one where the interviewee is shown a snippet of 'bad code' and asked to correct it or point out things that are wrong with it. I have trouble with these interviews because it takes me some time to read the code, figure out what its doing, and point out the flaws. In a situation where there's time pressure, I tend to freeze up and I see that the code 'should' work, even when it doesn't. What's a good way to handle this sort of interview, and, more generally, what are some good techniques to read and understand code _quickly_?
