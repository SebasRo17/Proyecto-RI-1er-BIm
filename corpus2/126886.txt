I would like to know how I can use a `switch` statement with `enum` values for the following scenarios: I am making a small program for a flight reservation system. The program is meant to enter certain details about the passenger. The program also restricts the user to choose destinations other than the following 3 destinations. Once destination is chosen, the flight number is supposed to be automatically assigned. The user will choose one of three destinations and program will assign an appropriate Flight No for the passenger. The Flight No will be assigned as below:                    Destination                    Flight No.           London                            201           Frankfurt                         233           Berlin                            241      So let's say I make an `enum` of destinations, then how can I use switch statement here? This isn't a homework. I am doing it just for the sake of exploring.
