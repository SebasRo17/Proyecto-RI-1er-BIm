I need _Mathematica_ to access an online public directory via some URL (fake in this case) http://example.com/images and perform operations similar to those _Mathematica_ can do on OS directories and files. Examples:   1. Get all files names - like: {image1.png, image2.png, ...}   2. Import files into _Mathematica_   3. Get various files info What is an efficient way to do it if it's possible at all?
