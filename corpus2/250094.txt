I am completely new to Drupal. A site I have taken over www.statehr.com has a form on the front page that a) obviously submits and processes data, and b) checks for duplicate username for example via an onkeypress event. Can anyone give me an idea of where to find the script that receives the post? The action is to / so .htaccess probably intercepts it, and I see two key hidden fields               form_id     form_build_id      which probably match up on the receiving end. The form is putting data in the users table but I want to do quite a few more things with it.
