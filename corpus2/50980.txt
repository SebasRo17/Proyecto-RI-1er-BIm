If I want to assign a regular placeholder as a string, it's very easy: (anything the user types in will automatically be given quotes around it, so when they evaluate the cell str is a string)                str = "\[Placeholder]"      I just can't get quotes around a named placeholder (not while assigning to a variable, at least):                str2 = {"\"", Placeholder[ProjectName], "\""}      Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
