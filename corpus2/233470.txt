I saw that the Unreal Engine is going open-source on github (see link1 and link2) and that made me wonder: "is open-sourcing a previously commercial engine a smart move?" What's the benefit to Epic Games in open-sourcing their core code in this manner? How can they not be concerned about people stealing parts of it just because they put a copyright and license statement on the code? It seems like there has to be a catch. How does releasing their source code benefit Epic Games?
