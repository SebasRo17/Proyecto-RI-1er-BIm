A simple problem I am facing is here:               list1 = RandomReal[{1, 2}, {3, 4, 30}];     list2 = RandomReal[{10, 20}, {3, 4, 30}];     Map[Map[(# + 1+Min[#]) &, #] &, #] &/@list1;      works fine, but whenever such a nested `Map` appears, I think there might be a better solution than what I am doing here. Now my problem is if I want to use a `MapThread` over the above function like the following, I stumble upon errors               MapThread[Map[Map[(# + 1/Min[#2]) &, #] &, #1] &, {list1, list2}];      Including this example and for even more nested situations, is there any general coding practice that is elegant, efficient and native to MMA functional language paradigm. Hope some one can help me with this type list manipulation here.
