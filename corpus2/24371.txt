I want to increase the number of minor ticks in a plot, but I don't want to label them. I searched through this site and also _Mathematica_ documentation, but I didn't find any solution yet. Could anyone please tell me how to do this. For an example:               Plot[2*Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, Frame -> True,       FrameTicks -> {True, True, False, False}, Axes -> True,       AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]      I want to get 10 minor tick marks in between 0 and 1 and so on (in between major tick marks on both axis). ![Here is the output plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C4jSZ.png)
