I have many outputs of one-dimensional Series expansions for which I am only interested in the general tending with the variable. For example, I would like to be able to transform something like               3.4235 + (4.22-5.2342 I) a + 7.543 a^6 + O[a]^7      into just               1 + a + a^6 + O[a]^7      etc. I have tried many things, including trying to collect the SeriesCoefficients and reassign them to 1, but I haven't been able to make it work yet. Here's an example of an attempt that isn't yet working (note, if it did work as expected, I would still need to add a simple If[] to exclude assigning SeriesCoefficients or Chop@SeriesCoefficients that are 0 to 1).                clear[test]; test = Series[1/(1 - b x), {x, 0, 4}];      Do[test = ReplaceAll[test, SeriesCoefficient[test, s] -> 3], {s, 0, 4}];      Print@test      Probably a much more efficient solution to this problem would be a more general rule that could be applied to the final output that simply checks the expression for "numbers" and makes them all 1. Surely there is a way to get mathematica to recognize numbers compared to symbols?
