Let's say I am selling hardware that uses the linux kernel. Do I have to state somewhere that it is running linux(or other gpl code)? The reason I am asking this is because I bought a television, which I found out is running linux. It doesn't say anywhere it is running linux, which seems to me a violation of gpl. If they don't state anywhere they are using gpl code, how do I know that I have the right to ask for the source? And let's say I want the source code of the kernel, how would I get it? Just go to the company and just demand it?
