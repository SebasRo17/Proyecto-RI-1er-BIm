I would like to understand the reasons and find a way to avoid such behaviour of the `Solve` function in Mathematica 8.               Solve[x + y + z == 5 && y == 3 , {x, y}]     (* Out[1]= {{x -> 2 - z, y -> 3}} *)          Solve[x + y + z == 5 && y == 3 , {x}]     (* Out[2]= {} (why empty?) *)      I need to get an answer in the second case. Any suggestions on how to persuade the program to calculate an answer that is even simpler than the first?
