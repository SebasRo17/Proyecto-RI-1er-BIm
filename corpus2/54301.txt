I now program in C# for a living but before that I programmed in python for 5 years. I have found that I write C# very differently than most examples I see on the web. Rather then writing things like:               foreach (string bar in foo)     {         //bar has something doen to it here     }      I write code that looks like this.               foo.ForEach( c => c.someActionhere() )      Or               var result = foo.Select( c =>                     {                         //Some code here to transform the item.                     }).ToList();      I think my using code like above came from my love of map and reduce in python - while not exactly the same thing, the concepts are close. Now it's time for my question. What concepts do you take and move with you from language to language; that allow you to solve a problem in a way that is not the normal accepted solution in that language?
