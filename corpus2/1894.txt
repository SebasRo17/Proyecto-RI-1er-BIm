I'd like to call some IronPython code from Mathematica using .NET/Link. The problem is that the code lives in .py files, yet from Mathematica I can only load .NET assemblies which are DLLs. So it looks like I will have to first load the IronPython .NET assembly, instantiate an IronPython language hosting environment, load the .py file into that and only then I'll be able to call the Python code. Has anybody done such a thing?
