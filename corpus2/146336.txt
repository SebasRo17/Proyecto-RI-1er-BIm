I precalculate data and store it in a static table and call this process 'caching' but that doesn't seem correct based on a quick dictionary search (hiding, concealing) I'm just saving the data statically to avoid the process time to make the calculation. Is there a more appropriate term/word? I think the key words here are 'static' and 'calculated' ## Probable Answers: ## As a noun (the actual output from such a process): Lookup Table ## As a verb (the process of getting there): Tabling
