I am having trouble finding any solution to this ODE:               ρ = 1.225;     b = 47.5;     Sw = 290;     AR = b^2/Sw;     m = 176000; g=9.81; W=m*g;          Lclimb = 1/2 ρ*(Vclimb[t])^2*Sw*CLfun;     Dclimb = 1/2 ρ*(Vclimb[t])^2*Sw (f/Sw + CLfun^2/(π*e*AR));     Tclimb = 2*(At*(Vclimb[t])^2 + Bt*Vclimb[t] + Ct);     Eqn1 = (Tclimb - Dclimb - W*Sin[θ[t]])/m == D[Vclimb[t], t];     Eqn2 = (Lclimb - W*Cos[θ[t]])/(m*Vclimb[t]) == D[θ[t], t];     DSolve[{Eqn1, Eqn2, Vclimb[0]==75, θ[0]==3 Degree}, {Vclimb, θ}, t]      I would be fine with NDSolve too, I just can't get this to evaluate to anything and want to know if I am doing anything wrong syntax wise or in my method.
