I have been playing with the RegionPlot3D idea from this question and have been trying to approximate the Gödel, Escher, Bach logo, but I am a little bit stuck on how to improve the rendering of the letter B. Here is the code so far:               Letter[s_String] :=       ClusteringComponents[       Rasterize[Style[s, 128, Bold], "Image", RasterSize -> {100, 100}]]          Gödel = Letter["G"];     Escher = Letter["E"];     Bach = Letter["B"];          SetOptions[RegionPlot3D, Axes -> False, Boxed -> False,       PlotPoints -> 100, Mesh -> False, Lighting -> "Neutral",       Background -> Black, PlotStyle -> Orange];          RegionPlot3D[      Gödel[[Round[i], Round[j]]] > 1 &&       Escher[[Round[i], Round[k]]] > 1 &&      Bach[[Round[j], Round[k]]] > 1,       {i, 1, 100}, {j, 1, 100}, {k, 1, 100}]      This works nicely for the letter E and G as can be seen here: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RKlEp.png) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ja9Al.png) But the letter B is not looking as nice, I think because of the shape of the letter G: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cpRlM.png) I am wondering if anyone has any good suggestions to correct the rendering of the letter B?
