Can a webservice be written in such a way that it can be called via just a browser url? For eg. if the webservice is called GetStockQuote, then it should be callable by the following url on the browser               http://myserver.com/WebServices/GetStockQuote?sym=MSFT      Likewise, if there are more params, they can be passed via the URL. Unlike this one - http://www.webservicex.net/stockquote.asmx \- where it doesn't look like the param can be passed via a URL. It seems to require either a program or a human to type in the param & click on invoke. Or does it always require a client program? Is there a way from the wsdl to figure out whether it can be called from a browser or not. How can I program a webservice which fulfils the above criteria?
