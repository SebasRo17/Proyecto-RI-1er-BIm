Usually               ColorData["TemperatureMap"]      is using to coloring graphs and show how near is any value to 0(Blue), 1(Red), or in the mean (White). The question is: How Can I do to obtain the RGB/CMYK code color, to a particualr value? for example,... to the value 0 is asigned BLUE=(0,0,100)%=(0,0,255)Hex but... What color-code asign the "TemperatureMap" to the value 0.123 ?, I know that it´s a close to blue, but... What exactly? I´ll use in other ranges like [0,8] or 1[12.45,45.85], not only in [0,1]
