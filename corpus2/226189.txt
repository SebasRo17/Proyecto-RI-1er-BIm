I'd like to create an app similar to Barbell Pro for Android, for practice / interest / educational purposes really. Or even as another example for database purposes, Fitocracy The problem is, I have no idea how the database could be designed... For example:   * We have a 1000 Persons using the app    * Each Person could have 1-7 individualised WorkoutRoutines, depending on the day. (Perhaps even more -> AM workouts / PM workouts)    * Each WorkoutRoutine has an individual set of Exercises, with some crossover e.g. someone could do Bench Press on Monday and on Friday afterall.   * Each Exercise has a number of Sets   * Each Set has a number of Reps Now to me, this seems like it could potentially be a large amount of information to store for Each Person, and maybe pretty complicated to do so. I only have some experience with relational databases and I don't know how I'd go about designing that in an efficient matter for a relational database. I'm not asking for a design, just how I'd begin to go about it. The potential complexity is daunting for me due to lack of database experience. Maybe it's not even that complicated, but like I say, ignorance from myself.
