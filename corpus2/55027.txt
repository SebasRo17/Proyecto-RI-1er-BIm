I wrote a little script to convert various graphics files (.ps, .eps, .pdf) to the raster ones (.png). `Export[out, Import[in], ImageSize -> size]` fails for some files without any message at an import step: `Import[in] === $Failed` (well, there’s another issue, something wrong with input files, maybe?). Albeit, Inkscape does the work well via `inkscape $in -w $size -e $out -z`. The problem is: _Mathematica_ ’s `Run` doesn’t like Inkscape.               In[]:= Run["inkscape -z file.ps"]     (*     Emergency save activated!     Emergency save completed. Inkscape will close now.     If you can reproduce this crash, please file a bug at www.inkscape.org     with a detailed description of the steps leading to the crash, so we can fix it.     ** Message: Error: Inkscape encountered an internal error and will close now.     *)     Out[]= 139      I tried in a notebook, in a shell mode, in a _Mathematica_ ‌Script. Other GUI programs `Run` properly. A PHP equivalent I had to write               passthru("inkscape $in -w $size -e $out -z")      works well, as do bare bash. What is this hatred between Inkscape and _Mathematica_? Can you reproduce this behaviour? _Mathematica_ 9 at Scientific Linux is used.
