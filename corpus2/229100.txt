We are planning to develop an android application. the application will use API and data transfer will be via SSL. I should write documentation and set functional and system requirements for the appliaction. One of the main requirements is that how much memory should the application use. Of course Android OS manages itself how much memory allocate to it at different satges of its activeness, but a great deal depends on appliaction. Is there any specific defined practice on how much memory should a typical android app use and that it is in use in advanced world of android developement, e.g. the appliaction of X type should use no more that 7 MB if they are active? How to set the requriement so that developers pay enough attention to this specific parameter?
