I am contributing to a library that is licensed under the MIT license. In the license and in each class file it has a comment at the top saying: > Copyright (c) 2011 Joe Bloggs <joe.bloggs@example.com> I assume that he owns the copyright to the file, and can change the license of that file as he sees fit. If I contribute to the library with a new class entirely write by me, can I claim copyright of that file. And put: > Copyright (c) 2011 Petah Piper <petah.piper@example.com> at the top?
