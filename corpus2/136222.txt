We're starting a medium sized PHP web app, written in MVC fashion, using CodeIgniter. Most of the functional specifications have been written, and there are a few features that will definitely be replaced with improved behaviour in later stages of the project. I'm tasked with writing a workflow document from a technical point of view and here's what I want to cover, ideally:   * The document should preferably be a diagram of some sort,   * A close mapping of elements in the document with with models/views/controllers/js functions/other important blocks in the code; let's call these modules That will suffice since I will be able to derive from that a way to test different modules independently and assign different modules to different programmers. The aspect of rewriting parts of the document when I discover that parts of the code need to be replaced isn't an issue, I'll make the rewrites to keep code and diagram in sync if/when I have to. My attempts so far with Petri nets and UML interaction diagrams have failed upon the realization that I have to expose too much of the decision making logic inside controllers. I'm looking for advice and I'm curious if anyone has done this before.
