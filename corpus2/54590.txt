I'm doing my 3rd year CSE Engineering. I guess this is the right time to ask this question! As in the next year, I'm going to do projects, "get my hands dirty". And there is only few days left out, as I know many people in Stack Overflow are working in Software field, I thought to ask these question.   1. Does the project that I'm doing in my final year need to be excellent? If so, what kind of project to do? And how do you say that the project is excellent or not?   2. Writing the code is very fun and serious at times. But the code should have a good algorithm?   3. And mostly in any software companies interview, what kind of question they ask?   4. Not but not the least, mastering in any particular language speaks in interviews?
