I have been programming for a long time, like 13 years (only professionally for about 4). I've become familiar with things like QBasic, Visual Basic, C#, .NET, Java, C, C++, Javascript, JQuery, etc. I can tackle almost any code and figure out what is going on or fix it, as well as create new solutions. However, no matter how hard I try, or how many times various DB people try and explain to me a solution for SQL, or how to create a SQL query that selects the things I want, I can't seem to 'get it'. What I mean is, I can understand why the new or modified query they write for me works, but I can't seem to get it into my head enough so that I can figure this out on my own or write my own complex queries. Was there any experience you had, or explanation you heard, that gave you enlightenment about SQL? This is not a yes or no question though, PLEASE share it!
