I have worked in a few places where the use of Open Source Software in products they produce is strictly forbidden for various reasons, such as:   * no formal support   * lack of trust in something perceived as "just downloaded from the internet"   * How can it be professional if it's not supported, we don't pay for it etc etc I'm looking for the best ways to convince/prove to management that things won't fall apart should we use these tools.
