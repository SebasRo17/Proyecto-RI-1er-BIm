I have a list of edges defined based on vertices like this:               Edges={{2, 1}, {10, 9}, {11, 10}, {11, 4}, {17, 12},.....}      (*Where each number is the index of a vertex which has 3D coordinates*)      In order to plot a graph I first made Edges looks like this (I want to plot **undirected** graph)               edges = Flatten[Table[{Edges[[i, 1]] <-> Edges[[i, 2]]}, {i, 1, Length[Edges]}]];      Then I plot the graph               GraphPlot3D[edges, VertexLabeling -> False, (*VertexCoordinateRules -> nodescoord*), \BoxRatios -> Automatic,ViewPoint -> {0, 0, -Infinity}];      Where am I wrong? Is it the way I define edges using "<->"?
