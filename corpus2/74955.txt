See UML colors here. Here is the example, I have following entity classes:               User(name)          MailBox(owner: User, label)          Mail(from: User, to: User, subject, body, composeTime)          MailCopy(type, from: User, to: User, subject, body)          MailDelivery(mailCopy, mailBox)      Use case: Every users have three mailboxes by default: `MailBox(*, draft)`, `MailBox(*, received)` and `MailBox(*, sent)`. `User(alice)` composed a new `Mail(alice, bob, hello, world)`, and clicked the "send" button. A new `MailCopy(SOURCE, alice, bob, hello, world)` is created and delivered to the `MailBox(alice, sent)`, and another copy `MailCopy(DEST, alice, bob, hello, world)` is created and delivered to the `MailBox(bob, received)`. I want to know how to classify these entities according to the UML colors archetype?
