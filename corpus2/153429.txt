Iteration has already started, new programmer joins the team, task X has already been estimated to be 30 hours by a different developer. What is the best practice in this situation?   * new developer runs with the given estimate (the idea being that any discrepancy will be corrected for when velocity is calculated?)   * new developer re-estimates task? (if so, what if it's significantly higher and no longer fits in the iteration?)   * throw our hands up and go back to waterfall?   * something else entirely?
