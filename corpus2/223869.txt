I'm trying to develop a new feature for open source application. But the existing application uses different APIs like Qt and KDE3. And more over the existing files are also very complexand depend on each other. e.g I wanted to create an object of PlaylistBox::Item but its constructor is protected. So I searched the codebase using grep, there is one line that uses this class, but then there are initialization variables of this constructor. Now how do I create these variables when I don't have any use and way to initialize them. My constructor on github,               SyncList::SyncList(QWidget* parent)//: PlaylistBox(player,parent,stack)      now how do I initialize these variables of PlaylistBox. This is the link to PlaylistBox constructor               PlaylistBox::PlaylistBox(PlayerManager *player, QWidget *parent, QStackedWidget *playlistStack) :      and this is PlaylistBox::Item in same file playlistbox.cpp#L775               PlaylistBox::Item::Item(PlaylistBox *listBox, const QString &icon, const QString &text, Playlist *l)      This was just an example case where I face problem. I want to know the basic approach to read such huge and interconnected codebases where one class inherits another and so on. How do I figure out which class should I use. I keep on trying different values hoping one of them will fix it, but clearly I'm doing it totally wrong way.
