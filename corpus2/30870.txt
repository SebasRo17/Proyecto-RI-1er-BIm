I have a function $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and I want to be able to see the effect of $f$ on any particular region of $\mathbb{C}$ e.g. what happens to the unit disk under this transformation. I know how to plot particular _regions_ in the complex plane using RegionPlot e.g.                RegionPlot[      Evaluate@ComplexExpand[        Abs[z]<1 /. z -> x + I y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2,        2}, AxesLabel -> Automatic];       shades the interior of the unit disk in light purple color. Is it possible to modify this code snippet to see the effect of $f(z)$ on the above unit disk for any given $f$?
