Recently my boss suggested that we post logs of our service that is hosted on Windows Azure into twitter. His idea is that it's conveniently readable and if Azure cloud fails logs persist. He also said, _lots of people do this_ , I Googled and couldn't find any data about this. Currenly my concerns are the following. First, perhaps twitter is not very convenient for logging something that can happen very frequently (for example, when our service role starts each instance writes tens of records over several minutes). Second, even if twitter EULA allows such use at this moment it might be changed in future to cut off tweets that occur too often to be human- originated. Is it practical to post service logs on twitter? What to consider if we implement this?
