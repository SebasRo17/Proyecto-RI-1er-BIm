My team and I are rebuilding a site we developed around ten years ago, and we want to do it in Agile. So after I spent a lot of time reading (probably not enough) I am having trouble with the question how to divide work between developers. I'll be more specific and say that the site is divided to separate modules that doesn't have much integration between one another. What is the best / Most accepted way to divide the work between the developers?   * Giving each person a different module to work on.   * Assign all developers to the same module, and split the work by different parts of the module (UnitTesting, DAL and Mapping, Logics, UI)   * Assign all developers to the same module, and split the work by different logics (For example each developer is in-charge of a specific logic(probably a method in the BL) and It's UnitTesting, DAL and Mapping and UI... Or maybe something entirely different?
