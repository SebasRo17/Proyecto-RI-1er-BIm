Inspired by the recent question about xkcd styled plots I started looking at xkcd again and I came across a comic titled Click and Drag. And if you do that, you start exploring a larger drawing. A _much_ larger drawing. How large? I don't know, but I spent about half and hour exploring it before my arm wore out. Now I want to see all the comic but I don't want to give myself RSI in the process. That leads me, finally, to my questions:   * How can I use _Mathematica_ to download the entire scrollable drawing?   * How can it be assembled and stored? This will surely be a tremendously large image; what data formats does _Mathematica_ support that can handle it?   * Is it possible to navigate the image from within _Mathematica_? In fairness people may ask "what have you tried" and I must say: nothing. Not long after posting I realized that the tiles are stored as PNG files with names that describe the location. This was also mentioned in the comments. This makes acquisition easier than I anticipated, and shifts the emphasis of this question to the second and third points.
