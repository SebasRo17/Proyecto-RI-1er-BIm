I'm trying to make a graphic of a random walk in 1D, but i want that the first and the last point have a color (in this case the first one red and the last blue), but i dont know what i'm doing wrong.. This is my code:               RandomWalk[n_, d_] :=      NestList[(# + Table[Random[Real, {-1, 1}], {d}]) &, Table[0, {d}],      n];          OneDim = RandomWalk[5000, 1];          firstpoint = OneDim[[1]]          lastpoint = OneDim[[5001]]          ListPlot[{{Hue[0], PointSize[.02],      Point[firstpoint]}, {Hue[.7], PointSize[.02], Point[lastpoint]},      Line[OneDim]}]
