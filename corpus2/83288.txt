I just landed my dream job - working in a big (famous) company as a frontend web developer. I've never even worked in a proper dev team before - the last 4 years since I started learning web dev I've been working on my own just building sites and apps for small business clients I found. I want to make the best possible start in my new job but it's not going as easily as I thought it might - there's very little induction or training - its a bit like being thrown in at the deep end, and to make matters worse most of the other developers in the office whilst being friendly and supportive, are speaking a language I don't understand very well. When they do speak english they use a lot of technical terms / jargon / names of products / systems etc that I've never heard of. I want to make a good impression and don't want to show myself up by asking too many dumb questions. What advice would all of you seasoned veterans of development teams suggest?
