I have been working with Silverlight 5 application for a while. I liked this technology and I was captivated to the point to get certified in Silverligt development. However, Html5 gained momentum this point, a new wave of thinking about new applications. Now, i am considering whether to develop in Sl or html5. I have read thousands of post on the subject and can not find clear if there is any way to migrate an application to HTML5 SL, know if there is any tool to help the process?
