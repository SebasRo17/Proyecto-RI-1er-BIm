I chanced to see some job requirements of Oracle SQL programmer or C# developer jobs, who want a person who can handle terabytes of data in ETL or data migration. I have worked on data migration to move data from one system to the other. As a C# developer or Oracle SQL programmer, I am not able to understand how things will be different if large data is involved. (Oracle documentation says that it can easily handle even 8000 terabytes, why do I have to worry about volume then?) Can someone please advice what is special about handling data migration of large volumes?
