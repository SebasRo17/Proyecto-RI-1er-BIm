The TIOBE index claims that the popularity of C++ is waning, and is currently way below C and Java. Echoing this claim, a blogger suggested today, that because C++ is going out of fashion, C++ programmers might be a bargain relative to other programmers. As a C++ programmer, I don't want to be left behind, if the industry moves on to something else, and I certainly don't want to be a "bargain". I've been programming in C++ for many years, and clunky as C++ may seem, in my current field (scientific/numeric programming), I just don't see any good alternatives, even though I've looked at dozens of languages. They seem to be either slow, less portable or even clunkier than C++. So, my question is, **are there reliable figures for the popularity of different languages, and C++ in particular** , in the industry? I'm skeptical that C++ is on its way out, because 75% of the qualified Google Code Jam entries were in C++ this year (This does not include the C entries)
