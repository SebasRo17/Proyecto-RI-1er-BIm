I'm working on an engine (I haven't started coding it yet but I like to have everything done as soon as I can, and since I'm unable to start coding it now, I'm working on these small things) and I want to license the code. For now, I'm thinking of leaving the project open-source, but later I might turn it proprietary so I was wondering what would be the best license for an open- source project (it's an offline project, I mean, it's C++/Lua based, not a web project) and also a proprietary license for later, in case I really turn it proprietary (I did search about both types of licenses, but from what I understood I have to make the proprietary license by myself, which would include registering copyright, contracting a laywer, etc. and don't want to waste money on this project, at least not for now). I would like users to have the possibility to modify, use parts of my code and use my whole engine in their projects (for the open-source license, of course the proprietary license will have other rights, but paid) BUT EVER HAVING STATED THE CODE IS COPIED/MODIFIED FROM MY ENGINE, AND IS NOT THEIRS CODE.
