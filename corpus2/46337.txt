I would like to do a contour plot with a label inside the figure. For example, the following works well. Note there is a small "example" at the right bottom figure.               ContourPlot[Cos[x] + Cos[y], {x, 0, 4 Pi}, {y, 0, 4 Pi},       PlotLegends -> Placed["example", {0.8, 0.1}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QHy0b.png) However, I don't want contour shading. But after I set `ContourShading -> None`, the PlotLegends disappeared.               ContourPlot[Cos[x] + Cos[y], {x, 0, 4 Pi}, {y, 0, 4 Pi},       PlotLegends -> Placed["example", {0.8, 0.1}], ContourShading -> None]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NlPB8.png) Would you be so kind to see if it is a bug? And is there a workaround? (I am using Mathematica 9.0.1)
