I have tried utilising the ImageLines function, and its accompanying Segmented setting. However, the segmentation doesn't appear to allow for its variables to be fine tuned, at least not according to the official documentation. For example, one may wish to restrict the segmentation to segments with lengths within a certain range, or to change the threshold below which two segments are detected instead of one. How would one do so, assuming that the Segmented setting can be fine-tuned, and if it cannot, what method would be recommended in order to achieve the aims stated above?
