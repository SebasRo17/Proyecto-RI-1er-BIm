I know there was many questions like this one, but please hold on one more. All programming languages I know now are made for web purposes. I've been learning ActionScript, php and a bit of Javascript, AJAX, etc.. I've liked php very much but I'm still looking something I'll really love! That's why I want to try something new. Can You tell me what are positives and negatives of this language? Is there some big example of C++ usage? Is it a good language to start this journey (maybe You can recommend something else)? Are there some good video tutorials which I can buy on CD/DVD? Could You recommend some books? @edit: After reading Your answers and some info on the internet I'm confused about two languages. Those are C++ and Python. Python can be used for web so it combine great with my current knowledge. But how about Python for desktop applications? Is it hard to build cross-platform apps? Could You compare for me this two languages? PS. I'm really glad about all of Your answers. It is very helpful for me & it forces me to productive thinking about my future ;)
