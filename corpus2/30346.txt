Is there a way to set a setting in the _option inspector_ to a path that is relative to some global Mathematica variable? I'm trying to set up a default stylesheet by setting `DefaultStyleDefinitions` to a style sheet located in `$UserBaseDirectory/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/StyleSheets`. I need the setting to be independent of the path to `$UserBaseDirectory` because I'm using the same settings on different machines where my user's directory has different names. But setting it to a value containing `$UserBaseDirectory` didn't work.
