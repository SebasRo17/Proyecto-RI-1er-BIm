I really want to start working in OS development, particularly kernel development, with the Open Source Darwin Project - building my own Mac-like operating system, however I am simply not experienced enough to work in the black art of kernel development - I'm constantly deterred by comments : "your code has to be close to spectacular" , "You need to be a programming veteran to write in kernel space" So I Have tried to find other projects. I am working at CryENGINE 3 at the moment, but I just can't get into the API's as I'm constantly wanting to start kernel development. I have no experience in user-land programs, however I have researched and created small assembly based programs. Note: I'm 17 years old. Are there any projects you can recommend me starting, so I can get some experience for user-land applications? I find it almost impossible to build something revolutionary. I have Experience with C, C++ , C# , Java , Haskell , Ruby , Lua and ASM. Plus: What's the chance of creating a business out of software development?
