> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Why do most of us use 'i' as a loop counter variable? I was just writing a nested loop and got to the point where I was using l and m as variables to control for loops, and I realized this could get very confusing; Ive already had a few bugs when I copied blocks of code to different levels. So I was thinking instead of using i,j,k I would use iSomething,iSomethingelse. So if I were going over a 3D model Id use               for(int iMesh=0;iMesh<numMesh;iMesh++)         for(int iVertex=0;iVertex<meshes[iMesh].numVertex;iVertex++)      or maybe use the name of the variable Im iterating over: for(int iMeshes for(int iVerts So I was wondering if there are any other standard or commonly used practices for doing this? EDIT: Im wondering if there ARE any standards, not if its OK to do this
