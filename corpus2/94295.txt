I've been programming very lightly for a few years, and not making much progress. It's something that definitely interests me, but I just haven't gotten motivated. Then, I think I figured out what's killing me. All the books I've read, all screencasts I've watched, seem to have missed out on one important thing: How do I go from print statements, variables, etc., to doing more complicated stuff? For example, let's take a site like Posterous. For those who don't know, it's a blogging platform that accepts blog posts via e-mail. The author of the blog has a special @posterous.com e-mail that they send blog posts to, and they are automatically formatted and posted. How would a developer use their toolbox of functions and statements to accomplish something like this on the back end? I'm sorry if this question seems really broad, it's just been frustrating me. I feel like I have a decent grasp of basic concepts, but have no idea how to actually _do_ anything.
