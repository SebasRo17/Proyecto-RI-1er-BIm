According to the documentation,               StringCases[{s1, s2, ...}, p]      returns               {StringCases[s1, p], StringCases[s2, p], ...}      but, oddly enough,               StringCases["string", {p1, p2, ...}]      returns the results which match _any_ of the patterns $p_i$, which is essentially equivalent to               Union[{StringCases["string", p1], StringCases["string", p2], ...}]      Is there a way to modify `StringCases["string", {p1, p2, ...}]` to return just               {StringCases["string", p1], StringCases["string", p2], ...}      in an analogous manner to how `StringCases[{s1, s2, ...}, p]` does it? One alternate way to get the same output would be               Through[Table[StringCases[#, p[i]] &, {i, n}]["string"]]      but I was curious if there was another way.
