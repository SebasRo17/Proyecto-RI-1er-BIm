I am trying to create a string of the form $0 < d_1 < d_2 < \ldots < d_n$ For a given n. My closest attempt so far is               eqn[n_] :=       For[i = 1; str = "0", i <= n, i++,         str = str <> "<" <> ToString[Subscript[d, i]]];      But for, say n=6, this gives me               "0<d      1<d      2<d      3<d      4<d      5<d      6"      Where it seems to have interpreted the string as `"0<d\n 1<d\n 2<d\n 3<d\n 4<d\n 5<d\n 6"`. Why is it doing this? How can I achieve the result I am looking for?
