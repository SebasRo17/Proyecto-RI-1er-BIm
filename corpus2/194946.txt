We have a large team of developers and testers. The ratio is one tester for every one developer. We have full bug tracking and reporting systems in place. We have test plans in place. Every change to the product, the testing team is involved in the design of the feature and are included in the development process as much as possible. We build in small iterative blocks, using scrum methodology and every scrum they are included in, including the grooming sessions etc. But every release of the product, they miss even the most simple and obvious defects. How can we improve this?
