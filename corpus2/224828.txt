I can fully appreciate the benefits of a package manager like Python PIP, Node npm, or Ruby Gems since they're doing much more than adding files to your applications path. Maybe I'm missing the point, or I'm being obtuse, but here are the **negatives** I can see:   * Separate step when building a project   * Separate dependency to install via another package manager (yo dawg)   * More clutter in the projects root with `bower.json` and / or `.bowerrc`   * Reliance on the registry being up to date, correct, and available   * Some imports / references to things like images won't work The **positives** I can see are these:   * I don't have to download the dependencies manually   * Optionally install packages as part of scaffolding based on user prompts or the like I'd really like to know of any benefits I'm unaware of, and I should say I'm not trying to be provocative I genuinely want to know.
