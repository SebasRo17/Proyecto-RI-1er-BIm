I am in the market for new employment, and found a position were they asked me to create a programming sample based off an assignment. I blew the sample trying to get it done quickly one night, and got declined - only to be given a second chance recently. The concern was that I didn't really demonstrate object oriented knowledge. I've rethought my approach but I figure it's worth asking: if you were hiring someone for an OO position, what skills would you most want to see them demonstrate they had a firm grasp on? I want to be sure that I'm missing anything important this time around.
