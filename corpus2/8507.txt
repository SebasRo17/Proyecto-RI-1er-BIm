The question is **how can we use Mathematica to create vectorized versions of low-resolution images?** The goal is to get an image suitable for quality printing at any resolution. Since "true" vectorization performed by various specialized software is a tough problem, I suggest to consider "artistic" approaches, which produce inexact, but beautiful version of the original. Colored implementations are highly appreciated.
