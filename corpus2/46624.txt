at first sorry if this question is already answered. I would like to display y value as plot marker in listplot               ll = {{33, 11, 2}, {3, 5, 4}, {6, 4, 8}}     Table[ListLinePlot[ll[[i, 1 ;; 3]], PlotLabel -> i,        PlotMarkers -> valueY], {i, 3}]      Gives me output like this: ![output from code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qlZM9.png) and I'd like to have 33, 11, 2 instead of valueY. Thanks in advance.
