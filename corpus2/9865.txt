First, I'm a little disappointed that Mathematica balks at:               Mean[TruncatedDistribution[{{0, Infinity}},MultinormalDistribution[{0}, {{1}}]]]      Second, is the numerical computation of means from truncated multinormal distributions so hard? Is anyone aware of a package that implements the algorithm of Leppard and Tallis (1989) (see here for FORTRAN code) or anything like it? **Edit** : rm asked for an example that fails to compute:               Mean[TruncatedDistribution[{{0, Infinity}, {0, Infinity}},          MultinormalDistribution[{0.5, 1.5}, {{1., 0.3}, {0.3, 1.}}]]]
