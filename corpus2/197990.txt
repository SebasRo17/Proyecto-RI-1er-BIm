We have a team of roughly ~8 devs who regularly work on the same feature over the course of a 3 week sprint. It isn't quite pair programming, but in our current workflow devs regularly push up incomplete code for a colleague to complete. This worked fine before we introduced Gerrit, but now our commits need to represent chunks of test-passing, complete, logical functionality, and so the model breaks. My only idea is to have everybody push up to a separate, untracked branch up until the functionality is ready for review, then squash everything into commits that make sense and push up. Is there another Gerrit-ized workflow that could work? I know this is a widely discussed topic on Google Groups, and that there has recently been some discussion of Gerrit topic reviews, but I wanted to see if there is anybody out there using Gerrit in this way, and what the suggested workflow would be.
