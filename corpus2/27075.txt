**Background** Concrete is mixture of aggregates and cement. Aggregates are composed of different sizes and colors. Core samples are taken by drilling in order to test the strength of concrete . They are usually in cylindrical form. See the image below. I want to detect the circle of the cylinder and aggregates as well as calculate the areas. **Question** ![concrete blocks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tNcYK.jpg) I have many images similar to this one. May Questions are :   1. How can I remove the background and detect the circle?    2. How can I find the shape of aggregates calculate the areas? PS: I'm well aware of related Questions on this site but most of them end up with failure. **Edit 1** Thank you shrx for the first part of the Q Code               img= Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/tNcYK.jpg"]          circles = SelectComponents[MorphologicalComponents[         LaplacianGaussianFilter[          ColorNegate@DeleteSmallComponents@Closing[EdgeDetect[i, 3], 11],           2], 0.0056`],        "Count", # > 600 &];     cm = ComponentMeasurements[circles, "MeanCentroidDistance"]     ct = 1 /. ComponentMeasurements[FillingTransform@i1, "Centroid"];     Show[i, Graphics[{Thick, Red, Circle[ct, cm[[1, 2]]]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rMl49.png)
