I am trying to classify a set of images into grayscale or color groups. I have been using ImageMagic to do that, comparing the color image to a grayscale version of itself and then using the Peak Error to determine if it is a grayscale image, as shown here: http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/compare/#type_general This is working, however, it is producing false results for a lot of back and white images. I have tracked this issue down and I believe it is being caused by pseudo-black pixels (e.g.: rgb(0,0,5)). These psuedo black pixels appear as full color, because they technically are. Is there a better way to classify these images? What would you suggest I do to get rid of these false results?
