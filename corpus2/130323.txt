I'm looking to create a client/server application for iOS devices, where client is the iPhone/iPad and server is hosted either at home (Macbook w/ Apache) or online. I've seen many methods suggested in my googling, but the most common method seems to be HTTP POST and GET requests. I'd like to know if there are any limitations of using HTTP for a client/server-based iOS application before I get too involved with the implementation. Performance is not my first priority, as I'd only be sending small amounts of data at a time. Also, is using Apache HTTP Server a viable solution, or should I use a different tool on the server side? Pardon my inexperience in the area. Thanks in advance. I've also heard of Parse and Amazon EC2, can anyone vouch for either? **EDIT:** To clarify, the server would be a single computer/host for all clients, not one server per client. I'd also like the cheapest (if not free) solution available.
