I am trying to visualize the visible spectrum using the built-in `ColorData["VisibleSpectrum"]` function which "colors based on light wavelength in nanometers". But I get wrong results for well-known pure colors. For example the yellow color has wavelength of 570â€“590 nm but `ColorData["VisibleSpectrum"][580]` returns green: ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sf7mZ.png) Is it a bug? How to visualize the visible spectrum in _Mathematica_ correctly?
