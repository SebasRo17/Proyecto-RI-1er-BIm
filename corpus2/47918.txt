Consider this simple streamline plot:               StreamPlot[{-y/10, x/10}, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},       StreamColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, u, v}, Hue[v]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8cxA0.png) The arguments to the colour function are rescaled to lie between 0 and 1, so the colours span the whole spectrum, as expected. But now I want to turn off colour function scaling and work with the original vector field values. Those lie between -1/10 and 1/10, so I should get only hues between purple and orange:               StreamPlot[{-y/10, x/10}, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},       StreamColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, u, v}, Hue[v]],       StreamColorFunctionScaling -> False]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/B9mXe.png) _I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that._ Is this a bug? How do I work around it?
