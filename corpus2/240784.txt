In my team we have a multiple projects, some short term and some long term. The team is required to deliver these projects on different dates and the effort to deliver these is run in parallel with the team working on stories for more than one project during each sprint. When trying to compute our burndown we aren't sure what to do. As the team is split between projects the velocity can change dramatically week-on-week as people shuffle to the tasks best suited for their specialty across the projects. This makes it difficult to create a reliable and meaningful burndown chart for each project. However if we combine the stories into a single burndown chart how can we track against the release if the release dates are different and it isn't obvious which points remain for each project. Is there a good method for dealing with this?
