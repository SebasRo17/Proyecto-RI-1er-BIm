The famous Zebra Puzzle (Wikipedia), often called "Einstein's Riddle," is a logic puzzle that can be solved deductively by applying a list of logical rules. One version of the riddle (from Wikipedia) begins: >   1. There are five houses. >   2. The Englishman lives in the red house. >   3. The Spaniard owns the dog. ... > The idea is that there are five houses, painted different colors, with occupants (one in each house) of different nationalities each of whom smokes a different brand, drinks a different beverage, and keeps a different pet. Given the "clues," the puzzle asks which resident owns the zebra. Given that Mathematica is a rule-based language, it seems that there should be a way of solving the puzzle without resorting to brute-force (i.e. while loops or searching). Can Mathematica be used to elegantly deduce the solution? How?
