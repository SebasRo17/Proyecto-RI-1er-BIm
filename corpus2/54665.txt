I have a lists with 100,000 elements and would like two swap to entries without dublicating the list Example:               a = {11,2,7,31};     swap[2,4]; (* how to implement this? *)      a (* should print {11,31,7,2} *)      I can do               swap[i_,j_]:=(a=ReplacePart[a,{i->a[[j]],j->a[[i]]}])      but this copies the list and if there are many swaps this takes way too much time... **Edit:** The important point of my question is how to do it without having Mathematica creating a copy of the list. This is in no way answered by the alleged duplicate.
