I work for a large corporation and I want to keep my skills fresh. I think contributing to an open source project would help, especially if I ever want a job at a startup. I have heard that large companies often own any development employees do outside of work. Could I face legal consequences by contributing to an open source project without notifying my employer? Could I be putting an open source project at risk if I contributed to it while employed? If refrained from contributing due to legal reasons and I applied to another company where open source development experience is expected, would they understand or would my application go in the trash bin?
