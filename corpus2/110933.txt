I was reading a book today called "Clean code" and I came across a paragraph were the author was talking about the levels of abstraction per a function, he classified some code as low/intermediate/high level of abstraction. My question is what is the criteria for determining the level of abstraction? I quote the paragraph from the book: > In order to make sure our functions are doing “one thing,” we need to make > sure that the statements within our function are all at the same level of > abstraction. It is easy to see how Listing 3-1 violates this rule. There are > concepts in there that are at a very high level of abstraction, such as > getHtml(); others that are at an intermediate level of abstraction, such as: > String pagePathName = PathParser.render(pagePath); and still others that are > remarkably low level, such as: .append("\n").
