What is the decisive difference between LGPL(v3) and AGPL(v3) ? Both can be used in commercial production, both can also be packed within a payed product. As long as I do not change the source code of these, I am not forced to enclose the source code with my product. So where lies the eminent difference? (Asked this also at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10996160/the-decisive- difference-between-lgpl-and-agpl, but a user suggested to ask it here.)
