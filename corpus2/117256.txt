I take notes about language features, project details, etc. I've noticed that I tend to take a lot of notes when I start learning a new aspect of a language or start working on a new project, but then as the momentum builds my note taking drops off. I often wish I would take more notes, since I frequently find them helpful months later when I encounter a problem for the second time or when I want to remember some past detail. Do you take a lot of notes? and how do you or don't you maintain the volume of notes you take? My problem is that once I'm going on something, jotting done a note feels like an interruption; even though, I know it will be useful in the future. Any suggestions?
