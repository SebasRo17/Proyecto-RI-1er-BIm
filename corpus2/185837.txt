My programming professor has told me that it is a good programming practice (at least in C/C++) to declare a function with the inner loop when nesting loops (not _for_ loops, since when, i.e. looping through a multidimensional array this is very intuitive). For example, if I write               int main()     {         while (cond1)         {             // ...(1)...             while (cond2)             {                 // ...(2)...             }         }     }      then it is better:               type inner_loop(param)     {         // ...(1)...              while (cond2)         {             // ...(2)...         }     }          int main()     {         while (cond1)         {             inner_loop(param);         }     }      What improvements do imply this method? Is there any case in which this way of programming nested loops can be counterproductive? Thanks in advance.
