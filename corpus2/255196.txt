I see that the market is full of mobile apps based on card/board games. For example, do a search for "Taboo" and there are many results which are not published by Hasbro Inc. Is this legal? The top "Taboo" result says in the description that they are not associated with Hasbro--does this absolve them of infringement issues? I can think of a few games that I could make mobile versions of that could be successful, but I'm wary of publishing (and monetizing) a game based on another, especially if it has the same name. Note: I noticed this useful thread, which hints that it is legal to create such games, but that the original owner may fight to have similar games removed and might win. If I develop such a game and have to pull it down, would I be able to resubmit it after making some changes?
