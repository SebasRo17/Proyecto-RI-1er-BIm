I would like to have abstract matrices M and S to get out the coefficients of matrix power series however it treats M and S as numbers even if i checked that M.S - S.M != 0. I attach my code below:               $Assumptions = {Element[M, Matrices[{3, 3}]], Element[S, Matrices[{3, 3}]]}     Series[Simplify[(1 - a*(M + S))^(-1)], {a, 0, 3}]      How can i cure this to get out proper result? Thanks in advance for reply.
