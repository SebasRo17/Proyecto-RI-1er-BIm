I have a list of objects that will need to go through an approval process. I am curious if it would be best to simply add some properties to my object, like `ApprovedBy`, and `ApprovedOn`. Another option is to create an `ObjectApproval` class that contains this information as well as other information that needs to be stored. If I wanted a list of objects that still needed approval, I could simply query for a null `ApprovedBy` in the first scenario. In the second scenario, I would have to maintain an accurate list of `ObjectApproval` items. The next thing is, what if I need a multi-step approval process? In this case, I think it would be better to create an `ObjectApproval` type to track all the intricate details, and I could simply query for the `ObjectApproval.Step` (or something similar) to find out the items a specific user needs to approve based on their role Any thoughts on this? Or perhaps design patterns to recommend?
