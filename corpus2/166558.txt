I have an IT background and was pretty confident until an opportunity came up at work to go into programming(C#). I have never programmed before this, and the software I am programming for is a program I have never used before (a 3D modeling software). It has been 6 months since then and I feel like giving up. I didn't get much training... about 3 weeks of training spread out over the last 6 months. I think I would be good at programming but this experience is making me rethink my decision. I'm not sure if it's just me, or if this frustration is normal. How can I figure out if programming is right for me?
