With help from here, I have succeeded in plotting the equation `z = -a Log[2 Cosh[(2 f[x] + x)/a]]`, with `f[x]` being defined by the transcendental equation `f[x] = Tanh[(2 f[x] + x)/a`. However, for `a < 2` each `x` in the vicinity of `0` has up to three possible values of `y` as a soultion.               f[x_] := y /. FindRoot[y == Tanh[(2 y + x)/1.5], {y, 0}]     p1 = Plot[-1.5 Log[2 Cosh[(2 f[x] + x)/1.5]], {x, -1.5, 1.5}];     Show[p1,  PlotRange -> {{-1.5, 1.5}, {-3.1, -0.9}},  AspectRatio -> Automatic]      I know that `y = Tanh[(2 y + x)/1.5]` is supposed to have a jump-discontinuity for `x = 0`, and be one-to-one everywhere else. So, how do I make _Mathematica_ use only the **minimum** values of                 y = Tanh[(2 y + x)/1.5] for x ∈ [-∞, 0]       and **maximum** values of                 y = Tanh[(2 y + x)/1.5] for x ∈ [0, ∞]      when I plot               z = -1.5 Log[2 Cosh[(2 y + x)/1.5]]      ?
