Suppose I have a function $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^x}$$ I can use the function `Series[]` to generate a series expansion of $f$ as follows               x0 = 0;     f[x_] = 1/(1 + E^x);     poly[n_] := Normal[Series[f[x], {x, x0, n}]]     poly[3]      which yields $$ f(x) \approx \frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{4}+\frac{x^3}{48} $$ Denote by $f_n(x)$ the series truncated after the nth term. I want to generate a plot of the error $|f(x)-f_n(x)|$ versus $|x|$ on log scales. I think I can do this with `LogLogPlot[]` as follows               Clear[error]     error[n_] := error[n] = Abs[f[x] - poly[n]]     LogLogPlot[error[3], {x, 10^-10, 1}]       This generates the plot ![error](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xKnpK.png) Which I think looks correct, the error curve is a straight line as expected. But now suppose I change the point of expansion to $x_0 = 1$. Now I want to plot $|f(x)-f_n(x)|$ versus $|x-x_0|$ on log scales. How can I do this? I have tried               ParametricPlot[{Log[error[2]], Log[Abs[x - x0]]}, {x, x0, x0 + 1}]      but I don't know how I can label the ticks correctly as above. ![error plot using ParametricPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wi37t.png) I think maybe I need to use `ListLogLogPlot[]` but I'm not sure how to generate the points for the x range. What i'm looking to do is plot something similar to ![I want to generate something like this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8dXyb.png) the matlab code to do this is available here
