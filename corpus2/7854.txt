I know how to import an image into Mathematica using the `Import` command. The original image can come from anywhere, but call this image "myimage" after importing into Mathematica Now my problem is how to insert this image at the point with coordinates (2,3) in the XY-plane. I know how to insert certain text at a prescribed place, but with imported images, I am not sure how to do it. Any help will be greatly appreciated!
