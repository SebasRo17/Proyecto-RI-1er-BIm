This is just a follow-up of this post: Beginner 2D animation with maths equations Part of the code is:               circ = RegionPlot[x^2 + y^2 <= radius^2, {x, -radius, radius},      {y, -radius, radius},      Mesh -> 20, MeshStyle -> {{Red}, {Blue}}, BoundaryStyle -> Black,      PlotStyle -> None]      where `radius = 20`. Say that I would like to add a **big dot** at the coordinates `(10,10)` on the above disc. My code is:               circ2 = Show[circ,      Epilog -> Inset[ListPlot[{10, 10}], PlotStyle -> PointSize[0.025]] ]      This however does not work. Can anyone suggest how to add a point on an already made graphic and **save the combined graphic as a single new object**? Thanks a lot...
