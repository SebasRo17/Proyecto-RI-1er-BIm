I am trying to highlight several subgraphs of a graph using the following command:                HighlightGraph[        GridGraph[{10, 10}], {{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,          2 \[UndirectedEdge] 12}, {4 \[UndirectedEdge] 5,           5 \[UndirectedEdge] 15}}, GraphHighlightStyle -> "Thick"]      It turns out that there is no action of `GraphHighlightStyle` on how my subgraphs look like. Compare with, e.g.,                   HighlightGraph[ GridGraph[{10, 10}],               {{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,2 \[UndirectedEdge] 12}},                  GraphHighlightStyle -> "Thick"]      So what has to be changed so that `GraphHighlightStyle` actually worked on multiple datasets in `HighlightGraph`?
