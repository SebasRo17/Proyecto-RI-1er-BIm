I am working on an asp.net MVC web application which contains several projects. One is BusinessObjects, which contains business logic / processes. Another is EmailGeneration which is used to send marketing campaign / customer emails. The EmailGeneration project references the BusinessObjects project because it need to generate templated emails based on Business Objects. I need to be able to trigger emails from business objects so that I can, say, automatically send an invoice when an order is completed. However, I can't add the reference as it would create a circular reference. This suggests that my design is flawed. How can I change my design to reduce coupling between the components?
