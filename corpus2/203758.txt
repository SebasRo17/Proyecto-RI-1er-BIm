I'm on my first real software project following the whole SDLC and am a bit confused. We have a requirement that states something like "The battery will be monitored each second" which needs to be verified. This is something that can't really be checked in the system since it happens "inside", i.e. there's no output that would show that the battery was checked each second. It is my understanding that at this phase the verification is done on a closed system, so you can't just use a debugger to verify something like this. Is this assumption wrong? Or can the requirement be considered to be ambiguously defined.
