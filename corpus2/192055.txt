The few LAMP web applications I have installed require me to create the necessary database tables myself, with a schema file, instead of doing it automatically with a script or setup page. Is this a normal and accepted practice? In my own hobby projects I find it much easier and hassle free to just create the tables in code. As the programmer I can make sure it's done correctly, and as the user I don't care - just make it work! However, I have very limited knowledge and experience in the world of web applications and database management, so I don't know the pros and cons of either approach. If I were to make my LAMP web applications available for download and installation by others, should I continue to do table creation in code or follow the example of the other applications I have installed, and just provide a schema file with installation instructions?
