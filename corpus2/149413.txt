I'm designing a system which listens to JSON RPC calls from clients, piles them up inside a list, and if the list gets full it will store them in a DB and keep receiving calls. My original plan is to listen to the RPC calls from Perl with the JSON-RPC and put them in an array. The clients do some long polling in another server to get responses as they appear.   * What is this blocking/non-blocking thing?    * Should I do a script for node.js to listen to the calls?    * What do you think is a good practice in this case?  The goal is to listen as much calls as possible.
