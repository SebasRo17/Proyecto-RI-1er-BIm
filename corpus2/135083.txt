I've read many comments about GUI programming, in both, C# and C++. And I noticed that Microsoft's .NET framework is powerful for GUI programming. So is it possible to use C++ and .NET framework? I think it will be a great combination since C++ is powerful language, and .NET framework is preferred for GUI programming on Windows, as I've read. Is it possible to write the GUI in C# and the functionality in C++?
