I have read the documentation, and know the way Initialization works with Manipulate, but I can't seem to understand why this piece of code               Manipulate[      Plot[h[x], {x, -3, 3}]      , {b, -5, 5}      , Initialization :> (h[x_] := x + b)]      produces a static graph. I know that if I change the function `h[x]` to `h[x_,b_]`, then the `Manipulate` gives a dynamic graph, but I would like the function `h` to have one parameter (instead of two), if possible. What am I missing here? Thanks, as always, for all help!
