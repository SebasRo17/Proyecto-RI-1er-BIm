If a software company loses the source code to one of the products they are selling, how serious would that be, in terms you could explain to a layman? Would the term "gross negligence" be too strong? Or "gross incompetence"? Obviously no one got killed but isn't it as serious as some financial negligence that people get jail time for? **EDIT:** Let's say it's not a case of a disk drive crashing, natural disaster or anything like that. Just they misplaced it.
