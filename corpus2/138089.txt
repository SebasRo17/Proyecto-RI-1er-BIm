I want to write my own compiler for my own language. Yes, it's going to be hard, and it will take long, but I think it will be worth it. I have looked into OSDev.org, and read about executable formats there, but they aren't much help. I am looking for information beyond what they have there. So, anything will help. Books, websites, PDFs, anything. I am looking into 32-bit, not 64- or 16-bit.
