I always wonder this, and perhaps I need a good history lesson on programming languages. But since most compilers nowadays are made in C, how were the very first compilers made (AKA before C) or were all the languages just interpreted? With that being said, I still don't understand how even the first assembly language was done, I understand what assembly language is but I don't see how they got the VERY first assembly language working (like, how did they make the first commands (like `mov R21`) or w/e set to the binary equivalent?
