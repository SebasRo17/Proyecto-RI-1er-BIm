I decided to give the `SocialMediaData` functionality of MMA10 a try but it does not seem to work for Twitter. The first time I call `SocialMediaData[]` I am correctly forwarded to the Twitter website where I can copy my authorization key, but then nothing happens. This is, for example, the output I get for               SocialMediaData["Twitter","FollowerNetwork"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/12iTQ.png) When I enter a wrong authorization key the authorization window keeps reappearing so apparently the key is correct. `SocialMediaData` for Facebook works like it should. **Question: what could be the reason that SocialMediaData does not give any output?**
