Our C++ MFC application gives the user the ability to define custom scripts in vbscript (via the VBScript engine). Since (parts of) the application are moving to .NET anyway, and since vbscript seems to be a legacy technology, we are thinking about adding a new scripting component where the user can add his scripts as VB.NET. Arguments for VB.NET are:   * Users already are "used to" the syntax   * Automatic conversion from vscript scripts to VB.NET scripts will be easier due to syntactic similarities What other arguments pro (or con) VB.NET as a in-application scripting language are there? Note that the users writing these scripts are _not_ programmers by trade, so any alternative has to take that into consideration.
