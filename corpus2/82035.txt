I am trying to choose the right license for a project that I would like to release as open-source later this year but I am unsure as to what the most appropriate license would be. I was originally thinking of the GPLv2 license, but I don't think that it is what I am after. I have been working on this project for over a year now (on and off) for my company. I figured that it would be great to give something back to the community and would like to release the project as open-source, but I want to retain full custody of the project. My company will be providing both free, commercial and community contributed content (perhaps with GitHub). Here is basically what I am after:   * Original source can be distributed and re-distributed (verbatim) both commercially and non-commercially as long as the original copyright information, website link and license is maintained.   * License of original source cannot be changed.   * Original source can be modified and distributed (commercially & non-commercially) for a specific application, but cannot be re-distributed without written consent from the original author (me). For example, a developer could change the source for their client, but they cannot redistribute that change. The developer may, however, choose to submit their modifications for integration into the original source.   * Themes and extensions must be covered by an open-source license. It must be possible for any developer to modify, distribute and re-distribute all themes and extensions (commercially & non-commercially) should they choose to do so. I am aware that it is unlikely that there is a license that will cover all of these points, but something along those lines would be fantastic. I have put a lot of hard work into this project and whilst I am happy to share it, I do not want to loose it to a big company who has loads of money to splash at it.
