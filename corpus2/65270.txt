I'm a software engineer with 5years of IT experience in a reputed (tier 1 indian MNC) service based software company in peoplesoft and informatica. But unfortunately i'm interested to switch to a programming career, esp. C. Can anyone please let me know what is a way to switch to a C programming career? Also, what are the pros and cons for such a switch?
