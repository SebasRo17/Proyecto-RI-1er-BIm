The mathematical problem is shown here. I tried to solve writing the               A0 = 2.0377638272727268`;     A1 = -7.105521894545453`;     A2 = 9.234000147272726`;     A3 = -5.302489919999999`;     A4 = 1.1362478399999998`;     h0 = 45.5;     \[Sigma]M = 0.00592251     \[Lambda]1 = 1.025;     \[Lambda]2 = 1.308;          f1[y_, x_] = A1 + 2 A2 y[x] + 3 A3 y[x]^2 + 4 A4 y[x]^3     b[y_, x_] = h0^2/12 (5 A1 + 8 A2 y[x] + 9 A3 y[x]^2 + 8 A4 y[x]^3)/y[x]^6     g[y_, x_] = -(h0^2/12) (A1 + 2 A2 y[x] + 3 A3 y[x]^2 + 4 A4 y[x]^3)/y[x]^5          Sys = First@NDSolve[{     f1[y, x] + b[y, x] y'[x]^2 + g y''[x] == \[Sigma]M,     y[0] == \[Lambda]1,     y[15] == \[Lambda]2     }, y, {x, 0, 15}]      When I evaluate this code, Mathematica answers with the following errors: > Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0.^6 encountered. >> Infinity::indet: > Indeterminate expression 0. ComplexInfinity encountered. >> > > Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0.^6 encountered. >> > > Infinity::indet: Indeterminate expression 0.

What am I doing something wrong?
