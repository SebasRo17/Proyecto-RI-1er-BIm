I currently don't have any qualifications in any form of web development (except an A-Level in ICT). I started working for a web development company 4 years ago and have finally been given the chance to go on courses. My manager doesn't have much of a technical knowledge, so has left it to me to decide whether the course he wants to put me on is worthwhile. From your experience, is the following course a worthwhile and credible course to take in helping improve my skills in ASP.NET/SQL? http://www.cvision.co.uk/realcbt/mcpd-asp-dot-net-35-csharp.htm Or, can you recommend similar alternatives?
