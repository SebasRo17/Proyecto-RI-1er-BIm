Are there any modern programming languages where you don't have to specify types for each parameter in a function's definition? Ex:               procedure P(a, b, c, d: integer)      vs               void P(int a, int b, int c, int d)      Is there a good reason why the latter form is so popular? Why don't more languages allow you to specify the type of all your parameters at once, like the first form?
