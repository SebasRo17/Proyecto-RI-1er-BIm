In Mathematica, it is possible to create a `Table` or `Grid` of `\\[Placeholder]` boxes. For example, I can make a 3-by-3 `Grid` of `\\[Placeholder]` boxes:               Grid[      Table[\[Placeholder], {3}, {3}],      Frame -> All, ItemSize -> Full]      > ![Grid](http://i.stack.imgur.com/638FP.png) Then, I can click on one of the placeholders (for example, the top left-hand placeholder) to change focus to it: > ![GridFocus](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HgSKc.png) Once focus is on one of the placeholders, I can use the arrow keys on the keyboard or the `Tab` key to change the focus to one of the other placeholders (at least in Windows XP; I have not tested this on later versions of Windows or Mac or Linux). Using the `Tab` key is particularly handy, because it cycles through the placeholders in the "canonical" order (i.e., cells **{1,1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,1}, {2,2}, {2,3}, {3,1}, {3,2}, {3,3}** where the elements are **{row index, column index}** ): ![GridTab](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ImAE.png) But, it can somewhat of a chore to cycle through the placeholders using `Tab`, especially for large _n_ -by- _n_ grids. My question is, **is it possible to interactively change focus in a grid _using the keyboard_?** For example, suppose that I label the rows with letters and the columns with numbers:               TableForm[      Table[\[Placeholder], {3}, {3}],      TableHeadings -> {{"a", "b", "c"}, {"1", "2", "3"}}]      > ![GridLabeled](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HmwP.png) Is there any way to write a function in which I could type **"b2"** , for example, using the keyboard and have Mathematica automatically change focus to the placeholder at **coordinate b2** , like the following? > ![GridLabeledFocus](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZWzx.png) With the focus now at **"b2"** , I can mark this coordinate it in some way, perhaps by typing an **"x"** : > ![GridLabeledFocusMarked](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5NhrG.png) Remember the board game _Battleship_? It is basically a game of placing **"x"** at "hit" coordinates (and placing nothing at "miss" coordinates): ![BoardGame](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iNYgL.png) I would like to use Mathematica to specify and mark coordinates in a grid _interactively, using the keyboard._ It doesn't matter _how_ the coordinates are marked. In other words, I don't necessarily need the script to change `\\[Placeholder]` focus in a `Grid`; I just need to be able to specify coordinates such as **"b2"** interactively (i.e., in real time, not from a list of predefined coordinates) and be able to mark those coordinates in some way. So, in this sense, it doesn't necessarily need to be a `Grid` of `\\[Placeholder]`s. It could be a `Grid` of `Checkbox`es. It could be a `Grid` of `Rectangle`s that change color when specified using the keyboard. In other words, **the important feature I am looking for is to use the keyboard to specify coordinates** , not mouse clicks. Do you have any initial thoughts of how I can accomplish this? Do I need to use `Input` or `InputField`, or are there other ways to get keyboard input from the user? Thanks so much for your time and help.
