Can someone help me to find a easy way to parse XML? I have an iOS 7 Application using Google Map API. I tried to learn this on my own. I try to create an application that uses Web Services like Google Map. These web services use HTTP requests to specific URLs, passing URL parameters as arguments to the services. Generally, these services return data in the HTTP request as either JSON or XML for parsing and/or processing by my application. I would appreciate it.
