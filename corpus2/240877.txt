Coming from Java, I've never used a language with dynamic typing. I'm very used to the static-typing way of thinking. My question is, how much does the use of dynamic typing as opposed to static typing influence the overall design of programs written using languages with that kind of typing? **Does the kind of typing (static/dynamic) influence the design of programs significantly?** Working with a dynamically-typed language, would you structure your application differently than working with a statically-typed language? **Or is it merely a language characteristic that affects mainly local implementation details, but doesn't affect overall designs?**
