I've been reading the book "SQL and Relational Theory: How to Write Accurate SQL Code" by C. J. Date. I have no formal background in CS, much less relational theory. Combined with the fact English is not my first language, I'm having a little trouble to understand a statement. At one moment (page 17) the author states: > ... the number of attributes in the heading is the degree (sometimes the > arity) ... Does this means that the concept "degree" is equals with the concept "arity" (ie. I can use those words interchangeably) or this means that sometimes those concepts are equals (but not always)?
