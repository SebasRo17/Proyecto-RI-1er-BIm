I was trying to use strings as tags for Reap/Sow and I've found out the following strange behavior when I also add a function as the third argument of Reap[]:               Reap[Sow[11, "a"]; Sow[21, "b"]; Sow[12, "c"]; Sow[15, "a"], {"a", "b", "c"}]          (* {15, {{{11, 15}}, {{21}}, {{12}}}} *)          Reap[Sow[11, "a"]; Sow[21, "b"]; Sow[12, "c"]; Sow[15, "a"], {"a", "b", "c"}, Max]          (* {15, {{Max[15, "a"]}, {Max[21, "b"]}, {Max[12, "c"]}}} *)      Whereas when I use numeric tags I get the following, expected, result:               Reap[Sow[11, 1]; Sow[21, 2]; Sow[12, 3]; Sow[15, 1], {1, 2, 3}, Max]     (* {15, {{15}, {21}, {12}}} *)      Why do string-tags seem not to work properly as "tags"? And more in general, do you know what kind of structures can be used as tags?
