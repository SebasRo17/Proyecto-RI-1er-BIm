I have to generate an interface to Mathematica for a fairly large library. I would like to use LibraryLink, as the generation seems much simpler. The platform is Windows (VS 2012), and I am wondering what the constraints are with regards to compiler options, etc. First and foremost: can I compile in 32 bit mode, or does it have to be 64 bits? (The CygWin toolkit `file` tells me that `MathKernel.exe` is a PE32+ executeable, whatever that is, and that the architecture is x86-64, which is 64 bits.) Would there be any library incompatibilities when compiling with VS2012 (VC11)? And are there any options I must respect?
