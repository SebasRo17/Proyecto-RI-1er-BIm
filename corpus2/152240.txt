Being a completely self taught programmer, I would like it if I could better myself by self-learning the computer science course taught to a typical CS grad. Finding different resources on internet has been easy, there is of course **MIT open course ware** , and there are Coursera courses from Stanford and other universities. There are numerous other open resources scattered around the Internet and some good books that are repeatedly recommended. I have been learning a lot, but my study is heavily fragmented, which really bugs me. I would love If somewhere, I could find a path I should follow and a stack I should limit myself to, so that I can be sure about what **_essential_** parts of computer science I have studied, and then systematically approach those I haven't. The problem with Wikipedia is it doesn't tell you what's essential but insists on being a complete reference. **MIT open course ware** for Computer science and Electrical Engg. has a huge list of courses also not telling you what courses are essential and what optional as per person's interest/requirement. I found no mention of an order in which one should study different subjects. What I would love is to create a list that I can follow, like this dummy one               SUBJECTS                                                        DONE          Introduction to Computer Science                                  *     Introduction to Algorithms                                        *     Discrete Mathematics                        Adv. Discrete Mathematics     Data structures                                                   *     Adv. Algorithms     ...      As you can clearly see, I have little idea of what specific subjects computer science consists of. It would be hugely helpful, even if someone pointed out essential courses from MIT Course ware ( + essential subjects not present at MIT OCW) in a recommended order of study. I'll list the Posts I already went through (and I didn't get what I was looking for there) Computer science curriculum for non-CS major? \- top answer says it isn't worth studying cse How can a self-taught programmer learn more about Computer Science? \- points to MIT OCW Studying computer science - what am I getting myself into?
