This is a tiny project of about 2000LOC. It is being compiled with `-Wall`. Now, I tried adding `-Wextra`. Two things happened:   * Some minor but valid warnings popped up, e.g. Comparing signed with unsigned   * Some minor but false warnings popped up, e.g. Unused function parameter. Those functions implement agreed-upon prototypes. But the extra parameters are really not needed for now. However the unfixable warnings pollute the build log and could hide a much more dangerous warning. _Should the -Wextra be retained or removed? How can a compromise be made for the most robust code development in the future?_
