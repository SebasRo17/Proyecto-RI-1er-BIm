**NB** : By _higher-genus surface_ , I mean a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2. This question has come up before on math.SE, and even MathOverflow, but most posters suggested using either Blender or Inkscape. However, I would like to draw these higher-genus surfaces in Mathematica, because I am trying to create a Manipulate which takes as input a word in the fundamental group of such a surface, and outputs the corresponding geodesic, drawn on the surface. So, for example, let's say I am trying to draw a genus 2 surface. What I am doing now is the following:               torus = ParametricPlot3D[{(2 + Cos[s]) Cos[t], (2 + Cos[s]) Sin[t],      Sin[s]}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}, {s, 0, 2 Pi}, Mesh -> None, Axes -> False,      Boxed -> False, PlotStyle -> Opacity[.3],      RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z, u, v}, x < 2]];     antitorus =      Graphics3D[     Translate[     GeometricTransformation[torus[[1]],      ReflectionTransform[{1, 0, 0}, {2, 0, 0}]], {1, 0, 0}],      Boxed -> False, Axes -> False];     bound = ParametricPlot3D[{{t, (2 + Cos[s]) Sqrt[       1 - 4/((2 + Cos[s])^2)],      Sin[s]}, {t, -(2 + Cos[s]) Sqrt[1 - 4/((2 + Cos[s])^2)],      Sin[s]}}, {s, 0, 2 Pi}, {t, 2, 3}, PlotStyle -> {Opacity[.7]},      Axes -> False, Boxed -> False, Mesh -> None, PlotPoints -> 100];     Show[antitorus,torus,bound,Lighting->"Neutral"]      This gives me this (not-so-bad!) picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kaYtA.png) I am wondering what other methods there are for creating these surfaces, perhaps with a smoother finished product than the one I currently have. And of course, ideally, I would eventually draw the two "building blocks" of all such surfaces, the once- and twice-punctured tori. Then I could dynamically build these surfaces on the fly...
