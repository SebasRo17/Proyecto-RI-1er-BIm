In a conversation earlier this week I was discussing certain language features, and I realized I don't have a good word / phrase to describe a particular feature. Some languages, such as PHP, have a language construct which allows `break` and `continue` statements to accept a numeric parameter indicating which block should be affected. For example:               for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++)         for ($j = 10; $j > 0; $j--)             if ($j == $i)                  break 2;     echo $i;      Because `break 2;` causes the outer loop to break, the output is `1`. If this were `break 1;` or just `break;` the output would be `10`. C# does not have any such construct. The equivalent would something like this:               for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {         bool broken = false;         for (j = 10; j > 0; j--) {             if (j == i) {                 broken = true;                 break;             }         }         if (broken)             break;     }     Console.WriteLine(i);      But of course, this could also be accomplished using a `goto`. So my question is, what do you call this? Is there a specific name for this "break _n_ " construct? I'd like to be able to say " _Language X has parametric break and continue statements_ ", or something like that.
