There is no Circle or Disk object in 3D. I quickly found a way to use Cylinder (thin lines, no faces, very flat):               Module[{s},     Graphics3D[{EdgeForm[Thickness[Small]], FaceForm[None],        Cylinder[{s = {1/2, 1/2, 1/2}, s + {0, 1/1000, -2/1000}}, 1/2]},        Axes -> True, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"},        PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}, {0, 1}}]]      ![3D circle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cWkT1.png) But   * orientation of the cylinder is tricky,    * choice of coordinate shift is dependent on graphics size and magnification. I have to take into account the parameters of relative thickness,   * it requires me to make a few auxiliary functions (without speaking for instance if I want to define a circle by center, radius and angles to the axis, or by three points)    * I cannot only draw an arc between 2 angle positions nor make it elliptical.  If I want all this, am I forced to recreate the wheel and construct computationally a 3D polygon approximating an ellipse ?
