I wondered if there was a way to automate the process of finding a way to tile a tile into a square. The idea is to represent the tile with a matrix of $0$s for blank space and $1$s for filled spaces like in $\\{\\{0,1,1\\}, \\{1,0,0\\}\\}$. ![The tile.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0k8C4.png) The square (or a general rectangular area) is represented by an array as well. The function should then have as arguments two lists (representing the tile and the area) and should find the ways (if they exist) to do the tiling. This is quite an hard problem for me, I have tried playing with `Plus`, so that if the result matrix has $2$ it means that the tile overlaps while if it is $0$ there is a gap but I can't find a way to tell _Mathematica_ that they should fit the area.
