I've got this CSV file I've imported that has tens of millions of lines in it. It takes around 20 minutes to import. I've been working with it for a while and have the processed data spread out in a bunch of variables. Now Windows is bugging me that I need to restart the computer. I thought about gathering all the data up in a table and then export and import it, but that would be a lot of hassle and take ages. I also thought about just saving the notebook and re-evaluate it, but with this amount of data that will also take a long time. I wonder what is the best way to save all the data so that I can get it back after having restarted the computer? Something fast and with minimum of hassle would be great. PS. I have no idea how to tag this thing. There is apparently no big-data tag.
