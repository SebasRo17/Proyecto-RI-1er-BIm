I am tired of hearing people recommend that you should use only one thread per processor, while many programs use up to 100 per process! take for example some common programs               vb.net ide uses about 25 thread when not debugging     System uses about 100     chrome uses about 19     Avira uses more than about 50      Any time I post a thread related question, I am reminded almost every time that I should not use more that one thread per processor, and all the programs I mention above are ruining on my system with a single processor. What constitutes proper use of threads in programming? Please make general comment, but I'd prefer .NET framework thanks
