I can't seem to be able to compute the inverse Laplace transform of a Laplace transform:               LaplaceTransform[x *  Sqrt[l^2 - x^2], x, s]          Out[27]= -(1/(32 π))      Sqrt[-(1/l^2)] l^4 (l^2)^(3/2)        s^3 MeijerG[{{-(3/2)}, {}}, {{-3, -(3/2), -1}, {}}, -(1/16)           l^4 s^4 Sign[Im[Log[-(1/l^2)]]], 2] Sign[Im[Log[-(1/l^2)]]]      But if I try to do the reverse:               InverseLaplaceTransform[-(1/(32 π)) Sqrt[-(1/l^2)]        l^4 (l^2)^(3/2)        s^3 MeijerG[{{-(3/2)}, {}}, {{-3, -(3/2), -1}, {}}, -(1/16)           l^4 s^4 Sign[Im[Log[-(1/l^2)]]], 2] Sign[        Im[Log[-(1/l^2)]]], s, x]          Out[29]= -(1/(32 π))      Sqrt[-(1/l^2)] l^4 (l^2)^(3/2)        InverseLaplaceTransform[        s^3 MeijerG[{{-(3/2)}, {}}, {{-3, -(3/2), -1}, {}}, -(1/16)             l^4 s^4 Sign[Im[Log[-(1/l^2)]]], 2], s, x] Sign[        Im[Log[-(1/l^2)]]]      Shouldn't this evaluate to the original? As to why I'd want to do this: I am trying to solve an equation using Laplace transforms.
