In one of my projects, I have data for hotels, and other booking sites are able to book this hotel. For example: Hotel A - Booking (ID = 4002), Expedia (ID = 123), Priceline (ID = 147) The three booking engines each uses their own Id to reference to Hotel A. I would need to check manually and make the right reference to the hotel. If I have 100,000 hotels, I have to check manually 300,000 (considering 3 booking sites) times? They might provide API, then I can cross check the name, address or latitude/longitude, but if they differ a little bit then I might give the wrong reference to the wrong hotel. I'm sure there are better ways to do this. There are many travel sites out there which do hotel price checking on many booking sites, but how do they do to make sure they are checking the right hotel on these booking sites? Anyone has any experience on this?
