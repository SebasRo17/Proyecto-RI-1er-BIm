To better understand my question, let me elaborate the background of the subject matter. I work in a financial institution where the business module (credit finance) is constantly changing. In the IT world, however, the developers have a 6 week cycle taking list of projects/enhancements, put it in a timeline and business expect delivery on those projects. During each cycle, each developer gets assigned work that needs to be completed by a certain date. That date is already finalized by IT Change Managers and codes must be done by then. The code will then be synced, built to create a package and deployed to the test environment for QC (Quality Centre) team to test. The problem, however, is that developers get given the code 3 weeks before the code cycle ends. We are then told to do a technical specification and work estimation for each project/enhancements/bug fixes we are going to do. I have constantly talked to my managers that that is a backward mentality having to do estimations knowing when we need to deliver the finished code. My challenge: Is there a better estimation/technical specification model that cater for this kind of environment? If not, how can I tackle this issue such that it doesn't conflict with the deadline. Thanks. PS: I totally disagree in providing a business requirement to developers and expecting them to do a technical specification document as well as estimations during a code cycle. I do believe that technical specification document should be done before-hand and completed as well with functional/non-functional document and signed off by business. This is not happening currently.
