I had a few days ago. I was having trouble with threads. Had lots of questions asked on StackOverflow and honestly for the first time I did not get the answer I was looking for. Finally, I decided to do a huge re-design of my system code and magically within a few hours I found a solution. So my question is, is it normal to often do a re-design if I get stuck with a problem or should I push on hard till I find a solution? Mind you this is the first time I was stuck for this long on a piece of code.
