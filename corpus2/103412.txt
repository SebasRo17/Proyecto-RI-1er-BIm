I'm updating my CV and I'm wondering what category is the best to place WPF under. Since I wouldn't really recognize it as a programming language like C# or such. The general description is: > The Windows Presentation Foundation (or WPF) is a computer-software > graphical subsystem for rendering user interfaces in Windows-based > applications. Hopefully this is the right place to ask. Thank you in advance.
