I am looking for a Beeswarm plot implementation in Mathematica. Consider the following data:               data = {RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], 100], RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], 100]};      Let’s visualize the data as a simple 1D scatter plot:               disperse = 0.1     ListPlot[MapIndexed[{#2[[1]] +       RandomReal[{-disperse, disperse}], #1} &, data, {2}],       PlotStyle -> {Red, Green, Blue}, PlotMarkers -> {"\[CircleDot]"},       Axes -> None]      We get the following 1D scatter plots (sometimes known as “Stripcharts”). In this example the vertical coordinate of points corresponds to `data` while the horizontal one is random. ![1-D Scatterplot or Stripchart](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wlXTi.png) Sometimes it would make sense to look at the distribution of the data in addition to the data points i.e. look at all of the data points in individually in a non-overlapping manner. A Beeswarm plot does exactly this. For instance, the data in a stripchart could be re-arranged in a pleasing manner so that one would be able to understand the underlying data without resorting to statistical analysis. For instance, the figure below demonstrates some sample **Beeswarm** plots. ![Sample Beeswarm plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uNLBy.png) Another property of a beeswarm plot is that individual data points can be colored individually allowing for the user to understand further delineation of data. The plot below shows an example of a beeswarm plot where subsets of data are colored differently. ![Beeswarm plot with individually colored markers](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Qr5r.png) I would like to put it up to the Mathematica gurus to advise on the best manner to generate such charts. Sample working code, of course, would be great!
