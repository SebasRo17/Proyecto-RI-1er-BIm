If I am sole developer (I do not work in a team) working from my laptop (Windows OS and Linux VM) and backing up data to the cloud (Dropbox etc), then is git still better than svn for my version control needs? I was thinking not since I wont need any of git's distributed features. But is git such a better approach to version control that I should consider moving anyway? With so many articles saying how people are moving from svn to git? I was wondering, if they are talking about large or open projects with teams of developers vs the sole developer. What do you think?
