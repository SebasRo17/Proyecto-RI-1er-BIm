I am trying to solve a system of equations which is dependent to an parameter `alpha`. So I iterate over `alpha` via a `Table` call and try to back substitute the solution found in iteration `i` into the `FindRoot` call. My example leads to an infinite recursion.               sols = {x -> 0, y -> 0}     Table[ {sol = FindRoot[{alpha x == 0, y x = 3 }, sol[[1, 2]], {alpha, 1, 10}]      Heikeâ€™s suggestion works perfectly for one parameter. I tried to extend this for two parameters, but I failed.               sols = {x -> 0, y -> 0}     eqns := {alpha x == 0, y x = 3}     Table[sol = FindRoot[eqns, {x, sol[[1, 2]], y, sol[[3, 4]]}], {alpha, 1, 10}]      how can I access the solution of `y` correctly?
