I need an expression for the real 7/3 power of a real-valued function, i.e., a reformulation of               f[x_] := g[x]^(7/3)      that works for negative values of `g[x]`. This function and its first and second derivatives are used in heavy computation (i.e. in objectives to `FindMinimum`) and need to be well-defined at all values of `x`. In particular, I've tried the following, which don't work:               f[x_] := g[x]^(7/3)      which gives complex values at negative values of `g[x]`, and               f[x_] := Surd[g[x],3]^7      which gives a "Infinite expression" error when its derivative is evaluated at 0.
