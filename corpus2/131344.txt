I have a website developed in ASP.NET MVC. Now, I am looking forward to getting up a mobile interface for it. My knowledge in this regard isn't that great, so I will explain what is needed to be done. It's much like on the lines of StackOverflow or Programmers and following are the few points that need to be addressed.   1. Much like Stack Overflow, if a site is visited from mobile, auto-detection should happen and the mobile version should be displayed.    2. Do I need to setup some sub-domain like `m.mysite.com` and should I have the mobile site installed for this domain (SE sites don't do this now but Facebook does that)   3. Lastly, How to design the website that is easily readable on all sized of screens for mobile.
