I am currently doing an internship in a large corporation and they are undergoing many changes in software delivery structure (moving to Agile). In the past couple of months I have noticed this religious attachment to `Clean Code` practices and the book being like a bible for the developers. Now, one of the most important features of the clean code is self-explanatory code which is based on understandable naming and rigorous re-factoring. This is followed by `no commenting` rule. I understand that this clean code is a long term investment which will ease following code maintenance and improvement, but... is this really worth all this fuss? Would anyone share their experience on Clean Code and any opinion whether I am just too conservative or it is just a temporary trend.
