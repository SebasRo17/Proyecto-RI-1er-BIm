As a backend and a frontend developer I see the process from start to finish, first by creating the logic, displaying the correct data on a web page and then using frontend skills to make this look awesome. My question is, do pure backend developers care what their code ends up looking like in the frontend? As far as the user is concerned, they will ONLY see design/frontend. They don't actually care that your code is clean, DRY and maintainable. As long as it doesn't disrupt their payment process or flight booking they do not care. Does this affect the average backend developer?
