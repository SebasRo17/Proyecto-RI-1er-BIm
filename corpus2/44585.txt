In the following simple example               MyMod := Module[{i},       Do[         Return[1],         {i, 3}       ];       Print["test"]     ]      I expected the module to exit on `Return` and never reach the `Print`, instead I have               In[1]:= a = MyMod            test      I am sure I always used the former expected logic in the past.   I lost my memory or is it changed something in the way `Return` works?
