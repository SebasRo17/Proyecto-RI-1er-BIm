Suppose you want to create a web page with some search capabilities over a database. Search has to be restricted both on some categorization of data and open text given by the users. Functional and non-functional requirements pose this constraints:   * Search has to be fast   * Data representation paradigm (i.e. Relational, Object-Relational, Semistructured...) should support big modifications on every stage of software lifetime.   * Database's paradigm should permit easy refactoring for existing client code Having this into account   1. Would you recommend a relational database? How would you tackle the constraints in this scenario?   2. Would you recommend a XML database? How would you tackle the constraints in this scenario?   3. If you think above solutions to be not useful in the light of this problem... what could be a useful approach? Please give some bibliography (or some websites) supporting your answers. thanks!
