I have table:               t = {False, False, False, a <= 456, a <=567, a<= 897}      I want to delete all values which are 'False' and make my table to looks like:               t = {a <= 456, a <=567, a<= 897}      I was tried to make a commend like above:               For[i=1,i< Length[tt], i++, If[tt[[i]]==False, Delete[tt,i], Print[no]]]      But it didn't work. I don't want to delete each 'False' value separately, because I have many tables, and each has a different number of `False` values. How can I improve that?
