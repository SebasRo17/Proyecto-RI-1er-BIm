I need to expose an Array[][] to many different clients (iPhone, Android, PC, Unix, etc), and need to make it available over HTTP/s This brings me to JSON, and makes me wonder how do all the other *endian machines work with JSON and will I need to worry about how the array will be reconstructed on other platforms. Initially this will be an array of UTF8 strings, but I want to support other types, for example, Array[0][] will be a image, while Array[1][] will be a audio file. ...etc. If JSON is the right way to send Array[][] data across HTTP, what "gotchas" should I be concerned about?
