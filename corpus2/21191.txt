In the theory of cumulants of vector-valued random variables, the following types of formulas appear: \begin{equation} \theta^i \theta^{jk} [3] = \theta^i \theta^{jk} + \theta^j \theta^{ik} + \theta^k \theta^{ij} \end{equation} This is supposed to mean as follows: sum over all possible permutations (in this case 3) of the indices. The indices of a given theta are symmetric and need not be counted twice. Another example would be $\theta^i \theta^j \theta^{kl}$ [6]. In this case there is a total of 6 terms: $i\;|\;j\;|\;kl$ $i\;|\;k\;|\;jl$ $i\;|\;l\;|\;jk$ $j\;|\;k\;|\;il$ $j\;|\;l\;|\;ik$ $k\;|\;l\;|\;ij$ Going to even higher order, $\theta^{ij} \theta^{kl} \theta^{mn}$ [15] has 15 terms, and etc. I am unaware of any closed expressions for the number of terms. Thus, I was trying to use Mathematica to numerically compute all terms involved in a given permutation. However, so far I have been entirely unsuccessful. Any ideas? Here are some (failed) attempts, made with 4 indices and the combination $\theta^i \theta^j \theta^{kl}$. This lists all permutations of four terms.               perm = Permutations[{a, b, c, d}]      I can use Mr. Wizard's dynP to partition in the size I want. For instance,               dynP[{a,b,c,d},{1,1,2}]     {{a},{b},{c,d}}      So, an alternative, would be to do this for all members of perm, and then eliminate duplicates according to the above-specified criteria. This, however, I failed to do. I appreciate any help in advance. Best regards, Gabriel
