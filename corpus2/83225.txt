Many times I forget things about my application. I don't memorize the table names or what a query did and I search to get what I want. My team leader told me I'm supposed to memorize the table names that I use. Is the developer required to `memorize` the table names in the database, the classes names...etc? And if the answer is "Yes, all the time," what should I do to remember those things?
