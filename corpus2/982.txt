_Especially: How to find the piece of code responsible for a missing parenthesis problem caused by a misplaced_ `SuperScriptBox`    For last 30 minutes (and I was lucky today, sometimes I spend 5 times as much time) I have been removing code little by little from my large one cell, (have to be one cell, it is `Manipulate` demo stylesheet) in order to find where the syntax error is (since _Mathematica_ , with all its might and power, can't tell the user which line number the syntax error is located at). Each time I see the red line show up on the right side of the notebook, indicating a syntax error, I know that I will now waste another hour at least looking for the syntax error. Why is it that hard for _Mathematica_ to tell the user where the syntax error is? I zoomed down to this little 5 character code, and I copy it to new notebook to examine it: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w6Opn.png) So, there is a hidden bad character there. Sometimes, with my big fingers and my small keyboard (can't find big keyboards any more, everything is so tiny), I must have hit wrong key combination, which must have injected some bad character to the notebook, and this happens. I will keep this cell on its own in order to find what the problem is. I tried to select the cell, and do convert to input form, but nothing happened. no output came of it. Then I did `cell->ShowExpression`, and this came up               Cell[BoxData[      RowBox[{"(",        RowBox[{"k", "h"}],        SuperscriptBox[")", "2"]}]], "Input",      CellChangeTimes->{3.536893041212217*^9},      EmphasizeSyntaxErrors->True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N8h1r.png) So, what does all this mean? Do you see from the above what is the problem? I think I entered the superscript as I always do, using `Ctrl+^` then `2`. I think the notebook interface is powerful and allows many things not possible otherwise, but because of problems such the above, I wish sometimes I am using plain text editor like emacs, where I can see what I have and not worry about hidden things I do not see, but I tried that once, and it is not practical overall setup to work with. Btw, originally, I had lots of code like the above inside strings, i.e. inside `" "` for formatting, and now I am removing all the strings to do some other way of formatting. I do not know if this has anything to do with it. But as you can see, now there is no string around the expression. Here is a screen shot of the earlier version of the notebook, from the same location of the code, showing how the above was inside a string, and I simply was removing the outside string quotes, that is all: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fufj0.png)
