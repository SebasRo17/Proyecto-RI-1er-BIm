I've been using a single scheduler to handle all my scheduled tasks (Quartz.Net). I'm starting to rethink how this operates because if I need to update 1 task, I have to stop the entire process, release the update, and start it back up. My Question: Is it better to have many Windows Services running individual tasks (or groups of similar tasks) or 1 Service running all of the tasks (my current set up)?
