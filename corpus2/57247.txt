The following code generates the familiar 3D-plot:                   Manipulate[      Plot3D[Sin[x a] - Cos[y ], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10},        ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap"], {a, -2, 2, 0.1}]      However approximately 4 minutes after pressing the play-button, Mathematica 10.0.0 crashes. I noticed the memory usage increased to about 3GB and then crashed. (I run on a MacBook Pro 2.6 GHz, 16 GB) Can anyone replicate this problem ?
