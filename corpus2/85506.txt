I'm a self-taught programmer. I am honestly not good in math. What advice you can give to improve my Mathematical skills so that I will not be so insecure around my fellow programmers? What are the steps or guidelines that you can recommend to improve my mathematical skills? Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information on mathematics for programmers? What about that book makes it special?
