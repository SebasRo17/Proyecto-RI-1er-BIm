What I'd like to do is to have the same label more than once in the plot. I.e. I do not want the edges to direct toward the first instance of that label! For example:               LayeredGraphPlot[{1 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 3, 1 -> 4, 2 -> 4, 3 -> 2}, VertexLabeling -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GxgdN.jpg) I want 3 -> 2 (a new 2)! How can this be achieved?
