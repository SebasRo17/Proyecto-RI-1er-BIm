I have made various `Grid`-s and arranged them column-wise in another `Grid`. All `Grids` are working fine and I exported that final `Grid` into PDF format. The entire `Grid` appeared in a single page after exporting, but I want to `Export` some `Grid`-s to one page and remaining ``Grid`-s to another page. I tried the following code but it doesn't work:               grid1 = Grid[{{Style["Life Alerts", Bold, 20], SpanFromLeft,       SpanFromLeft}, {Style["Alert", Bold, 15], Style["<>", Bold, 15],       Style["%Life", Bold, 15],       Style["OnDay", Bold, 15]}, {Style["L1", Bold, 15],       Style["<", Bold, 15], Style["90", Bold, 15],       Style["0.35", Bold, 15]}, {Style["L2", Bold, 15],       Style[">", Bold, 15], Style["90", Bold, 15],       Style["0.35", Bold, 15]}, {Style["L3", Bold, 15],       Style[">", Bold, 15], Style["90", Bold, 15],       Style["0.35", Bold, 15]}}, Alignment -> {{Left}, Center},        Background -> {None, {Yellow}}, Frame -> True,        FrameStyle -> Directive[Thickness[4], Black], Spacings -> {1, 1},          Dividers -> {{}, {True, True, True}}];      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/co1BZ.png)                 (*Exporting code*)       Export[SystemDialogInput["FileSave",".Pdf"], (Grid[{{grid1}, {grid1}}])]      Can anybody help me?
