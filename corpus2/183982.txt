Some people run the bleeding edge of technologies - updating the day that something is updated. In production, this isn't as appropriate. Researching about if the current (Java 7) version is ready for production produces a significant amount of old material that might not be correct anymore (at the time of this writing Java 7 has been out for a year and a half which seems plenty long). What considerations do I need to make to determine if it is appropriate to upgrade the production environment to a later version of Java?
