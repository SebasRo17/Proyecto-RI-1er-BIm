I want to know whether saving row count in a table is better than counting it each time of the proccess. Quick Example : A visitor goes to Group Clan, the page displays clan information and Members who have joined the group,Should the page look for all the users who joined the clan and count them, or just display the number of members already saved in table ? I think the first one is not possible to get manipulated with but IT MIGHT cost performance Your Ideas ?
