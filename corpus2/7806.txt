And by that I mean any piece of code, or an idea/algorithm presented in pseudo code, something which is very important and is almost art now. I intend to put up a few paintings and work on paper around my office which depict engineering, rather celebrate engineering. I want them to be not so commonplace like e=mc2 or anything too geeky, like 42. They be special, they be important and have earned the position of being almost sacred owing to their contribution to their field. So I want a representation of computer programing as well. Thanks for your time. EDIT:After seeing a few initial responses I would like to mention that I am not looking for things which go on a t-shirt or mug, but huge framing on a wall. So anything funny/wicked/clever is not only not suitable, but I want it to be inspiring/celebrating. Not to say that I don't love the funny, but this time I want to focus on things serious.
