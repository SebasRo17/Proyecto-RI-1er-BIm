When I use the following system               model = {x'[t] == x[t] (1 - x[t]) - x[t] y[t], y'[t] == x[t] y[t] - y[t], x[0] == 0.5, y[0] == 0.5}      with the `WhenEvent`               perturb = WhenEvent[Mod[t, 1],         {x[t] -> x[t], y[t] -> y[t]}     ];      chosen to be trivial, I have what seems to be strange behavior to me, namely if I do the following integration               NDSolve[{model, perturb}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 10000}]      I get an error that the integration reached maximum steps at `t==8670.`, even though nothing is changing. If I increase the `MaxSteps` I can get it to integrate. So my question is if this is expected? The longer you integrate a system when using a `WhenEvent` the larger the `MaxSteps` you will need? I can replicate this same behavior when I use initial conditions that are on a stable equilibrium value ... so truly nothing is changing.
