The answers to this question might be different than the generic, "I graduated. Duh, now what should I do?" Living in an area with a low population presents limited opportunities compared to those in more urban or suburban communities. On the other hand...maybe the answers will be largely the same. I'm asking you folks who might be looking at this from a perspective of more years on the inside for your wisdom. I have just finished a CS degree. I am about 40 (does it matter much?). I left a successful, professional career in the laboratory robotics industry because it required me to either move to a big city or continue to travel extensively. In a few years we could potentially move somewhere else or I could start travelling again but I need to start working now. I need to make myself as employable as possible. There are few jobs available in my area for computer professionals. Of those few, the majority seem to be IT related more than software development related -- SharePoint, ERP, network security, web services, etc.. Might I be well served by trying to pick up some IT knowledge? Or should I continue to work on my software development chops? I have my own project now that I am proud of and excited about and could happily continue to extend it. It is a good vehicle for learning new stuff until (and hopefully after) I find employment. I'm hoping to get some others involved in it as well. Or I could start a new project that would be a vehicle for learning something marketable -- from .net to being able to support all that legacy COBOL there seems like a lot of stuff out there. Thanks for whatever insight anyone shares.
