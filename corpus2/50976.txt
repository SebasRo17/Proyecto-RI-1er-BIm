This question actually doesn't have quite a lot to do with the `Series` function, but I don't know how to describe my problem. So here's the thing. I'm trying to plot function `f[x]` and its Maclaurin expansion together               ff[n_,x_] := Normal@Series[f[x],{x,0,n}]      But when I feed `ff` with an `x`, Mathematica always substitute the `x` in the expression with its actual value, which is not how `Series` works. So how could I hold the numerical value of `x` until `Series` finishes its calculation? This problem always happens to me, though in different contexts, and I used to find ways around it, but this time I want to solve it in the correct way.
