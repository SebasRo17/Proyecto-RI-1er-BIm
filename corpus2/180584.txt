Lets say that I have hundreds/thousands of objects(entries) in a database and each object contains 10 attributes. I have a way to quantitatively measure each attribute where a higher number implies that the object is better in that area. I also have a final price associated with that object. Is there any way to programatically (through maybe an algorithm) determine an approximation of how much each attribute contributes to the total cost? In essence, I want to be able to estimate the average total cost = a*attribute1+b*attribute2+.....+j*attribute10 by solving for a,b,...,j I realize that this might be more of a statistics question than a programming question, but I am more interested in the implementation of this through programming than a fully statistics explanation. Is this something more suited for scipy? numpy? some statistics framework?
