I normally add lots of sanity check clauses in my code. In other words, lots of assertions where the code is instructed to "panic" (usually print as much information as possible when a certain condition doesn't hold and then exit). The point is, many of these sanity checks are obviously redundant one way or the other. On the other hand I've often been bitten by situations were I didn't add a sanity check judging it to be fairly obvious that it can't fail and was proven wrong. So the question is: are there any guidelines / best- practices to decide how much sanity checking is reasonable? Too much sanity checking obviously clutters the code and is a pain to maintain when assumptions change.
