I have a question about adjusting the number of horizontal tick marks on a 2D plot. Example: f[x_] := 4*Sin[4*x] Plot[{f[x]}, {x, -10, 10}, Ticks -> {Table[Pi n, {n, -5, 5}]}] Gives the following plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MTjQV.jpg) How would I go about adding more ticks so I could change the range (in terms of pi) to fractional values of pi? Say -pi/10 to pi/10 or...in increments of pi/2....or pi/4? The "Plot" command I am using is one I found from the _help_ because I couldn't figure out how to make the ticks in terms of pi. I'm still learning some of the basics, but I'm quite stuck on changing the # of ticks. Anyone have some ideas please? Thanks
