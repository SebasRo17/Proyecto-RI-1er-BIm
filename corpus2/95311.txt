So after months of searching, I finally get an offer. It's a contract position through my recruiter. Then all of a suddenly I get another offer from one of the MAJOR software engineer companies. I already accepted my position at the first place, but this other offer gives me so much more money and it has benefits. Can I leave the contract from my recruiter to go to this other company?
