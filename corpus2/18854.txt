I have an integral over a region (rpp):                   Msq2[w1_,         w2_] := (12.8228 + 10.518/(0.948338 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) -           6.69841/(1.72935 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) -           57.4434/(2.01348 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) -           13.4997/(3.45415 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) +           9.50782 (1/(-0.110612 + 2.0134 w1) +              1/(-0.110612 + 2.0134 w2)) -           82.5202 (1/(1.14046 + 2.0134 w1) + 1/(1.14046 + 2.0134 w2)))^2;          r1 = Sqrt[0.283 + (Sqrt[-0.018769 + w1^2] + Sqrt[-0.018769 + w2^2])^2];          r2 = Sqrt[0.283 + (Sqrt[-0.018769 + w1^2] - Sqrt[-0.018769 + w2^2])^2];          mphy = 1.007;          rpp = RegionPlot[        Re[r2] < mphy - w1 - w2 < Re[r1], {w1, .11, .4}, {w2, .11, .4},          BoundaryStyle -> Blue, FrameLabel -> {"w1", "w2"},         PlotRangePadding -> 0];       w1min = w2min = Min@rpp[[1, 1, All, 1]];       w1max = w2max = Max@rpp[[1, 1, All, 1]];          NIntegrate[       Boole[Re[r2] < mphy - w1 - w2 < Re[r1]] 1/(64*Pi^3*mphy)*        Msq2[w1, w2], {w1, w1min, w1max}, {w2, w2min, w2max},        AccuracyGoal -> 14] // Chop      With 2 errors mathematica give the following answer (Numerical integration converging too slowly):               Out[8]= 119.375      I tried to correct the problem by evaluating the following expression:               NIntegrate[      Piecewise[{{1/(64*Pi^3*mphy)*Msq2[w1, w2],          Re[r2] <= mphy - w1 - w2 <= Re[r1]}}], {w1, w1min, w1max}, {w2,        w2min, w2max}, MaxRecursion -> 50, AccuracyGoal -> 20,       Method -> {GlobalAdaptive, MaxErrorIncreases -> 10000}]      But the problem remains:               Out[12]= 3095.25      it seems it doesn't converge. I used some other NIntegrate integration strategies but none of them works. With which method does this integal converge and gives a precise and correct answer? Is there any method which gives a correct answer? What is the real problem? I don't understand what's going on. @Retay: If I replace Msq2b instead of Msq2, the integral converges. Msq2 and Msq2b are very close to each other ( compare their plots). So what is the problem with Msq2?                Msq2b[w1_,             w2_] := (10.8 + 11.85/(0.959 - 2.013*w1 - 2.013*w2) -               6.9768/(1.8059 - 2.01383*w1 - 2.01383*w2) -               60.9431/(2.04286 - 2.01383*w1 - 2.01383*w2) -                  13.21819/(3.4901 - 2.013830*w1 - 2.01383*w2) +                10.461347*(1/(-0.072247 + 2.0138303*w1) +                  1/(-0.072247 + 2.013830*w2)) -                  82.309287*(1/(1.14002 + 2.013830*w1) +                  1/(1.14002 + 2.01383*w2)))^2;          Plot3D[1/(64*Pi^3*mphy)*Msq2[w1, w2], {w1, w1min, w1max}, {w2, w2min,        w2max}, RegionFunction ->        Function[{w1, w2, z}, Re[r2] <= mphy - w1 - w2 <= Re[r1]] ,       BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 4}]               Plot3D[1/(64*Pi^3*mphy)*Msq2b[w1, w2], {w1, w1min, w1max}, {w2, w2min,        w2max}, RegionFunction ->        Function[{w1, w2, z}, Re[r2] <= mphy - w1 - w2 <= Re[r1]] ,       BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 4}]
