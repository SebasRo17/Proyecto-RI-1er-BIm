I want to create a `ListPlot` with three sets of data, where the data in each set are joined by a line. This is an example:               ListPlot[{{1, 2, 3, 5, 8}, {2, 3, 6, 9, 10}, {4, 5, 7, 10, 12}},       PlotMarkers -> {Automatic}, Joined -> {True}]      **Question:** How do I keep a unique marker and colour for each of the sets but specify that the joining lines be a single color (gray)?
