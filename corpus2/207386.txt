**Note** : if you need to consider a specific OS to be able to answer, please consider Linux. Whenever I run a program, it will be given a virtual memory space to run in, with an area for its stack and one for its heap. **Question 1** : do the stack and the heap have a static size limit (e.g., 2 gigabytes each), or is this limit dynamic, changing according to the memory allocations during the execution of the program (i.e., 4 gigabytes total to be used by both, so if a program only uses the stack, it will be able to have a stack with 4 gigabytes)? **Question 2** : How is the limit defined? Is it the total available RAM memory? **Question 3** : What about the text (code) and data sections, how are they limited?
