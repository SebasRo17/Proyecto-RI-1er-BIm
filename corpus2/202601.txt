I saw below test question the other day in which the authors used a flowchart to represent the logic of loops, and I got to thinking it would be interesting to do this with some more complex logic. For example, the closure in this immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) sort of boggles me:               while (i <= qty_of_gets) {         // needs an IIFE         (function(i) {             promise = promise.then(function(){                 return $.get("queries/html/" + product_id + i + ".php");             });         }(i++));                            }      I wonder if seeing a flowchart representation of what happens in it could be more elucidating. Could such a thing be done? Would it be helpful, or just messy? I haven't the foggiest clue where to start, but thought maybe someone would like to take a stab. Probably all the ajax could go and it could just be a simple return within the IIFE. ![logic test](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qicvE.png)
