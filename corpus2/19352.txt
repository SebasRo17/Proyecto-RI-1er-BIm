Is there any way to have each cluster in the `DendrogramPlot` highlight in a different color? I've tried the obvious way but it doesn't work:               Needs["HierarchicalClustering`"]     data = {{0.758587,0.844749},{1.05549,1.01289},{1.21689,1.1919},{0.53086,0.977943},{2.08582,1.8978},{2.10121,1.81776},{1.88505,1.83257},{1.89067,2.48317},{2.88711,1.02682},{2.82199,0.901863},{2.90456,0.91189},{2.80032,1.09192}};     DendrogramPlot[      data,      LeafLabels -> Range[12],      HighlightLevel -> 3,      HighlightStyle -> {Red, Green, Blue}      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/16lSy.png)
