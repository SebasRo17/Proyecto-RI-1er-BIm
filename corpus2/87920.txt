Let's say if I am doing desktop application, and I am interested to know whether our software really gets used or not. Is it alright to insert in code that tracks whether our software is used, for how long and so on? Note that no person-identifiable information will be collected, all I am interested to know is how frequent and for how long the software is used. The information will be sent to our server for diagnosis. What do you think?
