I'm trying to learn more about Erlang than the toy projects I've been playing with. To this end, I'm reading through Programming Erlang and some of the archives from Armstrong on Software. I would also like to read over some example (preferably production) code that showcases the sorts of things you can build with Erlang that would be disproportionately difficult in other languages. Aside from (I assume) Yaws, are there any publicly available examples of beautiful Erlang code that I could read through to gain a better understanding of the language and/or see the idiomatic uses for various language constructs? I'm specifically **not** looking for code that "gets the job done" but uses questionable practices, or examples along the lines of "here's how you write `factorial` in Erlang". In the same vein, can anyone recommend any good literature for learning this language (other than the mentioned "Programming Erlang")? For preference, something you yourself used to learn it, but if there's some community standard books for it, throw those in too.
