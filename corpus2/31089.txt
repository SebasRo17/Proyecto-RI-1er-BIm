I've been working on a ODE, for a function `y[t]`, that, due to it's complexity, has to be solved numerically. I then need to use the results of NDSolve, which I store in the variable $s$, in the following manner:               Plot[          NIntegrate[                     f[r],{r,b,Evaluate[Sqrt[{(y[t])^2+b^2}/.s]]}                    ],          {t,0,5}         ]      which returns the following errors:               NIntegrate::nlim: r = {20.025} is not a valid limit of integration. >>     NIntegrate::nlim: r = {20.025} is not a valid limit of integration. >>     NIntegrate::nlim: r = {19.6024} is not a valid limit of integration. >>     General::stop: Further output of NIntegrate::nlim will be suppressed during this calculation. >>      It seems that the problem is due to $\text{Evaluate}$ returning the number in parentheses...I've tried the function $\text{N}$ but it has the same problem. Maybe I'm doing something else wrong. Can anyone help me? **Edit:** I shall post the complete code as suggested in the comments:               Module[{b = 1., k = 1., Vt0 = 2., L0 = 20.},      s = NDSolve[        {y''[t] - (y'[t])^2 (b^2/((b^2 + (y[t])^2) y[t]) - y[t]/(              b^2 (Exp[(y[t])^2/b^2] - 1))) - (z'[t])^2 (-1/(              y[t] Exp[(y[t])^2/b^2]) (Exp[(y[t])^2/b^2] -                 1) (b^2 + (y[t])^2)) + k*(b^2 y[t])/(b^2 + (y[t])^2) == 0,          y[0] == L0, y'[0] == 0,         z''[t] + 2*y'[t]*z'[t]*(y[t]/(b^2 + (y[t])^2)) == 0, z'[0] == Vt0,          z[0] == 0},        {z, y}, {t, 0, 5}        ];      f[r_] := Sqrt[E^(r^2/b^2)/(-E + E^(r^2/b^2)) - 1];           Plot[       NIntegrate[f[r], {r, b, Evaluate[Sqrt[(y[t])^2 + b^2] /. s]}],       {t, 0, 5}       ]      ]
