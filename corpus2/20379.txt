Can anybody kindly explain to me what is going wrong regarding a simple problem I have? I can find the eigenvalues of a large matrix using `Eigenvalues[]`, but when I try to find the determinant of the matrix minus eigenvalue times identity matrix, the result is not equal to zero. To make it clear please take a look at the following example:               n = 150;     m = RandomReal[{-5, 5}, {n, n}];     EIG = Eigenvalues[m];     DET = Det[(m - (EIG[[n]])*IdentityMatrix[n])]      For small values of `n`, `DET` equals zero, but when `n` becomes larger `DET` is no longer zero, and for `n = 150` (as in the example) `DET` will be a huge number! Could you please tell me whether the problem is from `Eigenvalues[]` or `Det[]` in _Mathematica_ , and how I can sort it out?
