I am curious about the very early steps that a programmer's mind takes when it first encounters a problem that it is supposed to solve. How do you start reasoning about it ? What are the first questions you ask yourself ??. Ok, let me make it more concrete for those of you who think the question is too vague or entirely situation dependent. Pick **any** of the following requirements and think out loud about your very first hunches/impressions/tendencies about how to solve it. 1) build a simple word processor with about as much functionality as MS Word Pad   2) design a single person card game (e.g. Solitaire)   3) build a scientific calculator   4) Any problem of your choosing with similar scale/complexity as the above three
