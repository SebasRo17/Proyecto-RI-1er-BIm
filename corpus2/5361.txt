When importing GIF animations with variable frame durations, the settings for "DisplayDurations" are not recovered correctly. As an example, I'm using the movie from this earlier question: ![slowDown](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UEQpN.gif) Here I'm repeating the code to generate it, putting the gradually increasing frame durations in a variable `durations`:               frames =        Table[Graphics[         Text[Style["Slow Down", FontFamily -> "Futura", FontColor -> Blue,            FontSize -> 48], {0, y}], Background -> Cyan,          PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {.1, 1.5}}], {y, 1.2, .2, -.1}];     durations = Append[Range[Length[frames] - 1]/20, 2];     Export["slowDownMovie.gif", frames, "DisplayDurations" -> durations,        "AnimationRepetitions" -> Infinity];          durations//N      > `{0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 2.}` Now compare to the durations that we get when re-importing the same animated GIF:               newDurations = Import["slowDownMovie.gif", "DisplayDurations"]      > `{20., 20., 20., 20., 20., 20., 20., 20., 20., 20., 20.}`               newDurations == durations      > `False` As expected from this negative result, `ListAnimate` also plays the animation at an incorrect, constant frame delay. It seems clear that this is a bug. Before I start looking for a platform-specific hack to fix this: **is there any way to get the correct display durations from a GIF with the`Import` function?** I looked into the `"Frames"` element of the GIF import, but that also seems to have the wrong display duration in it. I haven't looked at the raw data, but if one has to do that it may be better to find a non-Mathematica hack instead. **Edit** Wolfram support has confirmed it's a bug [TS 19773].
