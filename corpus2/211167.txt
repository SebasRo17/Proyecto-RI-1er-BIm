I have been working on a library which contains a large set of functions. For the sake of simplicity, I am going to use just one set as an example. I am not sure which is the better way, in terms of ease of use and performance, whether I should put those methods provided as individual methods, prepended with the function category, or whether it is better to create a Class containing all the method as static methods. For Example: Individual methods: (p.s. this could also be writen without `request_` in the function name and using Namespaces instead)               function request_method() { ... }     function request_url() { ... }     function request_useragent() { ... }     ....      Classed method:               class Request {         public static function method() { ... }         public static function url() { ... }         public static function useragent() { ... }         ...     }
