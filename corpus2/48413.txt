Java allows marking variables (fields / locals / parameters) as `final`, to prevent re-assigning into them. I find it very useful with fields, as it helps me quickly see whether some attributes - or an entire class - are meant to be immutable. On the other hand, I find it a lot less useful with locals and parameters, and usually I avoid marking them as `final` even if they will never be re-assigned into (with the obvious exception when they need to be used in an inner class). Lately, however, I've came upon code which used final whenever it can, which I guess technically provides more information. No longer confident about my programming style, I wonder what are other advantages and disadvantages of applying `final` anywhere, what is the most common industry style, and why.
