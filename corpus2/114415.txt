Take the original Boyer-Moore paper, for instance. It seems every time I look for an algorithm the paper I see referenced is talking about implementation idiosyncrasies on a PDP-10 or PDP-11. I know these were popular machines at one time, but not so popular as to account for the large number of references I see. Is there a specific reason these machines were used as examples in algorithms papers?
