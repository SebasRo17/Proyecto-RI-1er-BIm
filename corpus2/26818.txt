I have a list of 3D data points which form a closed curve. My own data can't be easily generated analytically, but the qualitative behaviour is well represented by a parametric curve families such as `{Sin[a1 t] Cos[a2 t], Sin[a3 t] Sin[a4 t], Sin[a5 t]}` where the `aN` are constants. Sample data is given by:               dt = Table[{Sin[3 t] Cos[1 t], Sin[t] Sin[5 t], Sin[2 t]}, {t, -10, 10, 0.005}];     p1 = ListPointPlot3D[dt]      ![points from a closed curve](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nqFrN.png) I want to solve for the points where this closed 3D curve cuts a plane I specify but I'm am unable to do it. For example a plane at `z = 0.5` as shown here:               p2 = Plot3D[-0.5, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]     Show[p1, p2]      ![cutting plane](http://i.stack.imgur.com/24FqM.png) No approach I've tried so far has worked e.g. `Interpolation`, `Nearest` to -0.5, use of `Select` and `Drop`. The data does wrap around itself multiple times and getting slightly different solution points on each pass due to differences in the stepsize or something like that is not a problem. Related I think to this question In brief: How can I find where a closed curve given by numerical data points cuts a specified plane? Any help you can give is much appreciated.
