See the example below. Is there any way to make this execute much faster and still get the same output ? I have read Conditionals slower than operators? but it didn't really help me as I can't seem to apply these methods to my problem. I have to execute about 100 of these operations in succession and each one can't take about a second to execute as running the algorithm would take way too long for the end user.               CurrentEquipID = 40          40          AbsoluteTiming[      Table[If[HTimeModelSelection[CurrentEquipID][[i]] ==          0, (1 - HOperatingEfficiency[CurrentEquipID][[i]])*         HUtilizedTime[CurrentEquipID][[i]],         Flatten[ConstantArray[           Select[EquipParams, #[[colEquipID]] == CurrentEquipID &][[;; ,              colOperatingDelayTime]], 20]][[i]]], {i, 1, 20}]]          {1.851185, {744.6512332, 744.6512332, 746.713979, 744.6512332,        744.6512332, 744.6512332, 746.713979, 744.6512332, 744.6512332,        744.6512332, 746.713979, 744.6512332, 744.6512332, 744.6512332,        746.713979, 744.6512332, 744.6512332, 744.6512332, 746.713979,        744.6512332}}
