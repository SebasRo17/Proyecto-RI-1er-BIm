Anybody here work for a company (or know of someone that does) in the fields of programming or anything related to DBs and not have set work hours? Where you are paid for performance rather than how many hours you sit in a chair at the office? Any project / company I have been apart of always has pretty strict primary hours with the "great opportunity" / expectation to stay until the job is done. Is this type of flexibility really feasible in a group environment in these fields? Would pay for performance work within a company in these fields? With having strict primary hours I notice a lot of inefficiencies. Some weeks or days there is only so much that can be done (for whatever the reason may be) and if your work is done it doesn't help moral to force someone to stay for 8 hrs/day or 40hrs/week if the next week they may have to pull a 60+hr work week. I know that a lot of flexibility can come from working independently or as a consultant so this question really does not encompass those types of positions.
