I've been reading about Bayesian spam filtering and I think I understand the theory, but I just don't see why this approach is needed in order to calculate the likelihood of a message being spam, given that it contains a certain word. If we have a set of messages already classified by the user as either 'spam' or 'ham' and we receive a new message (containing the chosen word) which we want to classify, then surely all we need to do is divide the number of spam messages that contain the word, by the total number of messages that contain the word... Why all the equations?
