Today I tried using Mathematica's plotting capabilities to display the output of a C++ program. This made me wonder whether it is possible to somehow tell a Mathematica script to read from STDIN and then do something with that, a la               #/usr/local/bin/MathematicaScript -script          (* Mathematica plotting script *)     data = ReadStream["STDIN"];     plot = ListPlot[data];     Export[plot, ...];      which can then be used like               ./cppDataGenerator | mathematicaPlotScript      However, I couldn't find much on that in the documentation, the entries always focus on output or string streams, and trial and error didn't yield a result either. So the question is: **How can I make a Mathematica script listen on the standard input?**
