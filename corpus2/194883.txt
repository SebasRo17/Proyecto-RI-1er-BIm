Let me start with a disclaimer: I'm _not_ the best programmer out there. I _do_ however study I.T. and learnt a bit of Java and C. I'm getting stuck into Python and Django + Mongoengine, I'm not going to explain it into detail as it will deviate from the original question. While trying to understand what is happening at this bit of Django code I was **shocked** by some of concepts I seemed to understand. Mostly I was completely confused by how one object could add accessible attributes to a parent object and how Python defines `__set__()` and `__get__()` in such a way as to be so confusing as that. Could someone tell me how _orthodox_ this design style is and whether I find it bizarre because I'm an amateur programmer.
