In programming what do you call a choice that is not Boolean? ie. a Boolean condition is a true/false, either-or possibility. What do you call a condition with one or more possibilities? And, is there any difference if the condition is zero or more versus one or more? Thanks! \--EDIT-- To add some clarity: Specifically I'm having a hard time when describing certain types of algorithms to non-programers. I'm a hobbyist programmer so I lack a lot of the vocabulary that comes with a computer science degree. If I present a user with an "either-or" choice, I find the users understand what I mean if I call this a "boolean" choice, even if it has more than two possibilities. For example: "Pick a color: red, yellow, green, or blue." If I have something that's a "one or more" choice I don't know what to call that. For example: "Select any colors that you like: red, yellow, green, blue." How do you (knowledgeable programmers) refer to these kinds of choices when you talk about them? \-- SECOND EDIT -- As was pointed out in the comments I shouldn't even be saying "Boolean", I should be saying "Binary." That makes perfect sense... So, is there such a thing as "polynary"?
