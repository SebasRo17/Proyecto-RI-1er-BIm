I've seen a lot of mentions of Pseudocode lately, on this site and others. But I don't get it:   * **What is Pseudocode?** For example, the Wikipedia article below says _"It uses the structural conventions of a programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading."_ Does this mean that it **_isn't_** actually used to make programs?   * **Why is it used?**   * **How is it used?**   * **Is it considered a Programming Language?** See the above Wikipedia quote.   * **Is it commonly known/used?**   * **Anything else...** I honestly don't know where to start with this. I have Googled it and I've seen the Wikipedia article on the topic, but I still don't fully understand what it is.
