I have code that represents the interface for a library that is used by a variety of **internal** clients. How should that interface code be exposed to these internal clients that live in different source control repositories? The interface should be relatively stable, but is in development (as is most of the internal clients) so keeping changes communicated is important, as is keeping breaking changes to a minimum. Normally, I would just directly reference them in the other modules but the separated nature makes that troublesome.
