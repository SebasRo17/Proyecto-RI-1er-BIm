I want to achieve two things in my java swing application: First, i need a canvas zone where i can drag elements (a rectangle or a circle) from the outside of a pane inside the canvas and place it at the position where they where dropped. also it should be possible to select an element on the canvas and move it around and drop it on another location on the canvas. what techniques would fit best to do such a job? Please leave a comment if something is unclear.
