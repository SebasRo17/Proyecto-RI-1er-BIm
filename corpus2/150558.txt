Can we use the word "object" for data / functions in e.g. C (or Pascal) which doesn't really have objects? In C, what is an object? A data structure? A named memory area? I spoke to my collegue about "objects" in C and he said that there weren't any but in the text I study about C the word object is used as a generalization of either a function or data. For example, if you in C declare a `union` you can say that you have declared place for an object that can be either a function or data. The ADT defined as "Object" looks like this in C               typedef enum { Integral, Real } Kind;     typedef struct {       Kind type;       union {         double rvalue;         int ivalue;       } data;     } Object;      Thanks for any reply
