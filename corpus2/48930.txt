I have a bunch of coordinates given in a file. The file contains Startpoints and Endpoints of arrows in columns(Example):               t    start1    end1    start1   end2        1    1  2     2  2    0  0     1  1     2    0  0     1  4           Where the number of arrows is not constant over time. I tried to read the file like this and it did not work (especially the No_of_columns which gives the number of columns for a given row should depend on the row number as each row does not contain the same number of coordinates):               {{#1, #2}, {#3, #4}} & @@@ #[[All, 1 ;; No_of_columns(row) ;; 4]] &/Arrows;      I could also output another file stating the number of coordinate pairs in each row:               t   No_of_arrows      So basically I need a matrix whose column number is not the same for all rows. Is that even possible? EDIT: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xuuc6v0az73k49e/arrows.txt EDIT2: I will try to be more specific. I created (with a lot of help) a code animating rectangles movement in 2D. In the next step I want to connect those rectangles by arrows. Importantly those arrows come and go so that I would have to give another file stating the number of arrows at each time point (maybe?). So for now I need data looking like this (?)               Arrow_coordinates={{{{1,2},{2,2}},{{0,0},{1,1}}},{{{0,0},{1,4}}}}       In this case I could run an animation with 2 arrows in the first step and 1 in the second step.
