When I press Ctrl-Backspace, Mathematica inserts what looks either like a tiny white space or sometimes is invisible. Actually, though, it is an ascii character code 8, also enterable in Mathematica as `\.08`. The presence of this character completely messes up code and is very difficult to diagnose (for example, `\.08a` is different from `a`, but they look identical). I can't imagine the purpose of this behavior but I desperately want to get rid of it. Ideally, Ctrl-Backspace would delete the previous word, like in a sensible application. I would be completely content, though, with disabling all behavior when I press Ctrl-Backspace. I have tried looking in KeyEventTranslations.tr but I didn't find the origin of this behavior. Note that I am using Mac OS X 10.9.3 and Mathematica 9.0.1.0 on a MacBook 2012.
