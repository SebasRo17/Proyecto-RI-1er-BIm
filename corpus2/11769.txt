All, Given a problem statement, when I start of with the analysis and design, I tend to think too much about the various functionalities associated with the task (sometimes not even mentioned in the task). My point is, I get diverted from the main task at hand thinking about various scenarios that I should consider while coding and this tends to demotivate me because I am often very confused in the end. What approach should I take in this case since thinking a lot on all possible scenarios comes naturally and I only try hard not to.
