I would like to solve the following two-dimensional inhomogeneous Poisson's equation in Mathematica including specific boundary conditions, and I know that an analytical solution exists, but Mathematica is not cooperating in this special case. I would like to analytically solve the following Poisson's equation: $$\frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial y^2}=6 x (1-y) y-2 x^3$$ with the boundary conditions $$u(0, y)=0,\ u(1, y)=(1-y)y,\ u(x, 0)=0,\ u(x, 1)=0$$ From a textbook I know that the solution is $$u(x,y)=y(1-y)x^3$$ If I try to solve this equation system by using `DSolve`               DSolve[{D[u[x, y], {x, 2}] + D[u[x, y], {y, 2}] == -2 x^3 + 6 x (1 - y) y,      u[0, y] == 0,       u[1, y] == (1 - y) y,       u[x, 0] == 0,       u[x, 1] == 0}, u, {x, y}]      But _Mathematica_ refused to do anything and is not returning any error message at all. Am I overlooking something or is such an PDE not solvable analytically in _Mathematica_? Of course one could use `NDSolve`, but I would like to have the possibility to get more general solutions through `DSolve`.
