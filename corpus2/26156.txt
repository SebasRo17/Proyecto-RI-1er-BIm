I have a list of numbers that are numerical samples of a function for which I need to find the Cauchy principal value integral. I thought I should be able to combine Interpolation with Integrate to do this, but it appears not. A simple function that shows this problem is `1/x`. If the actual function is known Mathematica can do the integral.               Integrate[1/x, {x, -1, 2}, PrincipalValue -> True]      giving the answer `Log[2]`. But if I only have a numerical approximation to this function the "obvious" way to try this does not work.               foo = Interpolation[Table[{x, 1/x}, {x, -1.1, 2.1, 0.0123}]]     Integrate[foo[x], {x, -1, 2}, PrincipalValue -> True]      gives the error message `General::ivar: "PrincipalValue->True is not a valid variable."` Can anyone tell me how to estimate the Cauchy principal value integral of a numerically sampled function?
