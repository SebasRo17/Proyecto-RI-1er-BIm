At my current workplace there is a common pattern in database design: they don't use foreign keys but they list all corresponding ids in a column like this:               some_table     id  name image_ids     1   a    1,2,3     2   b    4,6,7          images     id url     1  ...     2  ...     ...      They store self references in a same manner:               some_table     id  name  some_table_id     1   a     2,3     2   b     1,3     ...      They encourage me to use this pattern but it does not feel right for me. I would never design a database like that. I have some counter arguments against it:   * What if some day I would add some arbitrary data to a self reference? Using this model I would not be able to.   * It does not ensure referential integrity. I can easily add non-existent ids which will lead to problems   * Searching through strings is not fast either I need to justify my complaints so my question is: What persuasive counter- arguments can you come up with against this hacky design approach?
