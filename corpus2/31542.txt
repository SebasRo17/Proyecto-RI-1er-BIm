I would like to plot fractional functions. Say $f=(\sin)^{1/2}(x)$. By that I mean that $f(f(x)) = \sin(x)$. Similarly I can define a half-derivative to be an operator such that $H[H[f(x)]] = \frac{df(x)}{dx}$. What I'd like to do, in an ideal situation, is to evaluate the function at different points and then plot it. How do I numerically solve such equations in Mathematica? Is it possible to get a Taylor series? Side question: Does Mathematica treat operators as separate entities?
