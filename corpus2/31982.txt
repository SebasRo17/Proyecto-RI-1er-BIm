I have a second order reaction / diffusion type ODE of the form $\frac{D_{o}}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2 \frac{dC}{dr} \right) - \frac{aC}{C+k} = 0$ where $a, k$ and $D_{o}$ are constants and $C$ is a function of $r$. I know the following; $C(r_{o}) = \omega$ , $C(r_{n}) = 0$ and $C'(r_{n}) = 0$ , where $r_{o}$ and $r_{n}$ are positions and $\omega$ is a known constant. To model this behaviour, I am using `NDSolve`, which takes two conditions for these types of ODEs. For example, this gives a potential curve between the boundaries $r_{n}$ and $r_{o}$ ;               eqn = ((Do2/(r^2))*D[(r^2*(O2'[r])), r] - (a)*((O2[r])/(O2[r] + k)));               s = NDSolve[{eqn == 0, O2[rn] == 0, O2[ro] == omega}, O2, {r, rn, ro}]      This gives me one curve which I can readily plot; however is I instead tell `NDSolve` to use different conditions like this -               s = NDSolve[{eqn == 0, O2'[rn] == 0, O2[ro] == omega}, O2, {r, rn, ro}]      I get a different curve. However, I suspect I should be getting the same curve regardless. If the problem is narrowing it down to a unique solution from an array of possible solutions, is there a way to make Mathematica take all three BCs? I'm also open to the possibility that there is a more fundamental mathematical error or perhaps a bad assumption on my part, so please by all means point it out to me if I've missed it . Thanks in advance - grateful for any advice on this!
