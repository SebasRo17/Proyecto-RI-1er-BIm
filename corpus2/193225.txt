According to Gregory Baker & Erik Arvidsson (Google), creating a named function and then passing that to setTimeout is actually faster than creating an anonymous function (reference: Optimizing JavaScript code -> Avoiding pitfalls with closures): > Creating a closure is significantly slower then creating an inner function > without a closure, and much slower than reusing a static function.

EDIT: note that I am specifically referring to the last two examples, the first one has been removed for clarity.
