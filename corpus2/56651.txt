I am using operations over `Interval` and the result of an intersection (or union) contains some singletons. Would it be possible to remove them ? Example:               Interval[       {2894486400, 2894486400},       {2894659200, 2894832000},       {2895004800, 2895004800},       {2895177600, 2895350400}     ]      Transformed in :               Interval[{2894659200, 2894832000}, {2895177600, 2895350400}]
