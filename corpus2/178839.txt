I have an Entity `Student` with following properties - (`name`, `joinedOn`, `birthday`, `age`, `batch`, etc.) and a function `fetchStudents(<params>)`. I want to fetch students based on multiple filters. In my method I have two ways to pass filters.   1. Pass all filters as params to the method   2. Make a class StudentCriteria with filters as fields and then pass the object of this class While working in java I always go with the second option but recently I'm working in php and I was advised to go with the first way. I am unable to figure out which way is better in maintaining the code, reusability and performance wise. Thanks.
