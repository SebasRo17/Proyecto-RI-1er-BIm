I think this question should apply to most programs that load settings from a file. My question is from a programming point of view, and it is really how to deal with the loading of settings from a file in terms of different classes and accessibility. For instance:   * If a program had a simple `settings.ini` file, should its contents be loaded in a `load()` method of a class, or perhaps the constructor?   * Should the values be stored in `public static` variables, or should there be `static` methods to get and set properties?   * What should happen in the event of the file not existing or not being readable? How would you let the rest of the program know it can't get those properties?   * etc. I'm hoping I'm asking this in the right place here. I wanted to make the question as language agnostic as possible, but I'm mainly focusing on languages that have things like inheritance - especially Java and C#.NET.
