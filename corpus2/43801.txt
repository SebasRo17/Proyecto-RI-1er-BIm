If you have some non-technical people managing your software development team, is there a book you'd want them to read to understand the process better? For example, in most work, you can pretty well estimate how long a task will take. But in development, the whole point is that you have to figure out the problem, which takes unknown time. This is hard to communicate. Anything you know of that explains this well?
