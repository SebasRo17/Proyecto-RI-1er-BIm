I manage to plot strn[t] and sig[t] where sig[t] is the solution from my DSolve. However, when I want to ParametricPlot sig[t] vs strn[t], I failed to do it as the parametric plot does not show anything.               strn[t] = t*0.00025;     modulus = 20000;     sol1 = DSolve[{D[strn[t], t] == D[sig[t], t]/modulus, sig[0] == 0}, sig[t], t]     Plot[strn[t], {t, 0, 100}]     Plot[sig[t] /. sol1, {t, 0, 100}]     ParametricPlot[{sig[t] /. sol1, strn[t]}, {t, 0, 10}]      Can someone please tell me why?
