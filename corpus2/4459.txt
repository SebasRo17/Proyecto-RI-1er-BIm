I have created a CDF file that contains a `Manipulate` object with a plot. I intend to embed the file in a web site, so that users can use interactive sliders to change the parameters of the plot. My problem is that when opening the CDF file in a browser, the user can double-click on the plot and edit it (move lines, move points, etc.). The only interactive content I want in the web site are the sliders produced by `Manipulate`. How can I create a CDF file that doesn't allow the user to edit the plot?
