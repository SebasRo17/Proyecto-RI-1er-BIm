Some months ago I stumbled across a video on the internet of somebody giving a very good talk on the impact of memory access latency on the execution of programs. I'm trying to find the video again; maybe you know what video I mean and were I can find it. This is what I remember about the talk/video:   * I don't remember the title and it may have been broader, but the talk was a lot about impact of memory access latency in modern processors on program execution.   * The talk was in English and most likely the location was in America.   * The speaker was very knowledgeable about the topic, but the talk was in an informal setting (not a conference presentation or university lecture). I think the speaker was known to the audience and may even have been famous (I don't remember)   * The audience may have been a computer club / group of a local community or company (but I don't remember for sure)
