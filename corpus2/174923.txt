I have this doubt many years. I am wring some code to achieve some functionality. For example I am writing 20 lines of code to achieve the functionality and my co worker writing the code for the same functionality with just 5 lines. Since he used some looping statement to achieve that, but that code will execute around 30 to 50 times. So which is best way of coding? As per my knowledge I always try to reduce coding length as much I can.
