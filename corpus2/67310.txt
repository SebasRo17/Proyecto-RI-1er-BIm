Should you use "internal abbreviations/slang" inside comments, that is, abbreviations and slang people outside the project could have trouble understanding, for instance, using something like `//NYI` instead of `//Not Yet Implemented`? There are advantages of this, such as there is less "code" to type (though you could use autocomplete on the abbreviations) and you can read something like `NYE` faster than something like `Not Yet Implemented`, assuming you are aware of the abbreviation and its (unabbreviated) meaning. Myself, I would be careful with this as long as it is not a project on which I for sure will be the only developer.
