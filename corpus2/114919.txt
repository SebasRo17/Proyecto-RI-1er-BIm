If I were to develop a Silverlight game and publish it to a site where you can play it for free is the use considered to be commercial or personal? What about if the site has adverts on, is it then considered to be commercial if the program is free but its hosted on a site that makes money? My reason for asking this is Visual Studio Express can only be used for personal or non-commercial use so I want to check what the limits for the use are.
