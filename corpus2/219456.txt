If you have fixed-price software projects a potential customer can choose a software development company by the price to get best value for money. The software development company with the lowest price wins the contract. In agile software projects there are no fixed software-featuresets with fixed prices. Featuresets can change after every sprint. So how can a customer choose which software development company is best for him? (in price, quality or something else) [update] Lowest price is just an example how a customer _can_ choose a contractor. Background: Last week I was at a seminar about agile development. We found out that new customers often want fixed price price projects because that makes it easy for them to compare possible contractors. Customer and Contractor need a certain level of trust to agree to do agile development. If Customer and potential Contractor do not know each other what can a customer do to choose a contractor?
