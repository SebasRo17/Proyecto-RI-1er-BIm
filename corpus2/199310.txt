In languages that don't allow underscores in integer literals, is it a good idea to create a constant for 1 billion? e.g. in C++:               size_t ONE_BILLION = 1000000000;      Certainly, we shouldn't create constants for small numbers like 100. But with 9 zeros, it's arguably easy to leave off a zero or add an extra one in code like this:               tv_sec = timeInNanosec / 1000000000;     tv_nsec = timeInNanosec % 1000000000;
