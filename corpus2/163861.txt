I am planning to standardize our way of creating project for our new projects. Currently we are using 3tier architecture where we have our ClassLibrary Project where it includes our Data Access Layer and Business Layer Something like:                  Solution ClassLibrary           >ClassLibrary Project :               >DAL(folder)                    > DAL Classes               >BAL(folder)                    > BAL Classes      And this Class Library dll was reference on our presentation Layer Project which are the Application(web/desktop) Something like:                    Solution WebUniversitySystem           >Libraries(folder)               > ClassLibrary.dll          >WebUniversitySystem(Project):               >Reference ClassLibrary.dll                >Pages etc...      Now i am planning to do is something like:                Solution WebUniversitySystem           >DataAccess(Project)          >BusinesLayer(Project)               >Reference DAL          >WebUniversitySystem(Project):               >Reference BAL               >Pages etc...      Is this OK? Or there is a good approach that we can follow?
