I'm writing a small program that I want to be able to link with other programs. I also intend to run it from a command line interface, and maybe later with a GUI interface. How could distribution and reuse flexibility be hurt by linking my program as a static or dynamic library? Distribute it as a library and   * Dynamically link for GUI and command line interfaces   * Statically link for a stand alone binary
