Would a recruiter prefer a B.A in Comp Science from a more prestigious university or a B.S in Inf Tech from just an average university? Would it matter for someone already established in the field with plenty of experience? The only difference in the B.A and B.S is essentially the mathematics. The B.S is geared for those going on to master's programs, although one isn't excluded from going on to a masters program with a BA, many do require more mathematics. Just for those curious, the information tech degree is typically geared more to real-world problems then the computer science and the quality of it will vary widely. Some inf tech programs are as in-depth as an ABET C.S degree, the information tech from Drexel looks extremely strong. The Management Information Systems is generally provided via the business school and is more of a traditional business degree. I'm not sure really how well versed the recruiters/g.p are in the actual differences in all of these programs. Some non ABET BS Comp Science may only require 1 or 2 Calculus versus the ABET certified programs.
