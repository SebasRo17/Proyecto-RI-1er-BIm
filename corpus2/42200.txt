> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Version control for independent developers? I've heard statements to the effect of: "Well it's just me working on this project so I don't need to put it under source control" as well as, "There is no need to work version controlled on this project, it's so small". It is my opinion that no matter how small the project is, so long as it's adding value to the client (and they are paying for it too) that we, the developer(s), should version control it; especially since its company policy. Am I insane or does my standpoint make sense. Question: Should development work always be version controlled?
