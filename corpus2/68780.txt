Often one of the biggest problem areas for me when developing software (win and web) is some of the more (seemingly) abstract areas like tcp/ip, deploying to IIS and the various configurations, etc. This especially pops up when I am deploying a web app to IIS. What should I know about this so that I can troubleshoot problems, and develop services and apps that leverage an actual understanding of these areas? Also, WHERE can I learn this??
