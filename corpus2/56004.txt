So I have this array of points, in the form {x, {y,z}}, where x is the node number assigned when I used the locator pane to make a network, and y and z are its unitary coordinates. The graph is made up of two distinct node types, let's call them A and B. I want to be able to distinguish these two by assigned different shapes to their nodes and also want to connect the network how it originally was and using Primm's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree). I was wondering how I go about it. I should also probably mention that from this network I am going to run some Monte Carlo Simulations on it. The code I have so far is:               graphicslist =        Table[Rectangle[mpg[[i, 2]] , mpg[[i, 2]] + {.005, .005}], {i, 1, Length@mpg}];       Graphics[graphicslist]       where mpg is the array of my nodes and their coordinates. This returns: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/juI6d.png) Small sample of the mpg:               mpg == ({{1, {0.0996, 0.4195}}, {2, {0.1046, 0.392}}, {3, {0.1144,       0.468}}, {4, {0.1164, 0.4415}}, {5, {0.1432,       0.4455}}, {6, {0.1442, 0.376}}, {7, {0.147, 0.5085}}, {8, {0.16,       0.4965}}, {9, {0.1628, 0.5305}}, {10, {0.1708, 0.484}}.......      Here the integer is the node number and the following decimals are the unitary coordinates of its corresponding vertex. In the real Maryland Power Grid, there are two distinct vertices; loads and generators. I plotted, using the locator pane, all of its vertices and wish to differentiate which one are loads and which are generators rather than just have squares for both of them.
