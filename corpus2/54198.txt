I'm wondering if you could suggest me any way to implement "user roles" in GWT applications. I would like to implement a GWT application where users log in and are assigned "roles". Based on their role, they would be able to see and use different application areas. Here are two possible solution I thought: 1) A possible solution could be to make an RPC call to the server during onModuleLoad. This RPC call would generate the necessary Widgets and/or place them on a panel and then return this panel to the client end. 2) Another possible solution could be to make an RPC call on login retrieving from server users roles and inspecting them to see what the user can do.   * I'm also considering java security frameworks like Apache Shiro and Spring Security... What do you think about them? What do you think about? Thank you very much in advance for your help!
