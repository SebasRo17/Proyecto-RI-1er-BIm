I created a notebook and was manipulating its `WindowOpacity` option:               nb = CreateDocument[];     Manipulate[SetOptions[nb, WindowOpacity -> op], {{op, .3}, 0, 1}]      It works fine as a half-transparent window when the option has a value not too small, say `0.3` (Have written something in `nb` to make it more prominent against the web brower window behind): ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kZsjk.png) But when the value of the option is less than a certain threshold (in my case `0.004`), the `nb` window seems to be "click-through" for mouse, eventhough it should be still in place in front of the web brower window: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fo0uw.png) **The question:** Is this "click-through" behavior a feature or a bug-like thing? And why such a nonzero threshold? ps. My environment is _Windows 7_ (x64) and _Mathematica_ 8.0.4.
