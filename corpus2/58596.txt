I want to solve the one-dimensional one-phase Stefan problem, but I don't know how to make Mathematica understand the conditions. If you are not familiar with what I'm asking please refer to this wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_problem#Mathematical_formulation This is what I have so far. Clearly, it doesn't work.               NDSolve[      {D[u[x, t], t] == D[u[x, t], {x, 2}],       (-D[u[x, t], x] /. x -> 0) == 1,       u[s[t], t] == 0,       D[s[t]] == (-D[u[x, t], x] /. x -> s[t]),       u[x, 0] == 0,       s[0] == 0       },     {u, s}, {x, 0, s[t]}, {t, 0, 10}]      I hope there is someone out there with a magical code I'm using Mathematica 10. Thanks!
