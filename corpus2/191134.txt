I am Database Administrator, but now I need to know something about android applications. I need to run an existing .Net application in Android Operating System, while surfing on the internet I came to know that, I can use MonoDroid to build and run my application on Androids Operating System. I am new to this Android and MonoDroid applications, so **My questions:**   * Is it possible to run an existing .Net application on Android without modification?   * If not, is there a known set of changes necessary to make a .NET application run on Android? Thank you.
