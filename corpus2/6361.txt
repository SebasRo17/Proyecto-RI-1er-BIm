Wolfram Blog uses PNG images to display input and output cells in a notebook. For example, the following is an image from Samuel Chen's post: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xGAgz.png) I should be able to produce a similar image by selecting a group of cells and selecting File -> Save Selection from the pull-down menu. When I tried that on the cell               In[1]:= Series[Log[1+x],{x,0,6}]     Out[1]= x-x^2/2+x^3/3-x^4/4+x^5/5-x^6/6+O[x]^7      I get the garbled image ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QKYi0.png) This does not happen when I save selection to PDF or BMP. In the case of BMP, the `In[1]` and `Out[1]` goes missing: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GthCm.png) Do you know of a way to fix the problem with PNG export and/or include the `In[1]` in BMP export? I am running Mathematica 8.0.4.0 on Linux x86 (64-bit), which I think is part of the problem.
