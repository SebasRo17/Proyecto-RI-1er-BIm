If you click the cc-wiki link at the bottom of this site, you get a nice plain-english description of what you are and are not allowed to do. The legal stuff is there too, but as someone looking to use a library, I don't want legalese, I want a list of what I can and cannot do. Does a similar resource exist for software license, such as MIT, BSD-3clause, BSD-4clause, BSL, GPLv2, GPLv3, etc?
