I want to implement the following type evaluation symbolically $$(f^2g + fg + g)(x) \to f(x)^2 g(x) + f(x) g(x) + g(x)$$ In general, on left hand side there is a polynomial in an arbitrary number of functions (e.g. $f, g^3 h, (f_1 + f_2 + f_3)^3, \dots$ and on the right hand side all the functions have been evaluated at the same element $x$. I would to define a function `eval` or a rule such that               In[1]:= (f^2g + fg + g)[x] // eval     In[2]:= f[x]^2 g[x]+ f[x] g[x] + g[x]      What is a good way of accomplishing this?
