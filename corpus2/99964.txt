I recieved free membership to the Australian Computer Society when they granted me a scholarship/arranged an internship. With that internship, I have my first real world experience as an software engineer. I haven't yet taken advantage of my membership in any real way, other than enjoying their periodical, which is semi-nontechnical. Now, I'm considering joining something more international and/or serious, such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) or IEEE. How important is it as a software engineer to be a member of an industrial or professional organization? What benefits do such memberships grant you, in terms of exposures to new technologies and connections with future employers?
