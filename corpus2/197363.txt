I just came across the article "Rule of Three" in wikipedia > Rule of three is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a > replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states > that the code can be copied once, but that when the same code is used three > times, it should be extracted into a new procedure. The rule was introduced > by Martin Fowler in Refactoring and attributed to Don Roberts. I know that this is just a rule of thumb, but why is it recommended to refactor only after the second duplication? Is there any downside to refactoring when we write the first duplication?
