I recently forked a Git repository, and locally I created a project in my IDE to compile with. My IDE creates a variety of artifacts that I would like to keep saved somewhere. The obvious place would be in the VCS. If I add these files then they will be in the history for my fork. If i want send a pull request to merge upstream I wouldn't want these files included. What would be a recommended workflow for managing these changes that I would never want to go upstream.
