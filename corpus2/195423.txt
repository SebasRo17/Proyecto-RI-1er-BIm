For example to read data from a website we do:               HttpResponse httpResponse = httpClient.execute(httpPost);             HttpEntity httpEntity = httpResponse.getEntity();             is = httpEntity.getContent();      The method that executes the HTTP request, returns a response, then we turn the response into an entity, then we turn the entity into a input stream, then you got to use two more objects, a buffer reader and a string builder,to turn that is into a string. It just seems like a lot of repetitive code. Why can't HttpResponse have a method that returns an InputStream, or better yet a String? P.S. I'm not necessarily saying that Java is wrong, I want to find out what the reason behind it is, if any.
