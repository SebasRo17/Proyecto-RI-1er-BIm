I have a belief that markup should remain in mark-up and not in the code behind. I've come to a situation where I think it is acceptable to build the HTML in the code behind. I'd like to have some consensus as to what the best practices are or should be. When is it acceptable to build html in the code behind? What is the best method to create this html? (example: Strings, StringBuilder, HTMLWriter, etc)
