I have got coordinates in two list of Latitude and Longitude and would like to check if those coordinates are in a certain grid Example lists are:               qLon={-7.48333, -10.4667, -8.66667, -7.48333}     qLat={53.5, 52.5, 53.1167, 51.9833, 51.0167}      Grid borders:                 SLat=47       NLat=55       ELon=-15       SLon=-5      My idea was:               If[ELon <= # <= WLon, "","Outside Grid"] & /@ qLon     If[SLat <= # <= NLat, "","Outside Grid"] & /@ qLat      I would like to merge them, to do the test in one go, like:               If[ELon <= #1 <= WLon && SLat <= #2 <= NLat,...      but could not get it working. Another thing is the output; it should only show something if there is a point outside the grid.
