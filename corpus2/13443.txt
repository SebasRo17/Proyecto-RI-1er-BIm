A few weeks ago, my class was assigned to translate to Portuguese the book Real World Haskell. As I did the translation of the text and comments, I started to wonder if I should translate the code as well, as the instructor suggested. For example:               data BookInfo = Book Int String [String]                   deriving Show would become               data InfoLivro = Livro Int String [String]                    deriving Show Since I haven't read any software-related books in Portuguese, I don't know if that's a common practice, neither if it should be done this way. In the end, the code is a language mix (perhaps the example in Haskell is not a good one, since you can create synonyms quickly like `type CadeiaDeCaracteres = String`, but you get the point). So it doesn't really matter how hard you try, you'll have to rely on the reader previous experience with some sort of basic English words. Knowing this, I really don't see the point in translating code, since we learn in the early days of our coding life it should be written in the universal language. Nevertheless, if the surrounding text (comments, for example, and text itself in a book) needs to be translated, what is possible and feasible in this matter? Can you provide me with some guidance of what to do?
