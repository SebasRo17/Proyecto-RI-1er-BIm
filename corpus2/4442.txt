I have had the question posed at my work that, since we are planning to eventually move to Sharepoint 2010 for most of our Development, and since Sharepoint 2010 supports asp.net web parts, should we start moving all of our new development to be exclusively asp.net web parts? It was also asked how prism factors into all of this. (not sure what that is) We are now a mostly client/server based location but are moving to an SOA framework (slowly though). Is this a good idea? Is it better to have some apps in WPF and Winforms hitting the services or should we just go to web parts solely? What are we going to miss out on if we make this move?
