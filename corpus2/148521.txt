Since programmers learn more by implementing the real world scenarios rather then by gaining theoretical knowledge and concepts about programming, I wanted to know that is there any website that tells about real world scenarios for OOP learners so that they can practice their designing skills and implement these scenarios using c#? Like which can help them making designing decisions for a problem for e.g in which scenario one should use abstract classes, interfaces, virtual overriding etc.
