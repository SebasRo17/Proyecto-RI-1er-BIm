I work in finance and we have the habit to hire young people out of college, most of them with little-to-non coding experience. We are not looking for future quants, just business analysts with an analytical bias. Its happens that we have lots of spreadsheets with quite some VBA + some SQL. So if you want to be really good at your job you have to eventually learn to like to code. It is true that everyone can learn how to code. And it is true that in some circumstances people with potential can end up 'blocked' for whatever reason. Still, it's just my experience that some people seem to naturally get into stuff, while others not. And contrary to the general idea, its not that simple that if someone loves math, it should love to code. I worked with more then one quite smart quant that I just could feel coding was not the part they enjoyed. In my view some people just feel that attraction to 'build stuff' and very soon they are coming with their own ideas on what they want to build, others will end up always somewhat afraid of all those line of code in the back of the files they are using. I don't relate it people's overall professional qualities, its just the computer code part that scares them. Am I alone in this view? Does anyone has some ideas on how to identify people 'with the virus' when it is still in its latency stage?
