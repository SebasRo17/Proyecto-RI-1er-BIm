In one of Stephen Wolfram's recent blog posts (http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2013/04/data-science-of-the-facebook- world/#more-5350) he provides the network plot below. The size of the arrows that connects the different countries is supposed to illustrate the volume of people that moved from country X to country Y. **My questions:**   1. Can somebody please illustrate how to replicate this graph in mathematica (or at least point out "relevant" documentation)?    2. [Bonus part] would it be possible to have the size of the flags (or just the end nodes) correspond to the size of the given country's population (i.e. Chinas flag will be relatively larger than USA's Flag, who's flag will be larger than that of the UK, etc.)?  ![Image from Wolfram's Blog Post](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DjWKV.png)
