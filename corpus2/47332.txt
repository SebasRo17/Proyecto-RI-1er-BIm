I want to create an interpolation through the following 2dim data points:               data = {{22.78, 0.2431}, {22.06, 0.262}, {21.51, 0.2774}, {21.07,         0.2905}, {20.7, 0.302}, {20.38, 0.3121}, {20.1, 0.3213}, {19.86,         0.3296}, {19.28, 0.3499}, {5.41, 0.363}, {5.88, 0.364}, {18.71,         0.3709}, {5.14, 0.3715}, {5.11, 0.3734}, {6.3, 0.3772}, {6.4,         0.3824}, {4.96, 0.3882}, {18.15, 0.3925}, {4.9, 0.4036}, {4.89,         0.4083}, {6.69, 0.4141}, {17.6, 0.4147}, {4.91, 0.4372}, {17.06,         0.4374}, {6.61, 0.4414}, {6.43, 0.4493}, {4.98, 0.459}, {16.52,         0.4603}, {5.07, 0.4791}, {15.99, 0.4835}, {5.19, 0.4995}, {15.47,         0.5067}, {5.33, 0.5204}, {14.96, 0.5297}, {5.5, 0.5415}, {14.45,         0.5524}, {5.69, 0.5626}, {13.95, 0.5745}, {5.9, 0.5834}, {13.46,         0.5957}, {6.13, 0.6035}, {12.98, 0.6158}, {6.38, 0.6227}, {12.5,         0.6346}, {6.65, 0.6407}, {12.03, 0.6518}, {6.94, 0.6571}, {11.57,         0.6672}, {7.25, 0.6717}, {11.12, 0.6805}, {7.57, 0.6842}, {10.68,         0.6915}, {7.91, 0.6944}, {10.25, 0.7}, {8.27, 0.7021}, {9.83,         0.7059}, {8.64, 0.7072}, {9.42, 0.7091}, {9.02, 0.7095}};      With the common interpolation the plot looks like this:               dataInt = Interpolation @ data;     Show[{       ListPlot[data,          PlotRange -> {{0, 25}, {0, 1}}, ImageSize -> 800],        Plot[dataInt[r], {r, 5, 25},          PlotStyle -> RGBColor[0, 0, 1, .5]]}]      ![Listplot with interpolation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zjfyn.jpg) I already tried to obtain a better interpolation using Nearest or try to interpolate the two components seperatly but I was not able to get it the way I want it to be: It just does not connect the right points together. I already tried the solution presented here Parametric differentiable interpolation of a 2D data set using parametrizeCurve[] but it does not create an adequate interpolation either:               tvals = parametrizeCurve[data];     int = Interpolation[Transpose[{tvals, data}]]     Show[{       ListPlot[data, PlotRange -> {{0, 25}, {0, 1}}, ImageSize -> 800],        ParametricPlot[int[t], {t, 0, 1}]}]      ![Interpolation with using parametrizeCurve](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rc2bD.jpg) I must admit, that I dont understand the method behind `parametrizeCurve`, but it seems to be working with the wrong dimension of my data. I would be very happy to get a solution to my problem.
