I have an application with a configuration file that is stored in the application bundle. This config file stores the names of images on a remote server. Whenever the application is started, I download the configuration file from the server and see if there are any changes or updates. If there are changes, I iterate over the array of configuration settings and download the changed images to the user's iPhone I think that I will first list all of the name changes in an array, and after that start loading that changed images. However, I'm wondering if there is a better approach to solving this problem.
