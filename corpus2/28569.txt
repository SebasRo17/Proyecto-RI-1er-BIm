I have a list of seed points that each of them indicates the bottom-left value of a voxel. In order to improve the accuracy of my function, I need to equally sample my points and apply my functions on them.For instance, with 0.5 step- size, I should get 27 seed points on the related voxel. Here is an example:               seedpoints= {{33, 55, 12}, {33, 55, 13}, {33, 56, 12}, {33, 56, 13}, {33, 57, 12}, {33, 57, 13}, {33, 58, 12}, {33, 58, 13}, {33, 59, 11}, {33, 59, 12}, {100, 70, 14}, {100, 71, 12}, {100, 71, 13}, {100, 71, 14}, {101, 68, 13}, {101, 69, 12}, {101, 69, 13}, {101, 70, 12}, {101, 70, 13}};     (*h=stepsize*)      Based on the first seed point, I should nearly get:               desiredoutput={{33,55,12},{33+h,55,12},{33+2h,55,12},{33,55+h,12},{33+h,55+h,12},...,{33+2h,55+2h,12+2h}};(*all points must be on the related voxel,meanly 33+2h<=34 && 55+2h<=56 &&12+2h<=13*)      I hope, it is sufficiently clear. Any help or idea is appreciated.
