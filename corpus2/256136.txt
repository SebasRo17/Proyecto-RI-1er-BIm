The problem: We have a camera that is grabbing frames in 64 bit format. We use 32 bit software, and this worked fine on older 32 bit systems. Then the systems changed to 64 bit, and so did the frames, and my application can't access the image frames anymore. We have been able to save the frame to an image file (tiff), then open this file with our application, but it is very slow, and it feels like there has to be a better way to do this. I'm thinking I could call a script from my application that would access the 64 bit frame through the existing library, convert the frame to 32 bit, and return that frame to my application. The problem is, I'm not even sure where to start: how are frames stored before they are saved to files? Once I access the frame, is it even possible to convert it to a 32 bit format for my main application to access?
