Whenever I export a PDF file in Mathematica with the Export command, the meta- info of the pdf file will have the title as "Temporary Clipboard 0". I want to change the title. But using:               plot = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 6 Pi}];     Export["test.pdf", plot, "Title" -> "Some title"]      does not change anything. The Manual, says "Title" is the correct Meta-information element. Whats wrong? Thank you for your time reading this and your possible hints and solutions!
