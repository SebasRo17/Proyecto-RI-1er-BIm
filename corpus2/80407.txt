I just got the news that I'm (finally) getting to spend the next few months in Afghanistan with my fellow AF maintainers, and I was hoping to get some suggestions of good offline content to learn from. I've got a few textbooks from ck12.org, downloaded the offline versions of the MSDN docs for VCS Express 2010, but I would love to have something more general to learn from, maybe that covers data structures and algorithms (specific to C# would be awesome. Oh, and if anyone knows of any good offline WPA tutorials that would be even better.
