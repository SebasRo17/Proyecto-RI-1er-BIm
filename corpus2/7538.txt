I have a C# application that has 3-dimensional data that I wish to plot. Controls in C# for surface modeling are, in my experience, rather limited. I wish to have my C# application send the 3D point mesh data to Mathematica `Plot3D` and display the result in a winform or some other front end (notebook?). Essentially, my goal is to use Mathematica as a generalized data visualization tool from my C# applications. So far, I have been able to generate a picture file from Mathematica that I put in a `MathPictureBox` control which resides on a winform. However, I would like the interactivity you get when using `Plot3D` from a notebook. Is this possible?
