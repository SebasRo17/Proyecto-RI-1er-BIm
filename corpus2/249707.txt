I have been assigned to a system integration project. However, I do not understand part of the integration implementation architecture. For example, I have a passport scanner connected to a Windows Client application constructed in C++. The client application would pass the passport picture, name, address etc, (once the passport scanning is complete) to a WPF application. I'm not sure whether the communication between both system should be tie to a Web Services, or there is some other way to do so? If the Web Services proves to be the only solution, which party is the Web Service provider and requester? In my own perspective, the WPF application should becomes the Web Service requester. Meanwhile, the Scanner Client Application act as a Web Service provider would going to host the Web Services. However, in Visual Studio there is no way to add the WCF service file to the C++ Client Application project. Is there anyone can enlighten me about this?
