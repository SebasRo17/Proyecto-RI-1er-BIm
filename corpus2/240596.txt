I am building an Integration Testing Solution using Selenium in VS2012, which will be run on a CI server in the near future. I need to provide some way to vary the values being used for testing. The easiest would be to provide the QA testers with a few template spreadsheets, which they can fill in to run tests with those values (for example Log-In, Create new user, Create new Booking, Update Reservation etc). At this moment I have a Test project using NUnit, and another project that contains the test execution code using Selenium, with sample values hardcoded in workflows for each test. I have done some searching, but came up with no relevant results. I am either using incorrect terminology, or this has never been done (improbable, I know). Have you done this, or heard/read about someone who has? I'd like to not reinvent this particular wheel.
