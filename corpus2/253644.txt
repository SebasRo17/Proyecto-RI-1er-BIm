I'm currently developing a WinForm application. In order to inform the client about the improvements and corrections made during the last version, I would like to manage and display a changelog. I mostly found existing changelog on website (the term `changelog` is pretty used) or explanation on how to manage the release numbers, which I don't care. So, these are my questions:   1. How do I manage a changelog (using XML, pure text in the app, etc.) in a desktop application?   2. How do I present it to the user (external website, inside the winform application)?
