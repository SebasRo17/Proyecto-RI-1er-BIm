I am solving a second order differential equation for n[x]. I solved it with both DSolve and NDSolve. A plot of n as a function of x looks great. Than **I want to calculate a gradient of n[x] at a point x=0 and plot it as a function of V. I don't know how to execute this.** I calculated gradient at every point and plot it. I get expected shape of the curve and there is also V on x axis, but the values of y axis are to high. Here is the code:               eq = Gx + D[Dif*\!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[PartialD]\), \(x\)]\(n[x]\)\), x] -          Kr (n[x] - n0) == 0;     bcs = {n'[d] == 0, n[0] == n0*Exp[(e \[Alpha] V)/(kb T)]};     \[Alpha] = 0.25;     e = 1.602*10^-19;     kb = 1.38*10^-23;     T = 300;     d = 20*10^-6;     Gx = 10^17;     Dif = 4*10^-9;     Kr = 3.1*10^-9;     n0 = 10^21;     sol := {V,        D[#, x] &@        NDSolve[{eq, bcs}, n[x], {x, 0, d}, MaxSteps -> 50000][[1, 1, 2]]}     res = Table[sol, {V, 0, 0.7, 0.05}];     ListPlot[Table[res, {x, 0, d}], Joined -> True, Frame -> True,       ImageSize -> 500]      Gx is a complicated function of x because I integrate a list as input. So, my result of DSolve is very big. I need to stop the calculation of gradient as soon as it becomes zero. When the plot of n'[x] at x=0 cross the x axis (with values of V on it) my calculation should stop and the appropriate result (graph) should be displayed. I don't need the negative values of the derivative, so there is no need for Mathematica for further calculations. What is the best way to execute this? But I have another problem there because my result is to high and it never changes the sign. In theory it should.. My result should look like: Because I cannot post the images, you can see the desired graph on the link: https://www.google.si/search?hl=sl&rlz=1C1TEUA_enSI493SI493&q=current+voltage+characteristics+DSSC&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&biw=1600&bih=785&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=YspCUb3GFYvUsgaTnYGoCA#imgrc=wX5CgAQmm0sdkM%3A%3BJbeOH9F0mOvjNM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fars.els- cdn.com%252Fcontent%252Fimage%252F1-s2.0-S0025540812004047-gr9.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.sciencedirect.com%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fpii%252FS0025540812004047%3B384%3B314 On x axis is voltage, on y axis is current density, which I should calculate from the gradient at a point x=0: J=(dn[x]/dx)x=0. The current is related to a density gradient, the diffusion coefficient being the proportionality constant. But if I multiply the resulted derivative with Dif, it doesn't change enough. If I multiply the whole equation with e, which gives me correct units, the result is too small. From the picture above is evident, that my values on y axis are changing to slowly. Thank you for your answers!
