I have a 2D matrix, such as:               d=2;     M=Array[a, {d^2,d^2}];      and I would like to print it in a way which emphasizes its dxd block matrix structure. If `MatrixForm` had a `Dividers` option like `Grid`, then this is what I would use. But it doesn't. The first thing I tried was:               With[         {div={False, Join[Table[False, {n, d - 1}], {Dashed}], False}},         {{Grid[M,Dividers->{div,div}]}}//MatrixForm     ]      where the `{{stuff}}//MatrixForm` is simply to get the parentheses. The problem with this is that if your matrix is big (d>2) and certain entries of your matrix are big expressions, then they do an ugly line wrap thing. To counter this, I call `{{TableForm[#]}}&` on each element of the matrix first:               With[         {div = {False,Join[Table[False, {n, d - 1}], {Dashed}],False}},          {{             Grid[Map[TableForm[{{#}}] &, M, {2}],Dividers -> {div, div}]         }} // MatrixForm     ]      but this is a hack. So I suppose my questions are: What Form do `TableForm` and `MatrixForm` use on each of their elements, and can I use this here? I've tried `StandardForm` but that's not it. Next, is there in general some better way to do what I am trying to do? **Edit:** As requested, here is an example that illustrates the "ugly line wrap thing":               d = 3;     M = Table[Expand[(a + b)^RandomInteger[4]], {i, d^2}, {j, d^2}];
