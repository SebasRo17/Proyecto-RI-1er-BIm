We find it relatively easy to hire developers to work on various projects. The problem arises when the project is finished but still needs to be supported. We really battle to get people to join the support team. It's seen as dead- end, career-limiting, boring, second-class etc. Currently, we get round this by getting the project team to assign some of their team to the support team for a while. Part of the assignment is to do a "brain dump" of the project so that the support team understands it. This works as long as the assignment is only for a fixed period. Trying to hire people to work in support full-time is a problem. There are few applications and the calibre is not particularly high. (The financial reality though is that support can be very lucrative for a company and once you get a reputation, you get approached by other companies to do their support even though you weren't involved in the original development.)
