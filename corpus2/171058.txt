So i have to store daily attendance of employees of my organisation from my application . The part where I need some help is, the efficient way to store attendance data. After some research and brain storming I came up with some approaches . Could you point me out which one is the best and any unobvious ill effects of the mentioned approaches. The approaches are as follows   1. Create a single table for whole organisation and store empid,date,presentstatus as a row for every employee everyday.   2. Create a single table for whole organisation and store a single row for each day with a comma delimited string of empids which are absent. I will generate the string on my application.   3. Create different tables for each department and follow the 1 method. Please share your views and do mention any other good methods
