I have a table of data that I want to filter. Any value of zero in the table means that value was not calculated, so it should get populated with the tag "NC". Next the table is filtered for all those values that line within 0.25 of -1.51. Finally the table is cleaned up and "1.51 + NC" gets removed. The series of replacements works just fine, but it is extremely messy and unclear. Can any one propose a more readable/easier to understand version? In the real version test is a 27 X 27 table.               test = {{0, -1, -1.5, -1.45}}      targets = {ORR -> -1.51, CORedCO -> -1.2, ORedCO -> -1.25, HER -> -0.24}          Replace[Replace[       Replace[test , a_ /; a == 0 -> "NC", {2}] - ORR /.         targets, a_ /; Abs[a] >= 0.25 -> 0, {2}],       a_ /; a == (-ORR /. targets) + "NC" -> "NC", {2}]      the correct output is:               {"NC", 0, 0.01, 0.06}}
