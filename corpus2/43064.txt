I'm trying to do a `LogLogPlot` of the following function:               fun[t_, n_, ρ_, λ_, μ_] := (         1 - NIntegrate[(E^(s*(-λ - μ))*BesselI[1, 2*s*Sqrt[λ*μ]])/(s*Sqrt[ρ]),        {s, 0, t}]^(n))      Which works only when I use `Plot`. For example,               Manipulate[Plot[fun[t, j, 1/2, 0.5, 1], {t, 0, 50}, PlotRange -> {0, 1}],                {{j, 0.5, "n"}, 1.0, 1000, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]      But when I try to do a `LogLogPlot`, which is done with this code,               Manipulate[LogLogPlot[fun[t, j, 1/2, 0.5, 1], {t, 0.0001, 50}, PlotRange -> {0, 1}],                {{j, 0.5, "n"}, 1.0, 1000, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]      then things get crazy and _Mathematica_ outputs a bunch of errors. I'm not sure what I am doing wrong and any help with this matter would be much appreciated.
