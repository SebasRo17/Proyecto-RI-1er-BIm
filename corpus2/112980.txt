Currently, I enjoy my Java 101 class. I have some ideas for apps that I'd like to make and with time and work I think the process of developing an application from the ground up will work out fine. When I get my Java app(s) up and running - will it be easy to find a place where I can offer them for sale? In the Enterprise labor marketplace, I see ads for developers with expertise with J2EE, WebSphere, Hibernate, Spring, etc. As a Java newbie, I'm aware that I can forget about ever qualifying for those jobs. An alternative for me might be to make something that I can build a micro- business with. Is there a straightforward way of doing that?
