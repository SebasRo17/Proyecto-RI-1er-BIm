I have some questions for multiroot search for transcendental equations. Is there any clever solution to find all the roots for a transcendental equation in a specific range? Perhaps `FindRoot` is the most efficient way to solve transcendental equations, but it only gives one root around a specific value. For example,               FindRoot[BesselJ[1, x]^2 + BesselK[1, x]^2 - Sin[Sin[x]], {x, 10}]      Of course, one can first `Plot` the equation and then choose several start values around each root and then use `FindRoot` to get the exact value.   1. **Is there any elegant way to find all the roots at once?** Actually, I come up with this question when I solve the eigenequation for optical waveguides and I want to get the dispersion relation. I find `ContourPlot` is very useful to get the curve of the dispersion relation. For example,              ContourPlot[BesselJ[1, x]^2 + BesselK[1, x]^2 - Sin@Sin[a*x] == 0, {x, 0, 10}, {a, 0, 4}]      You can get ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QMIrP.png)   2. **Is there any elegant way to get all the values in the`ContourPlot` for `x` when `a==0` ?**   3. **Is it possible to know how the`ContourPlot` gets all the points shown in the figure? Perhaps we can harness it to get all the roots for the transcendental equation.**
