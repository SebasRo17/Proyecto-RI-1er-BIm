I'm a 25 year old data consultant who is considering returning to school to get a second bachelors degree in computer science or engineering. My interest is data science and machine learning. I use programming as a means to an end, and use languages like Python, R, C, Java, and Hadoop to find meaning in large data sets. Would a computer science or computer engineering degree be better for this? I realize that a statistics degree may be even more beneficial, but I'll be at a school which dosn't have a stats department or a computational math department.
