I need to minimize a function of two parameters that gives two "stress" outputs `{A,B} = f[tau,mu]`. How do I estimate (even roughly), the Pareto front for this problem? (That is, if I'm not mistaking, the set of (tau,mu) for which the ouputs (A,B) is Pareto-optimal. That is, you can't improve A or B without making the other one increasing.) Could it be just one single point? (Just so you know, `f` is a big, long piece of simulation based on several sets of data, and it still takes (after hard work of optimization, compilation and parallelization) something like 1 or 2 seconds to get one point. Therefore, I think any _rough_ estimation method'd be enough :) This is it, thank you guys! -- Iago-lito
