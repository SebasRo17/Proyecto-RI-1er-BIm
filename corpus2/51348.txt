I downloaded the historical stock prices for some stocks in the period 1990-2013 via FinancialData some months ago and computed the financial returns. Now I downloaded the data again for the same stocks in the same period but obtain slightly diffrent returns. Why is this so? I use the same code. These are the historical prices, they should not change. Are the prices being adjusted every couple of moths somehow?
