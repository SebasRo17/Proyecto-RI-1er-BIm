Everybody keeps saying that one of JavaScript's problems is using `+` [example] for string concatenation. Some say the problem is not using `+`, it's type coercion [see the comments from the previous example]. But strongly- typed languages use + for concatenation and coerce types without any problem. For example, in C#:               int number = 1;     MyObject obj = new MyObject();          var result = "Hello" + number + obj;     // is equivalent to     string result = "hello" + number.ToString() + obj.ToString();      So why is it that string concatenation in JavaScript is such a big problem?
