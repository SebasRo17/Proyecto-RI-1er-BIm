In Mathematica 9, typing in an input alias such as `intt` would result in the keyboard cursor automatically positioned within the first `SelectionPlaceholder` and ready to type inside it. However, in Mathematica 10 when I type it the keyboard cursor is placed to the side of the selection placeholder. Is anyone else experiencing this? In MMA10, how do you go creating a placeholder so that when you type the alias the keyboard cursor is already positioned within the first box?
