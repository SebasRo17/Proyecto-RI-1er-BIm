I'm diving into RoR and I see that the current version of Rails (3.0.5) works with both 1.8.7 and 1.9.2. Currently, I have both versions of Ruby installed using RVM, but I'm wondering which version I should be using as I dive into Rails and start developing apps. I suppose I'd prefer to use the newest version (1.9.2), but I don't know the technologies well enough to know pros/cons of using either. Thanks so much!
