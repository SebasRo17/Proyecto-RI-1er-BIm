I am currently a full-stack web developer working mainly in Ruby/Rails/Javascript. The languages I use on a daily basis (ruby, css, javascript, php) are great, but they are very dynamic, high level languages. I would like to learn a lower level, preferably statically-typed, non memory- managed, language that gets me closer to the underlying architecture. However, I would like to approach this language from the angle of a web developer, and hopefully utilize the knowledge I gain to make me a better web developer. Any advice?
