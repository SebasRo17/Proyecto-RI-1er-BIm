I developed a e-commerce site for a major company. I did not create some kind of a document to show how the data flows between pages. I used: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ExpressionEngine, plugins Modules and some other web technologies When I go to an interview I want to show my site and explain how it works and how I developed the site. Usually I go page by page and explain how the site works. Is there a nice creative way to explain how the site works?
