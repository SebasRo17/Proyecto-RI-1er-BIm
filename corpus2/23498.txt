I am interested in the roots of this function:               f[M_, b_] := 1 - (2 M Gamma[2, 0, (1/M + b M)/Sqrt[b]])/(1/M + b M)      for fixed values of b. In particular I want the value of b at which the function of M stops having roots. My code to do this is:               Do[s = FindRoot[f[m, b], {m, n}][[1, 2]]; Print[s]; n = s + .5;, {b, .005, 1000, 5}]      It seems to work but I'm not sure how to keep trying new values of b until there are no more solutions, instead of trying bigger and bigger b_max (in this case 1000). Also I get some error messages from FindRoot; is this something to worry about? How accurate is this code? Thanks!
