Is there a _Mathematica_ implementation for computing the Ehrhart polynomial of a convex polytope which is specified either by its vertices or by a set of inequalities? I am interested in knowing this because I understand that Ehrhart's polynomial for a polytope will determine the number of integer points inside this polytope. Alternatively if someone knows of an existing method to count the number of integer points inside a convex polytope (described by its vertices or a set of inequalities), it would be equally helpful.
