I'm writing a game that has a lot of time based aspects. I use time to help estimate player positions when the network stalls and packets aren't going through (and the time between packet's being received and not). It's a pacman type game in the sense that a player picks a direction and can't stop moving, so that system makes sense (or at least I think it does). So I have two questions: 1) How do I sync the clocks of the games at the start since there is delay in the network. 2) Is it okay NOT to sync them and just assume that they are the same (my code is time-zone independent). It's not a super competitive game where people would change their clocks to cheat, but still. The game is being programmed in Java and Python (parallel development as a project)
