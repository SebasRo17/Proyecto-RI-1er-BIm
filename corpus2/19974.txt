Many IDEs have the ability to spit out automatically written pieces of code. For example, it might generate a getter/setter pair for you. I wonder whether it isn't an attempt to work around some flaws in the language. If your IDE can figure out what the code should be without your help, why can't the compiler? Are there cases where this is a really good idea? What kind of code generation does your IDE provide? Would the same thing be better provided as a feature of the language?
