There are some types of bugs which are very hard to reproduce, happen very rarely and seemingly by random. It can happen, that I find a possible cause, fix it, test the program, and can't reproduce the bug. However, as it was impossible to reliably reproduce the bug and it happened so rarely, how can I indicate this in a bugtracker? What is the common way of doing it? If I set the **`status`** to fixed, and the **`solution`** to fixed, it would mean something completely fixed, wouldn't it? Is it common practice to set the **`status`** to fixed and the **`solution`** to open, to indicate to the testers, that "it's probably fixed, but needs more attention to make sure" ? **Edit:** most (if not all) bugtrackers have two properties for the status of a bug, maybe the names are not the same. By **`status`** I mean _new, assigned, fixed, closed, etc._ , and by **`solution`** I mean _open (new), fixed, unsolvable, not reproducible, duplicate, not a bug_ , etc.
