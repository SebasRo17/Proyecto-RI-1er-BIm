We got some code in a git repository that's used along different projects (with git different repositories), the problem is that we got now so many different projects that's difficult to track which projects will be affected and how when there is a change in the shared module. Is there any way to find classes and methods usages along different git repositories? Or who would you manage an architecture like that?
