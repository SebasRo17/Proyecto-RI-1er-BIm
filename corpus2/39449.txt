A recent project I worked on was proven to be severely underestimated by the architect. The estimate was out by at least 500%. Unfortunately I was brought onto the project after the estimate had been signed off with the customer. As senior dev, I quickly realised that the functional and technical spec. contained some huge gaps and uncertanties. As a result I felt compelled to call an emergency meeting with the business and technical directors to let them know the reality. As first and foremost a developer, I found this a very stressful and difficult situation. The "business" accused IT of being incompetent and being the messenger I received a few "bullets". The customer threatened to cancel the account, however to date the project is still unfinished and I am no longer directly involved with it. The architect was a nice guy socially, but based on this episode was either simply incompetent or there were large sales/business pressures influencing his estimate. So, as programmers, what is your experience of this sort of situation and how would you advise dealing with it?
