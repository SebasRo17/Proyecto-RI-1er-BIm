I need to use a long text as sample. Afterwards with an algorithm I will take a substring of it whose length is fixed (passed as parameter), but the startIndex is random, therefore each time it should take a different portion of that text. However I would take, if possible, a standard text as sample for my application. Looking in internet it is almost always used the Lorem Ipsum text. Can this be considered "standard" or is there a rela standard one? Thanks
