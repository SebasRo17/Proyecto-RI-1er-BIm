The Mathematica UI colourizes the FourierParameters in the following               Clear[x, y]     g[x_, y_] = x^2 y ;     f[x_, y_] =      FourierSeries[x^2 y, {x, y}, {4, 4}, FourierParameters -> {1, 2 Pi}]      as in the following ![colorized input](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F7FOh.png) "Why color" on right click says it is excess arguments, but the resulting series computation matches nicely, and returns without error, so this seems like a UI colorizing bug to me.
