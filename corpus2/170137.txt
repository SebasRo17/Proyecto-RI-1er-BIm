We are initiating a Spring + Primefaces project and the first problem we have encountered concerns storing the XHTML pages into the WEB-INF folder. When we use a faces form in a view located inside the WEB-INF folder, then the `commandButton` does not execute the managed bean method.                <h:form id="loginForm">         <p:commandButton action="#{LoginMgr.doLogin()}" value="Login"/>      </h:form>      Our bean:               <bean id="LoginMgr" name="LoginMgr" class="com.tesipro.channelmanager.business.implemented.CMLoginManager">     </bean>      In fact we think the problem is that with JSF, the pages are rendered using a link to the same page as the action of the form, so if the page is located in WEB-INF it is not publicly accessible. We know that having all our XHTML views in the web folder instead of WEB-INF actually solves the issue, but we would like to store that pages into WEB-INF.
