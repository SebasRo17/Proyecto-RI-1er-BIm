For instance if I had a program with a bunch of methods.                       public class Dog{                           public boolean ishappy{..}                      public int weight{...}                       public static void main{             Dog Max = new Dog             Max.ishappy}}      Is it best to use the main portion of the code to test, or write a completely separate program, which would be a client of the dog class, to test my code?
