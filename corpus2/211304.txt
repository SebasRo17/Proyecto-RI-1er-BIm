I've found a lot of things about embedding Lua into Python, but I was wondering is is possible to embed Python into Lua? I've searched for a while, and couldn't find anything on it, so maybe some of the StackExchange community knows. It's not a big deal if it _isn't_ possible, but if it is it could be really awesome for a Lua game I am currently working on, using LÃ–VE. Thanks! :)
