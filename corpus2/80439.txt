I see that most of the apps that include heavy GUI content are usually developed in C++. Most of the games/browsers are coded in C++. Can't we just develop better GUI apps with the latest dynamic languages? I know java wouldn't be a great choice. But what about languages like python which are natively built on C? Aren't the latest languages supposed to be better than their ancestors? Why do we still have to prefer the age old C++ over the latest languages? And I would also like to know, what is it that is responsible in C++, for the better speed of processing GUI? On the other hand what is it that the other latest languages lack?
