I was double checking the URL for the CDN version of jQuery this morning, and noticed that there are three different locations now. Is having multiple networks hosting a product bad, or even self-defeating? I thought a primary advantage is that as more and more sites use a CDN version, that the odds the library being cached in the browser keep going up. If the CDN is set up properly, and a user is using a decent browser, then the network doesn't even get accessed for a cached file. In the case with jQuery, does't having having three CDNs lower the cache hit rate by 1/3? Am I missing something here?
