I am a founder and only developer of an open-source software designed for a small subset of enterprises. It was originally developed for and now runs at one of businesses of the type it was designed for. It's my biggest project and I wanted to make something even bigger of it. Creating a software developing company and selling the product is not an option to me, so I decided to make the project open-source and sell the deployment and support services to enterprises in my area. The problem I faced is that I can't find developers to contribute to the project. Most articles and books on growing open-source community state that developer arrive from the users base, however my project's users base is small and is not related to IT. So it's really unlikely that one of my customers will happen to be an opensource enthusiast who happen to know the stack of technologies I use. I have been thinking about it for a long time, and seems like the only way to attract someone to collaboration is to look for programmers in my area and offer them to cooperate in both development and commercialization of the project. No one else would be interested in contributing to my project. _Is that correct and no other option exists?_ The generalized question is: **How do opensource projects with small, non-IT users base (like enterprise software projects) find developers to collaborate?**
