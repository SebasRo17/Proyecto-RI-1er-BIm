For a small amount of background, I am currently working on an undergraduate research project in Combinatorial Geometry and I'm working on a case analysis for embedding spherical simplicial 2-complexes in $\mathbb{S}^2$ and looking at their properties as they relate to tuples of spheres in arbitrary sphere packings. If that made no sense, no problem. I want to show that there does _not_ exist a solution to the equation:               a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i == 16 π - 33 ArcCos[1/3] - ω      where               ω = π - 4 ArcCos[1/3] +      2 ArcCos[(2 (1/2 + 1/8 (-1 - 3 Cos[4 ArcCos[1/3]])))/Sqrt[     3 (1 - 1/16 (1 + 3 Cos[4 ArcCos[1/3]])^2)]]      With some bounds on $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i$. I have tried inputting this into Mathematica as follows (with $\omega$ defined in a previous command)               FindInstance[         a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i == 16 π - 33 ArcCos[1/3] - ω &&          ArcCos[1/3] < a < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < b < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < c < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < d < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < e < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < f < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < g < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < h < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3] &&          ArcCos[1/3] < i < 2 π - ArcCos[1/3],          {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i}, Reals     ]      It returns an input of `{}` which means that _Mathematica_ couldn't find any solutions. This is a very good thing for me, but how can I formalize the fact that no such solutions exists other than "Mathematica couldn't find any solutions using the `FindInstance` command"?
