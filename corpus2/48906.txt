I was just wondering if this is a known bug. When I want to get basic help using the `?` command before some function name, it typically works for a while, but I've noticed that after I've computed some stuff (like, around 150 or so inputs), _Mathematica_ doesn't pull up the help, but instead just lists the attributes of the command. I'm running version 9.0.1 on OS 10.9.3, but this was also happening on an entirely different system with an older OS (10.6.8 I believe). If I restart the kernel, it works again. If I can reproduce the problem, I will post a screenshot. * * * **Addendum**. I have now been able to take a screenshot of the issue: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4XdjX.png)
