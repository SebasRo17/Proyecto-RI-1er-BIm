I want to create my own Dropbox clone (for learning purposes - only the Windows app) and am looking for some tips. Currently, I use the `FileSystemWatcher` to check if there's a change, then use `rsync` to sync all the data. Now, how does this work with multiple computers? If computer A changes a file, it should be pushed to computer B (and vice versa). My questions are:   * Do I need to create a push notification system or are there (better) alternatives so I know if data has to be pulled (as in a file has changed on the server)?   * Dropbox has the green tick and a blue sync icon. How can this be done? How do I know which files are being uploaded/downloaded (if `rsync`-ing the whole directory)?
