Is there a position in companies (and which ones?) where the role is writing some code along with going on to the seminars to connect with other developers who maybe the clients of your/company's product? I'd like to get out of the cubicle writing code style. I am already a member of some meetups and go there regularly but would like to get into a job where the requirement is to connect and share. I am not sure what kind of companies have such a position and what are these called. I am a programmer with sufficient web development experience. Thanks.
