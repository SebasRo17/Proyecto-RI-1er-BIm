Still present in version 10. * * * I've run into a `Grid` layout problem for which I don't know a solution. I want to specify alignment to a specific character such as a decimal _and_ an `ItemSize` on a per-`Item` basis. When I try to do this the decimal ends up on the right edge of the field rather than somewhere in the middle. My application is part of a larger, more complex Grid layout but here is a simple illustration:               gridIt[itemopts__] :=      Module[{x},       x = {{1.234, 12.34}, {123.4, 1234.}, {1234, 1.234}};       x = Map[Item[#, itemopts] &, x, {2}];       x = Prepend[x, {"Title", SpanFromLeft}];       Grid[x, Alignment -> {Center, Center}, Dividers -> All]      ]          gridIt[Alignment -> "."]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wiCqi.png)               gridIt[Alignment -> ".", ItemSize -> 4.4]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J2LI3.png) Why does this happen and how can I work around it?
