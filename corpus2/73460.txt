I was asked this in an interview test. I did okay on the test but didn't know enough to answer this question. I am curious to know what data structures I can use to query the data quickly. Basically the idea is there would be road sections (lines, made up of points) stored in some kind of data structure. It should be quick to query which road sections (or points) are within a certain distance from a point (radius).
