I don't know how to get into this area, or more specifically, become a website maker. Here's what I now   * html   * some java script   * C#   * and a little of everything else (php, css, xhtml, ect.) I've been on w3schools.com for a while reading and doing the tutorials and I've become much more knowledgeable about websites since I started. But when I compair what I've learned from w3schools to a website template I downloaded I notice things in this template that w3schools never even mentioned. What I'm wondering is whats the best way to go about becoming a web coder on your own, would it continuing w3schools be good? Or just download template read through them and figure out how the code works? One more question, I noticed these all use SQL, how do I go about learning SQL? and sorry, I lied, one more question, whats the best step process when learning web code? like what order, html then css then php? or html then xhtml then css? that kinda thing. thanks, Robert Edit: A website like this is my goal in this area: geforce.com Do you think making a website like this is difficult from a expert's view?
