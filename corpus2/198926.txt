I am working on a project using **MetaIO SDK (AREL)**. It works fine with all the files in the package (ipa), but I'm trying to download an animation automatically using a web service. It will be stored in the document directory. > Since AREL uses a javascript file, I need to give the javascript file the > address for the document directory, but I don't have any access to the iOS > (because Metaio does not give me direct access to the webview as there isn't > any other http request so cant use delegate). All i need is > window.MyImagePath = "/Users/mac/Library/Application Support/iPhone > Simulator/6.0/Applications/E02C5AE0-DFF0-4803-8C7F-134023077BD0/Documents/placeholder.png" In my JS file which is not in the document directory. I tried sending this information through the clipboard (safari allows clip board access only when paste event occurs) and through a web service which is not helpful either. Can any suggest a better solution please?
