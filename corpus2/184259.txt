I came across this about CLISP: *"it all-but-forces your code to be released as GPL" here, when looking for a good Common Lisp implementation. **How can a language force a license on your code?** Is this just FUD? I'm asking because I really don't speak "legalese" so maybe there's something I don't understand here... I get it that the language is GPL and it compiles to a form of bytecode, but can't I have my program with whatever licences I want? * * * EDITED: CMUCL -> CLISP (had my head in the wrong place when I wrote the question first time, sorry...)
