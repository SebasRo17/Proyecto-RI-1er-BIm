I'm trying to plot, given a list of words, how many words belongs to each language. I'm using the following code:               Total /@ Transpose@        ParallelMap[         Function[word,           Length@DictionaryLookup[{#, word}] & /@ DictionaryLookup[All]] ,          wordList]      I am finding it way too slow, the lengths of the lists of words which I am using are about 45000 (sample file: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35192406/words.txt) Is DictionaryLookup really slow? Does it use Internet? How can I speed up my function?
