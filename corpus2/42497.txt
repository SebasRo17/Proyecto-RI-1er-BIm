I have Mathematica 9 installed on two Windows Server 2008 R2 machines. Now i want to try using one of them as a frontend with local kernels and the other one for remote kernels. OpenSSH 6.5 for Windows is installed on both machines and key authentication is configured without a passphrase. SSH connection works normally. Here is the frontend configuration. In Preferences -> Parallel -> Remote Kernels i Add Host and use the custom launch command:               ssh -l username `1` "c:/progra~1/wolfra~1/mathematica/9.0/mathkernel.exe -mathlink -linkmode Connect `4` -linkname '`2`' -subkernel -noinit >& /dev/null &      For test purposes i set 2 remote and 2 local kernels in settings. After that in the notebook i try to call               Parallel`Settings`$MathLinkTimeout = 40     LaunchKernels[]      and launch Task Manager on both machines. At first two cmd windows appear and instantly close. Then i can see that two MathKernel.exe processes start on BOTH machines, but after nearly 20 seconds kernels shut down on remote machine. Local kernels stay running. After timeout i see an error output.               SubKernels`Protected`kernelFlush::time: Operation LinkWrite timed out after 40 seconds.     KernelObject::rdead: Subkernel connected through remote[1.1.1.1] appears dead. >>     SubKernels`Protected`kernelFlush::time: Operation LinkWrite timed out after 40 seconds.     KernelObject::rdead: Subkernel connected through remote[1.1.1.1] appears dead. >>     Out[9]= {KernelObject[7,local],KernelObject[8,local],$Failed,$Failed}      What am i missing? A solution would be greatly appreciated. Update: According to Szabolcs's comments i tried some other things.   1. My ssh command really had an open quote - removed.   2. Changed /dev/null redirections to ssh -f and -n keys.   3. Changed mathkernel.exe to math.exe in the path   4. Tried this solution. It works, so it's not a problem of connection or firewall. So now my ssh command looks like:               ssh -f -n user@remote_ip c:/progra~1/wolfra~1/mathematica/9.0/math -mathlink -linkmode Connect -linkprotocol TCPIP -linkname 'some_port@local_ip,some_port2@local_ip' -subkernel -noinit      And it doesn't work with the same behavior. When i try to run this command in the command line, math.exe starts on remote machine and then closes itself. After that on the local machine in the command line i see this message:               LinkConnect::linkc:     -- Message text not found -- (     LinkObject[some_port@local_ip,some_port2@local_ip, 3, 1])
