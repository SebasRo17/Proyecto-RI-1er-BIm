Inside my development team there are a lot of tooling/utility scripts around all members. Those scripts are mainly for specific tasks and shouldn't be part of our SCM (perforce). How should we organize those tooling scripts and snippets to spread them and let other members have access to them? Are there any good tools to share, organize and documentate scripts and snippets inside a team? Cheers.
