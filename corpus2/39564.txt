Systemmodeler v. 3.0.2. does not work anymore with Mac OX 10.9. Model centre works fine but simulation centre produce an error message. "error: No executable generated./var/folders/2g/dfgpd6_n45x3bfg12phwn7v00000gn/T/sme_1388340148_1316277068.exe" Also, in preferences: system modeller cannot find the compiler G++ in use/bin although it is there. Same problem if I try to run the model in mathematica. Everything was working fine with the previous version of Mac OSX Seems there is a compatibility issue between systemmodeler and OSX 10.9? Any fix coming?
