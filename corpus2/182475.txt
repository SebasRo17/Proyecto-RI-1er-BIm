I am newbie to TDD (writing first project following TDD practices). I have fairly basic interface `IProfiler` and an implementation `Profiler`.               interface IProfiler     {       bool IsBusy {get;}       long Elapsed {get;}     }      A Simple Test                   IProfiler profiler = default(Profiler);         [TestInitialize]         public void Initialize()         {             profiler = new Profiler();         }              [TestMethod]         public void ProfilerInitializationTest()         {             Assert.AreEqual(false, profiler.IsBusy);             Assert.AreEqual(true, profiler.ElapsedMilliSeconds == default(long));         }      The question is : As I will have more state, Number of asserts will increase. Should I keep separate Assert to test each field or should i include all here, or should I group into 3-4 similar asserts?
