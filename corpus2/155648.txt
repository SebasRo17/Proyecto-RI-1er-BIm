I need an advice about SVN usage. I use Tortoise SVN on my client to deal with a project I am working on. The probjem is that I have two set of bugs top fix on the project. One to deploy till 5 days, and one to deploy till 10 days. I am going to solve all the bugs before the 5fth days but I do not want to deploy the last 5 before the release date (till 10 days). How can I work on two separate codes and the merge all the modification? Is it possible? I have to create a branch?
