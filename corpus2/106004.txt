tl;dr: What is a less extreme (but still noticeable) alternative to the word "fluent", when saying e.g. "I am fluent in C++/Python/whatever?" * * * I think I can call myself "fluent" in C#, because I know the language and runtime very well, and I'm very familiar with the .NET framework's APIs and classes, etc. I would _like_ to claim the same thing for Python and C++. But while I _can_ program in Python (I did so for an entire summer, making a website with Django), for example, I would not call myself _fluent_ because **my code isn't always "Pythonic"** (e.g. using `map`/`filter` vs. list comprehensions), and I'm not too intimate with some aspects of the language and standard library yet (e.g. the introspection API, etc.). Is there a word or phrase I can use on e.g. a resume to describe what I know? I can think of "very familiar with", but is there a better word/phrase I can use?
