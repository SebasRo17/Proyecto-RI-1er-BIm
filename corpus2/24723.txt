Using Netlink, when we have more users than _Mathematica_ licenses (used in a pool), we get messages such as: > Error code: 11. Connected MathLink program has closed the link, but there > might still be data underway, that I translate into a more user friendly message. There's a Wolfram License Management Monitor on a server and it generates these reports: Ref: http://uczelnia.mazovia.edu.pl/info/mathematica.html ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j7zf2.png) Unfortunately the License Server is locked down (its still in the network unlike this: How to access Mathematica license server (being outside of the local network)) and I can't install IIS or a Windows Service to retrieve the License Report on demand. Is there a command that can be used in _Mathematica_ (via Netlink or Front- End) to get this information? ### Update As per http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/program/monitorlm.html, I can't get this command to work:               monitorlm  "servername"
