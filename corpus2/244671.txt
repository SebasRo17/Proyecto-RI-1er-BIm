I am trying to learn RoR and develop a webapp. I have a few models I have thought of for this app, and they are fairly embedded. For example (please excuse my lack of RoR syntax):               Model: textbook         title:string         type:string         has_many: chapters          Model: chapter         content:text         has_one: review_section          Model: review_section         title:string         has_many: questions         has_many: answers , through :questions          Model: questions        ...          Model: answers             ...      **My question is, with the example I gave, should I start at the top model (textbook) or the bottom most (answers)?**
