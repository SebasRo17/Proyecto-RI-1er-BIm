Recently, we had a nice question which brought up an issue that I believe is a bug. In the tutorial Defining Output Formats is an example at the end which doesn't make sense > This specifies the `TeXForm` for the symbol `x`. >   >   >     Format[x, TeXForm] := "{\\bf x}" >   > > The output format for `x` that you specified is now used whenever the TeX > form is needed. >   >   >     TeXForm[1 + x^2] >     (* x^2+1 *) >   The given output is wrong and should instead be something like `{\bf x}^2+1`. Therefore, I tested this with my colleague on all versions available to us and the output below shows, that it only worked back in version 4.2. Is there a simple reason why `Format` does not work as advertised? ### Version 4.2               Format[x,TeXForm]:="{\\bf x}";     TeXForm[1+x^2]     (* 1 + {{\bf x}}^2 *)      ### Version 5.1               Format[x,TeXForm]:="{\\bf x}";     TeXForm[1+x^2]     (* x^2+1 *)      ### Version 6.0               Format[x, TeXForm] := "{\\bf x}";     TeXForm[1 + x^2]     (* x^2+1 *)      ### Version 7.0               Format[x, TeXForm] := "{\\bf x}";     TeXForm[1 + x^2]     (* x^2+1 *)      ### Version 8.0               Format[x, TeXForm] := "{\\bf x}";     TeXForm[1 + x^2]     (* x^2+1 *)      ### Version 9.0               Format[x, TeXForm] := "{\\bf x}";     TeXForm[1 + x^2]     (* x^2+1 *)
