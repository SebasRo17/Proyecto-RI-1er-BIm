Is there such a thing as too much uniformity? Where I work we of course have standards including naming conventions, architectures, frameworks to leverage etc. However lately there has been a lot of critiquing of things I would consider more style. For example writing `if` statements in multiple lines vs one line, using the c# `??` null-coalescing operator instead of say `== null`, amounts of spacing for indentations etc. It seems to me this starts getting more into a personal style choice and doesn't need to be uniform across a team or company. What one person thinks reads more clearly another may not. Is there some value to this "extra" uniformity?
