I am an R user and am totally new to _Mathematica_. I am trying to find the roots of a system of two equations over a series of paramter values and plot the results. I can do the computation but would love to know how I can work with the results without exporting them from _Mathmatica_.                alphas = Table[               FindRoot[ {               S1*(1 - Exp[-R01*(1 - alpha)*Zinf1/N1 - R02*alpha*Zinf2/N2]) - Zinf1,               S2*(1 - Exp[-R02*(1 - alpha)*Zinf2/N2 - R01*alpha*Zinf1/N1]) - Zinf2} == 0,                {Zinf1, 10000},               {Zinf2, 10000}], {alpha, 0, 1, .1}]      This seems to return a list of named lists (each element being something like `{Zinf1 -> 9403.65, Zinf2 -> 9800.66}`). I would like to plot all the `Zinf1`'s vs. `alphas` and thought something like `ListPlot[]` could do it, but it seems to have issues with the name:               ListPlot::optx: Unknown option Zinf1 in ListPlot[Zinf1->9403.65,Zinf1->9475.33,Zinf1-    9533.97,Zinf1->....      Any idea how to get this data into an easier (perhaps unnamed) form?
