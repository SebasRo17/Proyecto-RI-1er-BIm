If you borrow code from some source, it is probably best to cite it (like "adapted from [source]"). However, if you take let's say you borrowed this function (example in C++):               void doWork()     {          cout << "Doing work!\n" << endl;     }      and now you editted it to be like this:               void doWork()     {          string name = "";               cout << "Starting work...\n" << endl;          cout << "Hello user. What is your name?" << endl;               cin >> name;          ...     }      Would you still have to say "adapted from [source]" or something like that? Or are you in the safe zone? **Note** : I am specifically wondering how this applies to copyrighted (and open source) code
