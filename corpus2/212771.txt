This would seem to be a pretty basic question, but I can't seem to find appropraite guidelines for it. What is the "restful" way of `POST`ing a relationship between two entities that are not necessarily parent/child. As an example, consider customers and orders. One could create a customer with a `POST` to `/customer`. However, what is the best way to create the order? One example would be a `POST` to `/customer/123/order`, but what if the order isn't assigned to a customer directly, and could exist on its own (in the case of a web-cart that allows for "anonymous" checkout)? Is the right way, then, to do `POST /order?customerId=123` Further, consider the case that an order can be submitted separately from payments (let's say we are invoicing a customer). You could create the order (per either of the methods above), but how would we make the payment? `POST /order/123/payment` or `POST /payment?orderId=123` (if we assume that a payment can be made for something other than an order, and one might want to get information about an order/payment without knowing the specific customer).
