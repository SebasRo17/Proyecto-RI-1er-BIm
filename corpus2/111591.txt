For example, is it copyright infringement if I write a class called Random with the exact same purpose and method signatures as Microsoft's .Net System.Random class? Does it make a difference what language it's written in? In this case I want to write a Random class for use in ActionScript, which lacks a built-in seeded PRNG class. If anyone has good links or reference suggestions for understanding what aspects of software are protected that's great too. And yes I know this isn't the place for "real" legal advice. If anyone goes to court pointing to a public message board as precendence--shame on them.
