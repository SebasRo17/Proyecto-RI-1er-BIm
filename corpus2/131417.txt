In my quest to better my development skills I learn new design patterns. In sample projects or personal projects it's really easy to adapt new patterns into my code. However at work I have a large code base that I am responsible for architecting and maintaining. This question is focused on writing consistent and maintainable code will still providing business value. When I learn new patterns I find myself conflicted on how to proceed moving forward on an existing codebase. **Do I go back update my code to use my new pattern ?**   * This has the downside of not providing a ton of business value and might not be the best way to efficiently utilize my time. **Do I move forward and use my new pattern/technique in any new code ?**   * This has the downside of being inconsistent, thus making my code less maintainable and setting a poor precedent for new team members.  Optionally I could just catalog the new technique in my head but not implement it. I really dislike this option though.
