I have a bunch of methods that are commonly used everywhere. Right now the codefile is named globals, to represent the fact that they are... in fact... global. However, I do not like this. I want to group these into a class and pass an interface around. I'll make only one instance, but I'm not falling into the singleton trap here. First of all, what should I name the class. I want to avoid the globals name because I'm afraid maintainers would get the wrong idea. Also, how should I consider splitting up such a set of methods so that behavior can change and adapt? The set of methods contains stuff like:   * Conversion tables   * Clipboard interaction   * Managing built fonts   * Common drawing methods   * Providing an interface with access to often used resources
