Here is a graph whose adjacency matrix is               m = {     {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},      {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0},      {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1},      {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1},      {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1},      {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1},      {1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0},      {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0},      {1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1},      {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0}     };      then how to compute its Lovász number in _Mathematica_? I think this is a common question. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated! Here are three ways to do the computation, which is the best one to compile in Mathematica and how? 1.Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. Let $A$ range over all $n*n$ symmetric matrix|symmetric matrices such that $a_{ij}=1$ whenever $i=j$ or $ij∉E$, and let $λ_{max}(A)$ denote the largest eigenvalue of $A$. Then an alternative way of computing the Lovász number of $G$ is as follows: $$ \vartheta(G) = \min_A \lambda_\text{max}(A). $$ 2.The following method is dual to the previous one. Let $B$ range over all $n*n$ symmetric positive semidefinite matrix such that $b_{ij'}=0$ for every $ij ∈ E$ and $Tr(B)=1$. Here $Tr$ denotes trace (the sum of diagonal entries) and $J$ is the $n*n$ matrix of ones. Then $$ \vartheta(G) = \max_B \operatorname{Tr}(BJ). $$ Note that $Tr(BJ)$ is just the sum of all entries of $B$. 3.The Lovász number can be computed also in terms of the complement graph $\bar{G}$. Let $d$ be a unit vector and $V = (v_i | i ∈ V)$ be an orthonormal representation of $\bar{G}$. Then $$ \vartheta(G) = \max_{d,V} \sum_{i \in V} (d^\mathrm{T} v_i)^2. $$ Though PlatoManiac provided a helpful link, that way can not go through on my computer.
