Having taken a course in Operating Systems I'm interested in expanding my knowledge of the Linux kernel and practice working with a big system. What are some interesting but not overly difficult projects I can try my hand at? EDIT: a bit of background on what I did do with the kernel.   * Implemented a new scheduling policy   * Implemented User Threads and a corresponding mutex library (not really kernel hacking but contained kernel related theory)
