**Background:** Recently I'm trying to deal with some Chinese characters which belongs to the **CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B** block. The motive comes from some further interest following a former question, and some ideas of using Mathematica for typesetting ancient Chinese scriptures. **Edit:** Here is some sample code which looks fine at first sight ( The Unicodes of the three characters involved here are `x20027`, `x200D5` and `x20137`. The setting of the `$SystemCharacterEncoding` of my Mathematica is `"CP936"`. ): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/M82qV.jpg) But after saving then closing the notebook, I re-opened it, without touching anything, the Front End displays weird now (and note the attendance of the syntax errors): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gt1RE.jpg) It seems the Front End is not able to correctly render them. Furthermore, although I can create a textcell looking fine: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1iHMS.jpg) whose `CellExpression` is:               Cell["\:d840\:dc27\:d840\:dcd5\:d840\:dd37", "Text", CellChangeTimes->{3.5359048507534103`*^9}]      but if I trig `Ctrl+Shift+E` and edit the `CellExpression` directly (eg. deleting the `CellChangeTimes` item, which should not affect the "appearance" of the cell), then convert the cell back to normal status, things get wrong again: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uy3ku.jpg) This kind of problem never happened when dealing with characters from **CJK Unified Ideographs** and **CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A** blocks, so I guess there may be a bug here. So my questions is: While I do realize the `"Unicode"` encoding in Mathematica referring to only 16-bit Unicode while the CJK-B begin with `x20000`, is there any method to render and work with characters from **CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B** correctly?
