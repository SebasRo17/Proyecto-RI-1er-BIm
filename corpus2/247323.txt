I have a database that collects and process large volumes of records However due to the legacy nature of the system im working with (and the powers that be) i need to transfer (processed) records to a different database instance (with some small field modifications along the way) The options i have identified are as follows   * I could set up a schedule task with a stored proc to transfer the records with any logic needed   * The company i work for is insisting i dump records to a file and ftp them and the use some existing logic to poll and insert   * SQL Service broker which seems to have built in fault tolerance, and has facilities to do this actual task Im just wondering what some potential pitfalls of sql service broker might be and is it the right technology for the job Anyone have any suggestions
