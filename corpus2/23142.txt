I've been thinking a lot about the problem of standardization across large companies. For me, the answer is pretty clear: do not arbitrarily standardize on tools just because that's what everyone else does. It's counter-productive. I'm thinking about source control, bug tracking and testing tools primarily. It seems so obvious to me that I can't really think of many good counter- arguments. Some I've thought of :   1. Easier sharing between teams   2. Easier for IT to manage (1) is definitely true if different teams are working on the same codebase/product. But in cases where one team doesn't work directly with the code I don't think is a valid reason. (2) is just kind of pisses me off if that's really an argument. The limitations placed on programmers, I believe, is more burdensome than any extra work piled on to IT. But I'm not an IT guy. I'm hoping for some better arguments than those.
