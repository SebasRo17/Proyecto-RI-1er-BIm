I if there are visual applications for debugging code in popular languages (like C, Pytho, Javascript). By visual I do not mean debugger with UI which is bundled with almost every IDE, I'm rather talking about a debugger that can visualize data and process of changing this data over time. E.g. imagine you're implementing a sort algorithm. It would be very cool to have an application that would save states of the array at each iteration and then would allow you easily go back and forth between states with good animation of insertion/deletion and move. I understand that there maybe no general utility for that. Insetead I expect some environment (like R or MatLab) that can be used to easily create such debugging applications.
