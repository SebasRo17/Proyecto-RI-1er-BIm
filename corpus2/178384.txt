We have an environment based on Microsoft stack (VS2010, SQL Server, etc), and I firmly believe that we could improve productivity a little bit, having more RAM and a faster secondary SSD. What data do you advice to gather so I can solidify my request in such a way the advantages can be unbiasedly demonstrated? Currently we have only 6GB of RAM and slower HD drives, and at home I have a 128 GB SSD in my desktop and 16 GB of RAM (I also think is the max amount of memory supported by our workstations, if we could go bigger then better), so I can feel the difference and it's real. The issue actually is how to get a budget approval from management and spend it wisely to increase productivity.
