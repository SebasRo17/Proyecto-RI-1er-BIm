I am primarily a Python, Java, C++ programmer, and I've gained a recent interest in functional language. I'm thinking of picking up a LISP dialect: Clojure. Now, I've been working through tutorials and whatnot, but I've noticed that beyond syntax differences, I don't feel that I am learning any fundamentally different way of solving problems. So, are there any advantages of learning Clojure after Python in the way I can write programs?
