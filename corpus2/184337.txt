I was just writing an if statement with fairly long property names and came occross this problem. Let say we have an if statement like this:               if(_someViewModelNameThatIsLong.AnotherPropertyINeedToCheck == someValue &&        !_someViewModelNameThatIsLong.ThisIsABooleanPropertyThatIsImportant)     {         //Do something     }      The second property is of a boolean type and it makes no sense to have the stetement like               if(boleanValue == true)      Is there a better way to emphasize the negation then to put the `!` in front. To me it seems like this can easily be overseen when reading the code and may potentialy cause problems with debuging
