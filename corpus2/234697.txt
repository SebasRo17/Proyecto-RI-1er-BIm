I'm a self taught PHP programmer. Because I have no formal training in PHP, I often find my coding style to be considerably different than example code I find on the Internet. I've slowly started adapting some of the more common practices I find. However, before changing my habits, I try to find a good reason to use the new style. I just don't see much reason to change my habit if it isn't actually advantageous. I see a lot of people write PHP code such as :               <h1><?php echo $cTitle; ?></h1>     <div><?php print $cContent; ?></div>      Whereas I generally write :               <?php         echo "<h1>", $cTitle, "</h1>";         print("<div>" . $cContent . "</div>");      What I'm seeing is that people are commonly going in-and-out of PHP, while I'll just use PHP to print/echo the html content along with the PHP variables. Is there a measurable difference between these two methods? Is there a good reason for me to change my ways?
