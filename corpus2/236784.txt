I have a question about Thingiviews license. I have a site that has to do with 3D Printing, it is not done yet but I was wondering if I would be able to use it on my site, The big reason I am asking is because it will be used to show 3D models that will eventually be made and sold, like shapeways kinda, so I am not selling Thingiview but it would be used to show something that will eventually make money. Thingiview is currently licensed under: > GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE and from what I can gather, it seems that what I want to do should be okay, do I just need to give the creator of it credit? I will either way but it seems that is all that is required. Is what I want to do okay (by ok I mean legal)? Also if I want to change it I can do that too right, I have some ideas to add to it. Is there anything I would need to do if I change it a little bit?
