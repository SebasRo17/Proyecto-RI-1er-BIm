I would like to develop iOS apps but due to budgetary issues I can only afford an iPad mini gen1 or iPod touch 5th gen. Is it possible for me to make apps for all iPhones and iPads/iPods using just a single device? Another question is how does the latest iOS7 work on ipad mini gen 1/iPod touch and what are the limitations when working with these devices when compared to an iPhone(My target apps are trivia and endless runner games). Thanks P.S. I do have a mac with xcode on it and I am developing a cocoa app right now and the question is if i can develop for all io7 devices using just one deceive for final testing.
