The only unit tests tactic I'm familiar with is comparing against golden data _ a predefined set of input data for which output is known (preferably including corner cases). I cannot think of any other reasonable way of unit testing. Trying to unit test using arbitrary input data is (at least) as difficult as writing the application itself. Are there any effective tactics for unit testing other than golden data testing? Note: By saying arbitrary data I mean any `syntactically` valid input which a method can accept (including logically invalid inputs).
