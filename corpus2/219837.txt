When starting to learn one new language, we have to choose perfect code style such as types or file name's first letter should be uppercase or lowercase, etc. But when I started to learn C++, I did not find any official common code style as I did for Java. A popular one is Google's, yet someone told me, we should keep the style of our company. But I think that no one will work in one company for a whole life, so it could be better for him to choose a popular common code style if some company's code style is ugly. How should I choose a code style for C++? Is there any official, common, popular code style that is generally used? Can I write C++ code with the style I use for Java? I think Java's code style is perfect.
