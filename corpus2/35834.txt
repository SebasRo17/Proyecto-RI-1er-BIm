Online (i cant remember where) i saw someone mention he wishes programming language has more built in features for tools like documentation and source control. Now i dont understand what needs to be built in for source control since tools like git (sorry but i dont have much experience with others) has everything i need and is very easy to use. Documentation i can understand, perhaps the ability to generate remote procedures calls from source to some kind of IDL would be cool. But really i dont understand what features a programming language can/should have that isnt tied with code generation and syntax (except the two i mention when it comes to libraries). What ideas do you guys have? What is your wishlist?
