Ok so I have made an ORM library for PHP. It uses syntax like so: *(assume that $business_locations is an array)*               Business::type(Business:TYPE_AUTOMOTIVE)->               size(Business::SIZE_SMALL)->               left_join(BusinessOwner::table(), BusinessOwner::business_id(), SQL::OP_EQUALS, Business::id())->               left_join(Owner::table(), SQL::OP_EQUALS, Owner::id(), BusinessOwner::owner_id())->               where(Business::location_id(), SQL::in($business_locations))->               group_by(Business::id())->               select(SQL::count(BusinessOwner::id());      Which can also be represented as:               $query = new Business();     $query->set_type(Business:TYPE_AUTOMOTIVE);     $query->set_size(Business::SIZE_SMALL);     $query->left_join(BusinessOwner::table(), BusinessOwner::business_id(), SQL::OP_EQUALS, $query->id());     $query->left_join(Owner::table(), SQL::OP_EQUALS, Owner::id(), BusinessOwner::owner_id());     $query->where(Business::location_id(), SQL::in($business_locations));     $query->group_by(Business::id());     $query->select(SQL::count(BusinessOwner::id());      This would produce a query like:               SELECT COUNT(`business_owners`.`id`)     FROM   `businesses`            LEFT JOIN `business_owners`              ON `business_owners`.`business_id` = `businesses`.`id`            LEFT JOIN `owners`              ON `owners`.`id` = `business_owners`.`owner_id`     WHERE  `businesses`.`type` = 'automotive'            AND `businesses`.`size` = 'small'            AND `businesses`.`location_id` IN ( 1, 2, 3, 4 )     GROUP  BY `businesses`.`id`        _Please keep in mind that the syntax might not be prefectly correct (I only wrote this off the top of my head)_   * Any way, what do you think of this style of querying?    * Is the first method or second better/clearer/cleaner/etc?   * What would you do to improve it?
