If I had a list, say,               names= {"Andy", "Bob", "Carly", "Sandy", "Jeff", "Tim", "Tom", "Zach"}      and I decide to pick a characteristic only a certain of them have, and my input would be something that works, (or think of it as something `WordData["....",",,,,"]`, and my output would look like:               {{"Andy", {}, {}, {}, {"Jeff", "Tim"}, {}, {"Zach"}}      I know this type of thing probably isn't possible, but just say if it did, how would I only choose the nonempty set? How would I do this using `Select`? I know I should select from my set of names, but not sure (There's probably a different way, but I wanted to continue to practice this function so I can understand it fully).
