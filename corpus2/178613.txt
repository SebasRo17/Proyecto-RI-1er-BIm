I know there are lots of posts for internationalization, but this is something I didn't found while searching. I have a PHP Web application, which is pretty big right now. It's developed actively for 4 years and wasn't built with internationalization in mind. Text is everywhere - in plain HTML, in PHP variables, in echo's, in the DB... Now I'm familiar with the concept of gettext and this is what i plan to use for the internationalization project of the application. However the app is not written in English and here is my question: Should I first translate everything to English while wrapping every string in gettext() function, or I can use my native language as a base? P.S. also any quick suggestions (links maybe) on making my life easier with the whole i18n project will be greatly appreciated!
