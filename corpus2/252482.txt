Is there any terminology for a problem that is caused by a previous wrong decision? For example you build your own framework, with a flawed MVC design. This in turn leads to weird situations when routing requests. A person then asks how to solve the latter problem, while the actual problem is the wrong design of the framework. I've tried searching several descriptions but as I'm looking for the word, it's hard to find anything relevant. It's not one of these Anti-patterns
