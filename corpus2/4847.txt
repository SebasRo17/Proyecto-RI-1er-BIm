Does anyone know how to create a ghost trail effect? For a simple example look at this screenshot: ![Ghosting Effect](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6QriY.png) You can find the actual animation here. What I would ultimately like to see it happen is to make the object move based on whatever equations you specify it. For instance, to make it move around a circle the object should have the position `(cos[t], sin[t])`. Or, lets say you have a list of specified coordinates `{(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn)}`, All I want to be able to see is the trace as an object takes in the coordinates I specify. Here is a simple ball moving without the ghosting effect.               Animate[      Graphics[       Disk[{Cos[u], Sin[u]}, .25],       PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}},       ImageSize -> 400,        Axes -> True      ],      {u, 0, 6}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qp8ew.gif)
