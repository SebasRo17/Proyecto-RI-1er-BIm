I have a problem with RunScheduledTask (new in Mathematica 8). A task that I usually need to do is to set a cron to start at a specific time and repeat itself at the same time every day (or the same minute every hour, and so on...)! Let's make an example: suppose I have to run `Pippo[]` at 5:00 AM every day starting from tomorrow. These are the "logic" steps in my mind to do so:   * calculate the absolute time of tomorrow at 5:00 and save it to `ABSTIME`   * execute `RunScheduledTask[Pippo[], 60*60*24, ABSTIME]` Unfortunately I have discovered that if I make it this way IT WON'T EXECUTE tomorrow at 5:00, but it will start the day after. I tried to set as `ABSTIME` the absolute time of today at 5:00 but it doesn't work either ('cause the ABSTIME is in the past). The only work-around I found is:   * calculate the absolute time of tomorrow at 5:00 and save it to `ABSTIME`   * calculate amount of seconds from now to tomorrow at 5:00 and save it as `SECSREMAINING`   * execute `RunScheduledTask[Pippo[], {SECSREMAINING}]` for the execution of tomorrow   * execute `RunScheduledTask[Pippo[], 60*60*24, ABSTIME]` for all other executions I think this a very "an-elegant" way, do you have any other solution? Or should we mass-warn Wolfram about this and make it change? ;)
