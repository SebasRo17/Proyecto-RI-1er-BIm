I have a list of `{x, y, z}` coordinates from a wavefront sensor I'm working with. However, not all of the imported points have actual values, but they still get imported as `{x, y, "NaN"}`. I'm trying to find a way to get rid of these faulty points, but so far, I can't find a way to identify them. They don't affect some graphs, but I've run into trouble when performing operations on the set of points I've tried several things like `Delete`, `DeleteCases` and `StringTrim`, but to no avail. When I run, `DeleteCases[graph, "NaN"]`, for example, I get back the same set of points. Also, I am using _Mathematica_ 7\. Thanks.
