After reading this post I recalled an old question I once met. We know that we can set default values for variables of a function:               f[u_: 1, v_: 2, w_: 3] := u^2 + v^3 + w^4      We can use the default values like this:               f[]      > 90 like this:               f[u]      > 89 + u^2 and like this:               f[u, v]      > 81 + u^2 + v^3 However, what if I want to call the default value of a variable not at end separately? Something like               f[, v, w]      only gives > Null^2 + v^3 + w^4 while what I want to see is > 1 + v^3 + w^4 Of course it's easy to circumvent, but I still wonder if there's a more straight forward solution.
