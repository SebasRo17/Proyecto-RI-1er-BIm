I have been doing .NET and MS tech/arcitecture for 4+ years. I have reached a dead end in my current job and is considering moving to a new job. Most of the current available jobs in my city are Java based. J2EE and the like. Is it wise to leave all those years of experience and start from scratch in the Java world?
