Can I somehow plot a vector field and the scattered data point associated with each and every vector? Also, is there any way to prevent _Mathematica_ from interpolting the vector field? I am trying to plot this data as a vector field. The data is from a .dat file that includes the following four columns: x-coord, y-coord, vecx, vecy. http://wikisend.com/download/386548/testBC.dat I managed to plot the following with Tecplot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/87dev.png) I am trying to remake this plot in Mathematica               testBC = Import["C:\\...testBC.dat", "Table", "IgnoreEmptyLines" -> True];     testBCx = testBC[[All, 1]];     testBCy = testBC[[All, 2]];     ux = testBC[[All, 3]];     uy = testBC[[All, 4]];     u = Transpose[{ux, uy}];     testbdry = Transpose[{testBCx, testBCy}];     ListVectorPlot[Transpose[{testbdry, u}], PlotRange -> Full,      VectorPoints -> 10, VectorScale -> {0.1, 0.2}]      Results in the following ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/n9b0f.png) _Mathematica_ interpolates the inside of the airfoil. How can I remake the plot from Tecplot, i.e., how can I show the scatter plot of x, y, and the vectors pointing away from every point. Also, I want _Mathematica_ to plot all the vectors as in Tecplot, not to only sample and interpolate.
