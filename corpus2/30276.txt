Recently I changed my furniture in my room and I am trying to find the best position of each part. I am sure that Mathematica could help! I read the LocatorPane, selecting multiple Locators for selecting multiple locators. Then I made some shapes like a triangle (3 Locators), a table (4 Locators) etc. and tried to move them(each shape as a whole) in some direction. My questions are:   * How can one group/ungroup some of the shapes (for examples table + chairs)   * Rotate a shape to a particular angle   * Ensure that two sides of the same or different shapes are in parallel,vertical or tangent?
