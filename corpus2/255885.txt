I am confused why do the server is taking too much time in execution of a following query:               SELECT tbl1.Column1 FROM Table1 AS tbl1      INNER JOIN Table2 AS tbl2 ON tbl2.Column4 = tbl1.Column1      It took about 20 minutes to return the results. MySQL config (my.ini) file looks like the following:                   [mysql]              # CLIENT #         port                           = 3306         socket                         = X:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data\mysql.sock              [mysqld]              # GENERAL #         user                           = mysql         default-storage-engine         = InnoDB         socket                         = X:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data\mysql.sock         pid-file                       = X:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data\mysql.pid              # MyISAM #         key-buffer-size                = 32M         myisam-recover                 = FORCE,BACKUP              # SAFETY #         max-allowed-packet             = 16M         max-connect-errors             = 1000000              # DATA STORAGE #         datadir                        = X:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data\              # BINARY LOGGING #         log-bin                        = X:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data\mysql-bin         expire-logs-days               = 14         sync-binlog                    = 1              # CACHES AND LIMITS #         tmp-table-size                 = 32M         max-heap-table-size            = 32M         query-cache-type               = 0         query-cache-size               = 0         max-connections                = 500         thread-cache-size              = 50         open-files-limit               = 65535         table-definition-cache         = 4096         table-open-cache               = 4096              # INNODB #         innodb-log-files-in-group      = 2         innodb-log-file-size           = 128M         innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit = 1         innodb-file-per-table          = 1         innodb-buffer-pool-size        = 2G              # LOGGING #         log-error                      = X:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data\mysql-error.log         log-queries-not-using-indexes  = 1         slow-query-log                 = 1         slow-query-log-file            = X:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.5.8\data\mysql-slow.log      Both Tables have primary keys.
