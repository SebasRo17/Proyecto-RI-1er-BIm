I want to plot only the vectors that I specify in my list of vectors, and no more. ListVectorPlot plots many of them, namely plots the field extrapolating from my four vectors.I would also like to have the length I give them, that is, if my list is the following: list = {{{-1, -1},{2, -2}}, {{1, -1},{2, 2}}, {{1, 1},{-2,2}}, {{-1, 1},{-2,-2}}}; I would like to have just four vectors at sites {-1,-1},{1,-1},{1,1} and {-1,1} of length Sqrt[2²+2²]. Does anybody know how to do this?
