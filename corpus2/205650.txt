The following IMHO valid java program doesn't compile because the Oracle 1.7 javac compiler thinks there's a possible loss of precision in lines 5 and 6. If you uncomment line 3 and comment out line 4, it compiles fine. Would someone explain why the compiler believes there is a loss of precision on the assignment to either byte `b2` or `b3`?               public class BUG {         public static void main( String[] args ) {             //final byte b1 = 9;             byte b1 = 9;             final byte b2 = -b1;    // fine if line 3 is uncommented and line 4 is commented             final byte b3 = 0 - b1; // fine if line 3 is uncommented and line 4 is commented         }     }      If my sample code is correct, then I'd like to report this as a bug but I can't find out where. Would someone explain what the compiler error message is saying in this case and why it's correct?
