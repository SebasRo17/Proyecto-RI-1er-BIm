This question might only be applicable to entry/junior level positions. Question:   * Let's say you're a Java/Open Source developer. Should you consider positions where the technology stack of the shop is C++/.NET?   * Lets assume that the shop is interested in hiring you because they are impressed by your strong algorithmic skills. And the fact that you are a Java programmer does not matter to them at all. The question is - Should this be an issue that should bother an entry/junior level developer? Should the applicant then make an acceptance decision based on other criteria such as the domain that one would be working on? Perks? Salary? Career growth? etc.?
