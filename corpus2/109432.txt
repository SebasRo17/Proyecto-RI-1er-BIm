Let's say version 2.4.x of Software Package X was released 2 years ago, and was sold up until about 6 months ago. Version 3.1.0 is now out (which fixes a lot of the issues with version 2.4.x), and is the only version actively being sold. In this case, the software is being sold to large businesses, not individuals, so the maintenance effort required is substantial. For how long should the company offer support for version 2.4.x?
