I'm trying to write the expression $$\sum_{\alpha,\beta = 1}^{4}\epsilon_{\mu \nu\alpha\beta}a^{\nu} b^{\alpha} c^{\beta}$$ in Mathematica, where $\epsilon$ is the Levi-Civita symbol and $a$, $b$, $c$ are 4-dimensional vectors. I tried this but the problem is with Levi-Civita as $\mu$ and $\nu$ are not specified in advance               a = {a1, a2, a3, a4};      b = {b1, b2, b3, b4};      c = {c1, c2, c3, c4};          Sum[       LeviCivitaTensor[4][[mu, nu, alpha, beta]] a[[nu]] b[[alpha]] c[[beta]],       {alpha, 1, 4}, {beta, 1, 4}     ]
