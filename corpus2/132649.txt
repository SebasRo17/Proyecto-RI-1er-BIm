What are the design problems in returning a hashtable from a public method when you want to return multiple items instead of creating a class and returning object of that? If it does have problems then under what circumstances it makes sense to do so? How does the answer to this question change depending upon whether the language is dynamic or not? **Edit:** This is to clarify that the keys would be constant and are part of code, not data. Something that we typically create a class for. The question is why would it be wrong to use hashtable instead if creating a class indeed does seem to be the right choice.
