I am looking at someone else's notebook, and when I go to evaluate it, it asks whether I want to evaluate the initialization cells. I would like to look at them first, but "I do not see them here nor there, I do not see them anywhere". How do I reveal these cells, and, for that matter, any other invisible cells in the notebook? I searched (sought?) for "initialization cell/s" and for "invisible cell/s" in the Wolfram documentation, and only found info about cells that don't have visible cell brackets, no info about cells that are completely invisible. Not how to hide my own or reveal someone else's. I found only this: `howto/SelectCellsWithoutVisibleCellBrackets` I'd be grateful for guidance.
