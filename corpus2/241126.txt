Actually I have a sub-question here:"Is Nginx official documentation opensourced?" Nginx is a good software, but I found its official documentation(http://nginx.org/en/docs/ really hard to read, because lack of design. Especially compare with documentations on this site (readthedocs.org). So I decided to move it to readthedocs.org little by little if it's opensourced. And I'm so confused that as the 2nd biggest web-server software on world, aren't there anyone else like me feel its documentation hard to read? Maybe there are many and I just don't know them. If you know any other site which have a better designed nginx documentation, please tell me, so I won't need to do the rebuild task.
