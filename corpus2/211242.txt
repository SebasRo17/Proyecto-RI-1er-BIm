I am constructing a program that does several things.   * **Listens** to a port. Every second a string is received   * When new data is received, it has to be **logged**. No errors or skipped entries are allowed   * When data is received, a **plot** on the screen has to be updated. This is an expensive computation. Missing some updates is not critical.   * Once a month, an **archiving** function shall be called, to backup the logs. This might take unknown amount of time. I am new to threading and would like to ask for _advice on the threading infrastructure_. On one hand, it seems that I need at least 1 additional thread besides the main thread, for the port listener. On the other hand, I am afraid that if I spawn too many a thread:   * Sync problems may occur   * The app may become resource-hungry Here is some proposed code for the listener. * The complexity of the code might rocket up
