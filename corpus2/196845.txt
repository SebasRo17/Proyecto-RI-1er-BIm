I believe that warnings should be treated as errors. If you start ignoring warnings you'll start missing "important" warnings among the "unimportant" ones. So my Continuous Integration system fails a build if there are warnings. One of my compilers has a bug that causes it to raise a warning when it shouldn't. My code is valid and compiles correctly, and I can't disable this particular warning. How should my CI system handle this? Should I temporarily disable "warnings as errors", until the compiler is patched?
