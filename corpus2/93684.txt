I am a junior software developer and I have been researching some of the practices in the industry to make myself better. I have been looking at unit testing briefly and I cannot see how the extra time writing a ton of unit tests is going to make my code better. To put things into perspective:   1. The projects I work on are small   2. I am the only developer on the said project (usually)   3. The projects are all bespoke applications The thing I don't get the most is, how can a unit test tell me whether my calculate price function (which can depend on things like the day of the week and bank holidays etc, so assume 20-40 lines for that function) is correct? Would it not be quicker for me to write all the code and the sit through a debugging session to test every eventually of the code? Any examples that are forms-based would be appreciated (examples I have seen from the MSDN videos are all MVC and a waste of time IMHO).
