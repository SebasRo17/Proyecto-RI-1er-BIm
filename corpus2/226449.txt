Scrum advocates assume that a team without a designated team leader (as it is in Scrum) is more effective than a team with a designated leader (as in traditional hierarchy). Although I can understand this point of view, I am not entirely certain that's the case. In Scrum teams leaders always emerge. Power vacuums get filled. So if the organization already recognizes certain people as talented leaders, why not assign them an official leadership role in the first place?
