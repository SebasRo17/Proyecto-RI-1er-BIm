Retaining the names inside `namespace` will make compiler work less stressful!? For example:               // test.cpp     #include</*iostream,vector,string,map*/>     class vec { /* ... */ };      Take 2 scenarios of `main()`:               // scenario-1     using namespace std;  // comment this line for scenario-2     int main ()     {       vec obj;     }      For scenario-1 where `using namespace std;`, several type names from `namespace std` will come into global scope. Thus compiler will have to check against `vec` if any of the type is colliding with it. If it does then generate error. In scenario-2 where there is no `using namespace`, compiler just have to check `vec` with `std`, because that's the only symbol in global scope. I am interested to know that, shouldn't it make the compiler little faster ?
