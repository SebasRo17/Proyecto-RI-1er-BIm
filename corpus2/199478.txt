Is there an equivalent to Build-Operate-Transfer or Build-Lease-Transfer in software development? Does it even make any sense to operate such a project in software? Do you know of any projects in your experience that have been launched as such? Another way to put it is: for a large software system project, why wouldn't a company bid it out to third parties for them to build and operate for a period of time (i.e. the third party will be responsible for ongoing maintenance and operation of the system), until the concession is up? The third party recuperates expenses from software development through the running of the system; the original company might earn from residuals during this period, and then absorb income from the system once the concession is up. Does this even make any sense?
