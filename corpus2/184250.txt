When I started working a programmer, I learned lots at first, on the job. Although Ive been given more responsibility, which is good in a way, it is mostly in the form of increased workload. I havent had much time or energy left to learn anything much new day to day. Sometimes I have 1 hr of time and energy left at the end of the day to keep up, but I mostly just produce a lot of the same type of code. It does make sense to spend working hrs producing, since it's the reason why a programmer is trained and hired. However, I am concerned about if Im falling behind as a programmer, by doing what I was hired for, even if not learning much new. Is this standard for most programmers?
