I'm trying to export a string to a Matlab mat file. Is it possible? The straightforward way               Export["file.mat", {{"1"}}, {{"Data"}}]      with any number of surrounding braces does not work for me, as I get the error message               Export::type: ({"1"}) cannot be exported to the ("MAT")format.      Any clues? **Edit** To make this a little clearer: I'd like to save some matrices **and** a string to the same MAT file.
