I have a problem with presenting solutions. Roots of 4th order polynomials are big expressions. Is there a way to present the roots, s2 and s3, in normal form with some substitutions? Maybe a way to force _Mathematica_ to find some similar terms under the radicals and replace them with substitutions (to factorize or simplify that way), so s2 and s3 are presented in a way that looks nice?               a1 = Roots[x^4 + r1 x^3 + r2 x^2 + r3 x + r4 == 0, x][[1]][[2]];     a2 = Roots[x^4 + r1 x^3 + r2 x^2 + r3 x + r4 == 0, x][[2]][[2]];     a3 = (-s2 - Sqrt[s2^2 - 4  s3])/2 ;     a4 = (-s2 + Sqrt[s2^2 - 4  s3])/2 ;          Solve[{a1 - a3 == 0, a2 - a4 == 0}, {s2, s3}]
