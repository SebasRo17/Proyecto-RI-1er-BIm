This has never come up, so I've never thought how a data or programming model should work that simulates (a) bird's eye view of cars moving and some rudimentary physics, (b) how the cars would follow a road layout and (c) how an efficient data structure for roads would look like. Obviously, this question also means to ask how the road data structures would interact with cars. Any recommendations, or reviews of such data models?
