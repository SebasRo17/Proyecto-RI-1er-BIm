We have a team working on an ExtJS web app. Right now, the interface and its functionality is all stuffed in one 1500-line JS file, which is of course _terrible_. It's bad form in general, of course, but it really makes merging changes a bear. Since Javascript doesn't have a #include or @require, or any other dependency- specifying mechanism, I'm at a loss how to gracefully split out functionality into smaller logical units, without requiring a great big laundry list of includes in the consuming HTML. I figure this is a common enough problem that somebody has worked out an elegant solution. Help?
