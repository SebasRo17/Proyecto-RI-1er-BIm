Currently, I'm a long Eclipse user because my past and current companies always deal with eclipse. Recently I met some example java codes created using netbeans. I downloaded and tried Netbeans 7.x and 6.9.x, but they're more heavier and eating memory resources than Eclipse Indigo. So anyone know which past version of Netbeans IDE that has lightness almost equal to or better than Eclipse Indigo (3.7) but can support Java SDK v1.6?
