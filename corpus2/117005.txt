There seems to be a number of different so-called "standards" bodies interacting and/or competing with each other. For example, RFC 3629 references ISO/IEC 10646 and appears to be governed by the IETF, but no mention is made of IEEE, which has also documented programming terminology and standards. I'm looking for something like: The Internet Ecosystem http://www.isoc.org/pubpolpillar/docs/factsheet_ecosystem_20090310.pdf but less specific to the Internet, and more so to computing. Questions a good resource(s) might answer are: Which orgs are at odds with one another or have come about to fill a need not provided by the other? Which book(s), blog post (or series of blog posts), or some other document that defines the relations ship between the organizations and acronyms? I'm looking for a source or list of sources that might help me understand the history, authority, and importance of these organizations and standards in relation to one another. A good answer might include a link to get me going in the right direction or even just a list of sources that help me put the pieces together.
