We use SVN and PhpStorm at work. Recently our team has grown a bit so there are several people working on the same project at a time, sometimes on the same file. We've run into the problem where people don't update before comitting and overwrite the changes that were made by someone else. This is a hassle. I don't know SVN very well, but it seems like this shouldn't even be possible. What are we doing wrong?
