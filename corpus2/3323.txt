I seem to be getting some unintended results from a nested `Manipulate` that I have not been able to resolve. I boiled down the problem I'm having to a simplified version. I can not seem to get the evaluation order of `Manipulate` correct.               Manipulate[      Manipulate[       Print[{Parity, n}];       {Parity, n},       {n, Select[Range[1, 10, 1], Parity]}      ],      {Parity, {OddQ, EvenQ}}     ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2l52K.png) The problem isn't what it shows in the window, it is with what the Print statement outputs. For instance, if it is in the state EvenQ,2 and I click on OddQ, the Print output will read:               {OddQ,2}      Despite the fact that it shows {OddQ,1} in the window. Why is this, and how can I fix it? In this boiled-down example it doesn't matter, but in my real life one, an error is issued every time I switch the outer manipulate.
