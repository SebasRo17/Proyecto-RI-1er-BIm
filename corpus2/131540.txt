When it comes to financial topics, I'm admittedly not well versed. I'm trying to lead my organization in our software development effort using a Scrum based development life-cycle. I am often discouraged when trying to coach executive leadership due to their belief that Scrum and Agile don't play well with their finanacial objectives. The other day I was challenged to show how my software developers could capitalize %60 of their work hours. I've found a few articles on the web ( http://itprojectfinancials.com/insights/2011/06/05/capitalizing-software- development-costs-from-sdcl-to-agile/ ), but haven't come up with any great arguments. I'm looking for advice or examples of organizations that capitalize software costs effectively in an Agile development environment. This article sums up the issue pretty well, but offers no advise http://blogs.collab.net/agile/2007/12/20/the-scrum-gaap/
