I'm writing a few libraries that I want to release as open source projects, but I want to find a licence that means I'll receive the credit when it is used in a project. Im not fussed about anything else, if people want to profit off of it then thats fine. So what licence is most appropriate? The only factor for me is that I receive the credit for producing the library if it is ever used.
