As a developer/DevLead you've got your focus on developing software and you may be quite good in it. Developers are, however, in my observation often not so good at playing political games. This concerns in particular about:   * Protecting yourself and to provide information correctly   * Keeping track about: Who has said what   * Who is to blame if anything goes wrong   * Etc. Management guys are much better in the game of looking good and blaming others. :) Are there common rules and techniques for software developers and DevLeads to protect themselves from political games and making life easier?
