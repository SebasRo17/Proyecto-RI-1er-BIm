Apologies if this sounds like a blog. I'm currently completing tertiary eduction in order to be accepted into a CS course at university, and I would like to know what options are available to me to improve my knowledge of programming and mathematics at home. I did not finish high-school, and have a pretty basic understanding of mathematics though I've never struggled with it. I'm not sure what level of mathematics I am at, suffice to say I would struggle with solving complex algebraic equations. I've never had any formal education in programming, but I've been doing it since I knew what it was. I'd say that I have OK practical knowledge, but next to no understanding of anything advanced. To improve my mathematics knowledge, I need a list of topics which should be covered, starting from the level of an average 16/17 year old. I'd also need to know which topics to cover before others. My first thought is to buy a highschool maths textbook to start with. I'm not sure what I should be doing to improve my programming knowledge, but I sure know that I am far, far off from answering questions such as: "Using only line drawing primives, construct a wireframe 3d car demo where the player can drive the car." (to use an example from a pretty out-there job application task). I'm not sure what I am expecting in the way of answers, perhaps just advice from people who have been in similar situations. I've got a year before I enter the CS course and I want to come in with all guns blazing. Thanks.
