This question is mainly about exporting to HTML/TeX. For those of you who do not know how to write aligned equations in _Mathematica_ please see this answer. Lets assume that you modified your stylesheet as I mentioned in my answer. In my notebook this is the cell expression I have:               Cell[BoxData[         FormBox[GridBox[{         {         RowBox[{         RowBox[{"a", "+", "b", "+", "c"}], "\[AlignmentMarker]", "=", "d"}]},         {         RowBox[{"c", "\[AlignmentMarker]", "=",          RowBox[{"d", "-", "a", "-", "b"}]}]}     }], TraditionalForm]], "DisplayMath"]      Now I want to export this expression to TeX, we can do this with:               cell = Cell[BoxData[             FormBox[GridBox[{             {             RowBox[{             RowBox[{"a", "+", "b", "+", "c"}], "\[AlignmentMarker]", "=", "d"}]},             {             RowBox[{"c", "\[AlignmentMarker]", "=",              RowBox[{"d", "-", "a", "-", "b"}]}]}         }], TraditionalForm]], "DisplayMath"];     Convert`TeX`BoxesToTeX[cell]      The output is:               \begin{array}{c}      a+b+c=d \\      c=d-a-b     \end{array}      The function `Convert`TeX`BoxesToTeX` is undocumented but the documentation does show how to use it under examples. It seems that the function doesn't do anything with the `\\[AligmentMarker]`, but I'm sure we could make good use of them. What we want to do is find any appearances of the `\\[AligmentMarker]` and substitute them with "&". And if we did find some `\\[AligmentMaker]`s then we use StringReplace to change "array" for "aligned". This is the output that I would like to end up with:               \begin{aligned}      a+b+c&=d \\      c&=d-a-b     \end{aligned}      Does anyone know how to create a wrapper function that does this? The main problem I'm having is replacing things in `cell`.
