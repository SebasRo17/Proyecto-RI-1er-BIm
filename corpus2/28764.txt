I cannot figure out why `FindRoot` doesn't work and returns this error: _The number of equations does not match the number of variables in ..._ My problem: drawing ground `g`, putting a bigger circle on it.               g = With[{        p = {          {-1.088, -0.395}, {-0.572, 0.235},          {-0.138, -0.28}, {0.404, 0.145},          {0.854, -0.405}, {1.204, -0.07}}},       BSplineFunction[p]]          pr = N@With[{h = 1/GoldenRatio},        {{-1, 1}, {-h, h}}]          perp[{x_?NumericQ, y_?NumericQ}] := Normalize[{-y, x}]          Module[{R = .1, t = .2, p1},      p1 = g[t] + R perp[g'[t]];      Graphics[{        LightGray, Rectangle @@ Transpose@pr,        Gray, Line[g /@ Range[0, 1, .01]],        Black, Circle[p1, R]},       PlotRange -> pr,       ImageSize -> 300]]      ![pic1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YS0pU.png) Now I would like to draw a smaller circle which touches the ground and the bigger circle to its left. But this produces the error:               FindRoot[      EuclideanDistance[        g[.2] + .1 perp[g'[.2]],        g[u] + .05 perp[g'[u]]] == .1 + .05, {u, .1}]
