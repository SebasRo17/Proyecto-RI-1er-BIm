Which types of learning resources do you find the most helpful, for which kinds of learning and/or perhaps at specific times? Some examples of types of learning you could consider:   * When starting to integrate a new SDK inside an existing codebase   * When learning a new framework without having to integrate legacy code   * When digging deeper into an already-used SDK that you may not know very well yet For example - (video) tutorials are usually very easy to follow and tells a story from beginning to end to get results, but will nearly always assume starting from scratch or a previous tutorial. Therefore such a resource is useful for quick learning if you don't have legacy code around, but less so if you have to search for the best-fit to the code you already have. SDK Documentation on the other hand is well-structured but does not tell a story. It is more difficult to get to a specific larger result with documentation alone, but it is a better fit when you do have legacy code around and are searching for perhaps non-obvious ways of employing the SDK or library. Are there other forms of resources that you find useful, such as interactive training?
