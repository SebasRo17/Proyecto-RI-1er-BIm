I am a CS student currently searching internship positions that are important to my future career. I am passionate about web design and development and it is really what I think my niche is in the programming world. I recently got offers between two companies - the first one, in an offshore company as a web developer where I am expected to study C# and AJAX (along with the basics: HTML, CSS, JS/JQuery, PHP, MySQL) and the second one specializes in Java and Agile software dev't. I am better in PHP than Java. It is obvious that I would pick the first one but I'm still on the fence because the second one is known to give solid training and foundation to both interns and employees while the first will expose me further to what I want to do. Which should I pick - **solid software development training and application** or an **real life application of a web developer's job** for my internship? **[UPDATE]** As of 25 May 2012 To everyone, next week will be the last of my internship. I went with the Java/Agile company and that decision changed my career path and life in general a lot. My fear of Java is now gone, instead it made me love the language better and everything during the internship training just solidified my passion to be a web developer. Thank you all!
