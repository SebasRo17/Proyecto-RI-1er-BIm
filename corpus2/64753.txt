My question is associated with the accepted answer to this question. It says that the language should be based on the fact whther the application is small,medium or large. What popular applications would you put in each category? And why? (is it the size of the codebase/number of simultaneous users etc..) * * * Thanks for all your answers. But in your examples I didn't see any web applications.Can you include some?
