I'm from the AS3, JavaScript, and similar "web languages" where _loading_ means the code is being downloaded from the server, and can't run reliably until enough has been fetched to the user's computer. However, what happens during a _loading_ screen in software and games in which all the information already exists on the user's computer? (especially now that the information can be stored on a "quick to read and write" harddrive, rather than slow floppies or CDs) Does this differ from the _loading_ pauses that sometimes may occur in the middle of a game?
