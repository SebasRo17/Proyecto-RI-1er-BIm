I have been searching for an example over the internet that shows any operation like saving a file or drawing anything in UI or any other sort that shows the implementation from High-leve language code to Low-level code to deep down machine level code. The basic idea is to explain the computer working in a nutshell. Like, in high-level laguage we write `int c= int a + int b` which is compiled into low- level code `IL_0001: ldarg.1 IL_0002: ldarg.2 IL_0003: add` and then to machine level code. Any example or code flowchart from high-leve language to deep down machine code will be helpful.
