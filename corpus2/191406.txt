Java has   * `int` and `Integer`   * `boolean` and `Boolean` This seems a bit inconsistent, why not either   * `bool` vs `Boolean` to use an established shorter name for primitive type? or   * `integer` vs `Integer` to keep type names consistent? I _think_ C++ had decided to use `bool` quite a bit earlier than Java decided to use `boolean`, and maybe also some (non-standard at the time?) C extensions too, so there would have been historical precedence for `bool`. I've noticed I often instinctively try to use `bool` at first (good thing modern editors immediately spot this without extra compilation round), so it'd be nice to know the rationale behind current state of affairs. If someone remembers (a part of) the story, or can even find and link to relevant historical discussion in the net, that would be great.
