I never used SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) before but used little Crystal Reports. My present project has extensive use of Crystal Reports for Visual Studio 2005. This choice brought some nasty issues of Crystal Reports in front. The very first report failed to print or export because of a bug. After wasting a week, I got stuck in another issue of reducing font size on print and export. Help in forums is also not coming soon. I want to know whether I should learn and switch to SSRS or migrate my project to Visual Studio 2010 with a higher version of Crystal Reports. Has SSRS replaced Crystal Reports as a de facto standard reporting tool?
