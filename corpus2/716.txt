I'm trying to visualize the SDP cone over 3x3 matrices by plotting random 3d sections of it. Since each region is a system of inequality constraints, I'm using RegionPlot, but I think the plots would look better if they only showed the surface...what is a good way to achieve this?               spectro2 := (        X = ( {           {x1, x2, x3},           {x2, x4, x5},           {x3, x5, x6}          } );        vars = Union@Flatten@X;        dvars = {x, y, z};        m = Length@vars;        n = Length@dvars;        makeMat := X /. (Thread[vars -> #]) &;        proj = makeMat /@ Orthogonalize@RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {n, m}];        mat2 =          Total@MapThread[Times, {proj, dvars}, 1] + IdentityMatrix@Length@X;        cons = And @@ (Thread[Eigenvalues[mat2] >= 0]);        RegionPlot3D[cons, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}, {z, -3, 3}, Mesh -> 5,          PlotStyle -> Opacity[.7], PlotPoints -> 5]        );     Table[spectro2, {2}, {3}]      ![](http://yaroslavvb.com/upload/sdp-cone.png)
