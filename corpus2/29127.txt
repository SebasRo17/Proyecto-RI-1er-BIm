The following code runs fine if I run it interactively:               Clear@realpath;     realpath[path_] := Import["!readlink "<>path, "Text"];     testsymlink = FileNameJoin[{$HomeDirectory, "testsymlink"}];     test = realpath[testsymlink];      In particular, the variable `test` gets the expected (non-`Null`) value. The same code runs fine also if I put it in a standalone script and execute it with               << "/path/to/script.m";      But if I put the same code, all by itself, in my `Kernel/init.m` file, it fails: the variable `test` gets the incorrect value `Null`. (The variable `testsymlink`, on the other hand, is still correctly set.) Furthermore, if I _then_ evaluate               realpath[testsymlink]      _interactively_ (in the newly started Mathematica session), I get the error shown in this post's title, twice: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eXxeO.png) I can't figure out why I'm getting this error, but I'm having it may give someone else a clue as to why the snippet is failing in the first place (when run as part of executing `Kernel/init.m`. PS: It appears that the offending snippet puts the session in a corrupted state, because when I attempted to upload the image shown above, I got this error: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vGmDU.png) I had first restart Mathematica (after deleting the offending snippet from `Kernel/init.m`), before I could upload these images.
