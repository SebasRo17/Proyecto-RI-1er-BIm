I had a co-worker leave our company recently. Before leaving, he coded a component that had a severe memory leak that caused a production outage (`OutOfMemoryError` in Java). The problem was essentially a `HashMap` that grew and never removed entries, and the solution was to replace the `HashMap` with a cache implementation. From a professional standpoint, I feel that I should let him know about the defect so he can learn from the error. On the other hand, once people leave a company, they often don't want to hear about legacy projects that they have left behind for bigger and better things. What is the general protocol for this sort of situation?
