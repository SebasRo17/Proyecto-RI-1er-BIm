So I took a job where the firm uses SVN (but will be moving to Git sometime in the future). The problem is that I don't know SVN. I've tried numerous Google queries and all I can ever find are SVN->Git tutorials, "Why is Git better than SVN" blogs, and a particular "cheat sheet" that gives (some) comparable commands... Short of reading the O'Reilly book on SVN, what are the brief (but not _too_ brief) instructions to SVN for Git users?
