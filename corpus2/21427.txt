I want to check the rank of a matrix for observability, but _Mathematica_ loses a rank if the matrix contains very large numbers. Let's say my matrix is               myM = {{1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {5.4 10^0, 1, 1, 1}};      with this matrix I get a rank of 4               MatrixRank[myM]      but if I change the matrix to               myM = {{1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {5.4 10^12, 1, 1, 1}};      (first entry in the last row) the rank of my matrix is only 3. Can somebody explain it to me please?
