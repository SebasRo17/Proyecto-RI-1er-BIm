C++ has plain multiple inheritance, many language designs forbid it as dangerous. But some languages like Ruby and PHP use strange syntax to do the same thing and call it mixins or traits. I heard many times that mixins/traits are harder to abuse than plain multiple inheritance. What specifically makes them less dangerous? Is there something that isn't possible with mixins/traits but possible with C++-style multiple inheritance? Is it possible to run into the diamond problem with them? This seems as if we were using multiple inheritance but just making excuses that those are mixins/traits so we can use them.
