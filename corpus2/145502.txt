I was wondering how safe is to say that —because developers are free to version and have better and more organic workflows— code will be delivered faster. A big factor here is team size of course, and I'd say the team is big enough to see this benefit (10-15 core devs, and maybe 5 to 15 more contributors to the common codebase). **Edit** : How development speed can be affected:   * Merging hell could be one of the cases that slow down people (DVCSs are much better at merging).    * Better workflows that ~~can pretty much only work~~ work more naturally on a DVCS **Integration Manager** ![Integration Manager](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IxVc7.png) **Dictator & Lieutenants** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/63H5O.png)   * Ability to use version control (i.e. committing) without inflicting potentially unstable changes to everybody  I just want to know if anyone has seen such things help the overall speed of teams/projects as a whole.
