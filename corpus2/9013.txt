My team uses a Kanban system for tracking day-to-day progress and it's worked out really well for understanding progress on features (captured as user stories). We have largely allowed our system design to emerge as we develop features which worked out well until recently. In the last two week we've had several discussions about architectural trade-offs specifically related to performance and modifiability quality attributes. I think what's happening is as we implement features and design the system, we're implicitly making decisions about the architecture but not considering those decisions in terms of our known quality attribute requirements. It would be really great if I could track/capture/visually depict how these important design decisions are being made so team members have a better chance to not create additional tension with in the system's architecture as it is being implemented. And of course, to complicate things more, features on our board aren't _exclusively_ functional and sometimes hide architectural complexity! How can I track progress on quality attributes (or other architecturally relevant decisions) visually on my team's kanban?
