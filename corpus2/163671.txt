I'm making a 'Pok√©mon Storage System' with a Client/Server model and as part of that I was thinking of storing an inventory file on the users computer which I do not wish to be edited except by my program. An alternative to this would be to instead to store the inventory file on the server and control it's editing by sending commands to the server but I was wondering if there are any situations which require files to be stored on a users computer where editing would be undesirable and if so how do you protect the files? I was thinking AES with some sort of checksum?
