I'm not talking about fixed price jobs, they're _fairly_ straightforward. But i'm on about an hourly rate project, my question specifically relates to what to charge for. If i have an IE/CSS issue that takes me an hour of scouring CSS to fix, is that chargeable? If i decide to use a really cool jQuery animation on their site but i need to get to grips with using it, do i charge them for the experimenting i do with the animation. Do you charge customers for something that they ask for, that you dont know about and therefore need to spend time learning? Its a grey area as far as i'm concerned and not clearly outlined in quotes (probably because not many clients would be happy to pay for your screw- up/learning) Whats the concensus on this?
