I have a list:               B={423, {{53, {39, 65, 423}}, {66, {67, 81, 423}}, {424, {25, 40, 423}}}};      This list can be visualized as a tree using `TreeForm[B]`: ![TreeForm\[B\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ORXFl.jpg) and I would like to find all possible traversals of this tree:               {{423,53,39},{423,53,65},{423,53,423},{423,66,67},{423,66,81},      {423,66,423},{423,424,25},{423,424,40},{423,424,423}}      It seems that `Subset` might be usable, but when I tried `Subset[B,{3}]`, it gave me the null set. Another possible problem with `Subset` is that it perhaps does not respect the leveling of the tree. I looked at the `Combinatorica` package, but I don't see a way to traverse the tree -- in the direction from top to bottom -- in all possible ways.
