We are looking at bringing on five college interns for the summer to help out with some development projects. Each one will be given a fairly stand-alone project that we are hoping he will be able to complete. However, we would like to provide some incentive for exceptional work, be it exceptional quality or exceptional productivity. Also, it should be something quantitative, not subjective. That way we can give them a goal beyond "make your boss happy and get a prize". Also, we prefer it to be something that will encourage them to work together, something they can achieve as a group. Finally, it should be something kind of fun, to lead up to a reward at the end of the summer. We are looking for something inspirational to encourage them to achieve more, not a metric to hold over their heads come review time. How do you inspire a dev team?
