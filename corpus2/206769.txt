Single Page Apps strips server down to a REST api. If SPAs are the modern and better way of developing web apps, then would someday JavaScript rule the world and server-side languages like Java, C++ etc would not be the prominent skill companies look for? Or are there still parts of huge and prominent web apps like youtube, amazon.com which just can't be all ported to client side JavaScript and would continue to depend upon server-side languages.
