I am interested in modifying the SQLite source code and making it available as an experimental public fork (GitHub, Google Code, etc.) However, the SQLite source code is currently in the public domain. If I fork, am I allowed to relicense using GNU GPL 3+? I would like my changes to the original source to be licensed under GNU GPL 3+. Using this Q as an example, I plan to commit the last official source to a git repo and make a note in README about the original source code. I assume this will satisfy this clause: `The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.`
