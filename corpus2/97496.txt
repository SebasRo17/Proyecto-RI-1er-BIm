Specifically, what is meant by "related field"? I'm in the process of pursuing an IT Infrastructure B.A.S. from the U of M (Twin Cities), but have been playing around with the idea of just doing the CSCI B.S. I don't want to be a hardcore programmer, but would having the CSCI degree, instead of the ITI degree, open more doors to whatever profession within the IT world I end up setting my sights on?
