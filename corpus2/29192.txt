I have this partial differential equation (G and M are constants): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/irS7q.png) and a solution is: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6xKu8.png) Mathematica doesn't find any solutions. My code for DSolve is:               DSolve[-2*G*M^2*r*Derivative[0, 2][γ][r, z] + 2*G*M^2*Derivative[1, 0][γ][r, z] +        2*G*M^2*r*Derivative[2, 0][γ][r, z] == 0, γ[r, z], {r, z}]      and as a result I just got an echo: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/70VyT.png) Any suggestions? Or nothing can be done in this case?
