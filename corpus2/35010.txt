See the Mathematica 'basic plotting' documentation: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/BasicPlotting.html Scroll down to the third plot on that page, which says the following: "The singularities can be omitted from the plot by specifying them in the plot's range." According to this doc, if you enter this in Mathematica 9, you will get the result shown in that doc page:               Plot[Tan[x], {x, -3, -Pi/2, Pi/2, 3}]      But when I try it I get this `pllim` error: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Sxjqt.png) claiming too many things appearing after `x`, but that's what the doc says to do. I have searched here for anything relevant to no avail. What's going on with this?
