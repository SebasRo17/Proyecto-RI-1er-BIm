I see a lot of crap online about how Erlang kicks node.js' ass in just about every conceivable category. So I'd like to learn Erlang, and give it a shot, but here's the problem. I'm finding that I have a much harder time picking up Erlang than I did picking up node.js. With node.js, I could pick a relatively complex project, and in a day I had something working. With Erlang, I'm running into barriers, and not going nearly as quickly. So.. for those with more experience, is Erlang complicated to learn, or am I just missing something? Node.js might not be perfect, but I seem to be able to get things done with it.
