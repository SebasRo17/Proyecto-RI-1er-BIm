If we have a graphics object,               plt = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, Pi}]      and we need to retrieve the discrete point data from it. This can be easily done by using `Extract` and `Position`,               First@Extract[plt, Most@First@Position[plt, Line]]      Or using `Cases`,               First@Cases[plt, Line[data_] -> data, Infinity]      However, my question is, might this be done via generic pattern matching? For example, some code like               plt /. (patterns-for-any-nested-or-parallel-heads) __ [ ___, Line[data_], ___] :> data      It might not be difficult to handle the parallel heads, but I do not see a obvious way to deal with the nested heads in a generic manner. Of course we can manually type all the nested heads, but this is rather specific. I am exploring the capacity of pattern matching in Mathematica. Is it possible to figure a general way to make Mathematica does it by itself? Actually I think this might be part of the algorithm under the hood of `Cases`.
