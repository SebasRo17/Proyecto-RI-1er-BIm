I'm trying to draw a `ListPlot` where the x and y axis have the same scale. My data is               {{100, 500}, {461/5, 473}, {548/5, 452}, {1459/10, 437}, {974/5, 428}, {250, 425},       {1526/5, 428}, {3541/10, 437}, {1952/5, 452}, {2039/5, 473}, {400, 500}}      A simple `ListPlot` will result in: ![Listplot no scale](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wMjwD.png) where the x and y axis have a different scales. I want them to force them to have the same scale. So far I've been able to achieve this only by explicitly setting `PlotRange` to the same value for x and y, and using `AspectRation->1`. Example:               range := {Min[Flatten[x]], Max[Flatten[x]]}     ListPlot[x, PlotRange -> {range, range}, AspectRatio -> 1]      The result is: ![List plot scaled](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9zevu.png) Questions:   * Is there a `Plot` option to force the scale to be uniform? Do I always have to set the same range and `AspectRatio` to 1?   * From the second image there is satisfying y âˆˆ [400, 500] and x < 100 with an x value that is lying outside of the drawing range. I thought by using the `Min` of all x and y this could not happen. What am I doing wrong?
