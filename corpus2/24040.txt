I want to use `Hue` function for different colours with the argument being a function, i.e.,               Hue[f[i,j]]      Now, `f[i,j]` in my case can take negative values. The range of my function is `[-2,2]` (which can be rescaled to `[-1,1]` if necessary, by dividing the function by 2). The problem is that `Hue` automatically rescales its argument to put it into the range of `[0,1)`. This is a problem for me as it will then show the same colour when my function is either `-1` or `0` or `1`, for example. The actual figure I want to work on can be generated by the following code:               Clear["Global`*"];      n := 10;      angles = Table[RandomReal[{-Pi, Pi}], {i, n}, {j, n}];      f[here_, down_, right_] := Cos[down - here] + Cos[right - here]      g[list_, {i_, j_}] := Module[{m, n}, {m, n} = Dimensions[list]; {list[[i, j]],          If[i != m, list[[i + 1, j]], -list[[1, j]]],            If[j != n, list[[i, j + 1]], -list[[i, 1]]]}]      GraphicsGrid[ MapIndexed[ Graphics[{LightGray, Circle[{0, 0}, 1],          Hue[Rescale[f @@ g[angles, #2], {-2, 2}, {-1, 1}]], Thin,            Arrowheads[Small], Arrow[{{0, 0}, {Cos[#], Sin[#]}}]}] &, angles, {2}]]
