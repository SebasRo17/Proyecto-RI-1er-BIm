After reading Should package names be singular or plural? it occurred to me that I've never seen a proper debate covering one of my pet peeves: naming implementations of interfaces. Let's assume that you have a interface `Order` that is intended to be implemented in a variety of ways but there is only the initial implementation when the project is first created. Do you go for `DefaultOrder` or `OrderImpl` or some other variant to avoid the false dichotomy? And what do you do when more implementations come along? **And most important... why?**
