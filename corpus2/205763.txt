I'm planning to write an e-commerce app using PHP & MySQL with lots & lots of custom rules. Say for example, I want to have a rule like " _Give Customer X, a 10% a discount for Product Y if he bundles it with Product Z_ " I've heard about Business rules engine(in Java and others). I intend to implement a flexible business rules functionality **without hard-coding** anything into PHP and with a good, solid architecture with the goal of maintainability and re-usability with the help of PHP OOPS. Please advice me on the following aspects: Does decision table fit my intended purpose? How can I change rule/business logic of the PHP application without redeploying/re-writing?
