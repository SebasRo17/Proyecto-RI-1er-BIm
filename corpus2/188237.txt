I am looking for advice on the neatest way to structure my code.               class Password     {         private string cipher;              Password(string cipher)         {             this.cipher = cipher;         }              public string HashPassword()         {              }              public bool VerifyPassword()         {              }     }      The idea behind the class is to abstract away the password hashing process. The class will present two functions to the user, `HashPassword()` and `VerifyPassword()`, which will perform completely different hashing algorithms depending on the value of the `cipher` variable. Currently, I am using a set of `if/else` conditional statements within the two functions itself to determine which hashing algorithm to perform. However, it felt quite inelegant to me. Is there a better way of structuring my code?
