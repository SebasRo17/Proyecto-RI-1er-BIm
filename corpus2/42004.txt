I have set of differential equations. For example, I took two equations and tried to solve them as below. I am not getting any results. Please help me to figure it out the mistake. And I wonder if I can use matrices to solve such a system of equations.Please don't put down this question.This is very important to my research.               Clear[j, v, s]     j[V_] = v[t] + v[t]^2;     τ = 1;     s = 0.1;     ip = 0;     DSolve[{v1'[t] == -v1[t]/τ + (j[v2]*s) + ip,              v2'[t] == -v2[t]/τ + (j[v1]*s) + ip},    {v1, v2}, t]
