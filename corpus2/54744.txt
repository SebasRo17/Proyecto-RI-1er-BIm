The following is in the documentation (MMA 10) under ParametricPlot3D -> Options -> Mesh :               ParametricPlot3D[{(2 + Cos[v]) Cos[u], (2 + Cos[v]) Sin[u],        Sin[v]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 2 Pi}, Mesh -> 10]      You'll see that the lines for u=0 and for v=0 are missing. These can be restored by using `Mesh->Full`, but then the number of lines will be the default, 15. I'd also like to have the number of lines be different in the two directions, with each one containing 0, but Mesh->{Full,10}, e.g., gives an error. Here is the image in the documentation: ![missing mesh lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rYXpt.jpg) **Update:** While the answer below works as requested, it does not work for tubes. See this example:               ParametricPlot3D[{(2 + Cos[v]) Cos[u], (2 + Cos[v]) Sin[u],        Sin[v]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 2 Pi}, Mesh -> 10,       BoundaryStyle -> Tube[.03], MeshStyle -> Tube[.03]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DVX9N.jpg)
