I'm a new ASP.NET MVC programmer. I've done asp.net webforms extensively and I used the Ajax Control Toolkit and update panels to provide a smoother user experience. What paradigms should I be considering from a user experience standpoint in asp.net mvc 4? I've noticed a few approaches ranging from simply injecting partial views through jQuery all the way to single page applications. There seems to be some Ajax baked into ASP.NET MVC 4 as well. What are the preferred approaches for line of business applications? Where would you point a new MVC developer to for creating responsive UIs? What are the tradeoffs of the various approaches?
