**Note:** As of version 9, this functionality is available and works out of the box. * * * I've a few questions about Command Completion in Mathematica. I recently discovered this feature, and it's really convenient. However, it gets tiring to hit `Ctrl`-`K` all the time. Is there a way to turn Command Complete on after every keystroke, like autocompletion is for many programming IDE's? Or, failing that, to map it to another key like `Tab`, which I find much more convenient to hit? I've looked up some internet sources on changing Keyboard shortcuts for Mathematica, but they all seem pretty complicated.
