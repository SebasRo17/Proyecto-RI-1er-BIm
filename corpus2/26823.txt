I want to degrade the image, and then execute the restoration, such as a lena.jpg. I tried this:               lena = ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Lena"}];     lena1 = GaussianFilter[lena, 5]       With these get stained image lena1.jpg is stained image from lena this image use for recognition in folow step                ImageDeconvolve[lena1, GaussianMatrix[5.10]]      only parameter 5.10 gives beter picture then lena1.jpg Then this I have three pictures "lena.jpg"-original image, "lena1.jpg"-degraded image and Image after deconvolve - Restoration image. Problem: 1) I do not know which settings (filters) to apply during restoration pictures and 2) Which function to use when degradation and restoration during which, as you know? Whether we can write a concrete example of an image degradation and restoration so obtained images? Sorry for my English... :)
