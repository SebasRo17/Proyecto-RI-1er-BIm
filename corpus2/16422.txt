Here's a problem that I don't understand.               f[x_] := Exp[Cos[3*x]]     g[x_] := (1/3)*x^3 - x^2 + 2       When I try to find the limit:               Solve[NIntegrate[f[x] - 0.1 g[x], {x, 0, t}] == 3, t]       I get these errors x3 > NIntegrate::nlim: > > Solve::inex: Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients > or the system obtained by direct rationalization of inexact numbers present > in the system. Since many of the methods used by Solve require exact input, > providing Solve with an exact version of the system may help. >>
