In an hypothetic situation of a company that have infinite resources (time/budget) to develop a product. can someone list me **ALL** possible steps that are required in my system development life cycle to reach the goal, in a **state of the art software engineering view** ? The GOAL of this question is to get a detailed list of all different aspects that i would do in "a state of the art" software development life cycle. I'm not interested in the paths (software development methodologies) but in all kind of steps. * * * Example: Focusing on the **"software test step"** i can test a products to archive different goals:               * 5.1 Test target           o 5.1.1 Unit testing           o 5.1.2 Integration testing           o 5.1.3 System testing           o 5.1.4 System integration testing     * 5.2 Objectives of testing           o 5.2.1 Regression testing           o 5.2.2 Acceptance testing           o 5.2.3 Alpha testing           o 5.2.4 Beta testing          * 6.1 Software performance testing and load testing     * 6.2 Stability testing     * 6.3 Usability testing     * 6.4 Security testing     * 6.5 Internationalization and localization     * 6.6 Destructive testing      And others .. Trying to enumerate all aspects of software testing, what else aspect i need to test ? Do this kind of reasoning to all aspect of software development life cycle.
