Let us say, I am browsing the internet and stumble upon a SO answer/forum/blog with code that perfectly solves a problem I have. The only trouble is they didn't specify any sort of licensing for their code. Is this code usable in my project or would I break copyright laws? What would be required for me to include it in a closed source project? An open source project? What licenses would be compliant or non-compliant with it? (e.g. Could I take their code and release it with GPL code?)
