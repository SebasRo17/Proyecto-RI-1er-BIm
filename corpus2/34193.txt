I see that we can do associative arrays in Mathematica using functions that have implicit pattern arguments, as in               debyeTemperature[ "Aluminum" ] = 433 ;     debyeTemperature[ "Americium" ] = 121 ;     debyeTemperature[ "Antimony" ] = 220 ;     debyeTemperature[ "Argon" ] = 92.0 ;          debyeTemperature[ "Americium" ]      My guess is that ChemicalData[] uses something like this internally. Is there a syntax for bulk initialization of such a hash function with pairs of values, perhaps like a similar perl hash initialization:               my %debyeTemperature = ("Aluminum" => 433,                             "Americium" => 121,                             "Antimony" => 220,                             "Argon" => 92.0, ) ;          print "$debyeTemperature{'Americium'}\n" ;
