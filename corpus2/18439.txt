I work with open source software a lot and keep coming across weird and funny names for executables, variables, constants and etc. Currently I am wondering why CATALINA_HOME environment variable was named that way? I did a quick search on google with but nothing relative came up. My only guess is that it is named after the island of the shore of south California. On the related note, very often I find amusing and clever names used in open source programs. One of my favorites are **slapd** and **slurpd** executables of OpenLDAP suite. What are your favorite/noteworthy variable/executable names that you have seen in your programming career? Do you think it is OK to name your variables/executables this way, or would you rather see boring but clear names? PS. This is not really a programming question but I think it somewhat fits in here, according to faq.
