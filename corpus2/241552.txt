I'm fairly new to programming, and I've been working on many personal projects, which I'm concerned can come across as silly and unprofessional. The kind of projects I have are a Reddit Image Downloader and a tool for GMs to use in roleplaying games. I want to start building up a GitHub account for projects in my chosen field of data analytics, but I'm not sure how to organize projects on my GitHub account. Should I create a "professional" GitHub, mainly containing different analytical scripts and have a separate "personal" account for fun little projects of mine? Or am I just overthinking this, and should I just maintain one account?
