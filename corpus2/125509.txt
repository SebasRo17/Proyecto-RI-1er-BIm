I'm currently looking for a new programming language to learn (currently working through some C++, know some C and Python), specifically one that has built-in concurrency support? I want to try to build a large graph library that can do processing across clusters or multiple cores.. I know C++'s Boost library has support for concurrency, but I also want to learn a new language and I'm guessing a language that was designed with concurrency in mind would also be more pleasant to do concurrent programming in. Overall I see this as a chance to learn a new language, learn about concurrent programming, and tackle a big project. From looking around, Clojure and Scala seem to be the two popular candidates when looking for concurrent programming support.. though I'm not sure how these two compare in terms of   1. Speed (specifically for concurrent large graph processing)   2. Community (thinking about pushing this project onto somewhere like GitHub)   3. Ease of programming concurrently Or are there other languages I should consider aside from Clojure or Scala? I have never programmed in a functional language before, but I'm open to learning it.. I've seen one of my friends program in Haskell and Clojure and it looks daunting but I've heard good things about functional programming, esp. for data processing. Thanks!
