# Are there any reasons for converting subscriptbox to Tex with space? * * *               ExportString[Subscript[\[Alpha], 1], "TeX"]          (*         %% AMS-LaTeX Created by Wolfram Mathematica 9.0 : www.wolfram.com\documentclass{article}\u     sepackage{amsmath, amssymb, graphics, setspace}\newcommand{\mathsym}[1]{{}}\newcommand{\un     icode}[1]{{}}\newcounter{mathematicapage}\begin{document}\[\alpha _1\]\end{document}     *)      Of course, I can remove the space in via the option "BoxRules", and `$\alpha _1$` can also rendered well in SE. But many people would edit my `$\alpha _1$` into `$\alpha_1$`, do you know whether there are any reasons for the default space generated by `ExportString`? The same to other boxes.
