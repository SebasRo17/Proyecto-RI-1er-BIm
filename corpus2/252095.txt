Time and time again, I've seen companies advertise their software by saying things like "Award Winning Software" or "Download our Award-Winning Android App", etc. Who is giving out these "awards"? I've been in the software industry for a few years now and I've never heard of anyone getting an award for their software. Is there actually a body that gives awards to companies or is it just the case that some obscure magazine gave the software a good rating and they then proceed to label their product as "Award-Winning"?
