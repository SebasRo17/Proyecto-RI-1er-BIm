I have the following data               data = {{7.5, 12.45, 12.45, 12.75, 12.75, 12.25, 12.25, 12.53, 12.53},     {8.5, 12.22, 12.22, 12.23, 12.23, 13, 13, 12.54, 12.54},      {9.5, 11.58, 11.53, 12.75, 13.48, 12.39, 12.52, 12.17, 13.56},      {10.5, 11.76, 11.82, 12.97, 13.55, 12.15, 11.88, 13.07, 12.79},      {11.5, 11.18, 11.85, 13.27, 13.02, 12.32, 13, 12.72, 12.63},      {12.5, 11.04, 11.61, 13.70, 14.17, 12.77, 12.79, 12.13, 11.78},      {13.5, 11.64, 10.68, 13.52, 14.03, 13.14, 13.21, 11.64, 12.13},      {14.5, 12.04, 12.12, 13.23, 13.67, 12.58, 13.02, 11.26, 12.05},      {15.5, 14.10, 14, 11.65, 11.68, 12.17, 12.36, 12.19, 11.85},      {16.5, 14.85, 14.54, 10.94, 11.62, 12.17, 11.72, 11.84, 12.31},      {17.5, 15.78, 15.78, 10.62, 10.62, 11.72, 11.72, 11.88, 11.88},      {18.5, 17.18, 17.18, 9.53, 9.53, 11.66, 11.66, 11.63, 11.63}};      but I can't find a way to visualize them. Let me explain the structure of the data and also what I want to plot. `data` contains 12 sub-lists and each one contains 9 elements. The first element, let's say, is the x-coordinate and all the other eight represent percentages. I would like to plot these percentages with vertical lines (something like a histogram). So, at the axis there should be 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, ... , 18.5 and above of every number eight vertical lines (with different colors and indicators 1, 2, 3, ..., 8 if possible) of the corresponding percentages. Any ideas how to implement this? **EDIT** Following @Pinguin Dirk 's method I added some style options using               B0 = BarChart[Rest /@ data, Frame -> True,      FrameTicks -> {{True, False}, {False, False}},      FrameLabel -> {"h", "Percentage %"},      FrameStyle -> Directive[FontSize -> 18, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],      ChartLabels -> {data[[All, 1]], None}, BarSpacing -> {1, 3},      ChartLegends -> Range[8], PlotRange -> {-1, 18}, ImageSize -> 550]      This is the output ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kVpBX.jpg) Some minor issues: (a). How can we manipulate the size/fonts of the numbers at the horizontal axis (7.5, 8.5, etc)? (b). How can we manipulate the size/fonts of the chart's legends? Is there a way to increase the size of the squares or change the used colors?
