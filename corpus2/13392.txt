I'm using Mathematica from Ubuntu. I need a normal font to display cyrillics inside PDFs. Any default font is very ugly, letters are too close together:               ImportString@       ExportString[Style["Русский", FontFamily -> #, FontSize -> 50],         "PDF"]&/@ {"Times", "Courier", "Arial"}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J2nRN.png) Here is the longer example with also Latin mixed in: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T38es.png) As you can see Cyrillics letters are much bigger somehow. It's happening to every text inside the notebook including graphics, even though it looks fine in the editor. This is how it looks on `MacOSX-x86-64` and Mathematica 8.0.4 which can be used as reference: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6tNBJ.png)
