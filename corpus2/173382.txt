I am a student and have obtained a one year placement at a business that develops an e-commerce system using C#, HTML, WPF, javascript, ASP and more. Although I do have a little bit of knowledge, I find myself being assigned a lot of tasks that are beyond me and even when I ask for help, the response I get is often cryptic to me. I stare at as much code as possible to just try and _"throw myself into it"_ but I often just get lost in the code I like to consider myself a fast learner and I am damn determined to be a good programmer. I would just like to ask if there are some tips for me to catch up as quick as possible? I don't want to be a nuisance and sit here and ask for help 24/7. I just want to crack on!
