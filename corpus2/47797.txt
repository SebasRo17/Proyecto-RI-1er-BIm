One of the arguments against using Open Source is that there is no "support". However, do big vendors (e.g. Microsoft) really offer "support" of any kind? I'm sure there is some sort of 4-figure-per-hour "paid support" option out there, but is that really an "option" for any problem short of one that is going to bankrupt your business? To put it more concretely... I buy a Microsoft product... it has a bug... now what? And how is that better than what I get from Open Source?
