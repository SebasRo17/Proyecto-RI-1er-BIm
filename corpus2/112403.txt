I sometimes hear that having too many "manager" classes in your program's design is code smell and add an unnecessary layer of complexity. To me it makes sense that people want to use manager classes for manipulating and controlling objects from a context that makes sense to them, but figuring out how to make a solution work without them can be confusing. Should one really avoid manager classes as much as possible? Also, what articles/papers should I read on how to implement an alternative work around for general/common cases where these managers can be removed?
