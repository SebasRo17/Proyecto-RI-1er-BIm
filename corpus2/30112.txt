The output of the following code is the same as the input.               waals = (P + a/V^2) (V - b) == R T;          ContourPlot3D[waals /. {a -> 1, b -> 1, R -> 1},      {P, 0, 100}, {V, 0, 100}, {T, 0, 100}]      But               ContourPlot3D[(P + 1/V^2) (-1 + V) == T,      {P, 0, 100}, {V, 0, 100}, {T, 0, 100}]      works fine. What's wrong? Do I have to specify all the parameters in the equation?
