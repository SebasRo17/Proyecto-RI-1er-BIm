Getting a few projects started with EF, but I had some questions about join tables and keys etc. Lets say I have a table of applications and a table of permissions. Applications have many permissions and each permission can belong to many applications (many-to-many). Now, the Application and Permission tables are easy:               Applications     --------------     PK  ApplicationID         Name          Permissions     --------------     PK  PermissionID         Name      But what's the BEST way to do the join table? I have these two options:               ApplicationPermissions     -----------------------     PK  ApplicationPermissionID     CU  ApplicationID     CU  PermissionID      OR               ApplicationPermissions     -----------------------     CPK ApplicationID     CPK PermissionID          PK = Primary Key     CPK = Composite Primary Key     CU = Composite Unique Index      Have you ever been burned doing it one way over the other? is it strictly preference? It has occurred to me that a lot of the "differences" will be abstracted away by my repository pattern (for example, i would almost never create an entire permission object and add it to an application, but do it by ID or unique name or something), but I guess I'm looking for horror stories, one way or the other.
