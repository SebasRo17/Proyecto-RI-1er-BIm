So I'm curious: I've implemented Lua within C++ a few times before, and while it was relatively simple, it still didn't harness the power that I would have liked. I love how eclipse works, including javadoc locations, etc. and I was wondering if there was a way to integrate Java into a native application (that is cross-platform, of course) to do what Lua does, but with Java. This means I'd be able to build my own base classes and stuff, etc. Just an interesting thought! Any insight? EDIT: Also, what about MonoDevelop? Is it relatively easy to integrate? Is it compiled? Is it cross-platform-able?
