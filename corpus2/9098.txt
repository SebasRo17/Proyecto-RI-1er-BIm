I have a question that seems easy but I can't solve it. I have an equation like:               eqgama = -8.33208*10^56 g1 + 8.18264*10^56 g1^2 == -1.42093*10^56      I use the following statements to find its discriminant:               poly = (eqgama[[1]] - eqgama[[2]]) // Simplify;     Discriminant[poly, g1];      The answer is: 2.29158*10^113 In another program mathematica itself simplifies eqgama to the following equation:               -1.97163*10^54 g1 + 1.93627*10^54 g1 ^2 == -3.36235*10^53      and so the discriminant becomes: 1.28315*10^108. I have a loop and I want to plot discriminants versus a definite parameter, but in this loop sometimes Mathematica simplifies equations and sometimes not. So the plot fluctuates. What should I do?
