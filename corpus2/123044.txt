Now that Django runs on Python 3, I think it's time to ask that all-important question: Should I start using Python 3 instead of Python 2? It really seems that though 3 has a lot of awesome new helpful features, everyone's sticking to 2. Are Python 2 libraries forward-compatible with Python 3? For example, will I lose all of my Django apps which have been developed for Python 2?
