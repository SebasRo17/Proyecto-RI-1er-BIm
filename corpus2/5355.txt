I'm looking for a way to create a Hasse Diagram from a given partial order binary relation. The relation will be given explicitly, for example: `Hasse[{{1,2},{2,3},{1,3}}]`, and the output will be the corresponding graph. I've googled for a solution, and I did find some solution, but I didn't get how to use it.. here's what I found. If there is a way to generate a Hasse diagram for a conditional partial order set, and for a non-finite relation (of course, for this case I'm only interested in an approximate diagram), I would be happy to hear about it too.
