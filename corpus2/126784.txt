I've just started my first IT job in a team with two developers (junior and senior), a project leader and an architect. My role is not yet completely defined and I said I'd be ok with both programming or testing. For now they put me on use case analysis since the PL says that it would leverage my analytical skills (I'm a science phd). Now the question is who's usually responsible for use case analysis? How usual is it to put a newbie on it? The hidden fear I have is: are they trying to keep me away from programming (after two weeks I still haven't SEEN a line of code...)?
