How do I specify an arbitrary number of variable names and initialize them inside of a Module or Block? For example, I want to do something like:               Module[Join[{mu = 100}, Array[(Symbol["lambda"<> ToString@#] = 0) &, 10]],           lambda3 = 7; Print[mu <> lambda2]; Print[mu <> lambda3];          ]      Instead, I get all sorts of errors about improper local variable definitions. I tried wrapping things in Evaluate, or making my own Hold and then Release sequence, but nothing I did seemed to work. Any help would be much appreciated! Best wishes, Andy
