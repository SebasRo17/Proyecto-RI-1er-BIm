I have a list of lists looking like this: `{{{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}}, {x1, y1},...}}`. Furthermore I have defined a legend, which is taken from the filenames. Now I want to plot this data dynamically, add/remove sub-lists in a `ListLinePlot`, e.g. with a `Checkbox`. This is the part of the code I have so far: Importing the data:               files = FileNames["*.dat"];     data = Import[#, "Data"] & /@ files;     legend = StringReplace[files, ".dat" -> ""];      So far I have made the plot like this:               plot1 = ListLinePlot[data[[1]], PlotLegends -> legend[[1]]];     plot2 = ListLinePlot[data[[2]], PlotLegends -> legend[[2]]];          Manipulate[     Show[       If[x1 == True, plot1, Sequence @@ {}],       If[x2 == True, plot2, Sequence @@ {}],       {{x1, True, "plot1"}, {True, False}}, {{x2, True, "plot2"}]      Is there maybe a more elegent way of realizing this, maybe automatically, for list of sub-lists?
