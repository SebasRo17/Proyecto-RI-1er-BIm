I'm still trying to understand design patterns here, after learning the Abstract factory pattern , I realised that this pattern will not scale well. Take a look at the uml diagram of the abstract factory pattern ![uml diagram](http://s11.postimg.org/okmvliygj/Abstract_Factory.gif) If I have to create a new 'AbstractProductC', I will have to add an abstract method 'CreateProductC' in 'AbstractFactory' which effects the implementation of both ConcreateFactory1, ConcreateFactory2. My question here is, does Abstract Factory pattern scale at all (or) I'm I thinking in the wrong direction here ? thanks in advance
