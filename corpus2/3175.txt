Solve returns a list of replacement rules               In: Solve[x + y == 3 && x - y == 6, {x, y}]     Out: {{x -> 9/2, y -> -(3/2)}}      I am only interested in the right hand side of these rules. To extract the right hand side I use substitution:               ({x, y} /. sol)[[1]]      It gives               {9/2, -(3/2)}      This works, but it is not very elegant. You have to adapt the list of the variables, each time you solve for different variables. Is there a more general way to extract the right hand sides form a list of replacements? **Edit** The number of variables and the number of solutions may both differ.
