I have an Access 03 program with a bunch of VBA code that is in use and the end user wants new functionality. I am finding it very difficult to add new functionality because my brain wants to use the most recent .NET technologies and VBA is not recent at all. How should I go about "rolling back" technologies in my head to keep my frustration levels to a minimum? Also my boss said it wasn't in the budget to rewrite the project from access and vba to some sort of form and SQL combo (which I could probably pound out in a few days, which is the same amount of time that I feel that it will take me to look up and implement in the old system).
