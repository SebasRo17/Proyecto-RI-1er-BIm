I have the following :               public Class A {              public void methodA() {             ....         }              public void methodB() {             ....         }          }      I don't have control over Class A. I would like to create subclasses of Class A with a restriction that it must override methodA() (super.methodA() call must run the implementation of Class A). is it possible? is so, how?
