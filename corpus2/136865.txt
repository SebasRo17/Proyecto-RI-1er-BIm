I got one project with some requirements. Basically my client provide data entry work. In that he converts image files(scan copy of articles, forms etc) to document file (MS word) by typing manually. For maintaining quality of that work he set some roles on documents text formatting like specific font, font size, paper size etc., and he compare image files with specific document for proofreading which is very time consuming task, and his some **smart employ** use some image to word converter for that conversion rather then typing manually. He pays a lot in the Data entry and he don't want automated converted files using some conversion software. So basically he want two functionality in his project that,   1. to automate standard format proofreading process and    2. to automatically reject image to word converted files. this is the all scenario and now **my question** is that   1. Is it possible to find out which file is manually type by employ and which is converted by using some conversion software?   2. Is it possible that we can check file for specific standard format?
