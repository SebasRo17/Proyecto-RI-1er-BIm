My application needs to create a directory symbolic link in Windows XP to get around the file path length limitation of ~256 characters. Windows XP does not have this functionality built-in. I had chosen Junction from Sysinternals as a candidate to solve this issue. However, now legal is telling me that I cannot distribute Junction to my users; they would have to download it themselves. My problem is that my users are not connected to the internet and probably have too many bureaucratic hurdles to go through to get approval to download and transfer this software.   1. Has anyone found an exception and legally distributed Sysinternals software like Junction?   2. What free/open/libre alternative do I have for creating directory symbolic links in Windows XP?
