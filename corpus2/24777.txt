I ran into this when I was working with an example from the Help Pages of V9. `Cells` is a new function added in V9. The following appears to work the first time it is evaluated in a notebook with `nb` assigned to some appropriate value, say, `EvaluationNotebook[]`.               Scan[(CurrentValue[#, StyleNames] = "Title") &, Cells[nb, CellStyle -> "Section"]]      However, if I try again to change the cells affected by the first evaluation to another style or back to the original style, nothing changes. Neither this               Scan[(CurrentValue[#, StyleNames] = "Text") &, Cells[nb, CellStyle -> "Title"]]       nor this               Scan[(CurrentValue[#, StyleNames] = "Section") &, Cells[nb, CellStyle -> "Title"]]        has any effect. For other `CurrenValue` targets such as `FontSize`, it's easy to change the value repeatedly.                Scan[(CurrentValue[#, FontSize] = 100) &,  Cells[nb, CellStyle -> "Section"]]      Scan[(CurrentValue[#, FontSize] = 30) &,  Cells[nb, CellStyle -> "Section"]]
