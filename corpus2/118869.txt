I just purchased the book 'Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design' by Richard Bird. Unfortunately, the book doesn't have any section that describes the notation that is used. You can view the contents of the book by going to Amazon's page, and clicking on the book cover to get a sneak peak inside. http://www.amazon.com/Pearls-Functional-Algorithm-Design-Richard/dp/0521513383 If someone could give me a name, and/or reference to understand the notation used. That way I could actually read and understand the algorithms.
