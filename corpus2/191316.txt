I am designing a new programming language. I am designing a syntax to implement queries. Currently this is how it works. **The database is accessible through entity object.** on this sample I have "entity.manufacturers" and "entity.products" table To get manufacturer with an ID of 1:                  var @manufacturer = entity.manufacturers where id = 1;      To query all products for @manufacturer:                   // Get all manufacturers products          var @products = entity.products under @manufacturer;         // No need to specify what links both since system already knows how entity is related      Currently I am using "under" as a keyword to get all records for @manufacturer. I want it to make sense by just reading the code. If you can give suggestions on a better syntax or keywords on how to implement this that will be awesome.
