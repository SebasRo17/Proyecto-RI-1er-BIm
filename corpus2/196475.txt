I was looking through some Objective C docs.. and got this : > UIGraphicsBeginImageContext : Creates a bitmap-based graphics context and > makes it the current context. Also, the same term is used in Robotlegs : > (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/intro-robotlegs-pt1.html) > Context: Context is the bootstrapping mechanism that initializes dependency > injection and the various core utilities that Robotlegs uses. Dictionary meaning of context as i googled, doesnot seem to match the way it's used in programming : > con·text /ˈkäntekst/ Noun The circumstances that form the setting for an > event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood > and assessed. > > The parts of something written or spoken that immediately precede and follow > a word or passage and clarify its meaning. Anybody can throw some light pls! V.
