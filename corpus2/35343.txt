I will show the problem on the following MWE:               Export["test.html",            Column[{ Row[{"test", "1"}]  }],            "HTML",            "CSS" -> None]      > >     $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded. >> >     General::stop: Further output of $RecursionLimit::reclim will be > suppressed during this >     calculation. >> >   Single `Row[{"test", "1"}]` without `Column` produces no error. Also let's assume I can't use `Grid`.
