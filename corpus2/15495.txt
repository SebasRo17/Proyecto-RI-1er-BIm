I'm generating a long table of list of the form: `PN={{1,2,1+i},{3.5,2.6,2}...},{...},...` Using: `Export["PN.dat", PN, "Table"]` Seems to do the job of exporting, but then using: `PN = Import["PN.dat", "Table"] or PN = ReadList["PN.dat"]` Can't reconstruct the same List, the first way considers the imaginary number i as something else "I", while the second one returns insane data like: `{{-1., -2.6464*10^-40, 0. + 2.76621*10^18 I}, {-0.129967...` Any ideas how to do this right? (Using ToExpression Returns $Faild)
