There appears to be a pretty clear consensus on the question about whether HTML and CSS are programming languages. They are not. HTML is a markup language and CSS is a stylesheet language. You could probably also argue that SQL isn't really a programming language either, and JavaScript is as the name implies more a scripting language than a programming language. However, what's a good "umbrella" term for these? Could i just say they are "technologies"?
