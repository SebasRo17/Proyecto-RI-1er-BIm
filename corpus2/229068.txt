I have a philosophy question about AngularJS and directives but correct implementation of the next problem solves it. So,   1. I need an AngularJS directive,   2. It loads some data via _several_ (not one!) `$http` requests,   3. It shows it,   4. It updates data (and re-shows it) every second,   5. The view has to be unchanged while data is loading/reloading. How should I do it in a correct way? And what about if I need a controller but not directive? (Difference is that controllers have `resolve` options but directives don't.) P.S.: I need a concrete scheme or a code! I know which components (`$http`, `$q`, etc.) I have to use. I don't know how to do it in a **right way**!
