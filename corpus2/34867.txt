I am trying to plot this graph showing the electric field lines and lines of equipotential based off the electrode configuration(in black) of two parallel lines. This is what I've been using for other electrode configurations:                gradientFieldPlot[(y^2 + (x - 7/2)^2)^(-1/2) - (y^2 + (x + 7/2)^2)^(-1/2), {x, -7, 7},                          {y, -5, 5}, PlotPoints -> 50, ColorFunction -> "BlueGreenYellow",                          Contours -> 15,ContourStyle -> White, Frame -> True,                        FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"}, ClippingStyle -> Automatic, Axes -> True,                        StreamStyle -> Orange]      and am trying to do it in a similar manner, but I do not know how to express the equations for these two finite parallel lines in the `[ ]`. Can any one help? Thanks sooo much!! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/48vec.jpg)
