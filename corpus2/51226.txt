I would like to find the real and imaginary parts of $x + y$ in terms of polar coordinates. Here is code:               ComplexExpand[Re[x + y], {x, y}, TargetFunctions -> {Abs, Arg}]      How can I add the assumption that $Abs[x]$ equals to $Abs[y]$? For example this code does not work:               ComplexExpand[Re[x + y], {x, y}, TargetFunctions -> {Abs, Arg},      Assumptions -> Abs[x] == Abs[y]]
