I am currently a professional programmer. I want to expand my skillset, but I also want to make the career jump to being a dev lead as part of a team. I know there's got to be a lot to learn (and this won't be an instant thing) but I think I'm smart enough to do it and I'm up to the challenge. I'm sure that many of the members here have probably gone through this themselves, and are now successful dev leads. Unfortunately, even though I know some personal areas I'd like to improve (depth of knowledge, breadth of knowledge, skillsets, etc), I'm not really sure how I would start something like this. As a programmer now, what steps should I take to get me to this goal? What should I prioritize?
