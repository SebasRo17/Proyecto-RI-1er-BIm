I would like to keep track of progress of a database request in an Enterprise CDF, but it won't allow `PrintTemporary` or `Monitor[]` to add content. When I use `Dynamic[If[progress<1,Refresh[ProgressIndicator@progress,TrackedSymbols:>{progress},UpdateInterval->.5],Histogram[outputData,<various_options_here>]],TrackedSymbols:>{progress}]`, the ProgressBar doesn't update during VERY heavy operations, like SQLExecute or building a Histogram out of a large set of numbers (2 sets of about 10^6 values). In addition, since the end result of the output has to be without a semicolon, I cannot tag `progress=1;` onto its end. E.g. `progress=0;long_SQL_request;progress=.5;Histogram[huge_data] progress=1;` <\- obviously can't do that last part. And `progress=.5` never gets picked up by the ProgressBar. Please help. Thank you!
