I have the following field in Flex:               [Bindable] public var zIndex:uint;      And I was trying to create the methods to process the calls in Java and I ran into a problem.               1. public int getZIndex(); // Does not work.     2. public int getzIndex(); // Works.      I thought that the letter following the `get`/`set` was supposed to be capitalized? Is there a reason for this? I couldn't find any documentation. I found an answer on StackOverflow that states that the first one is the correct way to name an accessor/mutator.
