The problem came up in a plot of RGB data obtained by imaging the variable star d-Cephei with a DSLR camera on several successive nights. I tried to plot the R, G, B intensity points for each day in a column and place a bitmap of the star (taken that day) over the column. This worked fine with `ListPlot` during September, but with October coming up, it was clear I would need something like `DateListPlot`. But when I substituted `DateListPlot`, after rewriting the data structures appropriately, I found that the points would plot, but the bitmaps that I had inserted with `Epilog` disappeared. Furthermore, by adding a `PlotRange` statement, I could get the bitmaps, but the R, G, B intensity points would not display. In what follows, I have tried to boil it down using just one suitable list of points for one color and just one bitmap created by rasterizing a Disk. Somewhat to my surprise, the problem is reproducible. As written, the image plotted with `ListPlot` shows it working properly, but it lacks the formatting of the date information on the x axis. The image plotted with `DateListPlot` formats the dates nicely, but it doesn't show the bitmap. My questions are:   1. What will make the bitmap display with `DateListPlot`?   2. How can I move the bitmap display above the range of the points on the Y axis, and below the title?   3. Is it possible to specify a `PlotRange` in DateListPlot? How would one specify the range for the x axis?   4. Why does this happen?   5. When will a book be published listing all the do's and don't's of plots and graphics in Mathematica? My code follows:               Clear[disk, datePts, pts, dateListPlot, listPlot]          disk = Rasterize[Graphics[Disk[]]];          datePts = {{{2012, 9, 24}, .1}, {{2012, 9, 25}, .35}, {{2012, 9,           26}, .75}, {{2012, 9, 27}, .90}, {{2012, 9, 28}, .60}, {{2012, 9,           29}, .30}, {{2012, 9, 30}, .10}};          pts = {#[[1, 3]], #[[2]]} & /@ datePts;          ListPlot[       pts,       PlotStyle -> Directive[{Red, PointSize[Large]}],       PlotLabel -> "ListPlot: Epilog disk visible",       Epilog -> Inset[disk, {23.75, .8}, {0, 0}, .4],       PlotRange -> {{23.5, 30.5}, {0, 1}},       Background -> LightGray       ]          DateListPlot[      datePts,      PlotStyle -> Directive[{Red, PointSize[Large]}],      PlotLabel -> "DateListPlot: Epilog disk not visible",      Epilog -> Inset[disk, {23.75, .8}, {0, 0}, .4],      (* Activate PlotRange makes Epilog visible, but points will not be visible. *)      (*PlotRange->{{23,30},{0,1}},*)      Background -> LightGray      ]
