I have rectangular regions in a plane. I want to consistently order them in a human-friendly way that a typical y-x sort won't work for. Basically I want (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1) to sort the same as (0,0), (1, -0.1), and (-0.1, 1). Ideas? * * * _From comments:_   * The obvious answers, y-x and x-y sort, result in different orders for the short example I posted. The things I'm coming up with, now, are clustering approaches where I cluster the y values, sort by cluster y means, then by x. > Question: What are you sorting your rectangles for? Searching? Displaying?   * Numbering the regions, and I want two region sets a human would say are nearly identical to get numbered identically.  > Question: Is the orientation of the rectangles really important (what is the > difference between (0,1) and (-1,0) in the problem domain)? Would primarily > sorting by area or diagonal be ok?   * I can't tell the orientation of them beyond portrait or landscape, and size doesn't work because a lot might be practically the same.
