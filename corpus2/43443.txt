I consider myself a programming language enthusiast. When I find bad code, especially my own, it is hard to understand, hard to change, and hard to test. My coworkers don't know better, or don't care. I am frustrated that I can't raise the code quality by myself. Is it normal to feel frustrated when the code quality, and maintainability, is not up to my standards? If so, how do you deal with it?
