Newer systems such as OpenCL are being made so that we can run more and more code on our graphics processors, which makes sense, because we should be able to utilise as much of the power in our systems as possible. However, with all of these new systems, it seems as if GPUs are better than CPUs in _every way_. Because GPUs can do parallel calculation, multi-core GPUs actually seem like they'd be much better than multi-core CPUs; you'd be able to do many calculations at once and really improve speed. Are there still certain cases where serial processing is still better, faster, and/or more efficient than parallel?
