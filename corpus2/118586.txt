_Note: I am surprised that this hasn't been asked before, and if it has I could not find it in a search._ I've been on tons of websites, I've read tons of articles, and I have heard tons of explanations. Most of them were good, but they were all either to broad or too complicated or just plain bad. So my question is , how does a compiler work? If this is a difficult, broad question, please tell me. But if not, please answer the question.
