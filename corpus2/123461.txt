Here's a question for me that really makes me wonder every time I start designing and developing a thick-client desktop application. I'm a .NET developer, and with my forms (WinForms mostly, but the platform should be unimportant) I also choose the startup position to be **Center**. The reason I do this is because I can't stand randomness, and as a user myself I don't like when windows jump all over my monitor. So my question for you, is what is the best way to go about this? Center an application startup window or have it randomly placed? And why?
