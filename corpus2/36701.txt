I have two (fairly large) lists of equal length & would like to pair them up. eg - from:               a = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {0, 3}};     b = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}};      I would like to get:               {{{0, 1}, {1, 2}}, {{0, 2}, {1, 3}}, {{0, 3}, {1, 4}}}      I have looked at various thing like Tuple, but can't see a way of doing it efficiently.
