I have been looking at web-frameworks in functional languages and eventually found Yesod and Ocsigen interesting. As far as I understand, they leverage the type system to statically prevent basic errors such as invalid HTML or internal dead links. My question is are there practical differences such as feature focus or maturity between these two frameworks? What does one have that the other miss? For example, with Yesod, can I write the entire web-application in Haskell and have the appropriate component compiled to Javascript? Thanks.
