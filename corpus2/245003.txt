I have a 2D array filled with a simple class:               class Tile     {         boolean N,E,S,W;     }      I also have a tilesheet representing all possible outcomes except all false (12 + crossroad). Now i need to reference all these possibilities to texture space on my sheet. Apart from having an if statement for each and every outcome is there a more efficient way i cannot currently think off?
