I'm trying to think of a nice and easy way to do this, but I thought I'd run it past some people for a second opinion: Say you've got 8 clients (one project for each customer) and each project derives from a core project. If a bug is raised that has to be fixed in core, our current approach is to create a bug and clone it for each customer (using Bugzilla). A lot of developers are finding it time consuming to manually clone the bugs across all clients and ensure that they are placed on each release tracker per customer. I suppose this is a workflow problem, so does anyone have suggestions on the best way to handle cloning bugs for multiple customers? Perhaps Bugzilla isn't the best tool for this. Most of us believe that it can not be fully automated and will require some manual intervention regardless of what tool we use. One idea I did have was to create a single bug issue. If it is a core bug and when assigning it for one release, we don't mark it as completely resolved as it has not been tested for all client projects that stem from the core project. The problem with this is that I would need a way to link the single bug to all customers and have it know when to automatically set it to resolved once the last customer has had a release. I don't believe Bugzilla has such a feature. Any thoughts or ideas would be welcome.
