I am trying to calculate a set of items that produce the highest damage output in a video game. There are about 50 different items, of which you can choose 6. There are all sorts of conditions that each item creates. I am writing a small app in javascript that calculates your damage based on the items. Could I utilize a genetic algorithm to find out which item combinations are the strongest? Or is brute force acceptable for this size of a problem? Or is there another way?
