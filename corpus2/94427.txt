_There was a company developing software product. They had adopted SCRUM as agile method for entire development department incl. programmers, testers and analysts. It had been working grand for them in early months. However later things started to revert, enthusiasm cooled down and slowly people drifted back into their usual habits. The sprint became 6-8 weeks long, daily stand ups became weekly status updates around the table with bug count parade, scrum master became just a badge rotated between team members like a hot potato, product owner disengaged and lost the ownership of the backlog, and so on._ My question for you, fellow agile practitioners, is how to regain the SCRUM principles in such situation? What could the team members who still believed and care do? What are the best steps for development manager to take in such situation in order to get the team back on track for SCRUM/Agile?
