I have a .c file that basically manages its own little database of people. There are add, remove, edit and search functions among some others. It has a static array which it uses to store the data. What is a good way to go about unit testing a file like this? Because the array is static I can't put in my own data. Should I employ some trickery and make a function that passes out a pointer to the array that gets compiled out in the production version? Should I just test the functions as is and make the data they way I want it via a series of adds and removes? What is the best way to test a file like this?
