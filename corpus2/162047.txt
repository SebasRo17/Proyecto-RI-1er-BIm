I'm looking at backbone.js and noticed that it supports various templating systems (they specifically refer to Mustache.js, Haml-js, and Eco, but I understand it can support even more)(like Pure and dust.js) My question is really why are there so many of these? What makes one better or different to the others? Can anyone shed light on what their individual strengths and weaknesses are.
