Talking generally abount **mobile application development** , I am looking for a list of appropriate questions to ask when visiting the client to get the initial requirements, i.e. what they suppose the application would be at the end. Let's assume that the mobile application idea is something very new for (our) clients and they do not much about what it can do, and how it does them, the only thing they know is they want a mobile application, installed on their phones, and should do what they want. Let's say I am a freelance mobile application developer and I want to get to know what the client thinks and get all the possible aspects that would affect pricing. What I really want is a list of questions, like:   * What is the platforms.   * How long do you expect us to deliver the project.   * etc Of course the list should not/ need not be long. Since the applications that a freelance developer develops is not so complicated, and the poeple who order them do not go through lots of details(since they are not technical enough).
