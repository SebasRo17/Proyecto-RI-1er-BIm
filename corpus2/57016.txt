Assume you import data from a Table source of the following format.               << GeneralUtilities`; fields = {"Country", "Region", "BU", "Year",      "Date", "Sales"};     organization = {{"Argentina", "LATAM", "Americas"}, {"SouthAfrica",          "Africa", "EAME"}, {"Brazil", "LATAM", "Americas"}, {"Japan",          "Japan", "APAC"}, {"Australia", "ASEAN", "APAC"}, {"Germany",          "Europe", "EAME"}};     SeedRandom[0];     list = Flatten[        Table[Join[          organization[[i]], {year, DateObject[{year, month, 1}],            RandomInteger[{100, 1000}]}], {i, 6}, {year, 2004,           2013}, {month, 1, 6, 5}], 2];     sales = Dataset[AssociationThread[fields, #] & /@ list]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HI4Q6.png) I would like to summarize the data at the year level. If working with a database, an SQL command of the following format would allow you to create a dataset that is still flat. > SELECT sales.Country, sales.Region, sales.BU, sales.Year, Sum(sales.Sales) > AS SumOfSales FROM sales GROUP BY sales.Country, sales.Region, sales.BU, > sales.Year; ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gSz8E.png) Using               sales[GroupBy@Key["Country"], GroupBy@Key["Region"],       GroupBy@Key["BU"], GroupBy[Key["Year"]], Total, "Sales"]      Creates a multilevel hierarchical data structure, which is not as simple to operate as a table type of dataset. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jcrzq.png) Is there a way to operate (total,mean, median,etc) on a dataset by grouping on several keys of interest while keeping the dataset flat the same way as done with the SQL procedure?
