I was thinking, is there a particular time in your coding where you verify that it works? Say, after coding a function, or an entire class, or an entire section of an app, or after every 'significant' block of code? I ask this, because I tend to verify my app too often, sometimes after every 3rd or 4th change. This is a habit which has proven very hard to shake. It appears to be counter productive to do this repeatedly and manually. Is there another solution? It seems to be either be a more competent programmer and essentially 'know' the return of the majority of your code, or have your IDE check the return periodically, or only test the return via TDD.
