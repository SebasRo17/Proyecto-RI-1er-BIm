I'm fixing code that is using ASCIIEncoding in some places and UTF-8 encoding in other functions. Since we aren't using the UTF-8 features, all of our unit tests passed, but I want to create a heightened awareness of encodings that produce similar results and may not be fully tested. I don't want to limit this to just UTF-8 vs ASCII, since I think issue with code that handles ASN.1 fields and other code working with Base64. So, what are the commonly confused encodings that may result in identical test data?
