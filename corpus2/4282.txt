I installed Adobe Type 1 Times Roman SC (small caps) and Times Roman Bold SC fonts on my Mac OS X system. Now every old or newly-created `Text` style cell in every Mathematica notebook appears in small caps! This is with the `Default.nb` style sheet. Why? And how to fix. Uninstalling the two fonts did cure the problem, but it makes no sense to me that this should have happened. Note that the Options Inspector shows the font settings for the `Text` style as being Times, 12, Plain.
