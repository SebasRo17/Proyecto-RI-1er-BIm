I've done some searching around on how to interpret morse code inputted by a human. I haven't found any existing libraries or applications that do this, but I found some academic papers on how it can be done. Before embarking on the journey of trying to interpret the academic language and advanced topics I have to know if it is okay for me to use these papers? What kind of license do they have? One I'm thinking of specifically is "A Morse-code recognition system with LMS and matching algorithms for persons with disabilities." but also others floating around. The paper mentioned appears to cost money to read, but then what? Can it have been patented? What rules apply here?
