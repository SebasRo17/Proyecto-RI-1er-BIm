I wonder if this is a bug, or if I'm misunderstanding something:               Exists[n, EvenQ[n] && PrimeQ[n]] // Resolve     (*     ==> False     *)      So if I interpret this result correctly, according to Mathematica there does not exist an even prime. However, if given the number directly, it gives the correct result:               EvenQ[2] && PrimeQ[2]     (*     ==> True     *)      So did I find a bug in Mathematica (and if so, is it fixed in the latest version)? Or did I misunderstand `Resolve`?
