I am trying to solve the following system of equations and did the following               Solve[x (1 - (y/(1 + y))) == ((1 - alpha) A y^alpha -            alpha A y^(alpha - 1))/sigma1 &&        1 - x == (0.0725 - alpha A y^(alpha - 1))/sigma2, {x, y}]      I want to solve for x and y symbolically, and then try to do the following. First, I want to find the numerical solution for the above system, given the values for `sigma1, sigma2, alpha, A`. Second, I want to assess whether the derivatives $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \sigma_i}$ and $\frac{\partial z}{\partial \sigma_i}$ are positive or negative by assigning values to the relative parameters. I am using _Mathematica_ 10, and once i tried to run the code above, i got this message: > Solve::inex: Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients > or the system obtained by direct rationalization of inexact numbers present > in the system. Since many of the methods used by Solve require exact input, > providing Solve with an exact version of the system may help. >> Any suggestions ?
