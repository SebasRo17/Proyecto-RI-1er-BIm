It's often useful to get just one number from `Solve`. I use the following construction for acquiring one solution from the expression returned by `Solve`.               q = t /. Solve[p == 2 t + 1, t][[1]]      Mostly I don't like to use the different variable name within `Solve`. And the rule-applying seems very unnatural. I think a solution that is more elegant must exist. Can anyone show me this?
