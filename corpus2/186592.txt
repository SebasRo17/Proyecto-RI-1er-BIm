I have a problem with Visual Studio 2012 and Environment Variables under Windows 7. I added a variable called `{LIBS}` with the value `C:/libs/`. In `C:/libs/` are folders containing C++ libraries. So far, so good. I added the paths to the project's settings (linker etc.), like `{$LIBS}boost` to include the boost libraries. I expected that I would now be able to use something like this               #include "boost/someboostfile"      but this does not work, I have to use the absolute path               #include "../../boost/someboostfile      but this is what I do not want to do. Is there anything I'm doing wrong?
