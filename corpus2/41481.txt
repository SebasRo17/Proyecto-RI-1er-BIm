I'd like to rank some functions according to their order of growth (e.g. `n^2 < n^3`). I'm not sure how to do order of growth in mathematica, so I was trying to rank the functions by their `Limit[x,x->Infinity]`. Here's what I have so far:               v = {2^(Log[2, n]), n^(1/2), Log[10, n], 2^(2^n), Log[2, Log[2, n]],       n*Log[2, n], n!, Iteratedlog[2, n], 1, n^3,       Log[2, n], (n^2)*Log[2, n], n, n^n, 100, n^2, 2^(2^(n + 1)), 2^n}          Sort[v, Limit[#1, n -> Infinity] < Limit[#2, n -> Infinity] &]      However, this doesn't even seem to work to sort the functions as a limit. What steps should I take to solve my problem? Thanks!
