I have the following lists of rules:               {x -> 1, y -> 2}     {x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 4}     {x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 2}      For each list of rules, I would like to add the rule `z -> 3` or replace any rule whose lhs is `z`   with `z -> 3` . I am able to get this to work for specific rules, for example `z -> 4`               AddReplaceRule[rules_List] :=      Module[{newRules},       If [MemberQ[rules, z -> 4],        newRules = DeleteCases[rules, z -> 4];        ,        newRules = rules;        ];       Append[newRules, z -> 3]       ]      * * * **Results** _Note I am expecting to see_ `{x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 3}` _for all three cases, but that is not the case, since I need to generalize_ `z -> 4` _in AddReplaceRule._               In[]:= AddReplaceRule[{x -> 1, y -> 2}]     Out[]= {x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 3}          In[]:= AddReplaceRule[{x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 4}]     Out[]= {x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 3}          In[]:= AddReplaceRule[{x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 2}]     Out[]= {x -> 1, y -> 2, z -> 2, z -> 3}
