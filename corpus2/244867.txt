Currently working on a web based CRM type system that deals with various Modules such as Companies, Contacts, Projects, Sub Projects, etc. A typical CRM type system (asp.net web form, C#, SQL Server backend). We plan to implement role based security so that basically a user can have one or more roles. Roles would be broken down by first the module type such as: -Company -Contact And then by the actions for that module for instance each module would end up with a table such as this:               Role1 Example:              Module   Create  Edit        Delete   View         Company   Yes    Owner Only    No     Yes         Contact   Yes    Yes           Yes    Yes      In the above case `Role1` has two module types (Company, and Contact). For company, the person assigned to this role can create companies, can view companies, can only edit records he/she created and cannot delete. For this same role for the module contact this user can create contacts, edit contacts, delete contacts, and view contacts (full rights basically). I am wondering is it best upon coming into the system to session the user's role with something like a: `List<Role> roles;` Where the `Role` class would have some sort of `List<Module> modules;` (can contain Company, Contact, etc.).? Something to the effect of:               class Role{     string name;     string desc;     List<Module> modules;     }      And the module action class would have a set of actions (Create, Edit, Delete, etc.) for each module:               class ModuleActions{     List<Action> actions;     }      And the action has a value of whether the user can perform the right:               class Action{     string right;     }      Just a rough idea, I know the action could be an enum and the ModuleAction can probably be eliminated with a `List<x, y>`. My main question is what would be the best way to store this information in this type of application: Should I store it in the User Session state (I have a session class where I manage things related to the user). I generally load this during the initial loading of the application (global.asax). I can simply tack onto this session. Or should this be loaded at the page load event of each module (page load of company etc..). I eventually need to be able to hide / unhide various buttons / divs based on the user's role and that is what got me thinking to load this via session. Any examples or points would be great.
