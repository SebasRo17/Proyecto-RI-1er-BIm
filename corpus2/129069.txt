> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do you handle a graphic designer who thinks he's a web designer? As a mobile/web developer in my company, I deal a lot with designers (i.e. Adobe suite designers). The problem is that these designers always want things from their point of view, by which I mean, they don't understand UX rules and other things such as how users interact with the software. And this is where problems start... Any suggestion on how to deal with them?
