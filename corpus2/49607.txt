My team recently went through the process of laying out a nearly one year plan for our work. We separated the plan into three phases. Each phase will include a couple of launches. I wonder, from an agile point of you, is this wrong? I think it's not a bad idea, because we haven't spent too much time on designing anything but the first few steps. It's possible for us to change direction. At the same time it's nice that we don't act with only the near term in sight.
