I've noticed posts on here demonstrating the use of delegates\lambda functions to solve the hole in the middle idea without a lot of repetition: http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/04/04/functional-c-the-hole-in-the- middle-pattern/ The problem seems to be that junior developers and others don't necessarily understand what the function pointer\delegate\lambda function concept is, which seems to make reading (and possibly debugging) the code more difficult. Should we avoid or severely limit the use of this tool in writing business software, especially in small team or sole developer shops? Or is it acceptable to use it with appropriate comments and expect that when I'm no longer around that the next developer will understand or learn about lambda functions?
