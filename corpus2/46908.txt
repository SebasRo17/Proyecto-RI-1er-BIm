I've used the ConfidentialReport stylesheet for a CDF document. When I edit the CDF within MMA a Paragraph Item appears with an opener as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Xxuc.jpg) but when the document is opened in the Player itself, the opener is not there. Does anyone know of a systemic reason why, or a fix? (I've a related question about local stylesheets for CDF documents but there's quite a bit of discussion already which I need to trawl through first...)
