Recently I'm spending my time implementing some computer vision algorithms, which usually handle a large amount of data. The problem I'm facing now is that I have to reform my video data to pass it to `Fourier`. To be precise, I'm trying to apply a temporal filter to video, whose dimension is **Time*X*Y*Channel** , while I want to apply `Fourier` to `video[[All, x, y, c]]` (`x`,`y`,`c` are some integers). I've already tried to naively reform the data using `Table`. It works like charm for small data, but for large data, reforming alone takes long and consumes too much memory. (Took about 4 minutes and 3~4 GB of memory to handle data < 100 MBytes) MATLAB's `shiftdim` sounds like a nice solution, while I failed to find an equivalent or workarounds for _Mathematica_. (Or maybe my approach is wrong?) ## In short: > Is there any way to efficiently reform a multi-dimensional array, just like > `shiftdim`?
