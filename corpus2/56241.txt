With Mathematica 10 for Mac, `BitShiftRight` works properly on lists of up to 100000 numbers, but appears to give incorrect results when threaded over lists of 100001 or more:               v1 = Table[i, {i, 1, 100000}];     v2 = Table[i, {i, 1, 100001}];     s1 = BitShiftRight[v1];     s2 = BitShiftRight[v2];     s1[[1 ;; 10]]     s2[[1 ;; 10]]      > >     Out[1070]= {0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5} >   >     Out[1071]= {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20} >   The error seems to occur for any `BitShiftRight[n,k]` whenever n is a list exceeding 100000 values. Mathematica 9 gives correct output:               v1 = Table[i, {i, 1, 100000}];     v2 = Table[i, {i, 1, 100001}];     s1 = BitShiftRight[v1];     s2 = BitShiftRight[v2];     s1[[1 ;; 10]]     s2[[1 ;; 10]]      > >     Out[799]= {0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5} >   >     Out[800]= {0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5} >   I have several notebooks that apply `BitShiftRight[n,k]` to very large lists. The only Mathematica 10 workaround seems to be the equivalent `IntegerPart[n/2^k]` that continues to work on very large lists, but is slower and requires rewriting previously working code. Otherwise I would need to stick with MM 9 for these notebooks. Can anyone confirm this anomalous MM 10 output? Does it affect other platforms? Am I missing something simple, or is this a true MM 10 bug? Thanks
