I have this formula, and many other which contains sum, I am perfectly able to do the computation over a list, however to do this I need to do it in several _manual_ steps. Therefore, I wonder if there would be any elegant way of adding sequence to it or hold the expression or something similar making it run without needing to do step wise computation _manually_. $$\frac{(x-\bar{x})}{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2}$$ Please note by manually I mean example calculating the mean first and then subtract it from the list and then sum it and so on.
