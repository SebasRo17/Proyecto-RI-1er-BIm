I'm working on a legacy system with troubling behavior - it uses the same identifiers to signify different things in different places. The system in question is a CRM system. It uses special codes for each subscriber's account to signify a bundle of features they've purchased access to. These codes are transmitted to licensing servers, which activate the appropriate features. However, the same code means different things depending on which licensing server happens to serve the subscriber. For example:   * Code 241 means the subscriber has access to features 1-10, 12, and 20-50 if they are served by licensing server A.   * Code 241 means the subscriber has access to features 1-20, 33, 34, and 50 if they are served by licensing server B. Clearly (to me, at least), it would be better if each code meant one things. That is, 241 should mean (1-10, 12, 20-50) everywhere and new code 242 should mean (1-20, 33, 34, and 50) everywhere. Is there a name for a problem of out-of-band data being required to uniquely specify something?
