Say I have an expression `test = 3 x1^2 - 2 x3^-3` and I would like to decompose the expression into `{3 x1^2, -(2/x3^3)}`, I can do that by using `List @@ test` on Mathematica. However, the problem I face is that when the expression is `test = x1^2`, i get `{x1, 2}` and for `test = (3 x1^2)` i get `{3, x1^2}` instead of `{x1^2}` and `{3x1^2}` respectively. The added information I have is the list of variables. For example, if `test = x1^2` I have the list of variables, which is `{x1}`. And for `test = 3 x1^2 - 2 x3^-3`, I have `{x1,x3}` Is there any other way to get what I want? Thanks
