I am thinking of making some applications for Linux (primarily Ubuntu) and I have an intention of selling some in the Ubuntu Software Center and offering a few applications for free. These free applications will be minor programs mainly used for fun and/or for a little convenience in day-to-day tasks (say, a ToDo list). What is the suitable license I should use for this? As for the paid applications, they will be more business-oriented (eg: a decision making software). For these, what is the suitable license type? I really confused about all these licenses (I have heard of Creative Commons, GNU, etc but have no idea whatsoever). And I'm hoping to make these applications using PyGTK and Quickly and some with Java. So if anyone could provide some light on this subject, I'm really grateful.
