I heard the term "post-mortem debugging", and Wikipedia says it's debugging done after the program has crashed. I often debug Python apps using a debugger that stops execution once an important-enough exception has been raised. Then I can use the debug probe to investigate. Does this count as "post-mortem debugging"? Because the program doesn't really crash. **EDIT:** If the answer is no, then what name would you use for the kind of debugging that I described?
