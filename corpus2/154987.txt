I work in a small shop at a fairly big company doing intranet web applications. By small, I mean there is 1 other guy in my position... and he graduated with me last December. (we aren't the only IT, but the only ones in our field) We are switching out an old COBOL system and converting it's only used application suite to a Web App. My company has contracted to a Web Application firm to help with this process who has chosen ASP.NET MVC, during one of the important meetings I asked if they will be using MVC2 or MVC3. Their lead developer said: > "MVC2, we don't want to support MVC3. haha" My question is, why is this? This was several months ago and I've been doing extensive and self training gearing up for the MVC switch. From everything I am understanding, MVC3 is just like MVC2 if you don't use Razor and it fixes a number of smaller bugs that MVC2 had. So in my eyes, I can't see any reason to **NOT** use MCV3. There has to be something I'm missing. Since I don't really have any mentors to turn to in the real world, I'm coming here. What problems are there with MVC3 that might possibly lead him to say this that I'm missing?
