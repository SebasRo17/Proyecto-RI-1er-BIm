Is this user story substantively correct: > As a system owner, I want everybody that uses the system to have to log in > using a secure password and login system, to prevent unauthorised and random > access to system data. And then: > As a user, I want to be able to log in with my secure password, so that only > I can access areas of the system I need to do my work. I have several other stories for the system owner, like password format, lockouts etc. Is this a good place for these requirements? As stories for the system owner?
