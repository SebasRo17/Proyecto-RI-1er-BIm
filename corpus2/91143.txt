It may seem like a silly question, but it's important at least for me and I'm interesting to hear from you. I'm a .NET developer 4 years ago, even before I went to university, I'm currently earning an MCTS in web development, and some of them told me that it's invaluable for my position, I'm not and wouldn't be an IT student anyway, just because I believe that in IT field, knowledge could be gained from experience and self-teaching (via books and videos) , I know lot of IT students (in my region at least) fight just for the sake of having a degree and to get a job, no more... I'm currently looking forward to complete my path in MS Certifications and hold the MCPD, is it really that you should be an IT guy in order to be certified? does it make sense for you that non IT students never need those certifications?
