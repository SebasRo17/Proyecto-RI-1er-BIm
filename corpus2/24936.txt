I have a large data set with 150k lines and two data columns. I noticed that there is a linear trend, which I want to remove. So, I do the following: first fit with a linear model               model = LinearModelFit[data, x, x]      then, I substract the fit from the data               data1 = data;     data1[[All, 2]] = data[[All, 2]] - model[data[[All, 1]]] + model[0];      This, however, takes unacceptable amount of time. Is there any way I can speed things up.
