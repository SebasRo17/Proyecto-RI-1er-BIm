This is my code, I want each line leaving a vertex to be the same colour from that vertex. So there should be 5 different coloured lines one colour for each vertex.               GraphPlot[{"Non-Drinker" -> "Non-Drinker",      "Non-Drinker" -> "Moderate", "Non-Drinker" -> "Harmful",      "Non-Drinker" -> "Deed", "Moderate" -> "Moderate",      "Moderate" -> "Hazardous", "Moderate" -> "Harmful",       "Moderate" -> "Deed", "Hazardous" -> "Non-Drinker",       "Hazardous" -> "Moderate", "Hazardous" -> "Hazardous",       "Hazardous" -> "Harmful", "Hazardous" -> "Deed",       "Harmful" -> "Non-Drinker", "Harmful" -> "Hazardous",       "Harmful" -> "Harmful", "Harmful" -> "Deed",       "Deed" -> "Non-Drinker"}, VertexLabeling -> True,       DirectedEdges -> {True, "ArrowheadsSize" -> 0.1},       MultiedgeStyle -> 0.1, PlotStyle -> {Black}, SelfLoopStyle -> 0.3,       EdgeRenderingFunction -> (If[First[#2] == Last[#2],          {Red, Arrow[#1, 0.05]}, {GrayLevel[0.1],Arrow[#1, 0.05]}] &)]      Thanks![This is what I have so far](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fk17p.jpg)
