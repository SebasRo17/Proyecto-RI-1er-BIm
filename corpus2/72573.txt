What's the best way to programmatically create a header file for another project? Here's the specific use case: one program fingerprints the device for discrete information like version number, id string, etc, and then creates a header file populating static structs/program constants. This header file is then consumed by multiple projects to define a type of that class. I thought about reading writing in an xml or flat file, that means consuming projects need to know that structure of the and plug in libraries to read it.
