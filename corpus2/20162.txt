The Sound function represents the sound signal very primitive in my opinion. There are only two buttons (play and pause). No rewind, no playing from some point on (like the most sound players have). Also the upper part(with the plots) does not "run" as the song is played. I can not change PlotStyle, PlotRange or AspectRatio(so I can not have a good zooming). There is no ColorFunction as the Plot function has(so I can not color the volume or pitch plots). Not to speak of music visualization (see, for example,projectm.sourceforge.net). Could the things get better? Any proposals, please?
