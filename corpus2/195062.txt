I'm looking for a reference to clean coding styles that I can pass to a team member. In particular, the rule that a method should not change its return type based on an input parameter. If you need different output, use a different method. Example:               $invoice_items = getInvoiceItems();     $total         = getInvoiceItems( TRUE );      To me, this is bad coding style (and I'm not even talking about a parameter whose meaning can't be determined from the calling code). The above example should actually be:               $total = totalInvoiceItems();      ... where `totalInvoiceItems()` might call `getInvoiceItems()` to get the items it needs to total. Where would I find a reference to this (and possibly other important coding style rules)?
