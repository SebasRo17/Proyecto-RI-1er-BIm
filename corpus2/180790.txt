For example, if I have a Customer Transactions Table and I create a REST for it. The fields are: date, description, and total_amount. I am trying to figure out which one is much more efficient when you get the sum and the count of the transactions:   1. You create a REST for `/transactons` URI and it lists down all the transactions. Then, you `sum` all transactions using javascript and you `count` all transactions using javascript.   2. You create a REST for `/transactions/count` and `/transactions/sum` URI and lists down count and sum for all transactions. Then, get the count and sum using javascript. I'm wondering which one is a better way.
