Let's say I write a mobile app and I want to sell it on all three:   1. Apple Market Place   2. Android Market Place   3. Windows Market Place Will any of these market places tell me that it's not possible, that in order to sell it I must only go through them and not through the other ones? p.s I know Angry Birds sells on all three. But how is that? I mean, don't books, for example, have exclusivity deals with their distributors?
