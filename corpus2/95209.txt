**Backround:** I am currently a Junior in college working towards a degree in MIS. I've been interning with a compnay for a 3 summers and a winter break in there. With only 11 months to go before I start marketing myself to potential employers I've decided to teach myself as much as possible about languages and platforms that are currently in high demand. My school offers job placement, but I've heard stories where it doesn't work out so well for applicants. Its this reason I've started doing searches for jobs online - Dice, Monster, CareerBuilder, etc. It seems that the only jobs I can find reequire at least up to 5 years experience. I also know not every requirement needs to be exact. **Situation:** Although I've not been in the field for 5 years, I would like to assure employers that I'd be able to keep up with someone who was. Experience is critical to self-development but I need somewhere to gain that experience. If you were an employer looking for someone with 5+ years experience, what would you expect them to know? How can you tell a 2 year from a 5 year besides a resume? I know this question is very general and it could apply to many different levels. I'm mainly concerned with programming languages such as C#, Java, etc. I won't be an expert on either but I want to know what I can at least set as a goal? **EDIT** : I found this website that explains the progression of skills that I though gave me an idea of where I stand. I know it doesn't specify years like I asked but it was helpful nonetheless.
