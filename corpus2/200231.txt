I am completely new to designing algorithms with graphs. I am following CLRS and other video lectures in Youtube, notably from IIT/MIT. They are pretty good, and I currently have decent idea about graph data structures, search, spanning-tree, etc. However, I am completely clueless as to how to identify a coding problem (the likes of which you see in Topcoder/Codechef) that requires a graph-based approach. In which problem, shall I need to use a minimum spanning tree? Where do I need to use Prim's Algorithm? Is there ay book/resource which covers lots of problems on graphs, explaining (well, kind of spoon feeding) how to identify that this problem requires a graph-based solution, and finally how to do it?
