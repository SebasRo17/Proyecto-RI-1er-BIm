I am using Linux, and I would like to be able to programmatically open notebooks in a running Mathematica instance from the command line. Currently, doing something like /opt/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/Executables/Mathematica foo.nb launches a new kernel/frontend instance. Is it possible to re-use a running frontend for opening notebooks (short of enforcing single-instance behavior, for which I believe there is a command line option)?
