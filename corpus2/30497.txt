I am interested in the following problem in combinatorics $\Cap$ Probability. Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{N}$ be a parameter. Consider a matrix of $2^\lambda$ rows and $2^\lambda$ columns. Each column differs from every other column in at least superpolynomial (in $\lambda$) rows. Does there exist some $t$ ($\in \mathbb{N}$) that is polynomial in $\lambda$ such that the following holds? Condition: For every column $C$, rows $R_1,...,R_t$, let $Same_{C,R_1,...,R_t}$ denote the set of columns that have the same entries in Rows $R_1,...,R_t$ as the column $C$. Now choose $t$ random rows $R_1,...,R_t$. Can I be assured that, with all but negligible probability over the choice of the rows, there exists $m$ ($\in \mathbb{N}$) that is polynomial in $\lambda$ such that for every column $C$ its corresponding set $Same_{C,R_1,...,R_t}$ contains at most $m$ columns? (Intuitively, I want to identify a column in this matrix -- upto a precision of polynomially many columns -- by choosing at most polynomially many rows at random.). Thanks!
