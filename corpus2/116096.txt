I am using Hg for my development. Recently, I upgraded to Lion and Xcode 4.2 and I have created a Xcode project in my source tree. The Xcode by default uses Git and created .git folder in the project folder. Being able to do versioning in Xcode is a plus but it is sort of redundant with both Git and Hg. The problem is, should I check in the .git (folder and files) in the Xcode project folder or not? Or should I just switch off Git in Xcode and delete .git folder? Thanks.
