**Note:** The bug described in this post is found in Mathematica version 9 and seems to have been fixed in version 10. Ok I don't know if it's a bug or what, but here's what I found: If I use this function:               ContourPlot3D[Cos[2*Pi*z] + Cos[2*Pi*y] + Cos[2*Pi*x], {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1}]      I get this error: > Rest::norest: Cannot take the rest of expression {} with length zero. >> I have found that this issue is sometimes due to a need to use a numeric function. So I used:               ContourPlot3D[N[Cos[2*Pi*z] + Cos[2*Pi*y] + Cos[2*Pi*x]], {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1}]      And I get this error: > Divide::indet: Indeterminate expression 0./0. encountered. >> Range::range: > Range specification in Range[3.,3.,0.] does not have appropriate bounds. >> I also tried:               ContourPlot3D[Cos[2*Pi*z?NumericQ] + Cos[2*Pi*y?NumericQ] + Cos[2*Pi*x?NumericQ],        {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1}]      But I get: > ContourPlot3D::valuef: N[Cos[2 π z?NumericQ]+Cos[2 π y?NumericQ]+Cos[2 π > x?NumericQ]] must be a numerical function. >> However, if I try any of this:               ContourPlot3D[N[Cos[z] + Cos[y] + Cos[x]], {x, 0, 2*Pi}, {y, 0, 2*Pi}, {z, 0,2*Pi}]     ContourPlot3D[Cos[z] + Cos[y] + Cos[x], {x, 0, 2*Pi}, {y, 0, 2*Pi}, {z, 0, 2*Pi}]      I get no error what-so-ever. But the error with `NumericQ` persists. I'd also like to point out that the `NumericQ` error is the only one preventing me from getting the 3D graphics. Does anybody know what's going on?
