Let's consider the following simple case:               V = 1/2*(x^2 + y^2) + x^2*y - 1/3*y^3;     h = 0.3;     rad = 6*h;          S1 = ContourPlot[V, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, Contours -> {h},      ContourShading -> False, ContourStyle -> {Darker[Green], Thick},      PlotPoints -> 100, PerformanceGoal :> "Speed", AspectRatio -> 1];     S2 = ContourPlot[x^2 + y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, Contours -> {rad},     ContourShading -> False, ContourStyle -> {Blue, Thick, Dashed},      PlotPoints -> 100, PerformanceGoal :> "Speed", AspectRatio -> 1];     P0 = Show[{S1, S2}, FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"}, RotateLabel -> False,      FrameStyle -> Directive[FontSize -> 20, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],      PlotRange -> 1.5, ImageSize -> 550]      which gives ![chans](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bqhtu.jpg) We see, that the blue dashed circle intersects the green contour at the three openings (exits). I would like to draw the symmetrical parts of the circle inside these exits. By the term symmetrical, I mean with reverse curvature. I added by hand and with red color in the plot the symmetrical parts. Any ideas how to obtain this? **EDIT** A copy of the above code (in version 9) can be found here:code.
