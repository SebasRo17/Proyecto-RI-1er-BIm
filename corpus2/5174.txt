I have a large list of lists with the dimensions {441,21,21,3} of which I need to print the x,y,z data from every 21st part up to 441. How can I print the 21x21x3 piece of every 21st part of this list? Here's what I've tried below that did not do the job. Also is there an more memory efficient way to perform this task?:               Table[Print["mylist parts", mylist[[i++21]]], {i, 1, 441}];
