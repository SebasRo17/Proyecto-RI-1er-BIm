I'm wondering what the best practice is for my git repository structure where I have an Android application + a web service backend. In general, I'd like to release these two independently (e.g., perf fixes to the backend with no changes to the front-end), but I am worried that if I keep these in two separate repos I'll lose the ability to see combined app + web service changes (e.g., there's a change in the APIs on the server). What are other Android developers doing to manage their source code + release process? Should I use one git repo with separate folders or two git repos? I should note that I'd like to set this up as push-to-deploy -- any changes to my master branch will trigger a tag and deploy.
