I have very big dataset, with over 14 000 000 records. And maybe more! Each record consists of Data ( Real ) and Time ( integer ). I group records by time interval, resulting in 300 groups. In each group there are 70 000 records. I need to draw a `BoxWhiskerChart`. BUT, The system has frozen for 15 minutes. And then work is very slow. I think the reason this froze, is that I give it groups that are very large. But what can I do?
