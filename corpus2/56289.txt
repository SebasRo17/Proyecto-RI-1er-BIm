I want to plot only **parts** of the sphere of radius 1 where the gradient $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ is < 0, = 0 and > 0. The full sphere is given by:               ContourPlot3D[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 == 1, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iTGBe.jpg) I know how to plot parts of the sphere where $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < 0.5 $ or something, but I can't figure out how to apply the condition to the gradient. UPDATE: The positive and negative gradients turn out fine, but when I try to plot gradient = 0 it turns out funny. I tried to find $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 0$ for the equation but it didn't work: $$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 == xy $$               eq1 = x^2  y + y^2 + z^2 x == x y     ContourPlot3D[Evaluate[eq1], {x, -2, 1}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -2, 2}]          deriv = Derivative[1, 0][z][x, y] /.          First[  Solve[    D[eq1 /. z ->   z[x, y], x],             Derivative[1, 0][z][x, y]  ]  ]  /. z[x, y] ->  z;          Positive1 =        ContourPlot3D[Evaluate[eq1], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -2, 2},         RegionFunction ->  Function[{x, y, z}, deriv > 0], Mesh -> False,          ContourStyle -> Blue, MaxRecursion -> 5];     Negative1 =        ContourPlot3D[Evaluate[eq1], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -2, 2},         RegionFunction ->  Function[{x, y, z}, deriv < 0], Mesh -> False,         ContourStyle -> Red, MaxRecursion -> 5];     zero1 = ContourPlot3D[        Evaluate[eq1], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -2, 2},         RegionFunction ->  Function[{x, y, z}, deriv = 0], Mesh -> False,         ContourStyle -> Green, MaxRecursion -> 5];          Show[Positive1]     Show[Negative1]     show[zero1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aXsUE.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ou2Iv.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lfqaT.png)
