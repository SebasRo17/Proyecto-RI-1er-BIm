I saw an interview with Joel Spolsky, where he says that Fog Creek Software intentionally keep their teams small (I believe as in four-five guys). The reason for this is to avoid a lot of the communication needed between the team members if the teams are larger. If one compares this to open source projects, where there can be hundreds (or thousands?) of contributors. Whether they are a team, is, though, arguable. There are probably also examples of something in between, with team sizes of 20 developers. My question is: What kind of software is most suited for getting developed by small teams, and what kind of software is suited for large teams?
