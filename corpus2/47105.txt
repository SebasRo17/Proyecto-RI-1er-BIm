(Sqrt[#] Sqrt[Quantity[2, "ElectronMass" ("SpeedOfLight")^2] + #] )/(       Quantity[1, "ElectronMass" ("SpeedOfLight")^2] + #) &[      Quantity[50, "Gigaelectronvolts"]]     (* 1.00000 *)     InputForm[%]     (* 0.99999999994777708655477259390422583293`6.882488164549814 *)      The precision is only 6 digits, which is anomalously low. I'm expecting about 0.999999999948, so that `InputForm` magnitude is not just a floating-point error. I'm aware that the physical constants involved, including the ones on which the units depend, are not themselves known to very high precision. But it seems to me that the structure of the expression should allow Mathematica to keep a great deal more precision than it shows me.
