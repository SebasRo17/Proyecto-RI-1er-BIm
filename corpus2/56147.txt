I actually already found my answer on the question, however it is not working. see BoxWhiskerChart with logarithmic axes I want to create a boxwiskerchart with a logaritmic axes. But when I try `ScalingFunctions` with "Log" I do not get the results I am suppose to get. Sometimes it does not work at all. And sometimes I get the wiskers upside down. What am I doing wrong?               data = RandomVariate[RayleighDistribution[RandomInteger[500]], {8, 50}];     BoxWhiskerChart[data, "Outliers", ChartStyle -> 56]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aHd1r.jpg)               BoxWhiskerChart[data, "Outliers", ChartStyle -> 56, ScalingFunctions -> "Log"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lfpc5.jpg) Also using Log10 does not work               BoxWhiskerChart[data, "Outliers", ChartStyle -> 56, ScalingFunctions -> "Log10"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zIAjn.jpg)
