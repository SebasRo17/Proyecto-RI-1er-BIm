I'm currently reading about database schemas about how the three-level ANSI- SPARC architecture works and i'm a bit confused about a concept it's talking about. My question is what would happen if an application was modified so it could store data for a column not defined in the logical schema? The book i'm reading talks about: > ... the addition or removal of new entities, attributes or relationships > should be possible without having to change existing external schemas or > having to rewrite application programs." - Database Systems: A practical > Approach to Design, Implementation and Management. Page: 40 (Part: 2.1.5)   * How does the logical schema handle input (columns) from applications for which it is not defined in the logical schema?
