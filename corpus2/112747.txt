I used to blame changing specifications from clients for code rot, not realising that business models do change and it's my job to develop in an adaptable way. I now see that as a sign of a bad developer (I've changed!). But now I see other 'whinges' in myself. A few times recently I've found myself saying 'it's like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole', and also I find myself blaming client indecision for a project not progressing. Are there signs I should look out for where I should change my attitude? Is the client always right, or am I sometimes justified in getting frustrated?
