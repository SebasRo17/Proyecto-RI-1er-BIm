I'm developing an iOS app for a museum as a freelancer. It's a very simple video player, to be installed on a single iPad that will be part of a permanent exhibition, basically acting as a kiosk. It turns out the iPad is the ideal device for that if you're looking for a small and affordable touchscreen. The problem is: as far as I can tell, none of the Apple Developer Program options available will allow me to distribute an app like that. The relevant options are (from the link above): > **iOS Developer Program ($99/year)** Select this program if you would like > to distribute apps on the App Store as an individual, sole proprietor, > company, organization, government entity or educational institution. > > **iOS Developer Enterprise Program ($299/year)** Select this program if you > would like to develop proprietary apps for internal distribution within your > company, organization, government entity or educational institution. The regular program requires distribution through the App Store. The Enterprise version is for internal distribution within _my own organization_. Neither is the case here! It seems like I'm doomed to violate Apple's terms of service (and I can think of at least two ways of doing that: jailbreaking, or changing the iPad's date so it won't know the provisioning profile expired). Is that really so, or did I get the descriptions wrong? Has anyone here been in a similar situation?
