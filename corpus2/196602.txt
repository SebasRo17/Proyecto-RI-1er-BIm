I was reading this article: Designing Flags Enumerations @ msdn and it says > Combining flags enumeration values is an intermediate skill that should not > be required for developers implementing common scenarios. I think flags enumeration is awesome - something I learned about during my experience with C. Why does it seem like this article is cautioning developers away from what I consider to be a useful (and not complex) skill?
