I have a project that I created under GPL (I am copyright holder). The mistake I made is I deciding to go closed source, in doing that I removed the open source download access and removed the project from sourceforge. A third party came in and recreated the project on sourceforge (under the same name) with the last GPL release and plans to modify the software. (For download access) Is it required by GPL that any branches of the project by under a new name? http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl- faq.html#WhyDoesTheGPLPermitUsersToPublishTheirModifiedVersions "Sometimes control over modified versions is proposed as a means of preventing confusion between various versions made by users. In our experience, this confusion is not a major problem. Many versions of Emacs have been made outside the GNU Project, but users can tell them apart. The GPL requires the maker of a version to place his or her name on it, to distinguish it from other versions and to protect the reputations of other maintainers. UPDATE The third party and I decided to leave the project page in place and redirect users to a new page for the open source version. This way the old page serves a purpose of notifying former users of the status of the project.
