I want to define a function which takes in two integers (indicating the lengths of 2 vectors), and solves a simple set of expressions at a set of points to find all the values in both the vectors. so far I have managed to successfully create a function which does exactly what I say above, except that rather than taking two integers as arguments, it takes the two vectors itself. Forgive me for the length of this next code fragment:               solution[svec_, nvec_] :=        NSolve[        Table[          approx[svec, nvec, -Cos[n*Pi/(Length[nvec] + Length[svec])]] ==             exact[-Cos[n*Pi/(Length[nvec] + Length[svec])]],          {n, 1, Length[nvec] + Length[svec]}],        Join[svec, nvec]];      The               -Cos[n*Pi/(Length[nvec] + Length[svec])      part is just a set of points. All of the above works fine. My attempt to change it so that it takes in just integers was to do the following: STEP ONE: create a function which takes an integer, gives a vector of length integer:               nvec[Q_] := Table[Unique["n"], {Q}];     svec[M_] := Table[Unique["s"], {M}];      STEP TWO: replace all of the `svec`s and `nvec`s in the previous code fragment with `nvec[Q]` and `svec[M]`. (could also get rid of Lengths obviously):               solution[Q_, M_] :=        NSolve[         Table[           approx[svec[M], nvec[Q], -Cos[n*Pi/(Q + M)]] == exact[-Cos[n*Pi/(Q + M)]],           {n, 1, M + Q}],         Join[svec[M], nvec[Q]]];      STEP THREE: Call the function               sol = solution[10, 20]      For some reason, this doesn't work. I never get an error; it just never finishes evaluating. Any help would be very much appreciated
