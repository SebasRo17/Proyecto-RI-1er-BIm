I'm looking for an efficient way of extracting the first element after the first sequence of N consecutive elements in which the values are increasing. If these are the data of a toy example:               data = {{1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 4}, {7, 6}, {8,         3}, {9, 4}, {10, 5}, {11, 6}, {12, 7}, {13, 8}, {14, 9}, {15, 10}};      and I would like to get the first element after the first sequence of 5 consecutive increasing values (from those in second position), I should obtain the row {13,8}. I was playing around with:               Split[data, #2[[2]] > #1[[2]] &]      that groups my data in sequences of increasing values, but I wasn't able to find a way to add the additional constraints I need. Any hint is much appreciated.
