I have about 1000 or so programming books, but a good selection are on languages/frameworks that are dated, like Django 1.1, Symfony 1.3, or HTML 4 and CSS 2. I just got them all back from storage and was sorting through what ones are of no use to me. So, I was wondering. Dated programming books are unlikey to be of any value to go through the hassle of selling them. Ideally I'd like to give them away but I can't find anywhere online to distribute them. Any ideas on what to do with them?
