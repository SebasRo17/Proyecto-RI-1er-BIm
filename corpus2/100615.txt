Assuming:   * The employee and company are parting on good terms   * The new company is OK with a little contract work as long as it doesn't distract from the new job   * The former company wants the help and the employee is willing to work a few hours a week Is it a good idea to do contract work for a former full time employer? Has anyone ever done this? How did it work out for you? I can see some possible pitfalls, so I wonder how good an idea it really is. What difficulties do you encounter doing development work outside the office and on a different schedule from the rest of the programming staff and how can they be overcome? If I do go forward, what would be a fair amount to request as compared to current salary?
