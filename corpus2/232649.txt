Would it be considered acceptable to use word compounds instead of numbers for version iterations? For example in a pattern: "[Adjective] [Noun]" The first version could be something like: "Auspicious Armadillo" Thus on each sequential release the noun would change to the next letter of the alphabet and the version could be along the lines of: "Auspicious Bear" Once the alphabet for the nouns runs out the Adjective gets changed and the Nouns can start over e.g: "Bewildered Armadillo" etc. This would give me around 676 possible different versions to iterate through. Assuming the project is small & short enough to fall within these 676 releases before a complete remake/overhaul, would such a versioning pattern be considered acceptable to use? Or would it just create needless confusion and chaos? I understand this might be somewhat opinion related, but I was hoping for some kind of a general consensus on whether this is an acceptable or terrible idea.
