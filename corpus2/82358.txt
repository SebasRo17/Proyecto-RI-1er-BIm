I'm in the process of writing a mail server stack and it's a fairly critical design decision as to whether a unique message can appear in more than one message box. Simple cases are easy to make a decision on (e.g. a message obviously cannot exist in the "Inbox" and the "Trash" mailbox) but a more subtle situation like being in the "Work" mailbox and the "Trash" mailbox is a little trickier. So:   * Is it easier to assume clients won't notice if a unique message appears in more than one mailbox, and throw a hissy fit.   * Or use tagging and only have the message exist in the major mailboxes and use tagging to identify other attributes. In clients that don't support tags (quite a lot), fake the message's uniqueness (not difficult on server end) and display the tags as if they we're their own mailbox    * Or is it cardinal sin to have a message in multiple mailboxes in the first place.  I'm specifically looking for the broadest possible client friendly solution as I'm making a client independent server. Unique message = Unique Identifier on the server (alpha numeric usually), all other headers and body components could by freak coincidence, or by hitting send twice in quick succession be duplicated. If I was to fake the Identifier it would only be to face the client, it would be linked back to the original again on the server for any edits. **Edited for clarity**
