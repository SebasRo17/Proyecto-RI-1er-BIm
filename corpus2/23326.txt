I have a lot of points that I would like to get shown on a plot. The problem is that sometimes I only have 2 points while other times i have 10 points. I've tried to make a for loop to create a plot with the points but without any luck. This is my code I have for now:               Point1 = {x -> 2, y -> 4};     point1dot =        ListPlot[{{Point1[[1, 2]], Point1[[2, 2]]}},         PlotStyle -> {AbsolutePointSize[5]}];     Label1 = Graphics[        Text[StyleForm["Point 1", FontSize -> 9], {Point1[[1, 2]] + 0.25,           Point1[[2, 2]] + 0.25}]];     Show[point1dot, Label1]      In this example there is only one point, but sometimes it will look like this:               Point1= {x -> 2, y-> 4};     Point2= {x -> 4, y-> -1};     Point3= {x -> 6, y-> 2};     Point4= {x -> 11, y-> 4};     Point5= {x -> 4, y-> 5};     Point6= {x -> 3, y-> -1};      It will become a great shortcut for my work if it could generate it itself instead of editing it manually all the time. So here is my question: Is it possible to make some sort of for loop (it doesn't have to be for), that takes value from my points and create a listplot with the label based on the amount of different numbers?
