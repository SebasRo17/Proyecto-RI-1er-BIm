I have been a Rails developer for a year now, and I really want to start diving in to Ruby and pure programming without using a framework. However I am having trouble conceptualizing little programs I can build on my own. I guess it's because I'm so used to having a GUI (the web browser) to interact with the classes that I write that I don't really get how I would interact with classes without clicking, going to different pages, etc. In terms of pure Ruby (without Rails), I've only built a blackjack game you play through the console through typing Y/N for hitting and staying. I would like to know what types of interfaces you guys use for your small programs? Are they all just ran once from your console using something like `ruby myclass.rb`? I have the motivation but I don't know what I would do after writing a few classes. All I do is have a separate file that requires all my other classes, instantiate my classes like so:               myclass = MyClass.new     myclass.part = ClassPart.new(1,2,3)     myclass.do_something # puts "value of instance_variable = #{@instance_variable}"      And then what? The program finishes. It's not interactive. It doesn't do much. I don't see myself building anything cool/powerful like that. Can anyone enlighten me?
