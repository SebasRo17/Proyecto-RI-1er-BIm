How do I acheive something like `InterpolationOrder` in `ListContourPlot` for `ContourPlot`? My main problem is I want to smooth the contours in `ContourPlot`. I have some points which I'm going to call data, which is 10,000 points and looks like this:               {{24.3,40.0},{29.2,56.0} ... }      I create this distance function:               D[x_,y_]=(#[[1]]-x)^2+(#[[2]]-y)^2&/@data      Now, my function is supposed to count the number of points within a certain distance of any x,y position and divide by the total number of points:               F[x_,y_,r_]:=Length[Select[D[x,y],(#<r^2)&]]/Length[data]      Now I can plot my function,               ContourPlot[F[x,y,5],{x,0,100},{y,0,100}]      The problem is my function is not naturally smooth. I know about `SmoothDensityHistogram` and `DensityHistogram`, but I like the more simple look of smoothed contours. Can anyone help with this?
