How should I go about evaluating the performance or execution time of C++ with CLR versus native C++? My personal bias is that I believe C++ with CLR to be slower since it has to run on a virtual machine. I will also admit that I have never really been a fan of Visual C++ due to the syntax that has been added, so I wanted to know how to evaluate the performance of the two approaches and determine which is provably faster instead of relying only on my biases.
