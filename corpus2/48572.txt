I have an 3D Graphic generated with Mathematica's Graphics3D, and want to use it later in SolidWorks. SolidWorks files are usually *.stp, *.step, *.stl extentions. google search hasn't given me a solution yet, and I didn't find anything on this page either. Are there solutions to that? What is the best way to do this? Or do you know any workarounds? **edit:** Just for info - my 3D Graphics (from here) is:               Graphics3D[{GraphicsComplex[        Join[{Cos[#], Sin[#], 0} & /@ Range[0, Pi, Pi/(25)], {{0, 0, 1}}],         {         {#, Rotate[Rotate[#, 180 °, {0, 0, 1}], 90 °, {0, 1, 0}]} &[              GeometricTransformation[Polygon[{##, 27} & @@@ Partition[Range[26], 2, 1]],                                        {IdentityMatrix[3], ScalingTransform[{1, 1, -1}]}]          ]         }]}]      **edit2:** Thanks to Simon Woods' wonderful answere, I was able to export to Solid Works, and print it with my 3D-printer. Here are real-world results: ![100-sided Sphericon 1](http://i.imgur.com/7WWJLLZ.jpg) ![100-sided Sphericon 2](http://i.imgur.com/9hwv3qV.jpg) Thanks alot again :)
