I am numerically solving an integral equation that contains a double integral. I have managed to get a solution but it takes forever. I am wondering if there is a way to speed up numerical integration of multidimensional integrals. Here is the code: First a couple of functions that enter the calculation (if I don't include them, the integration will be faster)               g = Pi          cs[x_] := 2*ArcCos[x]/Sqrt[1 - x^2];          csh[x_] := 2*ArcCosh[x]/Sqrt[x^2 - 1];          pref[t_, v_, d_] :=        1/d^2*(1 + 10^(2*(v - t)) (1 - 1/d^2)) /          Sqrt[1 - 1/4*((10^(2*t) + 10^(2*v))/10^(t + v) - 10^(v - t)/d^2)^2]          piece[d_,v_] :=        If[d Astart[v] < 1, cs[d Astart[v]], If[d Astart[v] > 1, csh[d Astart[v]], 2]]      Here is the actual iteration               Clear[Astart, A, precision, values]          precision = 10^-1;          Astart[t_] = -g*t + 1;          values = ParallelTable[{t,        1 + g/(Pi^3*2)         (NIntegrate[Log[10]*10^(v - t)*pref[t, v, d]*((d^2*Astart[v] - 1)*(Pi - g*piece[d,v]) +              d*Astart[v]*g^2*csh[g])/(d^2*Astart[v]+ g^2 - 1),           {v, -Infinity, 0},           {d, 1/(10^(t - v) + 1), 1/Abs[10^(t - v) - 1]},           WorkingPrecision -> 12,           PrecisionGoal -> 3,           MaxRecursion -> 20,           AccuracyGoal -> 12,           Method -> {"SymbolicPreprocessing",  "OscillatorySelection"-> False, "SymbolicProcessing"->0}         ])},       {t, Union[Range[-5.6,-1.6, 0.5]~Join~Log10[Range[0.08, 0.98, 0.1]]]}];           A[t_] = Interpolation[Re@values, t, InterpolationOrder -> 2, Method-> "Spline"]      Perhaps I should also mention that this later on iterated into a while loop until convergence is achieved (just to give a better picture on the amount of total waiting time...) EDIT: I have added in the code also the method the 'fastest' method that I could find, however it still runs for ages... Given the particular form of the integration limits, is there any better trick to help mathematica? Also, by inspection I can see that the result explodes logarithmically which might be another reason why it is so slow.
