My problem has two parts. Before that I have two Lists/Sets. It suppose to be created them by two initial strings. In the first part, I need to show sets' elements in venn diagram. I can create venn diagram with following code but it is not enough for my purpose. Also, I don't want to use internet.               WolframAlpha["(A \[Intersection] B)", {{"VennDiagram", 1}, "Content"}]      I don't need coloring though. On the other hand, A and B are two different sets. I need to show their elements in appropriate places. Here is an example image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jMjHt.png) Second part, I should show this two sets ordered in column representation. If there are matching elements, arrows should point from appropriate element of A to appropriate element of B.
