For completely random reasons*, I wrote some code that calculates and displays the following expression: > P=1*(2+2) _(3+3+3)_ (4+4+4+4) _.._ (n+n...â€¦ Which is equivalent to `(n!)^2` The version I wrote (listed below the line) isn't terribly efficient; especially not in how it calculates the inner product. **How should I go about simplifying the algorithm so it will operate faster and be more easily understood?** And yes, I know I should use something other than `int` for the variables. That aspect of my code isn't as interesting as re-working the algorithmic approach. * In the spirit of full disclosure this off-topic question sparked my working on the code  * * *               int sequence(int n)     {       int i, accum, prod, j;            accum = 1;       for (i = 2 .. n)       {         prod = i;         for (j = 1 .. i-1)         {           prod += i;         }         accum *= prod;       }       return accum;     }
