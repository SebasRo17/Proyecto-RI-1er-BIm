I am trying to create an interface with an external server, and don't know where to start. I would need to take audio as input to my computer, and send it to the remote server as a chunked HTTP request. The API that I'm trying to connect to is described here p1-5 http://dragonmobile.nuancemobiledeveloper.com/public/Help/HttpInterface/HTTP_Services_for_NDEV_v1.2_Silver_Version.pdf I have never worked with audio programmatically, so don't know what would be the most straightforward way to go about this? Are there solutions that exist out there that already do this? I've come across references to Shoutcast, VLC, Icecast, FFMPeg, Darkice, but I don't know if those are appropriate for what I'm trying to accomplish or not.
