I have this plot:               Plot[{0 x, -x, x, -Sqrt[2 - x^2], Sqrt[2 - x^2]}, {x, -3, 3},       PlotStyle -> {Purple}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TNLuJ.gif) Now I want to do the following. I want to plot the points: $(-1,0),(1,0),(0,0),(x,0),(1, \pm 1),(1,\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}),(0, \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt 3}),(0, \pm \sqrt 2)$ in this graphic. I'm able to plot points using `Graphics[Point[{x, y}]`but I would like to plot those point in the same graphic. This is probably really easy, but I can't find it in the documentation.
