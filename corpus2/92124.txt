I often hear people say they "sanitize input," which would mean make it clean. I understand this to mean "clean of potentially damaging contents," where the function that does the sanitizing would do something like character escaping. But then I hear things like "sane input," which to me, means the input isn't a string where a double was expected, or "January Third of Nineteen Ninety Five" where "1995/01/03" would have been correct. This represents a matter of formatting. Then we have "sanity functions," which handle user input to make it usable by the backend of the software. Can this refer to both types of input validation? Does it only deal with the formatting (like "sane input"), or with cleanliness of the input (like "sanitized input")? Are they two different classes of operations, or does sanity in this case just refer to both? I always thought it referred to sanitizing it (if that actually means something different than making it sane) since I thought "sanity" was a root for "sanitize." But I just looked it up and can't find any definition of "sanity" that has anything to do with cleanliness or sanitization. Is there idioms for each of these operations that I don't know about, or is it always just "sanity functions" which do both of these things? Would it be confusing to see "sanity" and "safety" functions?
