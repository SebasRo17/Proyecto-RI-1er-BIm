DateString[{2014, 5, 7, 13, 47, 44.760},        {"Year", "-", "Month", "-", "Day", " ", "Hour", ":", "Minute", ":", "Second", ".",        "Millisecond"}]      Returns 2014-05-07 13:47:44.759 The 44.760 can be 44.76 or 44.76` with no difference, replacing it with 44760/1000 does return 2014-05-07 13:47:44.760. Presumably this is to do with 44.76 not being exactly represented as a machine precision number and milliseconds just cutting out the last 3 digits rather than rounding to 3 decimal places. Can anyone suggest a simple fix?
