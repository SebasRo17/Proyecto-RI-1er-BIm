I'm working on a webapp which has an existing framework to cache values from the database. I have a requirement which needs multiple values from the database and the values have to be rearranged/restructured so that it's easy for the UI framework to handle them. I'm unable to decide where to put this 'complex re-arranging' logic. Should I do it from the database queries itself? or   Should I create a combined cache i.e read values from other caches, rearrange data, then store the result in a new cache? or   Put the rearranging logic in the UI?
