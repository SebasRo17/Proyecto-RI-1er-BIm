I'd love to use `SparseArray`or `List` to group a set of parameters together in a function.               params[a] = 5;     params[b] = 6;          AFunction[p_] := p[a] * p[b]      If I however want to create a manipulatable entry in the array, it doesn't work:               Manipulate[params[c], {params[c], 0, 50}]     Manipulate::vsform: "Manipulate argument {params[c],0,50} does not have the correct form for a variable specification."      The same thing for a "normal" value works as intended:               Manipulate[c, {c, 0, 50}]      The Mathematica 10.0 documentation states, that Manipulate should be able to interactively transform any expression. I also tried it with `With`, which leads to the same error. Is this straight not possible, or am I doing something wrong. How do you handle big manipulatable parameter sets?
