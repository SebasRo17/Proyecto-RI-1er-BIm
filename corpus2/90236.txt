I'm looking for some ideas on how to improve our current Quality Assurance process. There is no official QA method in place right now, but we basically just get some requirements using a ticket system and we go back and forth until all the requirements are covered. The problem right now is some requirements change and we may spend a day or 5 days on multiple requirements but in the end they all get tossed because the end user decided it's not appropriate or wanted something else. So we lose time and money, but how can we have foreseen these situations? I have to believe there is an effective way to communicate with end users about their set of requirements so that we can EXTRACT and squeeze out any doubts to foreshadow a change in a range of requirements. And then we need to be very sure that the requirements won't be tossed or changed so drastically that our work was a waste. In some ways it is about understanding really really well what the user eventually wants. But what is this effective QA process? Any ideas are greatly appreciated. I'd be happy to clarify any concerns. Thank you!
