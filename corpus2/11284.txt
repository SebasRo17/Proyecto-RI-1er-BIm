In writing my own (noncommutative) product I want to avoid typing redundant symbols like `A.B.C` or `A**B**C`, I just want to type `A B C` and have that mapped to my own `Product[A,B,C]`. (call me a purist) 1\. Is there a clever way to avoid `A B C` being mapped to `Times[A,B,C]` (besides `ClearAll[Times]`)? 2\. Is there any documentation about the inner workings of (Pre-)Parsing and `Times`?
