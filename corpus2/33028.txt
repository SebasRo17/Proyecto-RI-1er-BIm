I have finished designing a little application for Pandora and I am not sure how I can get it out and share it with everyone. What should I do to help advertise it to the public and let other people use it? As of right now it is free, and I hope to keep it that way, so I don't want to spend any money to give it out. I had actually designed this application just for personal use, but hey, why should I be the only one to use it?
