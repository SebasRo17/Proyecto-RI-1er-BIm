My problem is that I have a matrix `A` and the computer says is not Hermitian (self-adjoint). Then I check which elements make `A` be not Hermitian by calculating:               B=A-ConjugateTranspose[A]      In case `A` is Hermitian, this difference should be zero. What I get is that `A` is not Hermitian, but the terms I get in matrix `B` all are smaller than `10^(-15)`. So how can I fix it at the beggining of the code, _Mathematica_ to consider two numbers equal, up to `10^(-10)` precision for example, that is it to consider: > 0.00000000010 = 0.00000000012 or saying it in an alternative way, I want _Mathematica_ to consider the following matrix Hermitian:               C={{0,I*1.1^(-10)},{-I*1.2^(-10),0}}      throughout the whole code.
