Like these does:               Show[Graphics[Rectangle[{2, 1}, {15, 2}]]]     ParametricPlot[{t,t t},{t,0,2}]      how do I create a `Plot[]` with axes having equal variable length pr. pixel? My first idea was               Show[ParametricPlot[{}, {t, 0, 1}], Plot[t, {t, 0, 1}]]      But that messes with the `PlotRange` and possibly more...
