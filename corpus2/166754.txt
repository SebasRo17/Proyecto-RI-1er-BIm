I have an idea for a startup that revolves around a web app. I plan to incorporate a mobile app in the future but, unlike something like instagram, users will be more likely to access with a desktop computer. I am learning Ruby On Rails currently but wonder if, starting in the 4th quarter of 2012, I am focusing on a technology (web development) that is becoming obsolete. Should I dump the idea for something that revolves around mobile technologies and spend my time learning something like iOS development instead?
