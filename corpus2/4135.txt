For some reason Mathematica does not properly simplify this expression:               In[7]:= FullSimplify[ArcTan[-Re[x + z], y], (x | y | z) \[Element] Reals]     Out[7]= ArcTan[-Re[x + z], y]      Obviously, if `x` and `z` are real, then so is `x+z`, so `Re[x + z]` should be replaced by `x + z`. Strangely enough, dropping any small part of the input fixes the problem, here are some examples.   No minus sign:               In[8]:= FullSimplify[ ArcTan[Re[x + z], y], (x | y | z) \[Element] Reals]     Out[8]= ArcTan[x + z, y]      No `z`:               In[9]:= FullSimplify[ArcTan[-Re[x], y], (x | y | z) \[Element] Reals]     Out[9]= ArcTan[-x, y]      No `y`:               In[10]:= FullSimplify[ArcTan[-Re[x + z]], (x | y | z) \[Element] Reals]     Out[10]= -ArcTan[x + z]      Of course I can just drop the `Re` function manually, but this is just a small fragment of the actual expression I'm trying to simplify, and I would like to avoid going though the whole expression looking for this specific pattern.   Anyone knows how to fix this? Is this a bug or what? (I'm using version 8.0.4.0)
