I am storing my wcf endpoint in the registry, and using that whenever my app starts up to instantiate a wcf derived object. The user can change the endpoint location, to another server, and the registry gets updated. I am worried about security... lets say a malicious user updates my registry key that is set, and this will cause the client app to make a connection to who knows where... What are the best practices involved here, for what I am doing?
