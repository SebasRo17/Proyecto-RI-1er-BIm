Assuming a system where there's a Web Application with a resource, and a reference to a remote application with another similar resource, how do you represent a bi-directional sync action which synchronizes the 'local' resource with the 'remote' resource? Example: I have an API that represents a todo list. GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /todos/, etc. That API can reference remote TODO services. GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /todo_services/, etc. I can manipulate todos from the remote service through my API as a proxy via GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /todo_services/abc123/, etc. I want the ability to do a bi-directional sync between a local set of todos and the remote set of TODOS. In a rpc sort of way, one could do POST /todo_services/abc123/sync/ But, in the "verbs are bad" idea, is there a better way to represent this action?
