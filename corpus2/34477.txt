Let's say I have a list like:               {"good element 1", "bad element 1", "good element 2", "good element 3", "bad element 2", ...}      I would like to build a function that will display each element of this list one at a time, and if I press the "left" key it will append the focus element to a list of "good" elements, whereas if I press "right" it will append it to another list of bad elements. Can Mathematica do this and with what kind of functions? I usually come up with a bit of code of my own but this time I really don't know with what functions to start from.
