_Context_ I run long Mathematica sessions; sometimes I have Output up to Out[3000+]. Hence I would like to be able to clear out some previous outputs which do use lots of memory. _Attempt_ I am aware of clearing some outputs via unprotecting `Out` as follows               In[1]:= MemoryInUse[]/10^9.      Out[1]= 0.0179439               In[2]:= a = Table[1, {10^8}];     In[3]:= MemoryInUse[]/10^9.      Out[3]= 0.419424               In[4]:= Unprotect[Out];     In[5]:= Out[2] =.     In[6]:= Protect[Out];     In[7]:= MemoryInUse[]/10^9.      Out[7]= 0.0297147 My problem is if I have 3000+ outputs, which one are using a lot of memory so I can decide if it is safe to clear them. _Question_ What I am after is a way of finding out which amongst the previous `Out` are using most of the memory? I would like to have a function, say `MemoryHog[n]` which would return a list of numbers corresponding to the `n`th sorted Outputs using most memory.
