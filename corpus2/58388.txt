It's been only several years since I migrated from Visual Source Safe to SVN. And SVN for me is still kinda "WOW! I can do so many things! SVN is so cool!" But many people around me keep saying "SVN? Really? Meh..." And there's so many of them that I'm worried. Should I move my team to Git / Mercurial or some other fancy thing? I know I sound ridiculous and the obvious answer would be "stay with what works for YOU". SVN does work for me... But every time I create a new project in my repository I keep asking myself - may be this was the time to move? So... Is SVN really that bad? Do I miss a huge opportunity by sticking with it?
