What are your common gripes about junior developers that join your team or whom you have to work with? Obviously they are inexperienced so you can't expect them to know everything, but what skills are often inexplicably missing -- and how, specifically, can we help them build up these missing skills? I don't mean inter-personal skills like 'listening to advice,' I mean technical matters like (if applicable):   * 'you've never done SQL?'   * 'you've never written a unit test?'   * 'you don't know how to use a Unix command line?' Things which you _do_ expect - I'd like to hear your observations and techniques for teaching new programmers to get past these specific shortcomings.
