After shipping a release, once in two to three months, I get 10 to 15 days of free time. By free time, I mean no work, no one cares what you are doing etc., but you have to come to the office and go. Do you get free time like that? How do you utilize this time? I tend to read, but I feel cramming more and more information is not the best way to spend it.
