My project lead considers both of these approaches to be unnecessary overhead. I have been involved in and have witnessed a lot of talk around XML vs JSON, but this is the first time that I have heard an argument against BOTH. We are using c# in .Net 4. We'll be storing data in a sql server database on the server and also on mobile devices. I've heard all the arguments between the two but now I need to understand the arguments for and against the use of any object notation to store data - my project lead prefers csv format.
