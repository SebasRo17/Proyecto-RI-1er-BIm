The Incremental approach is a method of software development where the model is designed, implemented and tested incrementally (a little more is added each time) until the product is finished. It involves both development and maintenance. The product is defined as finished when it satisfies all of its requirements The Iterative Design is a design methodology based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process. Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made. This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design. In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented. It seems both methods are about creating a part of the system , refining it to pass all the test cases , adding another component of the system and refining it again , these gets repeated untill the system is finished. What is the actual difference between these two ways of designing software How is it possible to combine these two methods to form iterative and incremental design approach
