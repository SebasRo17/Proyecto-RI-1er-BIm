I'm developing an xbox indie game and as a last-resort I have a `try...catch` encompassing everything. At this point if an exception is raised I can get the user to send me a message through the xbox however the limit is 250 characters. **How can I get the most value out of my 250 characters?** I don't want to do any encoding / compressing at least initially.   Any solution to this problem could be compressed if needed as a second step anyway. I'm thinking of doing things like turning this: > at EasyStorage.SaveDevice.VerifyIsReady()   >  at EasyStorage.SaveDevice.Save(String containerName, String fileName) into this (drop the repeated namespace/class and method parameter names): > at EasyStorage.SaveDevice.VerifyIsReady()   >  at ..Save(String, String) Or maybe even just including the inner-most method, then only line numbers up the stack etc. * * * **TL;DR: Given an exception with a stacktrace how would you get the most useful debugging infromation out of 250 characters?** (It will be a .net exception/stacktrace)
