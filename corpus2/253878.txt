What is the best between:               $dispatcher = new Dispatcher($request);     $dispatcher->dispatch();      and               $dispatcher = new Dispatcher();     $dispatcher->dispatch($request);      or even               Dispatcher::dispatch($request);      Knowing that only one method of this class uses the $request instance. I naturally tend to the last solution because the class have no other states, but by I feel that it may not be the best OOP solution.
