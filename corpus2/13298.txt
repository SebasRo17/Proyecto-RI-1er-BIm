The Ackermann function is an extremely fast growing function. There are some slightly different versions of the function, but the one that I am looking for can be defined as: $$ A_0(x)=x+1 \\\ A_{k+1}(x)=A_k^x(x) $$ where $A_k^i = \underbrace{A_k \circ \dots \circ A_k}_i$. It can be defined in `Mathematica` as,               A[0, 1, x_] := x + 1;     A[k_, 1, x_] := A[k - 1, x, x];     A[k_, i_, x_] := Nest[Function[y, A[k, 1, y]], x, i];      There might be faster implementations (I am looking for it too), but the above one works correctly. I want to demonstrate the function for a number of students and for myself so that it is understood deeply. How can I demonstrate how rapidly the Ackermann's function grows? Note that while computing the function for large numbers take a long time, there are fast lower bound for the function. For instance we know: $$A_0(x) = x + 1$$ $$A_1(x) = A_0^x(x) = 2x$$ $$A_2(x) = A_1^x(x) = x2^x \ge 2^x$$ $$A_3(x) = A_2^x(x) \ge \underbrace{2^{2^{{ ... }^2}}}_x = 2 \uparrow x $$ $$A_4(x) = A_3^x(x) \ge \underbrace{2\uparrow(2\uparrow\dots\uparrow(2\uparrow 2)\dots)}_x=2\uparrow\uparrow x$$
