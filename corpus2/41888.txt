So I've got this line that contains the solution of a partial, non- extraordinary differential equation (because Mathematica doesn't handle extraordinary partial differential equations):               phi6m = NDSolveValue[{D[u[t, x], t, t] -       D[u[t, x], x, x] == -6 u[t, x]^5 + 10.5 u[t, x]^3 - 4.5 u[t, x],    u[0, x] == Tanh[x], Derivative[1, 0][u][0, x] == 0, u[t, -7] == -1,     u[t, 7] == 1}, u, {t, 0, 6}, {x, -7, 7}]      And now I wish to compute the following as a function of time, as well as its derivative with respect to time: $ E(t)=\int_{-7}^{7} dx (\frac{\partial u}{\partial x})^2+(u(t,x)^2-1)^2(u(t,x)^2-0.625)$ where u is the solution given by the aforementionned line of code. But now I wish to take the function, as well as its derivative, and plot it into a graph... what I tried allowed me to take the function at a fixed time value, here t=0.1:               phi62 = phi6m[0.1, x];     energiephi6 = D[phi62, x]^2 + (phi62^2 - 1)^2 (phi62^2 - 0.625);     energietotale = NIntegrate[energiephi6, {x, -7, 7}]      But not to make something plottable as a function of time, much less a derivative of the aforementionned function with respect to time. Is there anything else I can do to resolve the issue?
