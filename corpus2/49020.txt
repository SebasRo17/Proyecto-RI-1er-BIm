I have a set of "functions operators", say A1[u],A2[u],A3[u],and I would like to define a rule such that, for instance,               (x*A1[u1]).(y*A2[u2])      returns               x*y*A1[u1].A2[u2]      I have been trying something like:               operatorset = {A1[u1],A2[u1],A3[u1],A1[u2],A2[u2],A3[u2]};     distri = Dot -> Composition[Distribute, Dot];     rule1 = {Dot[Times[scalar1__, z1_ /; MemberQ[operatorset, z1]],          Times[scalar2__, z2_ /; MemberQ[operatorset, z2]]] ->         scalar1*scalar2 *z1.z2};      It works, however, I will need this kind of product when the operators have other arguments, like A1[u1^2], A2[u3], etc. Is there a way to define an "operatorset" where each operator has arbitrary arguments? Thanks in advance.
