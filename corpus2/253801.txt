I want to pass a pointer to my function and allocate the memory to which this pointer points. I've read in other posts that I should pass a double pointer to this function and I did so, but I keep getting segmentation fault:               #include <iostream>     #include <stdlib.h>          using namespace std;          void allocate(unsigned char** t)     {         *t=(unsigned char*)malloc(3*sizeof(unsigned char));         if(*t == NULL)             cout<<"Allcoation failed"<<endl;         else             for(int m=0;m<3;m++)                 *(t[m])=0;     }          int main()     {         unsigned char* t;         allocate(&t);          cout<<t[0]<<" "<<t[1]<<endl;         return 0;     }      the result is always this: Segmentation fault (core dumped) I don't think that there's anything missing from this code. What could be wrong?
