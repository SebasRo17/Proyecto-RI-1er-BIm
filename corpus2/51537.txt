I have sorted through the previous questions and couldn't find a specific answer to the following (and thank you in advance): I have fully developed my idea on paper and am looking to move forward with it, create it, and grow it. Since I am non-technical, I am looking to either partner or employ (I would pay for his/her services) for a very talented and well-rounded programmer to help create and develop the project. I am looking for someone that can act as a IT manager/CTO and get the job done while I use my resources to develop and deploy the strategy, deal with the business side of things, raise capital, grow, etc. However, due to my lack of IT knowledge, it is always hard for me to differentiate between a good and bad programmer and therefore only find out if he/she is good or not when it is too late. So my question that I have been asking everyone around me is "How do I assess whether the programmer is good or not if I cannot evaluate them myself?" and "Is there any website that reviews and rates programmers?" I have asked many to refer me to talented programmers but all are either not local (important for me to work side by side with them), happily employed or working on their own startup. I have also asked these programmers to help me find others but none seem to be able to help. Any help would be extremely appreciated. Thank you so much, HelpJ
