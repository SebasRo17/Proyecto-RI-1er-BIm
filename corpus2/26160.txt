I would like to have               a[i_, j_] := Piecewise[{{HoldForm[A], i == j && i < 2},               {HoldForm[A], i == j - 1}, {-HoldForm[A],           i == j && i >= 2},               {0, True}}];      W = Array[a, {2, 2}]     a[i_, j_] := Piecewise[{{HoldForm[Msub], i == j}, {0, True}}];      M = ArrayFlatten[Array[a, {2, 2}]]     TransP[M_] := Map[Transpose[#1] /. Transpose[0] -> 0 & , Transpose[M],             {2}];      G = MatrixForm[ArrayFlatten[{{M, W}, {TransP[W], 0}}]]      such that the Transpose[A] is printed in "Pretty" with a T in superscript in the output? How can I achieve this?
