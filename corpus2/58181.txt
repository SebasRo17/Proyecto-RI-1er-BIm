I have the following notebook:               $Assumptions -> { {c1, c2, λ, μ} > 0, Element[{c1, c2, λ, μ}, Reals], μ > λ}          (* True -> {{c1, c2, λ, μ} > 0, (c1 | c2 | λ | μ) ∈ Reals, μ > λ} *)          f1 := c1 * (λ/(μ - λ)) + μ * c2          df1 = D[f1, μ]          (* c2 - (c1 λ)/(-λ + μ)^2 *)          Solve[df1 == 0, μ]          (* {{μ -> (-Sqrt[c1] Sqrt[λ] + Sqrt[c2] λ)/Sqrt[        c2]}, {μ -> (Sqrt[c1] Sqrt[λ] + Sqrt[c2] λ)/Sqrt[c2]}}*)           D[df1 , μ]           (* (2 c1 λ)/(-λ + μ)^3 *)      The last line is getting the second order condition. Since all terms in the numerator are positive, the numerator is positive. Since $\mu > \lambda$ by assumption, then $(-\lambda + mu)^3$ is also positive for any $\mu$, $\lambda$ combination. Is it possible for _Mathematica_ to use the stated assumptions to tell me that the second order condition is positive, given the set of assumptions?
