Hakim El Hattab's Sphere, consists of only a handful of lines of Javascript, and would probably be even terser if written in Mathematica. How difficult would it be to "transcode" Mathematica to JS? Further, what is necessary to write the Mathematica code on a desktop and program it to negotiate with ssh or sftp to actually upload the scripts to a web server? Sorry if being a bit vague here, just getting into the web services aspect.
