I'm looking for a way to create a variable that I can use to hold all of the graphics directives for, say, a plot command. For example, I have 8 plots with variations on the following:               Plot[{Im[eppar[400*10^12, t, 0.1]],           Im[eppar[400*10^12, t, 0.2]],            Im[eppar[400*10^12, t, 0.5]],            Im[eppar[400*10^12, t, 0.8]]          }, {t, tlow, thigh}, (**directives**)]      There's a fairly long list of directives I'm using for the plots, and I'd like to avoid having to modify 8 long, complicated expressions every time I want to change anything. Does anybody know of a solution to this? It would make my code much cleaner.
