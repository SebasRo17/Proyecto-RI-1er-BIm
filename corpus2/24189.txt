I recently noted that there is an option in the options inspector to set a merge interval for cell changes. This (I think) prevents a quick series of changes from spamming your notebook history with a bunch of times that can bloat the file size and make the history hard to inerpret. That's great moving forward, but my old heavily used notebooks already have a ton of these closely spaced change times. Is there some easy way to retroactively apply the merge interval to the notebook history? The only thing I came up with was to `grep` out the times (in `python` maybe?) and compare them, making appropriate deletions as the file is parsed. I kind of worry that letting a script tinker with the raw notebook text risks breaking things, which would be bad, since these are my most heavily used notebooks.
