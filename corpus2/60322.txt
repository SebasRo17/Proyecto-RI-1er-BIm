I'm in the job market and I have a set of priorities for my next job including salary, line of business, etc. One thing that is nowhere on my list of requirements however, is the development process methodology. I feel my job is to create software and I view the process structure as something I can adapt to whether it's scrum or waterfall or whatever. Is the development process methodology a priority for you?
