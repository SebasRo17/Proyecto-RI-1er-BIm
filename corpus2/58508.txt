I'm sorry if the question is too obvious, but I haven't been able to find a straight answer for Mathematica. I have 1 set of "x" with at least 3 sets of "y" in different scales. I need to plot them together but I cannot find a way to offset the third "y" axis so that it is "out" of the main frame. Producing plots separately and putting them together with `ImagePadding` works wonderfully for 2 sets of "y" data, but I cannot find a similar solution for 3 sets which require different scales. This is what I have: ![what_i_have](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jI4Im.png) This is more or less what I need: ![what_i_need](http://i.stack.imgur.com/u2SYi.png) Is there a way that I can shift one of the axis to the right so that they do not overlay? Thank you **Edit** After the answer provided by @bobthechemist, I modified his code to adapt it to the lists I usually work it rather than symbolic functions. The resulting plot is the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4mWKM.png)
