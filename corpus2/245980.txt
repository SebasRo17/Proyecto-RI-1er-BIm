I'm working on an Android social app which connects to a Postgresql database for up-to-date user data and is going to use lookups for dropdown menus, and these lookups will either have multiple options (e.g. for eye color, the menu would show 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'hazel', 'red', 'white') or boolean options (e.g. for smoking, the menu would show 'non-smoker' or 'smoker'). Should I store these within the app? They're not really high sensitivity/confidentiality. I was originally thinking I would store them in the Postgresql database but in hindsight that seems overkill and would possibly start to affect performance and cause unnecessary hit on the database server. What would be the best way to store these within the app/on the device? For arguments sake, I'm using the current latest Android version (4.4.4, though obviously not only targeting that one).
