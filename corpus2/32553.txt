I would like to create a presentation for my lecture in which I would use Mathematica CDF files. Let's say I want to have such interactive content:               Manipulate[Plot[Sin[x (1 + a x)], {x, 0, 6}], {a, 0, 2}]      How can I place it in Word, Powerpoint or in Adobe PDF (I can use Adobe Acrobat) so it is usable. Usable - means not showed as an icon. Thanks in advance and Regards Misery
