I'm new Node.js development and I have a question about best practices when writing `package.json` files. From my understanding, you have to list all devependences that you need to execute your app under `"dependencies"` in the `package.json` file. All your extra dependences that are required to run your test (or your build process) have to be listed in `"devDependencies"`. But what about tools that you additionally use, but which are not necessarily required by every developer. Take the `node-inspector` package as an example, which I installed globally on my machine but did not add to the `package.json` file. Is that a good practice, or would you recommend to also file those packages as `"devDependencies"`?
