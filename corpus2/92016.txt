I'm working on my first game; a tower defense. So far It's coming along nicely. The only issue I am having (so far) is I can't figure out a way to effciently discover if an entity has entered a towers line of sight. So far I have considered just having every entity run though each known entity and calculate LOS, but that would bog down extremely quick. Then I thought of just having a bounding box for each tower and one each game step see if anything is in the bounding box. I have the same performance issue with that. Can anyone put forth some advice to put me on the correct track?
