I don't understand why the `switch` or equivalent is so popular in languages. To me, it seems like it had a place back in the days when the alternative was lots of nested `if` statements in the `else` part of other `if` statements. Now that we have `else if`, why do we need it? If we take the following:               switch (expr) {       case "Oranges":         document.write("Oranges are $0.59 a pound.<br>");         break;       case "Apples":         document.write("Apples are $0.32 a pound.<br>");         break;       case "Bananas":         document.write("Bananas are $0.48 a pound.<br>");         break;       default:         document.write("Sorry, we are out of " + expr + ".<br>");     }      It is clearly more readable than below?               if (expr == "Oranges") {         document.write("Oranges are $0.59 a pound.<br>");     } else {         if (expr == "Apples") {             document.write("Apples are $0.32 a pound.<br>");         } else {             if (expr == "Bananas") {                 document.write("Bananas are $0.48 a pound.<br>");             } else {                 document.write("Sorry, we are out of " + expr + ".<br>");             }         }     }      But how is it more readable than:               if (expr == "Oranges") {         document.write("Oranges are $0.59 a pound.<br>");     } else if (expr == "Apples") {         document.write("Apples are $0.32 a pound.<br>");     } else if (expr == "Bananas") {         document.write("Bananas are $0.48 a pound.<br>");     } else {         document.write("Sorry, we are out of " + expr + ".<br>");     }
