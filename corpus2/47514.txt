Ok, so before anything else, I have no idea what I'm doing. Not in mathematica and maybe not in the maths either. My question is basically if I can contour-plot `f=BinomialDistribution[100, p]`, with the distribution f (in colour) along the y-axis, and the chance p for the distribution along the x-axis. I would give some MWE if I got anything to work, but sadly I don't. I did create an image of how I somewhat expect it to look. ![Example of my proposed image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yHq9K.png) So what I can do is explain the rationale. I'm working on grain count samples, which are usually expressed in concentrations (5% Garnet, 10% Zircon, etc.). One usually counts 100 grains, so every grain turns into 1%. This of course introduces a representation error, due to the difference in _actually present_ concentration and _measured_ concentration. As far as I know, the Binomial Distribution like `BinomialDistribution[100, 0.2]` gives you the chance of finding the correct concentration (f=0.1 at 20%) as well as the chances for near integers. The distribution obviously peaks at a low percentage and spreads out greatest along the middle 50%. Thus along the X-axis I have the 'actual concentration', and along the y-axis I have the '(chance of) measured concentration'. given by `BinomialDistribution[100, x/100]` I hope you understand my question :)
