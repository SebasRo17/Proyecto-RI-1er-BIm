When working with a web based restful api what resources would you like to work with from the beginning when developing a system against it?   * Web based documentation?   * Working example? Simple? Complex?   * An SDK which abstracts away some of the details and allows in depth development straight away?   * All of the above? With your answers if web sites of examples are available that would be cool. Appreciate all the help in advance.
