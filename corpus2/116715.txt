I've been a software developer (whether part time or full time) for almost 3 years. I've always been the type of person to have that knack for taking a lead on things, and providing the organization around getting things done. Ever since I was the lead on my senior design project back in college, I felt that this was my true calling, not sitting behind a desk coding. Now, I know I need to understand how to code for other developers to truly respect me. Also, I really do love coding. I work on plenty of side projects at home outside of work, keep up with best coding practices, and try and continuously further my knowledge of the domain. My main question is, what type of things or opportunities should I be looking out for that will help me progress my career to a more managerial role, rather than a coding role. Like I said, I LOVE to code, however I'd love even more to be able to design things at a high level, and organize the team in such a way to get things done, and monitor their progress, while helping out with technical decisions here and there. These types of things truly make me happy, as opposed to just sitting behind a desk coding all day long. Obviously one of my main dreams is producing some sort of software on my own that would eventually blow up and make it big, and then beginning to hire a team and do it all myself, but I feel like the chances of that happening are far worse than just altering my career path a little to get where I want to go. I feel like I can garner that same satisfaction doing it for an employer rather than myself. Even though I haven't felt that way before, I feel like it has been mainly because I'm not doing what I TRULY want to do. Any tips, pointers, or things to keep in mind? Anyone that has done just this, and if so, how did you do it?
