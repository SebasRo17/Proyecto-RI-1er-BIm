I would like to make a plot of a function defined just for integer values, like               f[n_, m_] := 2 - (1/IntegerPart[n]) - (1/IntegerPart[m])      If I try to plot               Plot3D[f[n, m], {n, 1, 6}, {m, 1, 6}, PlotRange -> All,      PlotPoints -> 100, Exclusions -> None,      ColorFunction -> "BlueGreenYellow"]      I need this 100 points to get a "decent" result. This takes a long time, and the result is not very similar as the histogram one. Do you know if there is anyway to do this? Thanks in advance!
