So, the hyperbolic wave equation can be quite easily solved in _Mathematica_ like this:               L = 5;     TMax = 10;     tsunamiEqn = u /. NDSolve[{\!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[PartialD]\), \(t, t\)]\(u[t, x, y]\)\) == \!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[PartialD]\), \(x, x\)]\(u[t, x, y]\)\) + \!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[PartialD]\), \(y, y\)]\(u[t, x, y]\)\),            u[0, x, y] == 0.15 E^-(x^2 + y^2),           \!\(\*SuperscriptBox[\(u\),      TagBox[     RowBox[{"(",      RowBox[{"1", ",", "0", ",", "0"}], ")"}],     Derivative],     MultilineFunction->None]\)[0, x, y] == 0, u[t, -L, y] == u[t, L, y],            u[t, x, -L] == u[t, x, L]},             u, {t, 0, TMax}, {x, -L, L}, {y, -L, L}][[1]];      One can then plot it or `Manipulate` it via the following snippet:               Manipulate[      Plot3D[       tsunamiEqn[fac TMax, x, y], {x, -L, L}, {y, -L, L},       PlotRange -> {{-L, L}, {-L, L}, {-0.1, 0.2}},       Mesh -> 10,       PlotStyle -> {LightBlue, Specularity[White, 50]}       ],      {fac, 0, 0.9}      ]      **Now my question is** : How do I include a structure inside this "pond". I would like to see what happens when the wave interacts with a square block or so. I am drawing a blank right now as to how I would want to include that: A boundary condition? (would seem a little complex) **Here are a few snapshots of this wave travelling:** ![Time=0](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CYK0m.jpg) ![Time=0.2 TMax](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iIt48.jpg) ![Time=0.3 TMax](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mD6wt.jpg)
