Recently the software team in my company decide to use VS2012 (upgrade from VS2008) but we found out that VS2012 does not provide a nice support for Windows XP (e.g. really hard to deploy .Net 3.5 managed C++ project). So we want to convince our manager to drop Windows XP compatible development and and target Windows 7 only. This allows us to use some new technologies such as .Net 4.5 (we are using 3.5 ATM). But we have many existing customers are using Windows XP and they will not able to upgrade to new version of our software (we may still provide bug fixes for XP though). So what are some good reasons to use VS2012 and drop XP compatibility? What in my list currently:   * Able to use .Net 4.5   * Use VS2012 (without compile some project using VS2008 tool chain)   * No need to test on XP machine
