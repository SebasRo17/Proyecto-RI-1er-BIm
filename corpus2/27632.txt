I'm looking at beginning some work on a cloud based application and I'd be interested to hear of anybody's experiences of pitfalls they have run into particularly from a design/architectural standpoint when working with cloud platforms. Are there any expectations that might change significantly from regular web development practice? Things that you wish you had been aware of before you got started or that might have influenced your choice of platform had you been aware of them? I realise there are significant differences between the different options out there, but I feel there are significant enough similarities to warrant asking this as a general question. Any experiences with particular platforms would also good- it would be interesting to see whether others have found similar things happening on other platforms too...
