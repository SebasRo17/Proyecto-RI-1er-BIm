Here is the motivation for my question. I want to plot `Sin[x]` over the interval `0` to `2 π`, with the part from `π/2` to `2 π` as a dashed curve. I want to plot this with a legend so that it shows the solid part is for acute angles, and the dashed part is for, say, other angles. Perhaps using `Show` and `ShowLegend` will work, but I couldn't figure out how to get the legend boxes to match the curves (solid and dashed curves). It seems `PlotLegend` takes care of this for you, but I couldn't figure out how to use this in `Show`. So I thought using `PlotLegend` in `Plot` will be easiest, except I don't know how to use `Plot` for the same function with different options on different intervals. I tried using the suggestions from Plotting piecewise function with distinct colors in each section, but I think my problem is that the same function is being used for both parts of the piecewise function I defined.
