Consider the following:               StringData1={"Dog","Dog","Dog","Dog","Duck","Duck","Duck","Rabbit","House"};     StringData2={"A dog is in the house.","A dog is outside.",         "Why is everybody talking about a dog?", "Dog", "The duck died in the house.",          "The duck is actually a rabbit.", "Duck", "And the rabbit in fact is a dog",          "I have a dog in my house."};      Using the following function, it is quite easy to plot a histogram for `StringData1`. However the options remain fixed.               StringHistogram[list_] :=      Module[{counter, strings, numbers},       counter = {First@#, Length@#} & /@ (GatherBy@list);       strings = First /@ counter;       numbers = Last /@ counter;            BarChart[numbers, ChartLabels -> strings]       ]      In case of `StringData2` I was wondering whether it would be possible to chop up each sentence into single words (e.g.`{Sentence1,...} -> {{Word1, Word2,...},...}`) and then to run `StringHistogram` on `Flatten@StringData2New`, whereas `StringData2New` is of the form `{{Word1, Word2,...},...}`.
