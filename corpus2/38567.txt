**Problem** : In the context of quantum harmonic oscillator the eigenfunctions are given by: $ u_n(x) = (N_n/\sqrt{b}) H_n(x/b) \exp\left[-x^2/(2b^2)\right] $, where $N_n$ is the normalization factor: $ N_n = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi} 2^n n!}\right)^{1/2} $ and $b = \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{m k}\right)^{1/4}$, where $m$ is the mass and $k$ is the spring constant. My book asks me to prove that the following equation holds, where $\varphi_n(k)$ are the eigenfunctions in the momentum space: $ \varphi_n(k) = \sqrt{b} N_n H_n(b k) \exp(-b^2 k^2 / 2), k=p/\hbar $ **Attempted solution** :               ClearAll["Global`*"];     norm[n_] := (1/(Sqrt[π] 2^n n!))^(1/2)          u[n_, x_] := 1/Sqrt[b] norm[n] HermiteH[n, x/b] Exp[-(x^2/(2 b^2))]          φ1[n_, k_] :=      Assuming[       {n ∈ Integers, n > 0, x ∈ Reals, k ∈ Reals, b > 0},       1/Sqrt[2 π] Integrate[u[n,x]Exp[-I k x], {x, -∞, +∞}]]          φ2[n_, k_] :=      Assuming[       {n ∈ Integers, n > 0, b > 0},       Sqrt[b] norm[n] HermiteH[n, b k] Exp[-((b^2 k^2)/2)]]          ParallelTable[         {j, Simplify[φ1[j, k] == φ2[j, k]]},         {j, 1, 8}] // TableForm      And here is the output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/37i18.png) **My question is** : Why does the relation hold only for $4k, k \in Z$ ? If I print $φ1[n,k]$ and $φ2[n,k]$ I see that in $φ1$ there are $(-i)^j$ terms, which is why the equation holds only for multiples of 4. Does anyone have any idea at all on where the error is ? (In my book? In how I do the Fourier transform? Something else I'm missing?)
