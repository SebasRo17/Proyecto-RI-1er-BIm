I want to create an illustration for a **product purchase wizard** , and I want to illustrate the way user interacts with the wizard. It's basically a simple flowchart or a simple workflow:   1. User starts the wizard   2. User selects product   3. User should check the availability of that product (manually)   4. If the product is available, then the next button is enabled, else it's disabled   5. If user change the product type, then the next button should be disabled   6. User goes to the next step   7. Based on the product type, a different UI is shown to him in the next step   8. He should adjust some other settings, ... I started creating a sequence diagram, but soon it proved not to be a good fit. Then I changed to activity diagram, again no success. What type of diagram should I choose to illustrate this flowchart (which is full of conditions, branching, state management, user interaction and more)? Do we have such a general diagram at all? What software should I use? **Update:** To clarify further, I'd like to draw a diagram of a **scenario** rather than a **workflow**.
