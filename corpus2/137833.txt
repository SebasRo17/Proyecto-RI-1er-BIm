I am an engineer but don't have a computer science background. I am proficient with Python, Django, use Mongo and know a bit of C++ / C#. Dabble with NGinx here and there. My weekend project, a nifty webapp, just saw explosive growth. And am looking to expand the team. What should I look for in potential hires beyond the obvious (code samples etc) ? Should I hire someone who wears many hats and bigger pay or break it up into smaller roles?
