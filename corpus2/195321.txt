I am trying to understand this: I wrote a code for points on a circle of radius 1. Note that the first and last point intentionally coincide.               do i=1,imax     X(i,1) = COS(-2*4.0*ATAN(1.0)*(i-1)/(imax-1))     Y(i,1) = SIN(-2*4.0*ATAN(1.0)*(i-1)/(imax-1))     print *, X(i,1)**2 + Y(i,1)**2      end do      The code is supposed to be a circle, but the following figure demonstrates the plot in Mathematica. It looks to me like an ellipse. Am I doing something wrong? Or is this just the way Mathematica plots it? ![http://imgur.com/0XMfZsw](http://i.imgur.com/0XMfZsw.jpg) The command for the plot is               ListPlot[a, PlotLabel -> "MeshPoints", AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"}, PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}]
