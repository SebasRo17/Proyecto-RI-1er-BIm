I want to hear from you any advice and experience of writing comments in your code. How do you write them in the most easy and informative way? What habits do you have when commenting parts of code? Maybe some exotic recommendations? I hope this question will collect the most interesting advices and recommendations forcommenting, something useful that everyone can learn from. OK, I will start.   1. Usually, I don't use `/* */` comments even when I need to comment many lines. **Advantages** : code visually looks better than when you mix such syntax with one-line comments. Most of IDEs have an ability to comment selected text and they usually do it with one-line syntax. **Disadvantages** : Hard to edit such code without IDE.   2. Place "dot" in the end of any finished comment. For example:              //Recognize wallpaper style. Here I wanted to add additional details     int style = int.Parse(styleValue);     //Apply style to image.     Apply(style);      **Advantages** : Place "dot" only in comments that you finished. Sometimes you can write temporal information, so lack of "dot" will tell you that you wanted to return and add some additional text to this comment.   3. Align text in the enumerations, commenting parameters etc. For example:              public enum WallpaperStyle     {         Fill = 100,     //WallpaperStyle = "10"; TileWallpaper = "0".         SizeToFit = 60, //WallpaperStyle = "6";  TileWallpaper = "0".         Stretch = 20,   //WallpaperStyle = "2";  TileWallpaper = "0".         Tile = 1,       //WallpaperStyle = "0";  TileWallpaper = "1".         Center = 0      //WallpaperStyle = "0";  TileWallpaper = "0".     };      **Advantages** : Just looks better and visually more easy to find what you need. **Disadvantages** : Spending time to align and harder to edit.   4. Write text in comment that you can't obtain by analyzing code. For example, stupid comment:              //Apply style.     Apply(style);      **Advantages** : You will have clear and small code with only useful information in comments.
