I've been confused for a while about the differences between the patterns Factory Method and Abstract Factory. Been doing a lot of research, still confused. I have one question: Is the **only difference** between the two patterns, is that Factory Method **produces one object** , and Abstract Factory produces a **family of objects**? Or are there more differences? I read a lot on this site and the web about this, only confused me more. I know how to use the patterns, but am having trouble differentiating between the two.
