I am trying to fit a non-standard PDF to data and `FindDistributionParameters` works great, and gives me the parameters of the distribution back using maximum likelihood, but I cannot find a way to get Mathematica to spit out the standard errors (or confidence intervals) for those estimated parameters. Anyone knows how to do it, or should I just go to a different program, i.e. MATLAB?
