No question too stupid right :) Came across this on wikipedia > The Java Persistence API replaces the persistence solution of EJB 2.0 CMP > (Container Managed Persistence). My understanding was the CMP is still there i.e Pooling,Transactions etc can be done via CMP where as JPA is ORM for me. I did not think there are even same thing . I thought may be CMP VS JTA might make sense but obviously not.   I know how off track I am but thats why I am here may some can help me get things in perspective.
