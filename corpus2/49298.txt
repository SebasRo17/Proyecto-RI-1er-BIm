I hope that I am asking the right question at right place. If not, please do not hesitate to point me to the right place. I am working in a laboratory, where computers/programming/programmers are all used only as support. But I believe that we need better information organization and management. Given the diverse information generated in the lab I believe that we need some sort of Laboratory Information Management System. Is there a good starting point to do this? I am myself not a trained programmer. I can code reasonably well in `python` and `R`, and if necessary I can learn `MySql`, `php`.
