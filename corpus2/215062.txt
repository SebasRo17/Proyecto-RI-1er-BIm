I can write code. I can read code but I can't implement good code. How to develop deep understanding of any framework or stuff that we are working on? Is it looking into documentation and working on it? I have seen in this form that people that have great understanding of things they are working on. How is this possible? How to not scrape on the surface only? How to manage time vs learning vs productivity?
