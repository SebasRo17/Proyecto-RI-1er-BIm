What are the most common templates, languages, web-design tools that you recommend for me to be able to start web-design? I do software but I have not not had web-design experience, I have been a Win32 developer with VB 6.0, Delphi, C#,etc.., not web-based. The type of web-design I have in mind is some simple web-sites, even static web sites, that the owner of some small business like a restaurant wants to have a web-site to show its services ..I know there are some stuff people start with like WordPress, Joomla, PHP CMSes, CSS frameworks,... I am looking for stuff like this that helps speeds up building a nice website...what are the things people mostly use these days? Thanks
