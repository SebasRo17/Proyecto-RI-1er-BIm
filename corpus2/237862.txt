I'm trying to choose a good name for a new open-source project. The problem is, there is already so much software in the world that Google search reveals one or more existing programs with every good name I can think of (and there have been several already). Obviously, names like "Linux" or "Windows" or "Java" or "Excel" are off- limits. But what about names which may have been used by some little-known program? Does it make a difference if the name is trademarked in one or more countries? In one case, I found that there is a commercial software package marketed by a Canadian company, using a name which I wanted to use. The same name is trademarked in the US, but by a different company. I couldn't find any evidence that the holder of the trademark is actually marketing software under that name. In Canada, the name is not trademarked. In other cases, I found several programs all using the same name, some commercial, some university-student research projects. So maybe this is normal in the software industry? What if I use a name which is not trademarked, and someone else trademarks it later? Could I face legal pressure to stop using it? Would it help to avoid legal problems if I prefix the name? For example, say I want to call my project "Broomflip", but other software is already being marketed under that name. If, assuming I am associated with an organization called "Hoplock", I call it "Hoplock Broomflip", would that be better? I'm hoping someone with a good understanding of IP law can shed some light on some or all of the above questions. Of course, personal opinions from those without special legal knowledge are also welcome, but please try to back them up with evidence or relevant references. Anecdotal evidence is welcome.
