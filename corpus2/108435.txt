> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Thoughts on Development using Virtual Machines My boss has been singing the praises of leveraging virtualized desktops for all our developers in the company - about 100 people. I think this is a horrible idea and can think of no other companies pursuing a similar course of action. He believes that he can run Word and Outlook much faster over his server hosted virtual machine and has somehow come to believe that this will work for software development just as well. I have grave doubts of this. **Can anyone else provide me with some objective technical and/or business data on this scenario which can be used to dissuade him?** I can see desktop virtualization as a viable option for task based workers who sit in front of MS Office or a LOB app all day, but for software development, I see this as a huge potential blunder. I for one, have no interest in returning to dumb terminals and blind faith in operations to keep the servers and network tuned to our needs. If such a system is instituted, I may very well leave the company... as I see the policy betraying a clear lack of understanding and a diminished perception of value in what the devs are doing...
