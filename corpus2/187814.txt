We apply Scrum/Agile and we have two teams. The other team has a conflict of interest (or rather personalities) between two developers. I would like to help resolve this and would like to know how to deal with it should it ever happen in my team. I am not a team lead as we use a flat structure. The conflict mostly comes to light during the daily stand-ups and during the end-sprint retrospectives. So far there has been no open bursts of shouting or even "violence" but at the current rate i would guess either of those may be inevitable. The conflicts are on areas of code or standards or ways of dealing with Scrum in the project. Neither team member is actually more wrong or sight than the other, so choosing a side is impossible. The effect of this underlining conflict is a negative impact of team morale and the newbies not feeling safe enough to give opinions or start taking charge of their tasks through fear of being involved in this or similar situations with the seniors. Thus from a Scrum/Agile perspective how would / could one go about getting the developers to set their differences aside and work as a whole team again?
