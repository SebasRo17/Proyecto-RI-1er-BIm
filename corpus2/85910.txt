I do a lot of Java programming at my work (I'm an intern) and I was wondering if it is generally a rule to create javadoc to accompany my code. I usually document every method and class anyways, but I find it hard to adhere to Javadoc's syntax (writing down the variables and the output so that the parser can generate html). I've looked at a lot of C programming and even C++ and I like the way they are commented. Is it wrong not to supply javadoc with my code?
