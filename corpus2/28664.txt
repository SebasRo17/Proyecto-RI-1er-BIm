This should be an easy question but since few examples are given for `ShowLegend` and I am a new user, I got stuck after many attempts. I plot three graphs which are seperately defined as `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. In each graphs there are one or two curves (Original codes to yield the graphs are complicated and not important). Then I present them in one graph, coding               graph1 = Show[t1, t2, t3, PlotRange->All]      Now I would like to add texts for identification for each curve in the graph1, in a form like                 --- x=2       ___ x=3       ''' x=4      Since the graph1 has already been plotted, `PlotLegend` may not work. I used `ShowLegend` but don't know how to establish the codes. Many thanks in advance.
