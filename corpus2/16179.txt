Since I'm working at least 50% on Linux which is probably the operating system which gets not so much attention from Wolfram, I find _new_ bugs regularly. What bothers me the most is, that tracking a bug down and writing a good bug report takes time but I can never be sure, someone else already reported the same issue which would render my action useless. Especially in Version 9.0.0 the community found some serious issues. Mostly they were propagated through our chat, but neither I can be online all the time nor other users. **Question:** Is there any issue tracker where one can look up open issues of Mathematica? If not, might it be possible to maintain our own tracker, where everyone can insert _confirmed_ bugs? This MathGroup message suggests, that `bugs.wolfram.com` is some webinterface to the bugtracker. Unfortunately the site is down. Let's assume, we set up our own buglist, everyone could insert not only the bug itself, but the information from the support response too. This would be extremely helpful.
