Piggybacking on this, I am somehow not fully convinced that I can't save data generated by a calculation in a mathematica file so that when I re-launch said file, I wouldn't have to run my calculations again. I ask because I use `NDSolve` for 4th order non linear PDEs and sometimes I need to run it for really large times (in excess of a few hours, yes that sounds crazy but I am just trying to get results for a fluid dynamics problem here and I am not all that interested in being a computer scientist to reduce run times). So after reading the linked article, I did this for an example problem:               sol = NDSolve[{D[u[t, x], t] == D[u[t, x], x, x], u[0, x] == 0,         u[t, 0] == Sin[t], u[t, 5] == 0}, u, {t, 0, 10}, {x, 0, 5}]          DumpSave["pde0.mx", sol]      Then I quit mathematica and relaunch it and load `pde0.mx` with `Get`               Get["pde0.mx"]      And when I plot,               Plot3D[Evaluate[u[t, x] /. sol], {t, 0, 10}, {x, 0, 5},       PlotRange -> All]      Voila, I get the plot as if I had run the simulation. So.. did I run the simulation again by invoking `sol` through `Get` or was my kernel state saved?
