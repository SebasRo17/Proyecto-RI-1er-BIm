I'd like to `NotebookWrite` a `Cell` in `StandardForm` with a `Grid` to a new document. What I'd like to copy is               toCopy = TraditionalForm@Grid[{{a^2, b^2, c^2}, {d^2, e^2, f^2}}]      If I now use the following code               NotebookWrite[      CreateDocument[]      , toCopy]      I get a red rectangle in the new Notebookbook. I've tried to change all letters a to f to "a" ... "f", but nothing changed. I am somewhat puzzled... What I missing here? Thanks for all help, as always! Edit: With the answer of Alexey, it works good to copy the `Grid` to the new Notebook. But the TraditionalForm is lost: I get InputForm. Even using               NotebookWrite[      CreateDocument[],       ToBoxes[toCopy, TraditionalForm]]      doesn't seem to work. Any more help, as always, very much appreciated!
