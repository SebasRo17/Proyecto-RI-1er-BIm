Objective-C 2.0 introduced properties. While I personally think properties are nice addition to the language, I have seen a trend of making every instance variable as a property. Apple sample codes are no exceptions to this. I believe this is against the spirit of OOP, and since it exposes a lot more implementation details of a class to the client than they need to know. What guidelines do you suggest for the proper usage properties in Objective C?
