I'm looking for a programming judge system which supports putting contestants programs against each other in "matches". The format could be either for example a tournament style or chess ranking, but this isn't that important. A good example would be Google's AI challenge (http://aichallenge.org/) The only systems I've found so far are "regular" programming judges, i.e. those who can check if a program passes or fails a given problem, like DOMJudge. Do you know of any systems like this?
