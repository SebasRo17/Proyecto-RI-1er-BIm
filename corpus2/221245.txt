This is a basic question. But, I think understanding this would be helpful to play with buffers in 'C'. Thanks. ## Scenario Just a sample snippet               char *test_buff = (char *) malloc(512); //allocate 512 bytes in heap memory.     bzero(test_buff, 512); //Reset buffer instead of Junk/garbage.     /* random code here to fill-in the buffer called "test_buff"...*/     ...     /* Send data to another host/system [this doesn't matter though]      * using buffer "test_buff".      */      sendto(sock_descriptor, test_buff /*buffer to send data*/, sizeof(*test_buff) ,...,...);  // option-1     /* OR */      sendto(sock_descriptor, test_buff /*buffer to send data*/, 512 /* actual malloced size*/ ,...,...); // option-2      ## Question   1. Which one of the two is better [between option-1/option-2] way of using buffer? I hope option-1 makes sense, as it has length/size of valid data bytes of send buffer or "test_buff" in this case. Thanks for your time and input.
