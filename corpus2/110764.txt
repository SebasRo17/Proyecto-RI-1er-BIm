I've mostly used the waterfall methodology on my projects, but now I'm expanding my horizons into agile methodologies. From what I've read so far, and maybe I've read the wrong things, agile means small waterfalls. Instead of a big waterfall spread over one or two years, you have small waterfalls that last weeks or maybe a few months at most. Is my understanding correct or is there more to it than that? What are the agile philosophies?
