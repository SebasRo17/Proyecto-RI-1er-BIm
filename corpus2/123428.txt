Google App Engine has been great for trying out ideas and learning stuff, but so far I haven't seen much confidence in the community in using it for production applications. One significant issue that has come up over and over again is that when things go wrong, it's nearly impossible to actually talk to anyone at Google. This is really scary if your company is depending on this service for the production app. However, their literature on Premier accounts looks promising, with the promise of better levels of support. What has been your experience with using Google App Engine when it comes down to resolving support issues? Does it really take 4 hours to just acknowledge a P1?
