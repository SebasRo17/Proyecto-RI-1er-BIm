I try to plot a 3D Vector plot. All Vectors start at (0,0,0) and point in directions given in spherical coordinates:               While[n < 100,x = RandomReal[];      AppendTo[rs, x]; AppendTo[Thetas, ArcCos[x]]; AppendTo[Psis, 2*Pi*x]; n++]      How do I convert the coordinates (`Thetas`, `Psis`, `rs`) into a List compatible with `ListVectorPlot3D`? Best and thanks for your help! * * * # Edit Thanks for your help. Putting the array into the right shape is exactly my problem. Could you show me how this has to be done? I used:               n = 0;     Origin = {};     Spherical = {};          While[n < 3, x = RandomReal[];      AppendTo[Origin, {0, 0, 0}];      AppendTo[Spherical, {x,ArcCos[x], 2*Pi*x}];     n++]          SphericalT = CoordinateTransform["Spherical" -> "Cartesian", Spherical]          cords = Transpose[{Origin, SphericalT}]      but it doesn't work to plot cords by               ListVectorPlot3D[cords]      the output looks like               ListVectorPlot3D[{{{0, 0, 0}, {0.0435796, 0.204158, 1.31166}}, {{0, 0,      0}, {0.0774815, 0.267354, 1.74896}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {0.466032,      0.498845, 4.28931}}}]      which in my eyes fits               ListVectorPlot3D[{{{x1, y1, z1}, {vx1, vy1, vz1}}, ...}]      proposed in: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ListVectorPlot3D.html
