In a current project we have setup the build so that we could mix Java and Scala. I would like to use more Scala in our code base to make the code more readable and concise. In the process also learn the language by handing over real features. So I plan to use Scala for some classes to showcase its benefits and convince other devs to look into using Scala too. For a rest based web server or a program in general what kind of code structures lend themselves to Scala's functional programming style.
