Imagine a chain of 20 rings, labeled by 1-20 sequentially. We want to make random size sets of numbers randomly chosen from these 1-20 rings. No duplicate numbers are allowed. Example of a set: $\{16,7,11\}$. We want to count the links between the members of different sets. Rules:   1. If we have got one number $N$ in set $A$ and next successive number $N+1$ exists in set $B$ this is called link of length $1$.   2. If the next successive number $N+1$ is not member of any set, we look for the closest successive number $N+m$ existing in other sets, so this is called a link of length $m$.   3. If the next successive number is also in the set $A$, then is a loop, we ignore it.   4. The two ends of the chain, if not member of any set, are dangled, we ignore it. Output = {the number of links of length i}. Example:               clusters = {{2,3,4}, {16,7,11}, {9,20,12,18}}      In `clusters` we have: 1 link of length 1 : `11-12` 3 links of length 2 : `16-17-18, 7-8-9, 9-10-11` 1 link of length 3 : `4-5-6-7` 1 link of length 4: `12-13-14-15-16` and `18-19-20` is a loop to same cluster and `1` is a free end so ignore them. How can I count the links to have:               out1 = {{1,length1}, {3,length2}, {1,length3}, {1,length4}}      Also we need to know the total number of links between two given cluster. for above example we will have:               out2 = {{cluster1-2, 1links},{cluster2-3, 5links},{cluster1-3,0links}}
