If you have a menu "Admin tasks" and different admin tasks (like 10) that you could separately assign to each user, but there are users who don't have any admin tasks, how would you deal with "Hiding admin menu" for those users? I was thinking of 3 ways: 1) Javascript, check if Admin menu is empty and then hide it. 2) Check for all permissions in Admin menu, with a counter, and show it if counter > 0. And then also re-check the permissions for each item to show. 3) Save all permissions in associative array. Test all and assign ' true' to granted items. When building the menu, have a function that tests if there is at least one permission granted. I wouldn't need to re-check permissions against DB, just against the array for each item. Is there any better way?
