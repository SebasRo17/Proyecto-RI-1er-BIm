As we all know, every software has bugs in it. It is matter of time to discover it. Suppose if you just found your product has potential big issue and it was not developed by you. How would you deal with it? I usually speak up with some data & analysis even if it is not my part of code. I am wondering if it is too offensive because I often faced on some resistance(depending on the issue), which would eventually be gone.
