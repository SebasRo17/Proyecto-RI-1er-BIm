Is there a nice way to define output formatting for my expression, a product from `n = k` to `j` with `n â‰  m`? I would like to use something like this here (however _Mathematica_ doesn't evaluate it): $$\prod _{n=k,n\neq m}^j \frac{\lambda _n}{\lambda _n-\lambda _m}$$ My work around at the moment is: (adopted from Sum or Product with Exclusions) $$\prod _n^{\text{DeleteCases[Range[k, j], m]}} \frac{\lambda _n}{\lambda _n-\lambda _m}$$
