Imagine this set up:               public interface IMass{         double Mass {get;}     }          public static class IMassExtension {         public static double ToKg(this IMass massObject) {             return massObject.Mass / 1000.0;         }              public static double CalculateInteractiveGravity(this IMass massObject, IMass otherMassObject)                   {              return blah;         }     }      Is it ok to put the extension class in the same file as the interface (i.e. IMass.cs) or should it be in a separate file (IMassExtension.cs)? * * * A base class is not possible here. Imagine               public class Person : Animal, IMass {}      and               public class House : Building, IMass {}
