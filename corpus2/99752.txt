In a recent video on Java, Joshua Bloch states at 4 minutes 20 seconds into the video: > And then there's inheritance, and that was a marketing necessity. You know, > we can argue whether you really need implementation inheritance or not. So I wondered: how would Java look like without implementation inheritance? For example, how would `equals`, `hashCode` and `toString` work? Would Java have needed something like mixins instead?
