I am an "old" programmer used to _Fortran_ and _Pascal_. I can't get rid of `For`, `Do` and `While` loops, but I know _Mathematica_ can do things much faster! I am using the following code               SeedRandom[3]     n = 10;     v1 = Range[n];     v2 = RandomReal[250., n];          a = {};     Do[        Do[         AppendTo[a, (v2[[i]] - v2[[j]])/(v1[[i]] - v1[[j]])          ],         {j, i - 1, 1, -1}], {i, n, 2, -1}        ]; // Timing      If `n` is small, it runs fast enough, but for bigger `n` it slows down. I usually deal with `n > 600`. How can the code be made faster?
