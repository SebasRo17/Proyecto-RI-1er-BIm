I have created a notebook with two cells. This is the content of the first:               g = Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 4, 4 \[UndirectedEdge] 5, 4 \[UndirectedEdge] 6}]      And this is the content of the second:               g     listDegree = VertexDegree[g]     vl = VertexList[g]     nodeMaxDegree = Pick[vl, listDegree, Max[VertexDegree[g]]][[1]]     aM = AdjacencyMatrix[g];     vLM = aM[[VertexIndex[g, nodeMaxDegree]]];     nN = Pick[vl, vLM, 0]      If I evaluate the second cell (after processing the first) for a **second** time:   1. the first time no problem, the results are correct;    2. **the second time the vertex list of`g` is inexplicably wrong but the graph remain correct!!** I don't understand the cause because the graph `g` is never touched. Thanks in advance
