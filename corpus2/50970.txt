I took over a rather complicated project as the sole developer/project manager and tester sometime last year. In November last year there was a deadline for some new functionality to be delivered. The system I took over which was supposedly ready to be used was far from being ready. Sitting with one of the our customers users he came up with new features and requirements which was required. Even though the features they asked for was implemented he argued it was nothing like what they specified in the requirements. So I had to get back to the drawing board and do extensive changes to the system. Promise after promise, this is my own fault, I missed subsequent deadline due to different reasons: over-optimistic planning on my behalf, sick kids and various other personal issues. And there have been failings on the customer side too: only testing when I watch over their shoulder and so on. Yesterday we agreed that we go live if their users approve the application. Of course some issues showed up and now today, when I tried to call our customer he hung up and hasn't replied to any of my emails. This is really wearing me out, the hours and time spent on this far exceeds normal working hours and has taken its toll on my family as well Obviously there are things in this situation that are specific to this project, but I don't think the overall pattern (multiple small problems, leading to project breakdown) is uncommon. What would you do in a similar scenario?
