I'm trying to reproduce a textured head in Mathematica, and I'm using a kind of 'net' of a head which contains all the features on the face. The texture looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LmTQl.jpg) which is supposed to look something like this:![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8RuWq.png) Here's the code I'm using.               ListSurfacePlot3D[Import["inputImage.obj", "VertexData"],      PlotStyle -> Texture[texture], Mesh -> None, MaxPlotPoints -> 80,      TextureCoordinateFunction -> ({#1, -#2, #3} &)]      which gives me![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PCxHA.jpg) Another problem is that the texture is reflected about the origin (ie the face is plastered on the back of the head as well). It should instead be black on the back of the head mesh. I suppose this is suppose to do with the head being centered at the origin. I also need to have the texture to 'follow' the head when I change the coordinates of the mesh later on. I have attempted using               Graphics3D[      {EdgeForm[],       Texture[texture],       GraphicsComplex[mesh,        Polygon[polygon, VertexTextureCoordinates -> mesh]]}]      but it gives me this instead ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lpK2R.jpg) I need to be able to reproduce this in Mathematica as I have some coordinate transformations which I need to apply, and thereafter, 'wrap' the mesh with the texture. Are these possible?

My guess was that these are texture coordinates (where u is horizontal and v is vertical) as per the links provided by Rahul Narain. I attempted to create a list of coordinates from these two list in the following manner               texturecoord = {Import["inputImage.ply", "UserExtensions"][[2]][[2]],         Import["inputImage.ply", "UserExtensions"][[3]][[2]]} // Transpose      Then, I tried doing               Graphics3D[      {EdgeForm[],       Texture[texture],       GraphicsComplex[mesh,        Polygon[polygon, VertexTextureCoordinates -> mesh]]}]      But that gives me this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D20xM.jpg)
