From a very young age, I've always wanted to be a programmer. Being a part of a game is my dream. So here is my questions: 1) I'll be going to university next year, and I'm planning on going to Wien for education. Is computer science to best way to get what I want, or is there another way to learn programming in university? 2) Becasue of all the sutdying for the university exams I can't learn any programming languages right now. Will it be hard for me to learn the languages from scratch? If so, how difficult will it be? Thanks in advance!
