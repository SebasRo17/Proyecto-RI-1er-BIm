It's a common issue to see a company's sales team promise new features in order to close a sale. Many times these new features are still in development or are still being designed. Sometimes features are sold before the development team even knows about them. If the customer understands the features are not yet implemented this can help guide the product's design. However, if the sales team promises these features with an uninformed time frame it can put significant amounts of stress on the developers who are charged by management to meet the deadlines. Additionally, sometimes non-existent features are sold to customers as being either completed or near completion when development may not even be aware of the requirements yet (legal/ethical issues notwithstanding). **Is there a word or phrase that can be used to describe the uninformed/irresponsible/unethical applications of this practice?** It's similar to feature creep, but occurs before development or design.
