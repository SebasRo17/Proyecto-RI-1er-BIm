I'm trying to store a directory structure, including files and their content, in MongoDB. The work is part of a synching app, and is using in Node/Mongoose. Now, I'm new to Mongo, and it's late here - is the idiomatic implementation as easy as it looks - ie, something like this?               var FileStoreSchema = new Schema({       fullPath: {         type: String,         index: { unique: true }       },       filename: String,       [Metadata and other useful fields]       });
