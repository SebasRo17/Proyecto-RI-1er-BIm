I received an offer at two companies for a spring co-op. They are both software engineering related. The first company(C1) offered me 22/hr. Is $22/hr + housing stipend a reasonable offer? The area is cheap to live in, which leads me to believe that 22/hr is a good offer. Would it be possible/reasonable to negotiate this? I still have not received the offer details from the other company(C2), but they said they are currently preparing the letter. C2 is in Boston, which will obviously be more expensive. C2 pays for housing entirely. My main problem is deciding between the two. Both are apparently good places to work, so the main issue comes down to pay. Everything else put aside, what salary/hourly rate should C2 offer to top C1?
