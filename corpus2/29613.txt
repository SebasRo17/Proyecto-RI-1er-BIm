I have one table which contains time periods (`"start"` and `"end"`) and a `"type"` for every period:               table1 = {{"start", "end", "type"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 8, 5, 0.`}, {2013, 8, 10, 10, 6, 0.`}, "a"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 10, 6, 0.`}, {2013, 8, 10, 10, 50, 0.`}, "b"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 10, 50, 0.`}, {2013, 8, 10, 12, 10, 10.`}, "c"}}       Now, I have a second table which contains dates:               table2 = {"date",                {2013, 8, 10, 11, 5, 0.`},                {2013, 8, 10, 10, 15, 0.`},                {2013, 8, 10, 10, 35, 0.`},               {2013, 8, 10, 11, 10, 0.`},                {2013, 8, 10, 12, 5, 0.`}}       What I want to do now, is to test whether a date is within one of the periods and if yes in which period. The result should be a table which shows in which period the date is. For my small example, the table should look like this:               result = {{"date", "coresp. type"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 11, 5, 0.`}, "c"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 10, 15, 0.`}, "b"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 8, 5, 0.`}, "a"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 11, 10, 0.`}, "c"},                {{2013, 8, 10, 12, 5, 0.`}, "c"},                {{2013, 9, 10, 10, 10, 0.`}, "none"}}      Is there an way to create the result table automatically?
