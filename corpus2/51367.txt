I understand that _Mathematica_ has a bug when exporting images. The ticks are scaled not correctly when exporting at high resolution. For example: when you do:               Export["xx.png", plot, ImageResolution -> 360];      The image looks good, but all the frame ticks are all gone. When you do               Export["xx.png", plot, ImageResolution -> 100];      The ticks are there, but the resolution of the image is not good enough. I tried the trick of using `ImportString` and `ExportString`:               ImportString[ExportString[plot, "PDF"]      It works, but creates another problem: the `PlotRangeClipping` option is missing, and the figure has plot lines sticking out all the way to the boundary of the image, not the boundary of the axes. Can someone provide an easy and relatively universal workaround?
