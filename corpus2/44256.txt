I read ReplaceOrRemoveInvalidOrMissingData _Mathematica_ documentation, and I tried to apply the same approach to my dataset. I've got two problems, but one is only a style problem!   1. There is one more elegant way to select numeric data in a large dataset? I mean that I've got a dataset o 29 possible numeric value and 2 columns that are not numerical. So I tried this way.               baddata[entry_] :=  Not[MatchQ[ entry,        {_?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ,        _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ,         _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ,        _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ, _?NumberQ,        _?NumberQ, __}]]          DeleteCases[data, _?baddata];      It works, but it is not so elegant! 2 . I would accept some non numerical (e.g. blank values) values in some columns (e.g. the first, the twelfth and the twentieth). How can I modify this algorithm? Thanks in advance. * * * EDIT Your answers are very useful for me, and I'm wondering how all of you use Mathematica in a very smart way! For my first question it's very clear all your solutions, but, it is not clear for me (surely I didn't explain in a right way my problem) if I've got this kind of dataset               mydataset={{1, 2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5, 4}, {1, "", 3, 4}, {10, "", 12, 13}, {20, 30,     40, ""}, {100, 200, 300, ""}};      I want to select the row in this way: I can admit blank entries for the second column, but not for the fourth column. So the result would be:               result={{1, 2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5, 4}, {1, "", 3, 4}, {10, "", 12, 13}}      Can I modify your algorithm in this way? Thanks again, and sorry!
