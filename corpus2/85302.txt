It's unfortunate, but I'm taking this course that would require me to work in Flash CS3 (specifically programming), which would make me use windows. I'm very used to development under Ubuntu, and booting into windows would require me to switch a hard drive. I was wondering if:   * I could use the Flex 4.5 SDK to develop (something like a console application), then later hook it in Windows with the GUI I'm required to design? (In other words, is Flex 4.5 SDK compatible with CS3)?   * Is there a good lightweight editor that I can edit actionscript 3 in?
