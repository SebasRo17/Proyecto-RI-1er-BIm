I solved an integral and get a conditional expression as the result. The conditions are quite heavy but if I use `Assumptions` within my `Integral` call the computation time is heavily increased. My question, how can I evaluate a conditional expression? Example:               Integrate[1/Sqrt[z - Cos[x]], {x, 0, 2*Pi}]     Out[1]:= ConditionalExpression[(2 EllipticK[-(2/(-1 + z))])/Sqrt[-1 + z] + (       2 EllipticK[2/(1 + z)])/Sqrt[1 + z], Re[z] > 1]      And now let's say I know that $z \in \mathbb{R}$. I want to see what conditions are left when I plug that assumption in (of course this is quite an easy case here, but in my case I have tons of conditions and I like to see which disappear because I can make certain assumptions). Again, I could use `Assumptions` but it will make the computation ultra slow.
