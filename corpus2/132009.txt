I'm coming back into the winform world after being in the web world for a while. Is it common or otherwise feasible for developers to use IoC in winform? My concern is mainly with performance. I envision that I will need to "bootstrap" or initialize all my inverted items that are required by a given form instance on form initialization. If this initialization becomes expensive, I can push the task off to a thread, but that requires that I get the created objects back to the main thread where they will be used at some point.
