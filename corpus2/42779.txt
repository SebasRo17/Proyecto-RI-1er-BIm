I would like to write multiple lines of text inside an `InputField`, using `ContinuousAction->True` to update some variable `x` (so I don't need `Enter`).               InputField[Dynamic[x], String, ContinuousAction -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kYKwI.png) To do the above image, I have to copy and past the text. The point is, if I press `Enter`, the standard behavior is to try to update `x` value. How can I change it in order to make `Enter` to create a new line break in the text inside the `InputField` instead of try to evaluate it?
