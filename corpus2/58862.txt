I am confused about how Mathematica licensing works and there seem to be no clear explanations on the Wolfram site.   * I got Mathematica Starter last year and installed both at work and home (included for "free")   * I assume my Home Edition 9 is permanent, ie, never needs to be renewed and will last forever, ie I "bought it". Unfortunately I am stuck on 9 because 10 will not run on XP.   * My Mathematica 10 which I recently upgraded seems to be working fine at work, will it last forever, or will I at some point get some "expired" message?   * I have already got an "expired" message for SystemModeler which I got at the same time, and I can no longer use SystemModeler. Is this because "Starter" expires after a year?   * The "Modeling & Simulation Suite" which they advertise including both Mathematica and SM does not say whether it is a yearly deal or permanent. Which is it? ![System Information](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E5IHd.png)
