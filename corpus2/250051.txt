I have been arguying with a developer who insists that 1 FR=1 UC. I think that is a non sense as there are requirements often describing situations arising from the same point - for this the use cases have alternate flows. For example: FR01 - User can log in FR02 - User's account will be locked after 3 incorrect passwords. FR03 - Logged user can log out I believe all these can be nicely captured within a single use case, describing the interaction between the user and the system. But maybe I am missing something? EDIT: According to the book "Use Case Modeling" from Bittner, Spence: > a use case contains a set of description of requirements, the requirements > are presented in the form of narrative rather than an itemized list... ...   So I would say definitely more requirements can be captured within a single use case.
