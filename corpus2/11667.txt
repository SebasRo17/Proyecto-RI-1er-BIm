I'm looking for a 'term' that describes holistically the set of various software development tools/services that most developers use on a day to day basis. While each tool by itself has a specific purpose and can be described, is there a plural term when they are grouped together and running as a holistic service. If a person said a server was a production test box, I'd expect it to be running the application that company are writing. If a person said box A is the office ware server, I'd know to expect email/communication related services.
