The next version of the application will be a .NET based application (both desktop and web). The **requirement** is that both applications have to look and work exactly the same way. I was thinking that maybe there was a way to create a web control or something and use it in both applications. Is this possible? For example can I create a user control for the web and use it for the desktop (without using a web browser control)? If the above isn't possible, what are my alternatives? Please let me know.
