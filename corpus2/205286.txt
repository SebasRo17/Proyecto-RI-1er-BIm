I've been asked to develop a program with four interchangeable GUI's so that users can switch from basic to intermediate to advanced to expert mode seamlessly and at will. I have a good understanding on how to separate the GUI from the business logic. That's taken care of. My question is exclusively about how to organize, design, implement the GUI part for this particular requirement. If any of you can help with information from languages/frameworks other than C#/NET, it will be appreciated just the same.
