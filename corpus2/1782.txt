I would like to return two separate values from a compiled function, but _Mathematica_ refuses to use the compiled version. Here is a narrowed-down example:                   cFunc = Compile[{{a, _Integer, 1}}, {a, a.a}];          (*        ==> CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at instruction 3; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation. >>            ==> {{1, 1, 1}, 3}     *)      Here `a` and `a.a` are hypothetic intermediate results of some long computation, that must be externalized in order for computation to go on outside the compiled function. I assume it is not possible to return lists that are not uniform (data type and dimensions). Is there any way to return more than one results from a compiled computation?
