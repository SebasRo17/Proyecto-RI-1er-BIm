When I set the `Antialiasing` option in `Style`, I get the followings:               plot = ListContourPlot[        Table[Sin[i + j^2], {i, 0, 2, 0.05}, {j, 1.2, 2, 0.05}],         ColorFunction -> ColorData["AvocadoColors"], Contours -> 10,         Mesh -> False, ImageSize -> 400];     Grid@{{        Style[plot, Antialiasing -> Automatic],        Style[plot, Antialiasing -> True],        Style[plot, Antialiasing -> False]        }}      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D0gb9.png) For `Antialiasing -> Automatic`, everything is fine. Though `Antialiasing -> True` reveals polygon edges while still maintaining antialias on contourlines, frames, etc. `Antialiasing -> False` gives a plot where nothing is antialiased and polygon edges are not visible. There is this thing written in the documentation for `[Antialiasing][1]`: > With the default setting Antialiasing -> Automatic, choices are made to > optimize appearance on each type of computer system. I would not say this is an optimal appearance. Can anyone tell me the logic/algorithm behind `Automatic` in this case?
