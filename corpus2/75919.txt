Often, in libraries especially, packages contains classes that are organized around a single concept. Examples: **xml, sql, user, config, db**. I think we all feel pretty naturally that these packages are correct in the _singular_. > com.myproject. **xml**.Element   >  com.myproject. **sql**.Connection   >  com.myproject. **user**.User   >  com.myproject. **user**.UserFactory However, if I have a package that actually contains a **collection of implementations of a single type** \- such as **tasks, rules, handlers, models, etc.** , which is preferable? > com.myproject. **tasks**.TakeOutGarbageTask   >  com.myproject. **tasks**.DoTheDishesTask   >  com.myproject. **tasks**.PaintTheHouseTask or > com.myproject. **task**.TakeOutGarbageTask   >  com.myproject. **task**.DoTheDishesTask   >  com.myproject. **task**.PaintTheHouseTask
