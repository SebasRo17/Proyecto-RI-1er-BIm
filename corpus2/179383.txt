I have an open source project that is a add-in to TFS (ie it is for developers and those using TFS.) It is currently using the GPL. But it occurs to me that the GPL does not really represent what I am trying to do with my license. I want my code to be free to everyone who wants to use it. And if you modify it and use it then that is great too. You should not have to open source your modifications. But I would like to block someone from building my code and selling it. Or modifying it and selling it. (Anyone that wants to do that should have to negotiate a separate license with me.) **Is there an open source license that prevents re-selling, but allows full non-vending use for a person/company that downloads it?**
