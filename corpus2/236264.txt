Imagine your customer want's to have a possibility to add new property (e.g. color) to product in their eshop in their CMS. Instead of having properties as fields:               class Car extends Product {        protected String type;        protected int seats;     }      You would probably end up doing something like:               class Product {        protected String productName;        protected Map<String, Property> properties;     }          class Property {        protected String name;        protected String value;     }      That is, creating own type system on top of existing one. It feels to me like this could be seen as creating domain specific langauge, or couldn't? Is this approach a known design pattern? Would you solve the problem differently? I know there are languages where I can add a field in runtime, but what about database? Would you rather add/alter columns or used someting as shown above? Thank you for your time :).
