This is kind of a vague question so I apologize in advance. When software is "smarter", I tend to interpret that as really just saying that it covers more edge cases. First of all, is this correct? Assuming it is, does this mean that the software is full of if/switch statements to make sure input is handled properly, therefore making it "smarter"? This thinking makes me feel like the code would end up bloated and messy. I'm running into a point where I'm wanting to handle these edge cases, but I don't want to bloat my code merely overlooking some best practice. What am I missing?
