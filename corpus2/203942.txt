On hackernews and /r/programming I've heard several reports of how the games industry is incredibly harsh on programmers. Someone on this site also linked this blog post in an answer I read recently. According to various reports, programmers in the games industry are severely overworked. Perhaps not when working for small games companies, but definitely when working for places like EA(the place discussed in the blog post). So my question is, why? I'm a developer for a large networking company, I sometimes work more than 8 hours a day, but I wouldn't dream of working 12 hour days 6 days a week like the blog post describes. I'd quit and move on without a second thought. Why does the games industry, specifically, have this problem?
