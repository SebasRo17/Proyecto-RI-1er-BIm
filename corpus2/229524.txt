I am making a Game in HTML5. In one part of it, I want the users to be able to customize the avatar they get by default. For sample, let me share a screenshot from Zombie Lane on Facebook (now this game may not be in HTML5 but that's not the point): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RXseK.png) My question is as to how do I include the images in the HTML5 page and in which format? Whenever a clothing is different shirt is selected, the change is applied immediately. Is it a whole new photo that we see, or is the photo changed somehow by programming? How is it done?
