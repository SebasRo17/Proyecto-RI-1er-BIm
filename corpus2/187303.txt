In the O'Reilly book on Scala, I read that copy-pasting of code creates: > ... creates issues of code-bloat, maintainability and _skew_ , I can't see any obvious definitions of the word skew in context. I am aware of the problems of copy-pasting, but I can't make them fit with the word 'skew'. Since this is used in an O'Reilly book I'm guessing it's a real programming term in circulation. Any pointers?
