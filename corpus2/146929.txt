I want to output an analog signal from my Windows 7 computer. The wave will be a combination of about 5 frequencies, with a maximum of 28 MHz. It won't be a problem to generate the wave data with C++, but I am not sure how to output the wave dynamically (as it is being generated). I am sure an audio port is not set up to output 28 MHz, but is there some way to bypass the sound card and interface directly with the port? If not, what would be the easiest way to output a high frequency analog signal with C++?
