I tried to expand `BesselJ[k,x]` function into a Taylor series with `Series` command. Here both `k` and `x` are some functions of the expansion variable $\lambda$, so in the expansion, derivatives with respect to both `k` and `x` occur. The problem is, whenever there is a term that is the derivative of both variables, _Mathematica_ leaves it as (e.g.) `Derivative[2, 1][BesselJ][0., 2.40483]` and doesn't give a numerical value in the end. First I thought it is because assigned values aren't exact -- since the above `2.40483` is the value of `BesselJZero[0, 1]`. However, it also doesn't give numerical or analytical result for the following easier calculation:               D[BesselJ[k, x], {k, 1}, {x, 1}] /. {k -> 1, x -> 1} // N     (* -> Derivative[1, 1][BesselJ][1., 1.] *)      But, when the order of the differentiation changes, it gives numerical results:               D[BesselJ[k, x], {x, 1}, {k, 1}] /. {k -> 0, x -> 1} // N     (* -> 1.22713 *)      It works with `x -> BesselJZero[0, 1]` as well. First question: why is this the case? Second (if it is possible): how can I handle it with `Series` command?
