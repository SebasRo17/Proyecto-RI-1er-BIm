Here is my problem: I have a set of 'n' colors including the primary colors and their codes in hexadecimal. Now given another color 'x' I wonder if it's actually possible to come up with a mix between two or more of the colors of the set that will produce 'x'. The mix should be subtractive. Here is an example of the result of the algorithm: My set of colors is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6. I am trying to find the mix to produce the color x. The result could be: 50% of c1, 25% of c4 and 25% of c5. If anyone could point me in the right direction (or at least tell me if it is unfeasible), any help would be gladly appreciated!
