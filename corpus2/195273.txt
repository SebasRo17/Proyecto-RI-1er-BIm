Not being a Java practitioner, I recently came to learn about the JAX-RS specification and Apache CXF framework. While still wrapping my head around all these things, I also read the this question on SO. Since MVC is a design pattern while JAX-RS is a specification, I was confused about the comparison. Granted my nascent understanding of JAX-RS, what makes it more suitable for implementing a RESTful API than say a framework that uses the MVC pattern? N.B. I have a C and Python background.
