I have an array of $M$ sets of morphological components corresponding to the same image, however computed in different ways. For example, we might have:                    M = Array[{} &, 4];               t1 = 0.1;          t2 = 0.2;          t3 = 0.5;               M[[1]] = WatershedComponents[image,t1];          M[[2]] = MorphologicalComponents[CrossingDetect[image],t2, Method->"BoundingDisk"];          M[[3]] = MorphologicalComponents[image,t3, Method->"ConvexHull"];          M[[4]] = MorphologicalComponents[EdgeDetect[image],t1];      Is there a mechanism in Mathematica v9.0 that would allow me to create a function like:                   MorphologicalComponentNoIntersection[testComponentList,M]      Which will return a set of morphological components in testComponentList that nowhere intersect / overlap any of the components in the array of component lists $M$? Or, in the opposite manner, perhaps a list of components in testComponentList that intersect / overlap with each at least one component in each list of components in $M$?
