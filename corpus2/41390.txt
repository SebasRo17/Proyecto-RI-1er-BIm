I have a question. Suposse I have some data with their respective errors:                Data = {{0.067, 0.423}, {0.30, 0.408}, {0.60, 0.433}, {0.25,0.3512}, {0.37, 0.4602}, {0.44, 0.413}, {0.60, 0.390}, {0.73,0.437}, {0.8, 0.47}};                Errors = {0.055, 0.0552, 0.0662, 0.0583, 0.0378, 0.080, 0.063, 0.072, 0.08};      I want to construct somehow numerical derivatives of these data at som specific point. My idea was first to find a fit of those data (I'm not including the errors so far)               model = a*x + b*x^2 + c*x^3 + d*x^4 + f*x^5 + g*x^6 + h*x^7 + j*x^8 + k*x^9;          fit = FindFit[Dataf, model, {a, b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k}, z];          modelf = Function[{z}, Evaluate[model /. fitfs8]];          fits = Plot[modelf[x], {x, 0, 1.0}, Epilog -> Map[Point, Datafs8],       Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 700, PlotStyle -> Directive[Red],      FrameLabel -> {Style["x", Italic],       Style["y", Italic]}, Axes -> False,       LabelStyle -> Directive[16]];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X8Lr0.jpg) The reason why I choose those model was matter of convenience, since I have some theoretical model (Black line, I don't add the expression because is quite "complicated"). After that I make a Numerical Derivative of the Model and compare with the analytical derivative of the theoretical prediction ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AiEpV.jpg) The questions are:   1. How can I include the errors in the method?   2. How can I get then expressions (numbers) for y' at some point with errors as well? I appreciate your help :)
