Consider the following code. After evaluating it, when I move the mouse over the output `text`, it prints 1, and when I click the mouse on `text`, it prints 2.               EventHandler["text", {"MouseMoved" :> (Print[1]), "MouseDown" :> (Print[2])}]      I want to modify this so when I move the mouse over the output `text`, it prints 1, and when I click on `text`, it prints 2 and stops printing 1. How do I do this?
