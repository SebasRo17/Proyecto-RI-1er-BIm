I asked this question Mark Minimum Value in DensityPlot. Another question has come up, or better said, a task: Find the minimum of a function. I haven't been able to write the needed code for that, because I want to find the minimum of the function `ueislexpl[epsilon, h, n1, n2]` with respect to `n1` and `n2`. But `ueislexpl` calls the function `eislminx2[epsilon_?NumericQ, n2_?NumericQ]`, which needs a value for `n2`. For tests one may use `epsilon = 0.1`. Is there a way of finding the minimum of `ueislexpl[epsilon, h, n1, n2]` with respect to `n1` and `n2`?               eislexpl[gamma_,epsilon_, n2_, x_] :=         28 (epsilon)^2 - 1 + ((-2 Log[E^(1/2) x])/x^2 + (27/10(gamma - epsilon))/x +          (10 epsilon^2 n2^(3/2))/x^(3/2))          eislminx2[gamma_,epsilon_?NumericQ, n2_?NumericQ] :=      (       minx = FindArgMin[{eislexpl[gamma,epsilon, n2, x], 0 < x}, x];       eislexpl[gamma,epsilon, n2, minx]     )          ueislexpl[gamma_,epsilon_, h_, n1_, n2_] :=        n1 (40  epsilon^2 - 1) + (1 -127/100 ) (1 + (n1 - 1) HeavisideTheta[1 - n1] -        (-1 + Exp[-(n1 - 1)]) HeavisideTheta[n1 - 1]) + n2  eislminx2[gamma,epsilon, n2] +        (h - n1 - n2) (28  epsilon^2 - 1)      The function `ueislexpl[gamma,epsilon, h, n1, n2]` describes the energy of a specific type of crystal morphology. It is used to predict specific growth modes. `h` is the total amount of deposited material `h=n1 + n2 + n3`. There are 3 different types of structures that can appear. A so called wetting layer, 3d-structures of kind 1 (3ds1) and 3d-structures of kind 2 (3ds2). `n1`is the amount of material comprising the wetting layer, `n2`is the amount of material comprising 3ds1, and whats left of `h`, `h-n1-n2=n3` is the material comprising 3ds2. In my simulations i usually use values of h within [0,8], meaning that values for n1 and n2 are too within [0,8]. I saw, that i oversimplified my functions, so i edited them, now there is one variable more, `gamma`, the surface energy per unit area, epsilon is the strain. My goal is to plot 2 different phase diagrams, one that shows the energy as a function of `h` and `epsilon` and the second one showing the energy as a function of `h`and `gamma`. The function `eislminx2[gamma,epsilon, n2]` determines the energetic minimum for a given set of `gamma`,`epsilon` and `n2` \- so i can't give constant values for them, they need to be variables. And the function that determines the energetic minimum of the system (minimum of ueislexpl[gamma,epsilon, h, n1, n2]) needs to be able to deal with that, is that possible? Determining the formal minimum of ueislexpl[gamma,epsilon, h, n1, n2], leaving some variables blank for the moment, as if i took the derivative of `y=a x^2 + x`, `dy/dx=2 a x + 1=0` \- even though i dont know the value of a i can formally take the derivative and later on plug in values for a and determine the minimum. Or is there another way?
