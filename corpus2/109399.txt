Mike Cohn in Agile Estimating and Planning, page 154, defines a "natural order" for implementing user stories - this, according to him, is a intuitive sequence that makes sense to both developers and the team. I understand and endorse this idea. Though, I am having trouble letting go the concept of "critical path"; I see the value of ordering stories based on their dependencies. Even if the backlog is an always evolving tool, we could derive the "critical path" of the current backlog to prioritize and derive for 3-6 months worth of releases. It just does not sound right considering all I know about Agile. How do you apply the concept of critical path in Scrum? Your personal opinion would be much appreciated!
