I'm learning about the open source web based project management tool Trac and I'm a bit confused about its role in the area of reporting defects vs bug tracking. For those unfamiliar with Trac itself, it has a Ticket system which is the tool used to report issues, and you can choose between reporting a task, an enhancement, or a defect. It's that last option that I'm confused about. I get the impression that Trac is not meant to be a bug tracking tool, but if that's the case then what is the defect field for? I looked at the way the Trac team uses their own system, and it does _look_ like they post some things that appear to be bugs, but for the most part it's other kinds of issues, and that actually blurries the distinction for me even further. Can someone explain to me how the "defect" option is to be used? Is defect==bug? Should tickets be opened for bugs?
