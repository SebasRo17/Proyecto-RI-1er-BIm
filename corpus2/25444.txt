I have been trying this problems for hours and cannot find any helpful clues. How can I convert $Sinh[3\theta]+Sinh[\theta]$ to a rational function of x given $2Sinh[\theta] = x-x^{-1}$ by using only a **SINGLE** pattern replacement rule. I guess what single means is that we are only allowed to use one arrow. My question is twofold:   1. I have one method but unsure of its correctness, also although I know the method but I am unable to write the code.   2. If my method is wrong, what is the correct one? This is the best method that I can think of. My method is as follows:   Since we have the hyperbolic trig formula, we can use the rule (I will use Q instead)               Sinh[a Q] -> (x^a - x^-a)/2      I have tried many ways, and below are the 2 best ones that I think are the closest to the correct answers:               In: f := {Sinh[a Q] + Sinh[Q]} /. Sinh[a Q] -> (x^a - x^-a)/2;     In: {Sinh[3 Q]] + Sinh[Q]} // f        > `Out: {1/2 (-x^-a + x^a) + Sinh[Q]}[{Sinh[Q] + Sinh[3 Q]}]`               In: {Sinh[#1 Q] + Sinh[#2 Q]} /. Sinh[# Q] -> (x^# - x^-#)/2 &[3, 1]        > `Out: {1/2 (-(1/x^3) + x^3) + Sinh[Q]]}` I always have troubles putting the rules into one entity such that it will replace every coefficient of Q, including 1. The output that I am looking for (using my method) is               Sinh[3Q] + Sinh[Q] = x^3 - x^-3 + x - x^-1        Many thanks.
