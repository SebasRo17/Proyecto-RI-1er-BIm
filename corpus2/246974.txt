I have been using Symfony2 with Doctrine2 for some years. I have recently started using Microsoft's Entity Framework with MVC5. From my Symfony2 experience I understand that a repository's job is only to retrieve and return objects, no additional operations like Saving. Now every examples I have seen for EF has a method Save/Update as part of the repository. For symfony I have been creating manager classes as follows:               interface IManager     {         function getClassName() ;         IRepository getRepository() ;         function Save(object);         function Update();     }      So I pass around the manager, if I need to retrieve objects I call the repository directly. If I need to save I call the manager's save method. Is a repository supposed to support save/update? What do you think of my IManager class, should I also use it for EF?
