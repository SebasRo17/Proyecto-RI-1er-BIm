I'm trying to fit data with xerror and yerror using "Findfit", so i'm trying the same form than in tuto : http://reference.wolfram.com/applications/eda/FittingDataToLinearModelsByLeast- SquaresTechniques.html which is {{x,errx},{y,erry}} So my code is :               data2201vol = ReadList["data.dat", {{Number, Number}, {Number, Number}, {Number, Number},{Number,Number}}][[All, {1, 3}]]          data1 = data2201vol     res1 = FindFit[data1, model, t, eta];      But when i evaluate i get that :               FindFit::fitd: First argument {{{7.98187,2.92332},{65326,255.59}},{{13.0174,2.91387},{61510,248.012}},{{23.0829,2.98836},{55135,234.808}},{{43.1855,3.0372},{45142,212.466}},{{53.2883,3.11867},{41257,203.118}},{{63.3186,3.16282},{38048,195.059}},{{83.3984,3.23615},{32628,180.632}},{{103.479,3.26169},{28339,168.342}},{{123.585,3.36999},{24976,158.038}},{{203.785,3.47143},{16381,127.988}},{{243.893,3.62374},{13685,116.983}},{{303.901,3.54541},{10845,104.139}},{{363.98,3.57129},{8753,93.5575}}} in FindFit is not a list or a rectangular array. >>      Of course "model" is well defined, it works when i use a more classical input without yerror. I didn't find so much on that, if someone have an idea !
