I'm currently hunting for a new job. I'm a c# / SQL server developer, but have never worked in an agile environment. I'm in the UK, where very few (IT) employers advertise directly, but instead use recruitment agencies. The problem I'm having is that many agents have little or no understanding of the skills they're trying to recruit for. Agile, being the latest buzzword, appears as an "absolute requirement" on many job postings. I've already spoken to couple of agents today who believe that it's some kind of programming language, rather than a development methodology. It looks like I'm going to have to tell a few white lies to get my CV into the hands of potential employers. Can someone suggest a resource for the basics of Agile so I can at least sound convincing to an agent.
