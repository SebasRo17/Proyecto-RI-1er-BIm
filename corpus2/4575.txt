I came across some somewhat surprising behavior of `Simplify` today, on something very simple. Let's take two cubic polynomials that we know have the same value:               bySum = Sum[k^2, {k, 1, n}]      > >     (1/6)*n*(1 + 3*n + 2*n^2) >                 byBernoulli = (BernoulliB[3, n + 1] - BernoulliB[3])/3      > >     (1/3)*((1 + n)/2 - (3/2)*(1 + n)^2 + (1 + n)^3) >   Now, I haven't done anything to simplify these two polynomials, so it's no surprise that they look different. However, `Simplify` helps less than you might think:               {bySum, byBernoulli} // Simplify      > >     {(1/6)*n*(1 + n)*(1 + 2*n), (1/6)*n*(1 + 3*n + 2*n^2)} >   Mathematica can still figure out that they're the same if you ask it, but the `Simplify`'d forms are different.               bySum == byBernoulli // Simplify      > >     True >   I was somewhat surprised by this. `FullSimplify` works as I'd expect, but this isn't the sort of problem where I'd expect to need it. For what it's worth, this is Mathematica 8.0.4 on Windows 7 (x64).
