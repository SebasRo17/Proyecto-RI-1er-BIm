I am using `ContourPlot` for defining a 2-parameter space feasibility of a function. This function simply returns 1 if everything is `True`, or -1 if everything is `False`. My question is, without knowing the algebraic expression of the function, how can you find the point inside the feasibility region that is most distant from the border? Just as an example, if my contour was a square, the point I would be looking for would be in the center.               ContourPlot[Sin[y] + Sin[x], {x, -4.7, 1.6}, {y, -4.7, 1.6},       Contours -> 1,      FrameLabel -> {x, y}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dR000.png) Any ideas are appreciated! Thank you in advance
