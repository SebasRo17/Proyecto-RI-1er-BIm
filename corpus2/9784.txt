It seems that this is a really basic question, and I feel that the answer should be obvious to me. However, I am not seeing. Can you please help me? Thanks. Suppose I have a list of data `list` and a selector list `sel`. I would like to `Map` some function `f` onto elements in `list` that correspond to `True` in the selector list `sel`. Thus for the input               list = {1, 10, 100};     sel = {True, False, True};      I would like to obtain the output               {f[1], 10, f[100]}      I can think of some complicated ways to accomplish this (e.g., using `Table` to step through both `list` and `sel` using an iterator `i`; or find the positions of `True` in `sel` using `Position` and then `MapAt` at those positions), but not simple ways. Do you have any advice?
