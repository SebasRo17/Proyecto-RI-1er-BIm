I have been having some trouble with the addition of large (but very sparse) matrices using SparseArray. Here is the simplest example to illustrate the issue. First, I will define diagonal matrices with random boolean entries:               Do[A[i] = DiagonalMatrix@SparseArray@RandomChoice[{0, 1}, 10^4];, {i,1, 5}]      Now I add them:               AbsoluteTiming[Sum[A[i], {i, 1, 5}];]      In my system (Mathematica 9 in Mac OS) this operation takes 2.39 seconds. Next I implement this sequentially, adding one matrix to another at each step:               B = 0;     AbsoluteTiming[Do[B += A[i], {i, 5}];]      This operation takes in my machine 0.001226 seconds (!). This seems to be independent of the method used to sum; all the following choices take approximately the same time:               Sum[A[i], {i, 1, 5}]     Total@Table[A[i], {i, 1, 5}]     Plus @@ Table[A[i], {i, 1, 5}]     A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4] + A[5]      Of course, what I am really interested are non-diagonal matrices with non- trivial entries. Even though I could continue to use the aforementioned "sequential" approach, this behaviour is puzzling for me and I would really like to understand it. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance. Gabriel
