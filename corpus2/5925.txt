When I used Mathematica under Windows, I could control the page size of the pdf files created by `Export[...,"PDF"]` by setting the paper size in the print menu to the desired size before executing the `Export` command. In particular, I would set the paper size to `Ledger`, and when I opened the resulting files in Acrobat the page size would be listed as 10.83 x 16.83 in. Now, I'm using Mathematica under Mac OS X, and this trick doesn't work. Is there some option for `Export[...,"PDF"]` that allows me to control the PDF page size of the output directly? **Update** The item I'm exporting is of the form `CreateDocument[{item1,item2}]`, where item2 is a `GraphicsGrid` that contains `ImageSize` information. Unfortunately, when that information gets wrapped inside `CreateDocument`, `Export[...,"PDF"]` seems to ignore it when setting the PDF page size.
