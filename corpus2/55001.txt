I have found that attempting to **Save Selection As...** in a magnified Notebook fails with errors. On my system it can be easily reproduced by:   1. opening any documentation page   2. setting Notebook magnification to 150%   3. making an arbitrary selection   4. using **Save Selection As...** in the **File** menu   5. attempting to save as a .PNG image Errors produced in the Messages window: > >     The specified setting for the option WindowSize cannot be used. >   >     During evaluation of In[15]:= Set::shape: Lists >     {System`ConvertersDump`height$3806,System`ConvertersDump`width$3806} >     and {0} are not the same shape. >> >   >     During evaluation of In[15]:= Image::imgarray: The specified argument >     {} should be an array of rank 2 or 3 with machine-sized numbers. >> >   I am running Mathematica 10.0.0.0 under Windows 7.
