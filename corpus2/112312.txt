Well... I was hired because I did not take a comp-sci or engineering course, however I was really good at coding. My job is doing the heterodox stuff when needed... You know, the guy that sometimes has to use a goto, or invent some bizarre technology. When I started my job, I blasted though stuff I needed to do, then I got slower and slower until I almost got fired. Now I am more or less stable, but I am noticing I am slowing down again. I plainly open my source code, look at it, and have no idea what I have to do, sometimes I do not know even what I was doing. I think this is related to my lifestyle. My work is a two hour commute (meaning I lose 4 hours daily), and I have not completed university yet (so I need to do some university work at home), and on weekends I spend time with my significant other. Does anyone know what to do in a situation like this? I am depressed that I cannot write code like I could when I started, or when someone would throw some oddball problem at me and I would spit out a solution instantly. Now I am having trouble typing even 10 lines of code in a day, because I spend the entire day trying to figure what to do. In fact, I can't even procrastinate when I **want** to procrastinate, I open the browser, and I have no idea of what web page to open. It is really annoying :( I feel like my IQ dropped from its measured levels to something like 80...
