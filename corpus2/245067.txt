Are Data Warehouses bespoke projects that are developed to meet the needs of a specific organisation or can you buy off the shelf products that would meet the needs of many organisations? I am talking about a product that will integrate information from many different systems e.g. finance system, sales system, production system etc for management reporting. Different organisations have different systems that have different database designs. For example, organisation A may use finance system A, which has a completely different design to finance system B used by organisation B. Therefore I believe that Data Warehouse products are bespoke products and it is not possible to develop a product that could be used by many organisations e.g. organisation A and organisation B; that have the same types of systems e.g. Finance, Sales etc. Am I correct in this analysis?
