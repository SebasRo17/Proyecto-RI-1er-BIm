I want to make a desktop application- an analog-clock with the option of setting alarms using java. For rendering all the graphics and the button features, a Swing applet is the answer. But the problem is that I want to run the applet onto the desktop and so need an applet viewer like thing. Applet viewer comes with the JDK and I think installing entire JDK on a system for running just a simple alarm clock is really not a good idea at all because it will take a lot of space. Is there a way out? Can I get just the applet viewer (or anything similar to that) instead of entire JDK so that I can run my applet? Or is there any other way I can do my project using Java?
