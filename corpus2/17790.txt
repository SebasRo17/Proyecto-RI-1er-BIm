I'm current the sole developer/architect of a fairly large web application (ASP.NET MVC stack, roughly 150K+ lines of code) and the end of development is on the horizon. As such, I'm starting to think about what needs to be done for the hand off of the project and I want to make sure I do the right thing for anyone that has to maintain the project in the future. What are some things to be aware of when getting ready to hand a project off to another developer or team of developers of maintenance?
