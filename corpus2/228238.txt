I am asking this question as an extension to the following question: https://superuser.com/questions/713409/how-to-message-any-user-on-your-lan I don't think I have a real answer. I found it quite difficult to get the `net send` command working on Windows 7 and even if I could have it would have been enabled only for admin users. So I have decided to write my own program to solve the problem. Using `python` I can write a program to check for messages on a common file (which I can store on a common harddrive which we have on our LAN). So the program will write `from:192.168.23.44 to:192.168.23.45 Hello`. Assuming the program is installed on both machines, I can ask the machines to poll this file every few seconds and pop-up a message if a message has been written for it, by searching for it in the `to:` field. If writing to a single file becomes an issue I will make multiple files which will act as inboxes for each of the computers on the LAN. However, this approach is very inelegant. I don't suppose internet messengers, Google talk for instance, poll a server to check whether there are any new messages for the user. So my question is: what is the optimal way to write a LAN messenger program. Now that I think of it, I am looking for a minimalist approach. I will just put the program in the `Startup` folder of all the machines and it should come alive whenever any user logs in. I was just able to configure the machine to respond to the `ping` command by making a new rule for the ICMPv4 protocol (ref: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/how-to- enable-ping-response-in-windows-7/5aff5f8d-f138-4c9a-8646-5b3a99f1cae6). I am guessing that answer lies in `python` and the `ICMPv4` protocol, but I needed some direction.
