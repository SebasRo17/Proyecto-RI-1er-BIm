What I'd need is to draw an hemisphere of given radius but then it should have a reduced height. I don't mean a section of an hemisphere, I mean that the hemisphere should be pressed/flattened...so that it keeps on having the given radius but it is much less high, more flattened. I can't fine the right values or the relations between theta and phi to correctly use this formula:               SphericalPlot3D[5, {\[Theta], 0, Pi/5}, {\[Phi], 0, 2 Pi}, AspectRatio -> Automatic]      Any help? Remember, I don't want the radius/diameter to change, it only must be flattened.
