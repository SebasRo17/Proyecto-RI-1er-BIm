While using IE autocorrect "naive" got transformed to "naïve"! My regional settings are Au English, from a Unicode search point of view the two are nothing alike. I am not even sure whether there are other characters that are being replaced, but from a programmers point of view what are the consequences and remedies in such cases? In SQL is there a way to return results containing both "naïve" and "naive"? (without hardcoding or explicit programming of course). Are there other instances of automatic transliteration that one should be aware of? Or is there a method to handle such sameness of characters in other languages? e.g. umlats in German and lack/inclusion of vowels in Arabic script based words. Thanks for any observations on this matter
