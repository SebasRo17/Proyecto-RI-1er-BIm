> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Going from PHP to Java I have been working at my current job for about 4 years. I have been doing PHP for twice as long. I am completely self taught (with lots of internet and friends help). I recently found a job posting for a Java developer and I am wondering what I need to know about Java to prepare. I took 2 college course on Java so I am looking a little beyond Hello World stuff (actually just installed Eclipsed and wrote it again). I hear they also do Flex so anything on how Java and Flex work together would be great as well. My first step is going to be to remake a project I built in PHP using Java. This is similar but the answers aren't very specific. Going from PHP to Java Thank you and I apologizes if this should be community wiki.
