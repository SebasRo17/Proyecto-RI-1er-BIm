# Problem I want to clone an svn repo with git-svn. The problem is the subversion repository changed layouts at `r1235`. # Specifics From revision 1 to 1234, `foo` used the standard svn folder layout with:   * /trunk/src   * /tags/`version`/src At revision 1235, the author added `bar` to the repo. To do so they restructured the master repository making the folder layout look like this:   * /trunk/foo/src   * /trunk/bar/src   * /tags/`version`/foo/src   * /tags/`version`/bar/src # Goal I want a new git repository that has the history of `foo` as if it was never rearranged to include `bar`. # Relevant Documentation Working with non standard layouts is discussed in git-svn's documentation. If the entire history in unnecessary (or if I just want `bar`), I can get what I want from r1235 on:   * `git svn init --stdlayout http://path.to/repo`   * edit `repo/.git/config` adding `/foo` to relevant paths (or `/bar`) `               [svn-remote "svn"]        url = http://path.to/repo        fetch = trunk/foo:refs/remotes/trunk        branches = branches/*/foo:refs/remotes/*        tags = tags/*/foo:refs/remotes/tags/*      `   * `git svn fetch -r 1235:HEAD` # My attempts   * `git svn clone -r 1:1234 --stdlayout http://path.to/repo`   * edit `repo/.git/config` as above   * `git svn fetch -r 1235:HEAD` # Result The last command seems to succeed because `r1235` \- `HEAD` get downloaded. However, `git log` only shows commits up to `1234`. The working directory also seems to be the old revision.
