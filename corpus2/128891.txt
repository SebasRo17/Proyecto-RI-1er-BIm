Web developers code in a minimum of four languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a server-side language), must produce a working result in several different browser implementations, and may work on the top of a custom software stack that they don't control.   * How should a code review take these things into account?   * Should a code review include all parts of a front-end project (HTML and CSS as well), or just focus on the logic?   * How should a code review handle workarounds for browser- or stack-specific problems?
