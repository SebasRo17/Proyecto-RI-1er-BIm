I've now been using _Mathematica_ for about a year, and am starting to get a somewhat unwieldy collection of notebooks. Sometimes I've figured out how to do a particular task in one of them, and want to use that again, but have to search through what I've done. To tackle this, I've cobbled together a script that generates an html page for all the notebooks that I've checked into my source code repository (I happen to be using github to store my notebooks, latex, and other source code), and can put comments in that generated html file about what I did in each notebook, including any special techniques that I learned to accomplish the task. By way of example, I can list these with something like on this page. From a local copy of my source repository I generate something similar, allowing a click on the various notebooks to view them with the CDF player. I'm able to navigate my collection of notebooks well enough this way, but was curious how other people tackle the same organizational problem?
