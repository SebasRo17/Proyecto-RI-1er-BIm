On any team, you are going to have the need for more grizzled and grey developers and some young pups. Some reasons include:   * Money. There are often tasks that don't require the same level of experience to deliver, so it makes sense not to pay top dollar to have those tasks fulfilled.   * Energy. There's an energy and enthusiasm that new people can bring to a team that stops it from getting too stale and set in its ways. There's also calmness and wisdom that the more senior people can bring.   * Knowledge transfer and career growth. Both in terms of the project and skills, it's useful and often fun to teach people and to learn new stuff. It's satisfying to help "bring on" new team members. I realise there are some cutting edge projects where it may be important for there to be more senior people than junior, but in general, is there an ideal mix of experiences on a team, or is it totally dependent on the project?
