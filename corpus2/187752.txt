I am coming from a .NET background and beginning my journey into the Mac OSX\Ruby\Rails environment. A lot of the resources I have found such as this one have between 5-10 steps for setting up a Ruby\Rails environment. My question is, what are the bare minimum requirements for setting up a working Ruby\Rails environment? Can I use RailsInstaller and be done? Should I install all of the tools that the above link suggests (XQuartz, Homebrew, RVM, etc) even though I don't really know what they do? Right now I am not being paid to do this, but am also curious what professional Rails developers do when setting up an environment. I am also more concerned about the _why_ as in _why I shouldn't use RailsInstaller_ or _why I should install RVM_.
