Let me first explain what I am doing then I will mention my little problem that I could not figure out. I am using Mathematica version 7. I have an equation named " ** _fd_** " and I took the derivative of " ** _fd_** " with respect to **_t_** which I will note the outcome as **_Dfdt_**. Basically, I am trying to understand if **_Dfdt_** is negative or positive (Comparative Statics) and in order to do this I put some assumptions on the parameters in the simplify function which will be seen in my code below. However, as a outcome I get a general restriction outcome which satisfies **_Dfdt_** being positive or negative. Are there any possible methods/codes to take out the parameters values which satisfies **_Dfdt_** being positive or negative ?
