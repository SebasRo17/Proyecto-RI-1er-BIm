I have: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9kOuC.gif) created with:               With[{stdOpt = {InterpolationOrder -> 0,      GridLines -> {Range[10], Range[10]},      GridLinesStyle -> Directive[GrayLevel[0.8], Dashed],      Joined -> True, AspectRatio -> 1}},      ListPlot[{0}, stdOpt, PlotRange -> {{0, 10}, {0, 10}}, Axes -> False,     Frame -> False, Epilog -> {          Black, Opacity[1.0],          Text[Style[1, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 0.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[2, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 1.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[3, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 2.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[4, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 3.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[5, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 4.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[6, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 5.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[7, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 6.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[8, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 7.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[9, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 8.5},       FormatType -> Bold],     Text[Style[10, Large, FontFamily -> "Times"], {0.5, 9.5},       FormatType -> Bold]          }]]      and I would like to place (& correctly align) a column of numbers (from pre- made lists) for each of the 10 columns (rather than the manully placed numbers as they appear above).
