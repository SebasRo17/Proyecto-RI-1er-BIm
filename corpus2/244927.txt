I want to refactor an OLD legacy application and give it a new feel... so, I want to use Twitter Boostrap for the UI... I've also been playing around a lot with AngularJS... is it common place to use them in conjunction with one another? Is it even the correct question to ask? I've done about an hour's worth of "googling" on the subject and I see a lot of people using the CSS- portion of bootstrap with Angular, however, do I gain anything (or lose anything) by also including the bootstrap .js portion, as well? Thanks.
