I have a website in which I'm loading all of the users' comments by the number of likes they have. This has caused me some troubles. Let's say comment #1 has 5 likes, comment #2 has 2 likes, and the rest have 0 likes. We have the following comment id's:               1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10      Now let's assume someone else "likes" comment #4. Now the id's ordered are:               1   2   4   3   5   6   7   8   9   10      Let's assume I'm loading 3 comments at the same time. At scenario #1, I loaded comments:               {1, 2, 3}      Now when I click "load more," I load:               {3, 5, 6}      Loaded #3 twice! And comment #4 is never viewed. Problems also happen when a comment is deleted, but that's for later. How can I work around that? I saw websites that order by "likes" or something similar and I almost never encounter duplicates and/or missing comments. Any tips? Thanks.
