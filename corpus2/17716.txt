I've reduced my actual problem to:               ParallelEvaluate[       Module[{slot=1},         Slot[slot]       ]     ]      gives error messages that I think shouldn't be there. It seems I can work around them with               ParallelEvaluate[       Module[{slot=1},         Slot@@{slot}       ]     ]      and               ParallelEvaluate[       Module[{slot=1,s=Slot},         s[slot]       ]     ]      but I still think this is a bug in the parallel framework. Am I missing something obvious? It seems the numeric check happens with the local Module placeholder values passed to the parallelism framework in a syntactic way, not in a semantic way. But that's wrong, I should be able to pass `Slot[anything]` v8.0.4 and v9 alike, Windows and Linux.
