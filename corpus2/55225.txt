Version 10.0               Clear[y,x];     DSolve[D[y[x], x] - y[x]^2 + y[x]*Sin[x] - Cos[x] == 0, y[x], x,          GeneratedParameters -> C]      or               DSolve[D[y[x], x] - y[x]^2 + y[x]*Sin[x] - Cos[x] == 0, y[x], x]      both return a solution that does not include `C[1]`, the constant of integration.               {{y[x] -> Sin[x]}}      The question is: Should `DSolve` always return an arbitrary constant? Even though the answer is correct, it is missing `C[1]` hence this is a particular solution. If `DSolve` does not _have to_ generate a constant of integration in the solution of a differential equation, then what caused it not to generate it in this specific case? **Update:** Let me add a solution found by Maple for this, which _does_ include a constant of integration:               Clear[C,y,x];     eq = Derivative[1][y][x] - y[x]^2 + y[x]*Sin[x] - Cos[x] == 0;     eq /. y -> (- Exp[-Cos[#]]/(C[1] + Integrate[ Exp[-Cos[#]], x]) + Sin[#] &);     Simplify[%]     (* True *)      So, the above is a general solution with a constant of integration that solves the same differential equation.
