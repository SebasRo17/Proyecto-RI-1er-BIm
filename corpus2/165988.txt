I have a meeting with a prospective client tomorrow for a certain e-commerce project he wants to commission. I had an overview of it over the phone and from what I understand there are gazillion such concepts already floating and most of them are disasters and I have reasons to believe that his project is significantly likely to have the same fate. Should I raise/discuss the commercial feasibility of his idea with him or simply accept the project, give my best and leave out all the rest?
