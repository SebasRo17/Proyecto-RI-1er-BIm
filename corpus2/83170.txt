It seems silly to compare these two servers considering that they're meant for very different things. But if you think about it, they can do lots of similar things: store configuration data, distributed locking, queueing, etc. I've got an instance of Redis that I'm using for some production-related things, but would like to do some simple synchronization between servers (mostly configuration changes that don't require pushing up code and simple locking between servers). What does Zookeeper give me that Redis wouldn't?
