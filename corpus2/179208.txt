These days computers usually have 2GB or 4GB memory. I like to use some secure client server model, and well an sql database is likely candidate. On the other hand I only have about 8000 records, who will not frequently be read or written in total they would consume less then 16 Megabyte. And it made me wonder what would be good secure options in a windows environment to store the data work with it multi-client single server model, without using SQL or mysql? Would for well such a small amount of data maybe other ideas better? Because I like to keep maintenance as simple as possible (no administrators would need to know sql maintenance, as they dont know databases in my target environment). Maybe storing in xml files or.. something else. How others would go if ease of administration is the main goal? Oh and it should be secure to, the client server data must be a bit secure (maybe NTLM files shares https or...etc) Maybe I should say something of the use, it would be like client ask for a single record and retrieves an answer a single byte is returned those clients won't launch complex questions, only the maintenance server side might require record editing, clients will only ask not change records. And clients wont perform advanced queries.
