I have a list like this:               rew={{{2011, 3, 13, 0, 0, 0}, 1044.4}, {{2011, 3, 13, 3, 0, 0}, Missing["NotAvailable"]},      {{2011, 3, 13, 3, 0, 0}, 1044.7}, {{2011, 3, 13, 6, 0, 0}, 1043.4},      {{2011, 3, 13, 9, 0, 0},1041.5}, {{2011, 3, 13, 12, 0, 0}, 1044.1},      {{2011, 3, 13, 15, 0, 0}, 1045.4}, {{2011, 3, 13, 18, 0, 0}, 1046.8},      {{2011, 3, 13, 21, 0, 0}, 1047.5},.....}      How do I delete duplicated sublists? From this list I want to delete                {{2011, 3, 13, 3, 0, 0}, Missing["NotAvailable"]}, {{2011, 3, 13, 3, 0, 0}, 1044.7}      this sublists which have duplicates because the first part is the same. And also delete duplicates if I face the duplicates
