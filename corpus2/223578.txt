I have a JSON API that includes some discusssions. I want to build a static html site on another server, pages that are built from data on that API. I am more comfortable using Rails than Node. The API is done in Node. The idea is that I periodically call the JSON api to get the data, and dynamically build the html pages on the Rails server. This way the web pages would be super fast, wouldn't have to call the JSON API. One technology that looks like it would do the job is http://middlemanapp.com/, but I haven't used it before. Anybody done this before and have any suggestions? My preference is to use Rails, and Heroku.
