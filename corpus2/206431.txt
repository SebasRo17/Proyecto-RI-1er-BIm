I'm a Java developer with a bit more than a year of experience which places me somewhere above a junior, but not among mid-level developers yet. Recently I was offered a long-term project which is about studying an existing banking application code for 4 months and then introducing changes when needed. As a not-so-experienced programmer I'm looking for ways to develop and I wonder what such a project might give. Would you consider dealing with a big and probably not-so-well written application a good practice for a beginner?
