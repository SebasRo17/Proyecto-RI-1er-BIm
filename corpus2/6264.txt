Some of the built-in Stylesheets (e.g. _PastelColor_ ) connect together input and output cells by setting the `CellFrame` and `CellMargins` of the bottom of the input cell and the top of the output cell to zero. However, when there is no output the input cell looks ugly because it is missing the bottom part of its frame. There is a style defined in the Stylesheet called _InputOnly_ which has a full frame and looks much better, but I have to apply it manually with the Format/Style menu (select Other and type "InputOnly" into the input field). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MJ6Cs.png) Is there a way to get Mathematica to automatically use the _InputOnly_ style for input cells with no corresponding output?
