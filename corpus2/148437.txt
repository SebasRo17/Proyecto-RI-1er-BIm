I have found a small oss project (one file) in someone's blog a few months ago. The license is "Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic". I sent a mail to the author if I can put this in github but got no response back. Meanwhile his blog has been shut down. I am not a lawyer, but this seems legal to republish the code (with appropriate attribution) in github. Am I right? Is this moral? Maybe the guy just wants to disappear for a while...
