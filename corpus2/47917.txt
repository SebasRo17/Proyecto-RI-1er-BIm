I am wondering how I could determine the frequency of oscillations of a differential model equation? How could I find the frequency from this example given in _Mathematica_ Documentation:               s = NDSolve[{y'[x] == y[x] Cos[x + y[x]], y[0] == 1}, y, {x, 0, 30}]     Plot[Evaluate[y[x] /. s], {x, 0, 30}, PlotRange -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ofHF.png) I am asking because I need to determine the frequency of one model term as a function of a the strength of a second model term, in a much more complicated model than described above.
