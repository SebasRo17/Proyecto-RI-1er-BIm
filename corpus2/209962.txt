I am working on a PHP code and as it grows getting more and more tired of repeating the same standard pattern again and again and again:               class BolerPlate     {         protected $property1;         protected $property2;         ...              public function __construct ($property1, $property2, ...)         {             $this->property1 = $property1;             $this->property2 = $property2;             ...         }     }      So I am re-typing here each property name 4 (!) times just to get the standard setup! In each class! It doesn't look elegant nor DRY to me. And re-typing the same names creates more bug opportunities. I wonder if there is any more elegant way or best practices to get the same setup with a code easier on the eyes :) EDIT. What I have in mind is some sort of factory method where I can supply the list of properties only once each. Or using variable variables and iterate over all properties?
