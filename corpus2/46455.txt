Good evening , I have a matrix 20x20 in symbolic form. The matrix depends on 5 parameters (a,b,c,d,e). I would like to get the interval of each parameters that ensures that the matrix S is symmetric positive definite. Should I first compute the symbolic expression of the eigenvalues and then solve a system of 20 inequalities to find the interval of the 5 parameters? Or can I do it directly with some Mathematica command? Thank you.
