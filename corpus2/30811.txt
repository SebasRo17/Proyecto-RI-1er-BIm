I have a number of computers which all might need to use the same (client) configuration for the Wolfram Lightweight Grid at some point. I know that there are ways to programmatically set certain front-end options with commands akin to               SetOptions[$FrontEnd, RenderingOptions -> {"HardwareAntialiasingQuality" -> 1}]      as in this question. My question is: are there similar commands which, when I evaluate them on a given computer will set the Local->Lightweight Grid preference pane? That is, I would love to have a notebook that I could distribute to my colleagues that contained code like               SetOptions[Something, LookForKernelsAt->IPAddress(es)OfTheComputer(s)RunningLightweightGrid]      that would configure their computers correctly and through Mathematica restarts (ie. so that they only have to evaluate the code one time). Is this possible? Do such commands exist? I have been trying to understand what is provided in the `LightweightGridClient` and `Parallel``Developer` contexts but nothing seems to fit the bill.
