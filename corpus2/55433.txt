I'm new in _Mathematica_ 10. So far, I have a two variable-function and I've use Minimize to find the optimal solution. Nevertheless, I'd like to make a sensibility analysis and study how this optimal solution behaves, doing a "For" cycle changing some coefficient of this function and keeping all the optimal solution in a table or matrix. Is that possible to do? I've tried using a For cycle but I don't know how to save the optimal value in an auxiliary variable. For instance :               Table[NMinimize[{a x + b y, 0.2 x + 0.1 y >= 14, 0.25 x + 0.6 y >= 30,          0.1 x + 0.15 y >= 10, x >= 0, y >= 0}, {x, y}][[2]], {a, 0, 3, 1}, {b, 0, 3, 1}]      Does anyone one how to save all of the X and Y Values in only 2 columns? I'd like to associate those columns to de corresponding value of a and b
