I would need some (a lot of) help to improve/rewrite some code. Since my real problem is a bit too complicated to explain, I try to show with a simplified scheme what I want to achieve. I create some random numbers on an interval between 0 and 1 with:               maximumRandomNumberFirstStep=10000;     randomNumberFirstStep=RandomReal[{0,1},maximumRandomNumberFirstStep];      Out of some reasons, I am only interested in values which are higher than a special limit value. So, I am searching for these values with:               limitValue=0.5;     helpListFirstStep=ParallelTable[If[randomNumberFirstStep[[i]]<limitValue,i,0],        {i,1,maximumRandomNumberFirstStep}];      For all values which are lower than this limit value I want to generate some new random numbers. At the moment I am doing this with:               maximumRandomNumberSecondStep=maximumRandomNumberFirstStep-Count[helpListFirstStep,0];     randomNumberSecondStep=RandomReal[{0,1},maximumRandomNumberSecondStep];      Now I want to add the new random numbers (randomNumberSecondStep) to all the old random numbers (randomNumberFirstStep) which are below my limit value. I am doing this with this very ugly code:               j=1;     randomNumberSecondStep2=Table[If[         helpListFirstStep[[i]]==0,         {randomNumberFirstStep[[i]],0},         {randomNumberFirstStep[[i]]+randomNumberSecondStep[[j]],j++}     ],{i,1,maximumRandomNumberFirstStep}];     randomNumberSecondStep2=randomNumberSecondStep2[[All,1]];      (By the way, this code does only work with `Table` but not with `ParallelTable` if I execute it more than once. Perhaps somebody has also a solution for that). If one creates a histogram `Histogram[randomNumberSecondStep2]`, it can be seen, that there are still values which are below my limit value. So, I have to copy my code from above, rename Second to Third and execute it again. I am doing this so often until none of my `randomNumberNthStep2`-values are below my limit value. This works, but I think it cannot be programed worse than I am doing it (copying, renaming etc. is really not nice, especially if your real problem is more complicated because of more variables). So, how can I write a better program in which all the copying and renaming steps can be avoided? I think there should be a solution in which all these steps are executed automatically. Unfortunately, my programing skills are too low to develop a nice solution. But I hope that some people here can give some help and hints. I would appreciate every support!
