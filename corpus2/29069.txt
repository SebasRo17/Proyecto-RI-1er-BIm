I have a list say:               m = {1, 2, 3}      The list is inside a package, and is the result of a calculation. I want to give the user the option to rename it, for example with an input:               new = Input["enter a new name"]      I have not enough experience, but I tried in several ways and failed. The most obvious failure is to make:               new -> m      I cannot define `new` as a list prior to this assignment. On the other hand, I cannot define the name of a list as a vector with super-index or sub-index, for example:               v^i_; j = {1, 2, 3}      Can somebody help me?
