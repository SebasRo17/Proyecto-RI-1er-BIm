I am a sole developer working with an offshore employer. I do realize the importance of unit testing (although haven't practiced before) but currently, the code hasn't ever been tested. The problem with the code is that it isn't what I call "been moduled well", some parts are really messy, extensive use of globals and the code doesn't really show loose coupling. If I am not wrong, the code might require heavy refactoring before being able to be unit tested. Also, it seems the employer, isn't quite interested in testing. He rather suggests to spend this time in building features. So what I suggested to him is UI testing. Because UI testing is something we do every time, testing features, clicking, checking if something is not broke, it made sense to both of us to use it to automate the process of checking features and save us time. Since I have never done UI testing before, I don't know what possible disadvantages might be associated with using just UI testing alone or will it be much beneficial at all?
