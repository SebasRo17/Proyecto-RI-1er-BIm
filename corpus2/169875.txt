Is there a 'design pattern' styled listing of common/popular algorithms anywhere? Specifically, something that has a similar format along the lines of: **Algorithm Name:** e.g., Quick Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.   **Problem:** A description of the stereotypical problem the algorithm is supposed to address   **Description:** Description of the solution   **Implementation:** Code examples of the solution   **Big O Rating:** Self-explanatory   **Similar Algorithms:** Algorithms that address the same problem in different ways, or similar problems I really like the GoF design pattern listing style, and I think it would help me learn various algorithms better/easier if I could find a resource that was similar in terms of organization.
