I have a code that I am running on a supercomputer. Currently the algorithm must finish before I can export any results from the algorithm. What I would like to do is to have the algorithm write out the results for every nth line of the loop. Could someone help me write this into the algorithm below. I currently use the Reap and Sow construct to store the data and collect it all at the end. Sometimes the code crashes for during the run, in which cases I get nothing out of the run before it stops. If I could also write to a file while the code is running, at least I'd have better starting points to begin the next run. Thanks!                      If[             u[[i]] < v[[i]],(*If u<v always accept that parameter set,             else accept with probability u<v*)                  ka[[i + 1]] = ka[[i]];             kb[[i + 1]] = kb[[i]];             Sow[{True, decayscore[[i]], v[[i]], ka[[i]], kb[[i]], i}],            (* These quantities are written to bestParamSets *)                  ka[[i]] = ka[[i - 1]];             kb[[i]] = kb[[i - 1]];             ],            ka[[i]] = ka[[i - 1]];            kb[[i]] = kb[[i - 1]]            ],
