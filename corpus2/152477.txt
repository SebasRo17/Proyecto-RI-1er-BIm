I was reading this article. It has the following paragraph. > And did Scala turn out to be fast? Well, what’s your definition of fast? > About as fast as Java. It doesn’t have to be as fast as C or Assembly. > Python is not significantly faster than Ruby. We wanted to do more with > fewer machines, taking better advantage of concurrency; we wanted it to be > compiled so it’s not burning CPU doing the wrong stuff. I am looking for the meaning of the last sentence. How will interpreted language make the CPU do "wrong" stuff ?
