In MATLAB, I can save and recall my own function using an M-File(function or script)   How can I do something similar in _Mathematica_? I already searched and know how to define functions and modules like the following:               f[x_]:=Sin[x]+Cos[x]       g[x_]:=Module[{a}, a*f[x]]      When I restart _Mathematica_ , however, my own function is deleted. Of course, I can save my notebook(.nb) file, but it is just saving my script, not saving my definition of the function. How can I deal with this problem?
