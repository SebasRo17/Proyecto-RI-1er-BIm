> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Get a “step by step” evaluation in Mathematica I have a list of inequalities combined with quantifiers. And _Mathematica_ is able to reduce to simple statement with the `Reduce[]` command , is it possible to see how it comes up with it.               Reduce[Exists[{p, \[Eta], \[Theta]}, \[Eta] (p - 1) < 1/     2 && \[Lambda] p < 2 && (1 - \[Lambda]) p/(p - 1) <      e && \[Theta] (1 - \[Lambda]) p/(p - 1) < 1/2 + \[Eta] &&      0 < \[Lambda] < 1 && 1 < p &&      e > 0 && \[Theta] >      0 && ((1/2 - \[Eta]) (1 + 1/(e - (1 - \[Lambda]) p/(p - 1))) <        1 || (1/2 - \[Eta]) (1 +           1/(e - (1 - \[Lambda]) p/(p -                  1))) < \[Theta] e)], {\[Lambda], e}, Reals]      Thanks!
