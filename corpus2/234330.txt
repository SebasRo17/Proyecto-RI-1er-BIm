Reposting here... hopefully the better place to seek opinions on the matter. :) Writing my own log4net wrapper class using C#. I want to create a lib such that I can reference it from any project/assembly in a given solution with a minimum of effort. ie: include the reference, maybe throw in a using statement and then make calls like MyLogger.Debug(blahblah); with perhaps a property (MyLogger) being set from a "main" method somewhere. From reading the docs, I'm not sure if I should be writing my own or using LogImpl? The latter seems to include all of what I'd want to put in my own wrapper, so, why reinvent the wheel? But, there is also a note in the help that says thast an instance member of type logimpl is not thread safe whereas a static member is... OTOH, if I make my own, I'd be looking at a singleton class I can create once and use throughout my solution (by passing the singleton ref to objects which require it) but I gotta rewrite all those Debug, Error, etc sections. So... not sure what approach to take. What would you folks suggest as a beginning?
