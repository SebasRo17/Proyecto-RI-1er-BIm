I am working on software for some scientific instrumentation. An embedded computer running Windows 7 is inside the instrument, which controls various components of the device; cameras, motors, thermometers, etc. I've written a basic interface in WPF/C# and use remote desktop to test the application. (Reason is safety, the instrument will be used in high radiation areas). What I want: A server runs on the embedded PC. The user accesses a web page at 192.168.x.x (Internet access would be nice, but not necessary) and clicks 'collect data' and the server loads the relevant C# .dll's, acquires data and uploads the data to the user. Speed/scalability is not much of a concern, as data acquisition could take anywhere from minutes to days. What I'm confused about: How do I go about executing my existing C# code from a web application? i.e., which .NET technology(ies) should I look into using?
