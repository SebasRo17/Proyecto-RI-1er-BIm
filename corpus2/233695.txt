Considering I have a `for` loop in a method of a class. Should the incremented variable be declared as `member of the class`, or should it be declared `in the method` it uses it(or even in the `for` loop, directly)? While declaring it inside the method seems easier and cleaner, doesn't declaring it at the start of the class makes you have more control over it? Something like declaring it `int var_used_for_loop_in_method_x`. What is good programming practice? Note that I'm not asking specifically for the `for` loop. I am asking if we should try to put most variables as class members as much as possible or not.
