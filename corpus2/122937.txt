recently I hired a freelancer to develop an iPhone application for my website, this application will get information from the DB of the website, normally I should give to him the access to the DB to take the information needed. The question is, how to let him take the information needed without safely, i.e preventing the danger from hacking or accessing to the DB of the website or do some modifications on it... What can I do ?
