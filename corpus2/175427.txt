I have an affiliate marketing client who needs to know if I can program this. Can I do one or both of the following scenarios without violating the GPL license? Scenario A: Make a software installer for a GPL licensed product which includes source, binaries, and license info. The installer also has a checkbox for installing optional software that's payware. (In this case, the payware is free crippleware, but has a registration upsell to provide more features.) The two products will not share libraries or anything else. Scenario B: Same as A, but reversed. So, the installer installs the payware, but there's a checkbox to also install the GPL software. And, again, when you install the GPL software, it comes with binaries, source, and license info.
