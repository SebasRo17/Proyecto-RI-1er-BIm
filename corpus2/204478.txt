Are there some best practices on the repository front, or some common newcomer-traps that I should avoid? I have recently been reading about the benefits of repositories even for single-developer projects and, in addition, I am likely to start working with multiple other engineers in a short while but, how do I go from never having used a repository to setting one up - for multiple people, even! **Background:** I am an electronics engineer before anything else, and while application programming has been part of that, it's never been something I've done a lot of - it has mainly been snippets of C for embedded systems where I was the only person working on it.
