I have several open-source projects, but I no longer have a license for Visual Studio. I heard that Resharper has some kind of deal for open-source project contributors. Is there something similar for Visual Studio? Thanks. * * * **EDIT**   ps: The main project I'm concerned about is DotNetZip. I use an open-source text editor now to modify the code and project files; and the project is hosted at CodePlex, which I can get to via the "free" Visual Studio TFS command-line tools. My main problem is that I can no longer design or run the tests I've put into the code. I know there is Nunit and other alternative testing frameworks, but the code is already instrumented for MSTest (I guess that's what it is) and I'd like to keep the testing stable if possible. **EDIT2** I know about DreamSpark but I am not a student. Just a developer of an open- source project. **EDIT3** I guess a better question might be, _what's the lowest-cost option for me, an individual open-source developer, to license Visual Studio so that I can run tests on my project?_
