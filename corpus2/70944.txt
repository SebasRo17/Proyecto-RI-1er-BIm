I have no formal education in computer science (I am a mathematician), and I recently discovered that well-made videos make for decent substitutes of actual lectures. I'm looking for advice about some nice video lectures, but I have a more specific requirement than this question. Namely, many videos I found online do not make use of the blackboard and use a still camera. In these videos you just see the teacher talking and pointing at something that may be projected on the overhead, but you have no way to tell. Often there are slides to follow, but these are not a great help. Instead lectures like SICP or this course on Channel 9 make use of blackboards and have undergone a proper video editing, which ensures that you always see the relevant slides. This makes an enormous difference with respect to still camera lectures, which I find mostly unuseful. I can easily Google for lectures, but I need the help from people that actually followed them to find the relevant ones. I am mostly interested in the following topic, in descending order:   1. Compilers and interpreters   2. Operating systems   3. (Advanced) data structures and algorithms   4. Networks and protocols I don't really mind for the language used for the course, but in case I speak (at various levels) PHP, Javascript, Python, Scheme, C and Haskell. Even better if the courses proceed at a high pace. I generally learn rather quickly, but I do not have much spare time.
