Instead of TV, I prefer to watch (free) on-line conferences or videos. As a software developer, my favorites are:   * InfoQ   * MSDN Channel 9   * Google TechTalks   * LinkedIn TechTalks   * TED   * Business Of Software blog (I like entrepreneurship too) Maybe I'm losing other valuable sources (about software and startups) of these kind of content. So, can you suggest other specialized sites like these?
