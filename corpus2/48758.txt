I want to solve the differential equation:               DSolve[{R''[ρ] + 2 /ρ R'[ρ] + (1 - (l (l + 1))/ρ^2) R[ρ] == 0}, R[ρ], ρ]      This works fine and outputs:               {{R[ρ] -> C[1] SphericalBesselJ[l, ρ] + C[2] SphericalBesselY[l, ρ]}}       But when I add the condition:               R[0] ==0      i.e.               DSolve[{R''[ρ] + 2 /ρ R'[ρ]] + (1 - (l (l + 1))/ρ^2) R[ρ] == 0,     R[0] == SphericalBesselJ[1, 0]}, R[ρ], ρ]      The output is:               { }      Why is this the case?
