I think the following two-dimensional integrals should be equal, since they both integrate the function over the half plane defined by $t>\tau$. $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}t \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}\tau f(t,\tau) =\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}\tau \int_{\tau}^\infty \mathrm{d}t f(t,\tau) $$ However, when I take the following numerical integral in these two different ways, I get two different answers (only one of which matches my analytic solution).               integrand = Exp[I x1 t-I x2 τ-τ^2/(2 σ^2)] /. {x1 -> 1.0 + .1I, x2 -> 1.2, σ -> 0.1};     NIntegrate[integrand, {t, -∞, ∞}, {τ, -∞, t}]     (* 0.201597 + 0.107977 I *)          NIntegrate[integrand, {τ, -∞, ∞}, {t, τ, ∞}]     (* 0.0247648 + 0.248149 I *)      Any idea why this is the case? edit: The problem is not only with `NIntegrate`, but is reproduced by `Integrate` as well. Running               integrand = Exp[I x1 t-I x2 τ-τ^2/(2 σ^2)];     Integrate[integrand,  {τ, -∞, ∞}, {t, τ, ∞},Assumptions->Re[σ^2]>0&&Im[x1]>0]      gives $\frac{i \sqrt{2 \pi } \sigma e^{-\frac{1}{2} \sigma ^2 (\text{x1}-\text{x2})^2}}{\text{x1}}$ for an answer, which matches what I got when I worked it by hand. But if I do it with the original integration limits               integrand = Exp[I x1 t-I x2 τ-τ^2/(2 σ^2)];     Integrate[integrand, {t, -∞, ∞}, {τ, -∞, t},Assumptions->Re[σ^2]>0&&Im[x1]>0]      the evaluation hangs, and eventually the kernel stops working if I don't `Abort`. For some reason, the integral can only be evaluated properly both ways if exact numbers are used in defining `integrand`, as pointed out in Mr.Wizard's answer. I would still like to find out why this is such a tricky integral for Mathematica to do one way but not the other.
