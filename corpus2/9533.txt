I ran a solve to evaluate a few linear equations,               Solve[{some eqns},{A0,B0,c0,d0,e0}]       and then in the output I got:               {{A0-> stuff+ 1/rho F (stuff) , B0->..,...,e0->..}}.       Now when when I selected, copied and pasted the expression I got for _A0_. I wound up getting :               stuff+ 1/rhoF (stuff)      My subsequent `ContourPlot` was giving me nothing and it took me the longest time to notice that two of my variables, $\rho$ and `F` had been made into a new variable `rhoF` somehow during the copy paste process. I've found this to be a bit unnerving. Is there some way to guarantee that this never happens? I've been doing `ctrl`-`C` and `ctrl`-`v`. Should I do "copy as" and pick one of the options to avoid this formatting issue. Right now I don't have two variables that might merge together to become an pre- existing variable, but if for example **rhoF** had indeed been something I had defined earlier, I would never have found out about this error and I would've been in deep trouble doing some corrupted analysis. Any help will be greatly appreciated. EDIT: I tried the replace rule /. but I still have the same problem. This is what I have actually done:               {{A0, B0, L0, M0, c0, S}} = {A0, B0, L0, M0, c0, S} /. Solve[{     A0*(H0D)^(k1) +  B0*(H0D)^(k2) + (delta/(delta + rho - r))*(H0D)      + u/rho-  c0*F/rho ==-CF,     k1*A0*(H0D)^(k1 - 1) + k2*B0*(H0D)^(k2 - 1) == -((delta)/(delta + rho - r)),     L0*(H0S)^(k1) + M0*(H0S)^(k2) + c0*F/r == F,     L0*(H0D)^(k1) + M0*(H0D)^k2 + c0*F/r == H0D - CFL,     L0*H1R^(k1) + M0*H1R^k2 + c0*F/r -CRL == H1R - CFL + gamma*S,     A0*(H1R)^(k1) + B0*(H1R)^(k2) + (delta/(delta + rho - r))*(H1R) +      u/rho - c0*F/rho -CR == -CF + (1 - gamma)*S}, {A0, B0, L0, M0, c0, S}]      and then when I tried to get the value for `shift`+`enter` A0, again rho and F were combined in line 16 to form rhoF. I tried to boldface it but I guess boldface does not work inside the code format.
