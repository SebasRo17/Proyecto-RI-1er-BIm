This seems to be a simple, but useful question. I am plotting a basic function:               multiplier = 10^11;     func = 10^-11 x^2;     Plot[func*multiplier, {x, 0, 5},        AxesLabel -> {x, "Distance, \!\(\*SuperscriptBox[\(10\), \(-11\)]\) m"}]      That gives the result I wish to see. Imagine now that I wish not to write the multiplier manually in `AxesLabel` when I change it. The inverse multiplier needs to be converted to a string with an exponent (so as to produce the same final appearance). I have tried the `ToString` function with some parameters. For example:               multiplier = 10^11;     func = 10^-11 x^2;     Plot[func*multiplier, {x, 0, 5},        AxesLabel ->          {x, "Distance, " <> ToString[multiplier^(-1), FormatType -> StandardForm] <> " m"}]      But I get an awful label.   1. Could you think of a solution to this problem?   2. Can anyone think of why conversion to real numbers by "N" is necessary and if not how can it be avoided?
