I have large 6x6 matrix `U`which is a multiplication of 15 rotational matrix. All of the elements are `Sin\\[theta]` and `Cos\\[Theta]`. I have to solve simultaneous equations using the matrix elements. Yesterday i ran the code for 14 hours with core i3 machine at windows 7. Still no output. I know that `Complie` can run code quicker but i am not an expert on this. So i need help. here is the code.I tried but failed to use complie here. how to use complie or how can i run the code faster?               Solve[U[[2,4]]==0.12 && U[[1,4]]==0.11 && U[[2,5]]==0.17 && U[[1,5]]==0.11 &&           U[[2,6]]==0.14 && U[[1,6]]==0.11 &&           U[[3,1]]==0    && U[[3,2]]==0    && U[[3,3]]==0    && U[[3,4]]==0    &&            U[[3,5]]==0    && U[[3,6]]==0,       {\[Theta]12, \[Theta]13, \[Theta]14, \[Theta]15, \[Theta]16, \[Theta]23, \[Theta]24,         \[Theta]25, \[Theta]26, \[Theta]34, \[Theta]35, \[Theta]36, \[Theta]45, \[Theta]46,         \[Theta]56}     ]
