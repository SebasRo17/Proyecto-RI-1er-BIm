I've started doing some research on the technologies that I will need for my website. I'm trying to implement a really simple website with OpenID user registration. The website will store a block of text for each user. I imagine this means that I will need a database with:   * User ID   * Open ID url   * Data Having said that, I'm still having trouble deciding what I really need to do this. I know that I will need the following for the actual site:   * Javascript   * JQuery   * CSS But on the back end, I'm kind of lost at the moment. I've been looking at the OpenID-Selector, which is coded in Javascript. It seems like it's exactly what is used on this site. Will I actually need PHP? MySQL for the data and user registration?
