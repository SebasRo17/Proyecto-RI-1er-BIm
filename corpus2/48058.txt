I have a dataset, where some data has to be ranked in regard to the number of ranking of the total dataset. I've made a simple example below:               names = {"Set A", "Set B", "Set C"};     values = {67, 80, 50};     {names, values} // Transpose      I would like to add a 3rd column, which described the rank of the total column. I've tried with `RankedMax` but without any luck. To be more exactly, the matrix below shows my problem, where the third column is ranking the highest to lowest value. $$\left( \begin{array}{ccc} \text{Set 1} & 67 & 2 \\ \text{Set 2} & 80 & 1 \\ \text{Set 3} & 50 & 3 \\ \end{array} \right)$$ How can create such a column?
