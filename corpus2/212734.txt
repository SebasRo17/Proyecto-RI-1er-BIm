Sometimes when I create an API that should enable getting a single value or all values I use the following pattern (passing `NULL` to the API, means get all rows): @Usernames - comma separeted list of users               CREATE PROC GetUsers (@Usernames VARCHAR(100) = NULL)     AS     BEGIN         SELECT *         FROM Users         Where @Usernames IS NULL OR dbo.in_list(@Usernames,Username) = 1      END      Is this a good practice to use the OR condition the get both functionalities, or should i write something like this:               CREATE PROC GetUsers (@Usernames VARCHAR(100) = NULL)     AS     BEGIN         IF(@Username IS NULL)         BEGIN             SELECT *             FROM Users         END         ELSE         BEGIN             SELECT *             FROM Users             Where dbo.in_list(@Usernames,Username) = 1          END     END      * **Note:** This is only SQL for example, **this is not a specific coding language question**. Thanks.
