I am writing a game in C++ which has different enemy types. I have defined a base **_Enemy_** class and I also have derived classes **_enemy1_** , **_enemy2_** etc. Now for updating these enemies in each iteration of the game, I want to have an array: **_EnemyArray_** with its elements pointing to the existing enemies so that I can make sure to update them all with their own version of **_update()_** , etc. One way of doing this, would be to define separate arrays for each enemy type and that would be a clean way of solving the problem. However, I was wondering if the fact that these enemy classes are all derived from the same base class makes it possible to somehow have my EnemyArray as an array of **_Enemy_** 's and do some modifications later.
