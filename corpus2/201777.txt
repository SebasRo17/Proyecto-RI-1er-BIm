I am a bit puzzled on whenever or not to include `break` after the last case, often `default`.               switch (type) {         case 'product':                  // Do behavior                  break;         default:                  // Do default behavior                  break; // Is it considered to be needed?     }      `break`s sole purpose is in my understanding to stop the code from running through the rest of the `switch`-case. Is it then considered more logical to have a `break` last due to consistency or skip having it due to the `break` applying no functional use whatsoever? Both are logical in different ways in my opinion. This could to a certain degree be compared with ending a `.php` file with `?>`. I never end with `?>` mostly due to the risk of outputting blank spaces, but one could argue that it would be the logical thing to end the file with.
