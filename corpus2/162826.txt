Can anyone name any usefull strategy/architectural pattern for allocating actions between different controllers when using MVC pattern for developing web application? I am now developing web app using asp.net Mvc3 framework and still can't figure out how to manage actions and controllers. One approach is to create single action controller for each url, but it's not the best choice since to much controllers have to be created. Should I list all available urls that are supported by me web app, devide them into groups and create separate controller for each group or act in any different manner? It seems like I will become face to face with some kind of mess with no consistent approach in managing actions and controllers.
