I'm making an iPad app that will display a few choices and based on your choice will display a series of questions with each question triggering a different set of questions. I was wondering if there was a name for this or any open-source library that someone has made for this kind of app. If not, would it be best to hard code all the questions and responses into the app, or to read them from a file?
