public final class ImmutableClass {              private StringBuffer name;              public ImmutableClass(StringBuffer name) {             this.name=name;         }         public StringBuffer getName() {             return name;         }     }      Points that I have considered:   1. Make the class `final` so that it cannot be extended   2. Do not provide `public` mutator methods   3. Keep the instance variables `private` Are the above mentioned considerations sufficient?
