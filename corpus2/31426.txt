I need to use the features of the Summa package but it doesn't work in _Mathematica_ 9\. It gives the error               Cannot open Utilities`FilterOptions`      My question is: Is there an alternative (more modern) package with similar features, or a way to make `Summa.m` work in _Mathematica_ 9? * * * Following @Nasser I solved it. The problem was that the input of `FilterRules` is in opposite order, e.g.               FilterOptions[Expand,{opts}]      is changed to               Sequence@@FilterRules[{opts},Options@Expand]
