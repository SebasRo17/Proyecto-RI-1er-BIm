This is a badly titled question...maybe a moderator can make it better. Nearly two decades ago, I took a computer graphics class as an undergraduate. We got to do whatever we wanted for a final project as long as it demonstrated what we learned about CG. So, I read a book (I can't think of the name at all) that described a methodology to generate fractal images starting with a simple shape and mutating it using substitution. It described abstract fractals and tree/flower fractals. I do recall implementing the Sierpinski Triangle in one of my sample imputs as well as a 3D tree. The input to the program was basically a series of arbitrary symbols defined by the program. `-----=` might represent a rose. Then you apply some substitutions for a given pattern. `--= > -+=---=` might represent a longer rose with thorns. So, applying that pattern to the initial string you get `----+=---=`. Finally you loop over this string `N` number of times to create some desired effect. The book itself offered a ton of inputs with sample pictures, but no actual source code. The implementation was completely left up to the developer. I would like to know if somebody can help me with the terminology for this technique and bonus points for the name of the book (or a book) that described this process?
