I defined a function, `solve`, with a free variable n, which changes while `solve` is running. Therefore, evaluating               Dynamic[n]          solve[];      allows me to see the changes. But when I put `solve` into any sort of interface element like a button, I dont see n changing. Even if I evaluate               Dynamic[n]          bn = 0;     Dynamic[If[bn === 1, {bn = 0, solve[x]}]]          bn = 1;      I only see n change when the evaluation of `solve` is complete. What do I need to do to be able to observe changes to n as they happen? ### Edit With this, I see n change as evaluation progresses:               n = 0; solve[] :=  Do[n += 1, {1000000}]; Dynamic[n]; solve[]      With this, I only see n change at the end when it reaches 1000000:               bn = 0; Dynamic[If[bn === 1, {solve[], bn = 0}]]; bn = 1;
