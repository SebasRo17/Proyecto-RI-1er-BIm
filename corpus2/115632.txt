I am looking for some advices, resources or articles about how to expose a Platform API to outside developers. My main concern is what is the standards or best approach to do that, basically I have a set of REST API services of the platform and need to understand how to address the following issus :   * API Hosting and Management in general (should we use online api management tools like apigee or mashrey?)   * Developer Keys, permissions   * Developer tools, documentations   * throttling   * Reporting   * Logging/Auditing   * Authentication and Authorization It is also great if you can point out to some articles that explain how Facebook or Twitter or Google are doing this, or abstract architecture and management best practices on how to open Platform API to the public users. Thanks,
