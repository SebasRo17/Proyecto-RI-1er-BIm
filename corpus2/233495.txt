Does it have any legal merit to put a copyright comment on each class. Example:               //     // MyClass.h     // Companyname     // Created by DeveloperName on MM/DD/YY     // Copyright YYYY Companyname. All rights reserved.     //     public class MyClass { ... }      Or does it have the same effect as putting a license file in the root of the source code, like many do on github.
