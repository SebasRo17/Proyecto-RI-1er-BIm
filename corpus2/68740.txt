The danger of ever suggesting some feature on a product, especially open source, is that you'll get the response, "why don't you do it?". That's valid, and it's cool that you can make the change yourself. But we know practically that products do often improve as programmers listen to the voice of users — even if those users are other programmers. And, the efficient way to make those changes can include someone who's already working on the project taking up the idea and implementing it. There are some common terms used to refer to software development problems. e.g. Bikeshedding. Is there a common term used that essentially replies, "Yes, I know that I can change just about anything in the world — even closed source. I could get hired, and go write that code. But in this case I'm just making an observation that may in fact be useful for another coder already well suited to easily make that change — or just generally discussing possibilities." [p.s. (a few days in) - I should have pointed out that "submit a patch" is often said with wry humor, and I'm seeking an appropriate witty response. ;)]
