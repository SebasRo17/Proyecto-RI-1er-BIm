When the coupon calculation end date falls on a holiday, it is customary to delay the coupon payment to the next working day. E.g. a bond may have a monthly coupon calculation period of 2013 Jul 18 to 2013 Aug 18 (Sunday), the actual payment is delayed to 2013 Aug 19 (Mon). The price of the bond should depend on the actual payment date of Aug 19. How do I achieve this using `FinancialBond`?
