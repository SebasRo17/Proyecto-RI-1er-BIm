I am sure some else has experienced the problem of documentation regarding unit tests. I was wondering if anyone has used javadocs with their unit testing to generate their own internal javadoc files to keep track and document their unit tests? If so, did you find it successful? Or you think this a bad way to document unit tests, please let me know. If you have any suggestion for a better way for unit test documentation, it would be greatly appreciated.
