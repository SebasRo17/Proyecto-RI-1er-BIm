I tend to use a lot of subscripts in my code, and I am aware that copy and paste of subscripts from Mathematica to MathematicaSE (or any text editor, for that matter) is screwy in the sense that $a_b$ copies to MathematicaSE as               Subscript[a, b]      which when pasted back into Mathematica yields `Subscript[a, b]`. This is quite different behavior than Greek or other special symbols; for example, $\Lambda$ copies into MathematicaSE as               \[CapitalLambda]      which when pasted back into Mathematica correctly yields $\Lambda$. The same applies even for more obscure symbols, like `\\[WhiteBishop]`. Is there any way at all to have subscripts correctly copy and paste from notebook to text to notebook like all the other special symbols in Mathematica? Or is there no choice but to use infix symbols, like `a[b]`?
