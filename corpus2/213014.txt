Recently I have started experimenting with some of the newer W3C specifications such as WebGL and the Web Audio API that are not yet widely supported in browsers. As I want my page to look professional, I need a way to treat the unsupported browsers gracefully. Now I was wondering:   * Is there a standard or a guideline that details what a person should see when their browser does not support a certain page?    * Are there any pitfalls I should look out for when implementing a not-supported-message?    * And considering the extremely fast pace browsers release new, updated versions, how can I ensure that my script still works in future browser versions that actually do have the previously unsupported feature without blocking them?
