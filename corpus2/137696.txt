> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do I improve my coding skills? I was asked this ( _What is the best way to stay on the cutting edge of Software Engineering?_ ), and it's really bothered me that I didn't have a good answer. There are really two parts to this question:   1. Where is a good place (websites - magazines) to go to learn about emerging technologies, frameworks, design principles, etc?    2. How can I get a good feel on which emerging technologies will be adopted by "the industry?"  I realize the second will be harder than the first since no one has a crystal ball, but any advice would be welcomed.
