I wanted to ask this question so that I can come back to it and have it serve as a **constant reminder** for me. Throughout my life, I've had milestones where I've sat down and really evaluated myself. Every time I've found something negative I've striven to put it right. One of those negatives is pride or arrogance. Sadly the nature of programming leads to plenty of fuel to endlessly fill one's own ego. Can you give me any words of wisdom that can serve as a reminder for me to **"eat humble pie"**? I want to keep my arrogance in check, even if that arrogance is the weight of a grain of sand.
