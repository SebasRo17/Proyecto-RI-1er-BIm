I am making a directed graph, but Mathematica keeps trying to evaluate my labels. I know that I can just use " ", but I have a lot of input. Is there a way to turn evaluation off?               LayeredGraphPlot[{"C1.4.4" -> "T1.5.7", "1.23" -> "L1.5.4",        "P1.4.3" -> "C1.4.4", "P1.4.3" -> "C1.1.4", "P1.1.9" -> "P1.5.2",        "P1.1.9" -> "L1.5.3", "P1.5.2" -> "T1.5.7", "L1.5.3" -> "T1.5.7",        "L1.5.4" -> "T1.5.7", "P1.5.5" -> "T1.5.7", "L1.4.6" -> "L1.4.7"},       VertexLabeling -> True]
