I have a series of endoscopic images taken by two cameras at the same time. A color image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/n74Fl.jpg) and a fluorescent image indicating cancerous cells ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/porNw.jpg) I now want to overlay the two images to indicate the cancer in the color image.               ImageCompose[img1, {img2, 0.35}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KKuzq.jpg) you can see that it does not match exactly. I need a way to match both images. Another problem is, sometimes the color camera zoomed a little in while the fluorescent image does not. In the fluorescent image everything but the bright area should be omitted. The color image is the basis and the fluoro image should be fitted to it, preferably in some false coloring. Here are two corresponding images: pair 1               im1col=Import["http://i.imgur.com/shzDETI.jpg"]     im1fluo=Import["http://i.imgur.com/Yh9iAXH.jpg"]      pair2               im2col=Import["http://i.imgur.com/ZnUJFrv.jpg"]     im2fluo=Import["http://imgur.com/VHlrpNj.jpg"]
