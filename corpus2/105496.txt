I'm working on an enterprise LOB software. The next piece that will be added to the system is document management. Most entities throughout the system will have documents attached to them. I clearly see the need to organize, search, share, upload and scan documents. I was wondering if a document management system with the following requirements exists:   1. Not a monster (not Sharepoint, etc)   2. Easily embeddable, my environment is .NET Silverlight   3. No royalties. Preferably just pay for it once and use it as custom controls, etc. I bet such an animal exists as I don't want to reinvent the wheel.. Thanks!
