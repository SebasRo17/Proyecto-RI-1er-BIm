Assume that I have **library X** which contains **class A** with **method b** and that library X is realeased under **GPL licence**.               public class A {       public void b() {          // this is an example of b method's body. But assume that the body of method b           // is very complex          System.out.println("operation a");          System.out.println("operation b");          System.out.prinltn("operation c");        }         }      Assume that I am using library X and that I need a behaviour similar to the behaviour of the method b but with one addtition which I cannot achieve by simple extension of class A and overriding some of theirs methods. **The first question is:** May I extend class A and override method b in shown below way and is it really still allowed by the GPL licence.               public class AExt extends A {       public void b() {          // this is an example of b method's body. But assume that the body of method b           // is very complex          System.out.println("operation a");          System.out.println("operation b");          doOperationINeed();          System.out.prinltn("operation c");        }         }      **The 2nd question is:** Which from the common used opensource licences allow such extension and which do not?
