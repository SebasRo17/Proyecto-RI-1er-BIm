Am I wrong if I think that Python is all I need to master, in order to solve most of the common programming tasks? **EDIT** I'm not OK with learning new programming languages if they don't teach me new concepts of programming and problem solving; hence the idea behind mastering a modern, fast evolving, with a rich set of class libraries, widely used and documented, and of course has a "friendly" learning curve programming language. I think that in the fast evolving tech industry, specialization is key to success.
