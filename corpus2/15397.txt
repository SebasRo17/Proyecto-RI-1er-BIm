This morning I installed the trial version of Mathematica 9. After I discovered that `Export[]` is disabled in trial versions, I wanted to use my genuine Mathematica 8 again, but I discovered that the installer of MMA 9 apparently made MMA 8 a trial version too. When I try to re-register mma 8 it returns "You have already registered this product". I'm running the student version of Mathematica 8.0.4.0 on Ubuntu 12.10 (64-bit). **Question: How can I make Mathematica 8 fully functional again?**
