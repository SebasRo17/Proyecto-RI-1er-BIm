Recently reading the question What languages do you use without an IDE? One question asked in a few answers was "is Notepad++ and IDE?" One answers to the original question said "None, I use vim...", implying that vim is an IDE. But then another answer suggested vim isn't an IDE. So where is the line? What about notepad, ed, or nano? Is the only non-IDE coding technique the butterfly technique?
