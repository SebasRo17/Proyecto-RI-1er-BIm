I'm interested in implementing symmetry groups. So it would be useful to have central symmetry (isometry transformation). There are built-in functions: `RotationTransform`, `TranslationTransform` and `ReflectionTransform`, but I was not able to find something like central symmetry. The goal is to translate one object of any kind (image or built-in graphical primitives) into the symmetric analog to it. If anyone has any thoughts, please write!
