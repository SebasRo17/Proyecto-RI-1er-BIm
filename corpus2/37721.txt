Executing the following line,               Simplify[Div[Grad[-1/Sqrt[{x, y, z}.{x, y, z}], {x, y, z}], {x, y, z}]]      yields 0. However, this is incorrect, since $\nabla\cdot\nabla\left(|\mathbf{r}|^{-1}\right)=-4\pi\delta(\mathbf{r})$ in 3-space. I understand that this problem is coming from the fact that `Simplify` assumes $\mathbf{r}\neq\mathbf{0}$. However, I don't know how to coax Mathematica into giving the correct result without essentially having to resort to doing mathematics by hand, which kind of defeats the purpose of using a computer algebra system. In this case the result is obviously wrong so no harm is done, but for more complicated vector expressions I have no idea whether `Simplify` is going to give wrong answers without warning when applied to functions with spatial singularities. Is there any automated way to handle such singularities to give correct answers in Mathematica?
