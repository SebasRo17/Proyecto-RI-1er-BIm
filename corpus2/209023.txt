I have a requirement what seemingly looks very simple (and perhaps strange) but some minor details are giving me troubles. Perhaps I'm overthinking this. I'm building a scheduler application (on WPF) for an embedded device that runs everyday. The scheduler controls when the device can be turned on and off. For example, the embedded device can be scheduled to shut off every weekends and on any holidays, such as July 4th. So I went ahead and designed my datastructure to hold a datetime collection for holidays. Firstly, I don't need to store the time but apparently in C#, there's no other appropriate class that holds just dates. Second, I also don't need to store years but then I have no way of knowing whether it is a leap year or not. (For example, I can schedule the device to be shut off on every February 29th, but that date may not be available on a particular year.) I also need a way for the users to select a month/date. As far as I know, there's no appropriate UI control available to handle my problem. I think I need to look for something like this (Below is photoshopped from a standard calendar control): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XHyeW.jpg) What datastructure/design would you use to handle problems like this? What's a good UI design to have users intuitively select a month/date?
