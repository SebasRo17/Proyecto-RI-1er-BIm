When a client asks for an estimate on how long it would take to develop different sections of an app, is it best to give them a total amount or what it would take for each section? Is it better/more common to give a range of hours/days or just a single number? Do you think most clients feel that if a programmer says it should take 50 hours that they should be billed for 50 hours? If I say it would take 50 and it actually takes 60, do I tell them in advance that I'm going over on my estimate or just charge what was originally quoted?
