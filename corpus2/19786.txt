I made two `Polygons` with different colors. Their names are `p1` and `p2`.               p1Color = Red;     p2Color = Green;     w = 30;     h = 40;     l = 50;     p1 = Graphics3D[{p1Color,      Polygon[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, h, 0}, {w, h, 0}, {w, 0, 0}},        VertexTextureCoordinates -> {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}]},        Boxed -> False,       Lighting -> {{"Ambient", p1Color}},        RotationAction -> "Clip"];     p2 = Graphics3D[{p2Color,      Polygon[{{0, 0, l}, {0, h, l}, {w, h, l}, {w, 0, l}},        VertexTextureCoordinates -> {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}]},        Boxed -> False,       Lighting -> {{"Ambient", p2Color}},        RotationAction -> "Clip"];     {p1, p2, Show[{p1, p2}]}      The output is a list of three elements, p1, p2, and the output of `Show[{p1,p2}]`. The third element instead of lighting p1 an p2 with their indivdual colors mixes p2's colors with p1's colors. Any particular reason why is this is so? How do I overcome the mixing here? How can I specify the exact colors in the output of `Show`?
