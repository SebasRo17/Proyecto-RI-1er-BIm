I'm facing the right know the problem of building intervals to an arbitrary number. The special thing is that the first and the last intervals should have fixed length, while the "middle" ones should be of a fixed number. I think an example will make things more clear;-) We take the number 111, the first and the last 3 intervals should have the length 10, in between there should be 5 intervals. The solution would be: {{0,10},{10,20},{20,30},{30,40.2},{40.2,50.4},{50.4,60.6},{60.6,70.8},{70.8,81},{81,91},{91,101},{101,111}} I hope I made the problem understandable. Thank you! rainer
