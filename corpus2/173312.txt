I work within a team of developers. Everyone is making their changes without carrying too much if the same thing is already implemented in the codebase. This leads to classes constantly growing and to severe duplication. I want to add line items to class definitions from which a developer could judge what this class has.   * Would it help?   * How to do it in Visual Studio?   * If it wouldn't help, what would be the better alternative to encourage the developers to check if something exists before implementing it?
