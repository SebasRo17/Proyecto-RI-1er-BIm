I have a dynamic graph which changes depending on the current selection from a drop down box. All selections from the drop down box give fine results except one. For the one selection it shows the `y` axis in scientific notation. I understand that this is due to the values being large but I don't want this to happen. I also can't specify the `y` axis values manually, I need to use the `FrameTicks->Automatic` functionality. Is there any way to stop the y-axis ticks from displaying in scientific notation? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rUbhw.jpg)
