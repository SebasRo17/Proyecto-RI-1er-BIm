Our team uses the Ruby gem hitch to manage pairing. You set it up with a group email address (e.g. `dev@mycompany.com`) and then tell it who is pairing:               $ hitch james tiffany      Hitch then sets your Git author configuration so that our commits look like               commit 629dbd4739eaa91a720dd432c7a8e6e1a511cb2d     Author: James and Tiffany <dev+james+tiffany@mycompany.com>     Date:   Thu Oct 31 13:59:05 2013 -0700      Unfortunately, we've only been able to come up with two options:   1. `dev@mycompany.com` doesn't exist. The downside is that if Travis CI tries to notify us that we broke the build, we don't see it.   2. `Dev@mycompany.com` does exist and forwards to all the developers. Now the downside is that _everyone_ gets spammed with every broken build by every pair. We have too many possible pair to do any of the following:   1. set up actual `pair-james-tiffany@mycompany.com` email addresses or groups (n^2 email addresses)   2. set up forwarding rules for `dev+james+tiffany@mycompany.com` (n^2 forwarding rules)   3. set up forwarding rules for `james+tiffany@mycompany.com` (n forwarding rules for each of n developers) Does anyone have a system that works for them? ## EDIT I obviously missed a very important piece: we use GMail Business for all our company mail. We can add and remove users and groups, and users can create filters, but we don't have control over the MTA itself.
