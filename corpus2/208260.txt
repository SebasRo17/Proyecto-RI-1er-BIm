I have a console application that is run by taking the input parameters. It can be configured by passing report name parameter, for e.g. `reportgen.exe sales.xml`. It hits the database and retrieves the data into xml file and sends to sftp site. Whole of this process is logged and the `xml files` are being saved in a directory. This `exe` needs to be scheduled on daily basis, so what happens if the exe is scheduled at same time with different parameters. Is it thread safe and can be considered as independent execution doing what it supposed to do? **Edit:** It uses log4net for logging the debug info. into a file. So, how does it write log statements into single file for concurrent executions.
