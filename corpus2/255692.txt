I stumbled across polymorphic engines and I don't know anything about them. However, I am curious about how they are written. Every example that I've looked up writes them in assembly, my assembly is not good at all; I know just a few instructions here and there but not that well. On the other hand, I am good in C and C++. I am familiar with the concept of polymorphism in C++ but after reading about polymorphic engines, I am assuming that they are different from the polymorphism in C++. I'm just looking for simple code that shows encryption/decryption and/or obfuscation of code using C and/or C++ How can techniques such as using virtual keyword in C++ be used to obfuscate or encrypt the code in an application? NOTE: I was told to transfer this question from stackoverflow.com to this place.
