I really apologize if this doesn't follow the S.O rules but I need a little help, I personally still classify myself as a beginner in python, Yet I've wrote a very small and VERY SURE impractical program for my boss to use. I know I'm still a beginner because simple things still perplex me but every book I read for beginners honestly just rehashes what I do already know but every 'more advanced' book doesn't really allow me to learn, they depend on example files and I never really understand why they built 'said' function or 'said' class. So onto my question... Is there any recommendations on a book or ANYTHING that pushes me out of this stage, I've used head first and normally they are really good but my issue there is they have me back tracking just to move forward again, It worked in HTML but its confusing in Python, basically I think I need to build a program while following along, Again I like HeadFirst's style but I need something that isn't going to make me have to remember one thing just to forget it... for record, I've checked into some O'Reilly books
