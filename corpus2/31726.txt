Is there a way to find the numeric equivalents of `Tiny`, `Small`, `Medium`, and `Large` for for `ImageSize`? In other words, what are the integers `t`, `s`, `m`, and `l` such that, for `Graphics` objects, the directives               ImageSize -> t     ImageSize -> s     ImageSize -> m     ImageSize -> l      are equivalent, respectively, to the directives               ImageSize -> Tiny     ImageSize -> Small     ImageSize -> Medium     ImageSize -> Large      ?
