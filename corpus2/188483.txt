So, I am working on a project with a team and we are using Entity Framework. We basically want to use linq to entities, and not use stored procedures. I use quite a bit of lists and IEnumerables and so does everyone else. My question is, will converting the dataset produced by a stored procedure to an IEnumerable dramatically slow down the applications performance speed, say it parses through 1,000's of rows. Or would it be better to convert the store procedure to linq to entities(the procedure is a bit complex). We have not set up testing unit tests and integration yet.
