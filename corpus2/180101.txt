I have heard several terms for a C++ "Codepoint" (which is what I've heard used the most often), or a `.cpp` file that is compiled into an object file. For instance, `.cpp` files can include other `.cpp` files (or any other file, really, so long as it compiles), but during compilation, there is really only one 'main' code file that is used/generated. I know there is a widely accepted term, I just can't recall what it is. What is the accepted term for the final `.c`/`.cpp` file used to generate an object file?
