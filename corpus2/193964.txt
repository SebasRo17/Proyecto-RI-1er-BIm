We are developing a banking application. It's internal project of the bank. The application has to capture huge data to process. So auto save is recommended approach to capture? How to perform validations in case of auto save? And on jsp unload saving the data is correct approach? Which is best way of saving form data in case of auto save? If any network errors occur, how to handle, mean giving end user the data is not saved? I think it's just a feasible solution. Please suggest me optimal solution.
