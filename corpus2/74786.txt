I need to learn COM for my current project. I am a noob and I haven't been able to find good starting points for COM. I have been looking into MSDN and googling... I did find some interesting articles on codeproject.com, but I am not satisfied. Why do we use COM ? Why does it exist ? In what places does it exist ? ..... and so on .. So, will you please tell me where can I find answers to these questions ?
