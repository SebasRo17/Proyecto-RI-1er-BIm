After applying to multiple contracting positions, I landed a few interviews which I then was accepted to do the work. I am also a full time college student, but I do have about 25-30 hours free a week, so that isn't a problem. My issue is how do I manage that **time efficiently**? One of the contracting position starts next week and I've already started one yesterday. How do you make your schedule to fit your clients to give them the most time a day and not get stuck in a narrow path of working for one until you "feel" done? My clients do know that I have other work, but I don't want them to think it'll affect their work nor do I want it to. Also, if you can give advice about similar experience of **things to look out** for or how having multiple clients affected your **quality of work**. I'm hoping this isn't too subjective or too specific, so comment regrading to that so I can fix it . Thanks!
