Sometimes when I invoke `FullSimplify` on a large expression, I get a series of messages like this:               FullSimplify::ztest1 "Unable to decide whether numeric quantity «1» is equal to zero. Assuming it is."      I suppose _Mathematica_ makes this assumption when numeric calculations with reasonably high precision do not produce a number that can be distinguished from the exact `0`. While in certain cases this is useful, I want to be able to disable this assumption in cases that I believe involve tiny non-zero quantities. **Is it possible to disable this kind of assumption in`FullSimplify`?**
