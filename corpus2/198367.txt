I've been facing a problem recently, in which I want to optimize two programs. For that, I wanted to create some kind of "Common Interface" which I could reuse between my two programs. However, the code of these are approximately 1000 lines, and I don't want to spend a big amount of time checking if this or that function is the same as this one and whatsoever. So I used BOUML to check the similarities between class diagrams. But I wonder if there is a global way to do such a study ?
