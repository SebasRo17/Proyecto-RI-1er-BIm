I have just learned HTML/CSS and I practice everything I read to make it more understandable to me and I really enjoy it. My goal is to be a Modern Web Developer both front and back-end, so I won't stop learning. I'm planing to jump on JavaScript now but what I would like to know is how important is math to being a Web Developer.   1. Do I need to know math?   2. If so, what kind of math should I know and understand?
