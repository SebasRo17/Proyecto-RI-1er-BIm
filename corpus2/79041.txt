My first commit in my project resulted in the nightly build being broken and people are all over me as we are nearing the release. I want to send an apology email that should sound sincere and at the same time hinting that this was my first commit and this would not be repeated any more. Being a non-native English speaker, I have difficulties coming up with correct words. Can someone please help ?
