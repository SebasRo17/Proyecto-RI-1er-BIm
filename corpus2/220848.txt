I have one idea that I want to make an app for iPhone, I have recently bought a mac for the same purpose. I want to make small app and build on it in later versions. I work in in a small company and have 1 year of experience on working of iOS platform . I am a developer and don't have any design background so I want to know - should I take help from some designer? Or learn on my own and start coding for the app? I would like to know before starting out, what things should I consider or give more importance to. In general how should I approach building the app, design first and code later or reverse way.
