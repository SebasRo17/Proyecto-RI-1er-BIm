This is happening in every team. For some reasons, conflicts arise in the team and they affect the overall motivation and productivity. What is your recommended approach to solve that common problem? _Examples_ :   * one part of the team wants to implement dependency injection, the other part think it's a waste of time.   * some developers think the rest of the team is slowing down development (which explains why they are late on the schedule)   * personal incompatibilities between one or more developers   * one developer refuse to talk to another one (without apparent reason)
