I realize that there are already a couple of questions about this, but they mostly are about _if_ you should bring code to the interview, which is not the case here. I have a job interview (at a startup) coming up next week and they _requested_ to bring some code to the interview. I have two smaller open-source projects and a closed-source Android app, which I mentioned (and linked) in my skill sheet I sent along, so I wanted to show them some code of those projects. It's my first job after graduating, so I don't have any sources from previous employments and there won't be any issues regarding "spying", licensing issues, confidential code etc. All the code is completely mine and written by me. I guess I have pretty much three options: print some interesting parts of the code on paper or have everything on my tablet or laptop to show. The latter two have the advantage that I can bring all my projects and basically show them everything they want to see. However you can't directly make notes/underline stuff etc. as if I had printed it out and it's less convenient than just handing out paper. What's the best way to handle this professionally and do this as hassle-free as possible? I currently tend to print out some of the parts that I think are both interesting and well written, but have everything on my tablet in case they want to see more.
