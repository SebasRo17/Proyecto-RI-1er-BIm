My friend and I are working on a project together in visual studio, and we are using subversion for source control. We have used php based project management tools before for task and bug tracking, but we find it inconvenient to go to work in visual studio for hours then have to go find the website and log in and report on what we already made commit notes for, especially since sometimes we are working off line and then have to remember to go back and update the trackers. We are wondering if there is a project management tool (or set of tools) that is built into (slash an add-on) Visual Studio that will work with AnkhSvn allowing multiple people to maintain and track tasks.
