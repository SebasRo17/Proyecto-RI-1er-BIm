I ran across an article on things programmers should avoid doing and came across this term: Bulldozer Code. The author defined it at as "giving the appearance of refactoring by breaking out chunks into subroutines, but that are impossible to reuse in another context". I interpret that as him saying to avoid creating procedures for code that can't actually be used in more than one place, which confuses me a little because I have an instructor prefers using procedures for the purpose of 'cleaner' code. So what exactly is bulldozer code and why should I avoid it?
