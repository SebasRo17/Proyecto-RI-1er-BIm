I have a complicated function which contains many calls to `NIntegrate`, `NSolve`, `FindRoot` and other superfunctions in many places. My function is organized in such a way that every call to a superfunction is assigned to unique `Block`ed variable. Sometimes these functions produce `Messages` but it is not obvious which call has generated the message. I wish to find a straighforward way to know which call has generated the message. It would be great to include this information in the `Message` itself but just printing this information before/after the `Message` would be sufficient. I know that there is undocumented function `Internal`HandlerBlock` which seemingly can do such tasks but I do not know how to restrict it to handle only _printed_ messages. For example,               Internal`HandlerBlock[{"Message",        If[MatchQ[#, Hold[_, True]], Print[#]] &},       NIntegrate[Cos[20000 x]/Sqrt[x], {x, 0, 1}]]      Produces many prints but only one of them corresponds to the actually printed one `Message`.
