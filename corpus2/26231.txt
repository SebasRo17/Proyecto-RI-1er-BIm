When using `LegendLayout->"Row"`, with a lengthy row, I get line breaks. This would seemed logic if it was confined by another structure. But if happens even when there's no "confinement":               LineLegend[{Blue, Orange, Green}, {"this is a big test",        "this is a big test", "this is a big test"}, LegendLayout -> "Row"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iurGp.gif) How can I change the `ItemSize`/`ImageSize` of the Legend? (should this behavior be reported?)
