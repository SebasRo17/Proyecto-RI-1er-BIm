Here is a toy problem: I have a (directional) line that starts from `{2,0}` and goes through `{1.8, 0.01}`. Also I have a parametric plot defined like this: `{Sin[u], Sin[2 u]}` where `0 <= u <= 2 Pi`.   I would like to find the intersection of these two. I tried something like:               Solve[a*({1.8, .01} - {2, 0}) + {2, 0} == {Sin[u], Sin[2 u]}        && 0 <= u < 2 Pi && a > 0, {u, a}]      But both `Solve` and `NSolve` seem to struggle with this. `Findroot` is able to find an answer quickly but it gives me only one answer depending on the starting point while I'd like to have all correct answers, four in this case. Also I see if I redefine the line section so that it has only one intersecting point with the curve (e.g. line starts at `{0, 0}` and goes through `{-0.1 , 0.01}`) then `Solve` is able to find that one answer comfortably! Any idea how to solve this?
