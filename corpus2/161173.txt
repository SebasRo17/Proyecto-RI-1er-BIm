I'm using a lot of `printf` for tracing/logging purposes in my code, I've found that it's a source of programming error. I always found the insertion operator (`<<`) to be somewhat of a odd thing but I'm beginning to think that by using it instead I could avoid some of these bugs. Anyone ever had a similar revelation or I'm just grasping at straws here? # Some take away points   * My current line of thinking is that type-safety outweighs any benefit of using printf. The real problem is the format string and the use of non type-safe variadic functions.   * Maybe I won't be using `<<` and the stl output stream variants but I will certainly look into using a type-safe mechanism which is very similar.   * A lot of the tracing/logging is conditional but I'd like to always run the code to not miss bugs in tests just because it's a rarely taken branch.
