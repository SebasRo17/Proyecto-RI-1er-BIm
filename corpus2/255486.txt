I created XML parsing logic that forces XML to be formatted like this:               <fooList>         <fooObject value="SomeValue1" />         <fooObject value="SomeValue2" />     </fooList>      And then I started to think that a more elegant way would be               <fooList>         <fooObject>SomeValue1</fooObject>         <fooObject>SomeValue2</fooObject>     </fooList>      Are there any recommendations or good practices regarding this? I already know about Element vs. Attribute question, please note that mine is different.
