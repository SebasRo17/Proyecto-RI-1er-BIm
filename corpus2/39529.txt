I would like to automate the commands in this website into a batch file, so when the batch file it runs these commands in sequence. http://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/157461 Do any of you have any ideas. I know that you can just type in wolfram in a batch file like this:               #!/bin/bash     wolfram      It will give you this output:               Wolfram Language (Raspberry Pi Pilot Release)     Copyright 1988-2013 Wolfram Research     Information & help: wolfram.com/raspi          In[1]:=      How would you enter commands in the In[1]:= from a batch script? Thanks in advance. Ahmad EDIT I think this could help from http://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/RaspberryPi.html               wolfram -script file.wl
