I am a physics teacher and I am looking for a way to create homework assignments within Mathematica so that each problem has an input field that students can use to check their answers. For example, if the problem reads "What is the integral of 2x^2" I want an input field immediately after the question that students can type their answer into. If they type in the correct answer, it will confirm that it is right where as if it is not right it will tell them it is incorrect. Anyone have any ideas of how I could do this?
