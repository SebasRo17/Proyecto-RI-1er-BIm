Open source PHP shopping carts platform/framework occupy most top list. They are hot, and we want start quick. So, we are going to make decision between Magento and Opencart, PHP programmers would be happy to this end. While my Java programming colleges feel not so happy, they were selling Broadleaf commerce or JadaSite. But more online reading and discussion pushing us to this way. PHP shopping carts get more use and so tested more and they get support multiple shops and multiple vendors. What will be Java's advantage in this open source field? Or should we believe Java can give decent infrastructure in long run?
