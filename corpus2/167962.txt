I am using WPF, Prism and Unity to develop the user interface for a .net application. The UI will run from a PC, but I also need to develop a separate complex server component that will provide services to the PC component via WCF. Prism and Unity have proved to be of great value in creating a modular application, at least as far as the user interface is concerned. I would also like to make the server component modular, but I cannot find anywhere what techniques, patterns and technologies are suitable. I have considered:   * Unity or one of the other DI containers    * Selected parts of Prism, such as modules and events Are these suitable for developing a modular server component? Or are these UI technologies only and should I be looking at something completely different?
