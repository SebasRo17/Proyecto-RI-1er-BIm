I can import an Excel file into Mathematica easily: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZZqmE.png) But when I try from .Net it fails: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FCJhQ.png) * * * These are the commands and errors I am getting:               xlData = Import[\"C://Users//138013//Desktop//RefinedDataset.xlsx\", {\"Sheets\", \"MySheet\"}]      > "Import::chtype: \r\n First argument > C://Users//138013//Desktop//RefinedDataset.xlsx\r\n is not a valid file, > directory, or URL specification."               xlData = Import[\"//Desktop//RefinedDataset.xlsx\", {\"Sheets\", \"MySheet\"}]      > "Import::nffil: File not found during Import." * * * I've done research and seen these articles but nothing shed light on why its an invalid file:   Importing from Excel   Open Excel file with Mathematica   http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/format/XLS.html * * * Does someone know why `Import` is giving me a **is not a valid file** when the same command works in Mathematica and the file does exist and is valid?
