So lets say we have a clustered environment setup. We have a cluster SQL Server (I don't know exactly how its done but lets just say its been done for the sake of argument). Now if a website or application is trying to access that database for read/write (say an ASP.NET app or a C# Winforms app) and during that time SQL goes down - it takes a couple of minutes for the clustering failover to take affect to switch to another node. What happens during this time? I think it will time out/unable to connect. BUT is there a way for it to place the request in some pipeline so when the cluster node is back up/switched over it will continue as normal?
