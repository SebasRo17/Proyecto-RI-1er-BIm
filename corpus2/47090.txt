I will better explain my question. I have been struggling with this for long time Everytime i want to read something for e,g book on java , then i find so much stuff like many tutorials , many ebooks that i am not able to decide which one to choose. I spend some time reading one , then 2 and so on and in the end i leave and gain nothing. I like the old days when we had only few resources like one hard book and at least i finish that from start to finish and gained much but now days there is so much information that mind jumps from one source to other and gain nothing what should i do
