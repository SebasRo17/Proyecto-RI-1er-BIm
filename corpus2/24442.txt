The code line               If[StreamPosition>0,Read[str,Record]]        should be executed in a Module at first.   The Module consists of a Slider and a Pane.   The Slider positions a StreamPosition in file.   The Module then reads a chunk of records from that file.   The external file is a txt file with variable length string records. The Slider value for the ReadList is just a rough position.   For it is in lack of the knowledge of well defined record start positions.   The unwanted result:   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RhBT1.jpg) Therefore the Module has to adjust in a first step to the begin of a   record with Read[str,Record]. The first record displayed in Pane   will be the complete one. Should give this result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mw539.jpg) Note: The files start position - it's 1. record - is aligned and   does not need that correction. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cf1WX.jpg) Where to integrate it and how to bring to life the Read[] in this Module?               infil = "F:\\LargeDataSet\\Entwicklung\\Daten Beispiele\\test 1M \     semicolon key.txt";     panerows = 200;     str = OpenRead[infil, BinaryFormat -> True];     filebytes = FileByteCount[infil];     recbytes = Round[filebytes/anzrecs - 2];     erst = 1;     n1 = (erst - 1)*recbytes;            Module[{},      Column[       {Dynamic[SetStreamPosition[str, n1]],        Slider[Dynamic[n1], {0, maxbyte, recbytes}, ImageSize -> 400,          Appearance -> Small],        Pane[Column /@ Dynamic[ReadList[str, Record, 200 + n1 - n1]],         ImageSize -> {400, 200}, Scrollbars -> True]}       ]      ]
