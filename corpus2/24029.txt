I'm getting strange spikes in my surface `S` with the code below. `PlotPoints` seems to help, but it doesn't solve the problem. Any explanation and solution would be much appreciated.               a := {x, y, 1 - x}     b := {x, y, x}     S := Inner[Times,        Transpose[Inner[Times, {1 - x, x}, {{a /. {x -> 0, y -> 0}, b /. {x -> 0, y -> 1}},          {a /. {x -> 1, y -> 0}, b /. {x -> 1, y -> 1}}}, Plus]], {1 - y, y}, Plus]     ParametricPlot3D[S, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]     ParametricPlot3D[S, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, PlotPoints -> 100]     Expand[S]     ParametricPlot3D[{x, y, 1 - x - y + 2 x y}, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      * * * EDIT: It seems that `y ->` is somehow responsible. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwLGK.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SEfF6.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2k2lX.png)
