I have a list of the form:               {{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, {{5, 6}, {7, 8}}, {{9, 10}, {11, 12}}}      How can I create a function which will take each set at the highest level of the list:               {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}          {{5, 6}, {7, 8}}          {{9, 10}, {11, 12}}      And subtract the first element of the set from the second element of the set, here:               {3, 4} - {1, 2} = {2, 2}          {7, 8} - {5, 6} = {2, 2}          {11, 12} - {9, 10} = {2, 2}      Then compute the average or median of these values (`{2, 2}` here in either case)? It's clear how to do this using loops or tables, but is there a simpler way to proceed that makes clever use of _Mathematica_? For a table based implementation:               PairList = {{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, {{5, 6}, {7, 8}}, {{9, 10}, {11, 12}}};     PLMean = Mean[Table[PairList[[u, 2]] - PairList[[u, 1]], {u, 1, Length[PairList]}]]
