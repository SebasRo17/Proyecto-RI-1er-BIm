This is a contrived example, but it gets the point across. I am looking to use the following as inputs:               a = {10, 11};     b = {5, 7};     MakeCD[x_] := {{x, 2 x}, {3 x, 4 x}};      to function that takes a list of sublists. `ListPlot` is a suitable example of the function. Using `1` as the argument to `MakeCD`, `MakeCD` returns: `{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}` I am looking to supply `{{10, 11}, {5, 7}, {1, 2}, {3, 4}}` to `ListPlot` I can achieve this with the following:               {c, d} = MakeCD[1];     {a, b, c, d}      Also with:               Join[{a}, {b}, MakeCD[1]]      I am sure there is a better way to do this, but I have not yet stumbled upon it yet.
