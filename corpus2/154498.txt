I need to try the following thing: I would like to compile some simple C code samples and see the assembly listing generated by GCC for IA64 architecture, i.e. I just want to run GCC with the -S switch and see the resultant .s file. I don't have an Itanium machine, so in order to do it myself I'll probably need a cross-compiling version of GCC built for x86 RedHat. I'm not interested in full cross-compilation, meaning that I don't need to generate the binaries at all. The easiest way, of course, would be to find an Itanium machine with with GCC and just try it there. Unfortunately, I don't seem to have access to any. Another option is to build a cross-compiling version GCC on my RedHat, but apparently that's quite an endeavor for someone who hasn't done it before (I assume that the fact that I only need .s output doesn't make it simpler). What other options are there, if any? Maybe there's some sort of a web front to an Itanium GCC compiler on the Net (something like Comeau Online or ideone.com, but with .s output)? Anything else? I would appreciate any help.
