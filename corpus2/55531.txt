I would like to get a list of variable names as strings. For example,               x = 1;     y = 2;     Map[SymbolName, Unevaluated /@ Unevaluated@{x, y}]      > {"x", "y"} This works well. However, if I use               Map[SymbolName @* Unevaluated, Unevaluated@{x, y}]      It does not work and drops an error message > SymbolName::sym: Argument 1 at position 1 is expected to be a symbol. What's the difference between the two?
