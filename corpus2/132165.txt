I hope this is an answerable question. Let me give it some context: I am a psychology student and a programmer. I'm going to look into creating a artificial intelligence in the form of a chatterbot. I've been looking around the web, and read about projects such as Eliza which was a first simple psychoterapy program, that has now actually been written in javascript (so you can see how simple this was). **I want to create achatterbot that can converse**, and that will understand semantically and grammatically a sentence, for the purpose of reciprocal communication rather than simply outputting an answer. I'm interested in ways to learn about programming with "language". I know that this is a complex question, so the answer will probably be complex too. What programming languages/frameworks should I look into when wanting to analyze the semantics. I know of the excellent Wolfram Alpha project that has an API. But I don't want to create an artificial intelligence that can answer any random question. To parafrase: What frameworks / programming languages are suited to work with deconstructing linguistic units and understanding language, for the purpose of conversing? Also do you know of any projects that implement these?
