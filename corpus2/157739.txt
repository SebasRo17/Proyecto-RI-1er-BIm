I started learning arrays in C++ and came over a little side note in the book talking about 2D arrays in breif. I tested it out and i was amazed that it could give the programmer the ability to store data or information and lay it out infront of him in a spread sheet format. In a normal array to access elements i would simply do this:               int matrix[2] = { 1, 15};      But in 2D arrays :The only way it tells me to actually acces elements is by using a loop:               int fly[2][2];     int i = 0;     int n=0;     for(i=0; i<2; i++){         for (n=0; n<2; n++){             fly[i][n] =0;         }     }     for(i=0; i<2; i++){         for (n =0; n<2; n++){             cout << fly[i][n]<< endl;         }     }      I have tried accessing elements the old way:               int fly[2][2] = { 0};      but i noticed that this changes all the elements to 0 So..   1. Can anyone explain when i try accessing this 2D array like this all the elements change.   2. Is there another way to access 2D array elements without using a loop. Thank you all.
