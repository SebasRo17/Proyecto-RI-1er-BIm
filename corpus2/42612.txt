Yesterday I upgraded from mathematica 8.0.4.0 to 9.0.1.0. Trying to run the same notebook I used many times before, it takes ages to evaluate a symbolic (linearsolve) expression which before was evaluated in within a minute. It doesn't give the answer within 12 hours, with CPU usage at 25-30%. What could have changed? (I don't want to switch back to the old version, want to fix this). I want to solve:               rhoout = LinearSolve[Mcoeff, out]      Where the (10-by-1) vector is simply:               out = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}      And the matrix (10-by-9):               Mcoeff = {{1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1}, {-c21 - c31, 0, -I omge, 0, c12, 0,        I Conjugate[omge], 0, c13}, {0,        I (-dge + dse) - c1/4 - c12/2 - c2/4 - c21/2 - c31/2 - c32/        2, -I omse, 0, 0, 0, 0, I Conjugate[omge],        0}, {-I Conjugate[omge], -I Conjugate[omse], -I dge - c1/4 - c13/2 -         c21/2 - c23/2 - c3/4 - c31/2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,        I Conjugate[omge]}, {0, 0,        0, -I (-dge + dse) - c1/4 - c12/2 - c2/4 - c21/2 - c31/2 - c32/2,        0, -I omge, I Conjugate[omse], 0, 0}, {c21, 0, 0,        0, -c12 - c32, -I omse, 0, I Conjugate[omse], c23}, {0, 0,        0, -I Conjugate[omge], -I Conjugate[omse], -I dge - I (-dge + dse) -         c12/2 - c13/2 - c2/4 - c23/2 - c3/4 - c32/2, 0, 0,        I Conjugate[omse]}, {I omge, 0, 0, I omse, 0, 0,        I dge - c1/4 - c13/2 - c21/2 - c23/2 - c3/4 - c31/2,        0, -I omge}, {0, I omge, 0, 0, I omse, 0, 0,        I dge + I (-dge + dse) - c12/2 - c13/2 - c2/4 - c23/2 - c3/4 - c32/        2, -I omse}, {c31, 0, I omge, 0, c32,        I omse, -I Conjugate[omge], -I Conjugate[omse], -c13 - c23}}      EDIT OK, I did install the older version again (Mathematica 8.0.4.0), this is the result (I suppressed the output because it is very large, hence the 'Null' in the answer):               In[51]:= Timing[rhoout = LinearSolve[Mcoeff, out];]          Out[51]= {6.256, Null}      In v9.0.1.0, the exact same command (the same .nb file) does not produce an answer within reasonable time (again, I have let the evaluation run overnight, >12hrs, and there was no result)
