I am trying to solve the following inequality:               Assuming[{R[k] >= 0, R[k + 1] = R[k] - 2^N Y, Y >= 0 && N >= 0},       Refine[Re[R[k + 1] >= 0]]      I want check whether R[k+1] >=0 is true or not, but I am getting Re[True < 0] and I don't know what this means.               R[k + 1] = R[k] - 2^N Y     Y >= 0     N >= 0     Simplify[R[k + 1] < 0, R[k] >= 0]      In this case i am getting R[k] < 2^k Y. I want true or false as result.
