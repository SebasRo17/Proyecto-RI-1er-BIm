So, I'm expending this email submission form script for a client and saw something rather strange to my experience. As you can see below, the original programmer has sanitised the user input. Is this a good practice or does this makes sense at all?               // Build Message Body from Web Form Input      foreach ($_POST as $Field=>$Value)         $MsgBody .= "$Field: $Value\n";      $MsgBody .= "\n" . @gethostbyaddr($_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]) . "\n" .         $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"];      $MsgBody = htmlspecialchars($MsgBody, ENT_NOQUOTES);  //make safe      Thanks everyone!
