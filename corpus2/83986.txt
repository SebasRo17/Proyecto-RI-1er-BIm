I'm currently facing a dilemma with an upcoming performance review. When I started with my company around 1 year ago I tried to be as honest as possible in my perception of my programming skill set and knowledge. I based my perceived skills on my coding ability relative to those I consider to be good programmers and developers. So the salary I was provided I was happy with at the time. I have no problem with that as I believe honesty is important when going for a job and while in it. Also, I believe that once I'm in the job if I'm better than what I have given the employer to believe then my performance will reflect that. At the same another developer was hired. We were both hired to work on the same project doing the same task set. A few months back I found out that this person was on substantially more than me wage wise. Now during the project I have come to realise that this person is well below me in programming skills and even business knowledge. I have had to help him out numerous times with programming tasks, review his code and offer better solutions, and explain concepts about the project we are working on. Even though we both started at the same time. How can I go about increasing my salary (during the review) to be at least comparable with this person without directly mentioning their name or that I know what they are on. If I justify it based on the work I have done, what if they don't offer me a comparative package. Is it fair that I want more or am I being greedy?
