I've been studying cyclomatic complexity (McCabe) and reachability of software at uni recently. Today my lecturer said that there's no correlation between the two metrics, but is this really the case? I'd think there would definitely be _some_ correlation, as less complex programs (from the scant few we've looked at) seem to have 'better' results in terms of reachability. Does anyone know of any attempt to look at the two metrics together, and if not, what would be a good place to find data on both complexity and reachability for a large(ish) number of programs?
