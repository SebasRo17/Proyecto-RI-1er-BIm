Recently I've run into Cheerp, a C++ to Javascript compiler, which uses a modified version of clang to generate Javascript code from C++ sources. That makes me wonder: why in the seven kingdoms would someone do this in their right mind? I mean: why would you take a language that is not designed for web at all, that is far more convoluted and bureaucratic, write your code and then compile it into Javascript itself? Can anybody see any advantages in doing so? We surely can discard performance as a reason, because in the end it generates pure Javascript code. Is there anyone here that have real experience with this? P.S.: I'm not sure if this is an on topic question, but this is the most general forum about programming that I could find in the StackExchange network. ## Edit Although this seems like a subjective question, it is not. I am asking for reasons why this tool could be useful. I got interested at first, but started wondering why would someone use it.
