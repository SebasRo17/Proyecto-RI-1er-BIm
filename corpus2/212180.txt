Suppose I have a mesh of relationships, such as   * Friends who trust some friends and not others    * A IPv6 router that needs to locate peers across the Internet   * A PGP Web Of Trust that needs two people to locate each other's trust level I'm interested in determining not only the shortest path, but the cost of each (an arbitrary weight by be added), the nodes of each path, and other information typically used in this general purpose need. What approaches are there to accommodate this need? Ideally this will be something that I can run locally on a phone or computer and search a large graph in O(N) speed or better.
