Does anyone use the Feynrules Mathematica package? I'd like to know how could I write this vertex explicitly with sum on all indices               ((MD- Me CKM11) /4 vev)  dbar.ProjM. d X       where `X` is scalar particle So I'd like to write some thing like :               ((Md IndexDelta[i,j] - Ml CKM[i,j])/4 vev)( SR dqbar[i].ProjM. dq[j] );      This expression give me errors on FeynRules. so what do you think the right for it?
