I would like to find all occurrences of a full stop "." followed by a capital letter in a string and have these replaced with a "; ". How do I do this in Mathematica? e.g. `string="this is a test.A new sentence here"` -> output               "this is a test; A new sentence here"      Edit: and also one other pattern matching question - in a string I would like to have every other line occuring before a next line (\n) being deleted - how do I do that one? e.g.               string="this line should be deleted\nthis one not\nbut this one should be deleted too\nthis one not"      -> output               "this one not\nthis one not"
