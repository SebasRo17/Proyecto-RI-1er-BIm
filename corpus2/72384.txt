Imagine that there is a project to be completed. This project involves three parties: client, a development organisation (a one that you work for), and a design agency. The design agency is a subcontractor of the client. The role of the design agency are largely responsible for doing styling; however in the past these designers have produced substandard work such as extensive use of id targetting in css instead of class targetting, etc. At what point should developers become involved in a triangular relationship among client, design agency, and themselves? What meetings or communication would you expect to take place at this point?
