I can write code, resolve dependencies, and get my program to run on _my_ computer; I have no idea where to go from here though. How do I get the software ready for distribution? The school environment has taught me to do a few random tests by hand, make sure nothing is obviously broken, then throw all the source files into a zip and send it off. This is all that's needed to get a good grade is most CS courses. Nobody taught me how to release to real users. The only clues I have are a few phrases like "automated builds" and "continuous integration", but I don't know what these mean. How can I properly distribute my work? How can I make it easy for others? How can I move beyond "here's the zip" releases?
