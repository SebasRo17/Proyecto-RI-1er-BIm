wrote a program to calculate and display the first 20 fibonacci numbers, the sequence goes as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... (each number is the sum of the previous two numbers) The problem is that the numbers that get displayed are from 2 onwards , the first and second numbers of the sequence do not get displayed , could someone tell me what needs to be done to correct this? Code:                       private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)         {             int previousNumber = 1;             int currentNumber = 1;             int nextNumber = 1;                  while (currentNumber <= 11000)             {                 nextNumber = previousNumber + currentNumber;                 previousNumber = currentNumber;                 currentNumber = nextNumber;                 textBox1.AppendText(Convert.ToString(nextNumber) + " ");                     nextNumber++;                  }         }
