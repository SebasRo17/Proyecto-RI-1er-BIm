I'm starting with BDD and this is my story:               Feature: Months and days to days         In order to see months and days as days         As a date conversion fan         I need a webpage where users can enter         days and months and convert them to days.      I have some doubts ... Should I write my scenarios before coding anything or should I first write a scenario and then write code, write a scenario again and then write code, and so on ... ? If I should write my scenarios before, can my steps be approved and production code still does not get done? When should I do refactoring on my code? After the feature is done or after each scenario implementation?
