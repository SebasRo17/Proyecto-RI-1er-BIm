I am a Computer Science student (6th semester). I want to make a project and I have a team of 4 people (My friends). So we are 5 people and we have decided to make a " **Web based file explorer** ". The project will be similar to THIS one. How should we start with this project? We guys don't know much about programming. I know Java a little and I am a RHCE so can handle the server and all such administrative stuffs. Since this is our first project so we guys have no idea how we'll make it? I know Java and other guys in the group knows C#, ASP.NET, PHP, SQL and Joomla. Please guide and give your suggestions. Thank you. PS : Perhaps my question is not complete, if you want more information then leave a comment I will edit the question.
