Recently we saw how to produce xkcd-style graphs. I evaluated the same code and deployed the result to CDF. Everything is working fine except that, in the CDF notebook, the graph is scaled according to the size of the window. To start with, we have: ![Original size](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BMoxW.png) But, on resizing the window, the graphic also gets smaller: ![Resized window](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a0Bqp.png) I don't want the graph to be scaled with the window. How can I prevent this?
