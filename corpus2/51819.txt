I'm trying to export a graph as a graphic to an SVG file with transparent background. When the background is specified as a color (or unspecified), it works just fine. When the background is specified as `None`, it offsets the graphic down and to the right a bit and ends of cutting off part of the graphic.               g = CompleteGraph[7];     g = GraphicsGrid[{{g}}];     Export["good.svg", g, Background -> Pink];     Export["bad.svg", g, Background -> None];      Transparency works perfectly as expected when the graphic is exported to PNG. Is this a bug, or am I just missing something here? I'm running Mathematica 9.0.0.0 on Linux 64-bit. Here's a screenshot of what I am seeing when I open the bad.svg in the gnome image viewer (with some style changes made to the graph for visibility). Note that the image is cut off on the bottom and on the right. When I open bad.svg in chromium or in firefox, it appears fine. ![1](http://i.imgur.com/tAkcEye.png)
