In _Mathematica_ 9.0.1, when I evaluate               Graph[PolyhedronData["GreatRhombicosidodecahedron", "SkeletonRules"],       VertexCoordinates ->          Thread[Table[i, {i, 1, 120}] ->            PolyhedronData["GreatRhombicosidodecahedron", "VertexCoordinates"]]]      No error message was printed, so `Quiet` is ineffective, yet the output is highlighted in 'error red' and on mouseover it states: > Coordinate index -1 is out of range for the enclosing GraphicsComplex. However, the coordinates have clearly been implemented in the `Graph`, so I would like to simply silence this error _just as_ `Quiet` _or_ `Off` _would_ for error messages. I've only encountered this problem in the above context, but suspect the solution is simple. Does anyone know of a solution?
