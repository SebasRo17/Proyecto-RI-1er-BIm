I'm learning C++ right now, and it's the first language I'm learning. I keep seeing on stackexchange and other forums (Reddit, etc.) that I should drop C++ and learn a higher level language like Python or Java. The only arguments I see are that "C++ is harder to learn and is more low-level than others." which don't really give a reason NOT to learn it. I want to know if there are any actual reasons for dropping C++ and taking up another, "easier" language. Or if I should keep focusing on it, and just learn others later (which is what I plan on doing).
