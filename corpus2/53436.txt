I have recompiled a plugin (making changes before they are accepted upstream) for the gstreamer media framework. I did not recompile the whole library -- just a plugin. If I want proprietary python code to use this plugin -- am I running afoul of the LGPL license? My code never _directly_ links to the modified plugin. MyPythonCode [proprietary] --> pygst/binary [LGPL] --> gStreamer/binary [LGPL] --> modifiedPlugin/binary(w/source)[LGPL] The source code for the modified plugin would be available per LGPL.
