I'm new to scrum and using it on a project. We do 3 week iterations, estimate at the beginning and then collect the points at the end. We have a product back log (probably not complete). If you do estimates of the entire back log at the beginning aren't those estimate just 'wild ass guesses' So when do you estimate the back log and how do you determine a release date? ep
