I mean something along the lines of:               public interface Dimensioned {         int getWidth();         int getHeight();     }      and               public interface Positioned {         int getX();         int getY();     }      There are a **lot** of standard java classes that have exactly those methods-- notably `Component` and all of its subclasses as well as `Dimension` and `Point`. `Image` could implement `Dimensioned`.   Despite the widespread use of these methods, there's no uniform way of referring to them. Is this a conscious decision on the part of the language designers? In writing this question, I've noticed that it _is_ rather difficult to come up with good descriptive names for the interfaces. Even so, it feels like it would be useful to have them. I can't seem to find much information on the topic.
