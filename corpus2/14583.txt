Given a `Graph` with an automatically computed layout (i.e. not explicitly given `VertexCoordinates`, but using a `GraphLayout` method), how can we extract the coordinates of the vertices?               In[]:= g = RandomGraph[{10, 20}, GraphLayout -> "SpringEmbedding"]     Out[]= << picture of graph >>          In[]:= PropertyValue[g, VertexCoordinates]     Out[]= Automatic (* <-- I'd like to have a list of coordinates here *)      It's possible to convert the graph into a graphics object using `Show` and extract the coordinates from there. Is there a less hacky, more direct/robust way?
