I've written a recursive search algorithm to find the boundaries of a voxel data structure in order to render it more efficiently. I've looked around, and either it's such a simple and obvious technique that nobody's bothered to patent it, or it's novel and nobody's done it this way before. It's openly "published" on GitHub and protected under the GPL. I'd like to show it to others, to see if it can be improved, however... I fear that although I've written and published it, someone may attempt to patent the same idea. Am I safe, protected by the banners of open source software, or must I attempt to protect myself like the big guns and patent trolls do? It's my belief that software patents are evil, and that in order for the best software to be written, many eyes need to see it. I'm worried this may be a rather na√Øve viewpoint on how software is written, though, and I'm curious as to what others think.
