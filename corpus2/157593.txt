I was doing my ER diagram for a rails application I'm about to begin with and there I have an entity called `Class News` so I'd have a model `ClassNew` but I don't know if I will have problems in the future with the `New` part or what would be the right way to do this o how should I call the model? since the right thing would be `ClassNews` and the table should be `class_news`... What's the best thing to do when working with `News` at the time of creating models for ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails. Thanks.
