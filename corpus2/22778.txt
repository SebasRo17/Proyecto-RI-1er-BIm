I have an equation for function `F[x,y]==0` which first argument `x` is real and another, `y`, is complex. All constants in equation are real. I define `y` as `y=a+I*b`. I need to plot `Im[y]` as function of `x`. (in other words, I need a plot of `b` as function of `x`. The equality for `F` for `a` and `b` and `x` can be solved only using `FindRoot` function. Here's how I tried to plot what I need:               ContourPlot[{{Im[F] == 0, Re[F] == 0}}, {b, 0.1,        10^8}, {x, 0.1, 10^16}]      But nothing is plotted. Any ideas? Thank you for help! * * * Here is the function and constants:               e2 = 5     e3 = 1     omega1 = 1.1242*10^(16)     omega2 = 4.5896*10^(15)     omega3 = 5.5927*10^(15)     e1 = 1 - omega1^2/x^2     c = 3*10^8     k1 = Sqrt[y^2 - x^2/c^2 e1]     k2 = Sqrt[y^2 - x^2/c^2 e2]     k3 = Sqrt[y^2 - x^2/c^2 e3]     h = 5*10^(-9)     y = a + I b     F = ((k2/e2 + k1/e1)*(k3/e3 + k2/e2))/((k1/e1 - k2/e2)*(k3/e3 -             k2/e2)) - Exp[-2 k2 h]      Here is my attemption to plot roots I that I tried with FindRoot. But I am not sure it plots all roots correctly and I don't even know where to search for them:                findPoint[i_] :=       Evaluate[Function[        Assuming[a \[Element] Reals && b \[Element] Reals,          FindRoot[{(Re[F] /. x -> (10000*i)) ==             0, (Im[F] /. x -> (10000*i)) == 0}, {{a, 0.5}, {b, 0.2}}]]]]     list1 := Table[b /. findPoint[i][[1]], {i, 1, 2000}]     list2 := Table[10000*i, {i, 1, 2000}]     PointDone := Inner[List, list1, list2, List]     Show[{Graphics[Point[PointDone], Axes -> False, AspectRatio -> 1/2,         Frame -> {{True, False}, {True, False}}, FrameTicksStyle -> 18]}]      Here is a plot I got.. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mqjhq.png)
