I'm trying to plot the zeros within a certain distance from the origin using Mathematica of a given function (in my case, partial sums of the Zeta Function). I've tried plugging in simple functions, such as 1+2^(-s), but the program keeps throwing an error (it won't even show a plot). I am a beginner with Mathematica; will someone explain how to perform the task at hand or point me to some examples? I've found a few references, but they all seemed centered around learning the programming language as a whole. If possible, I want to avoid this for now and put it off until the summer when I'll have more time to sit down and play with it.
