I am trying to have a satellite (camera) move around the earth (unit sphere) and take picture of the earth. The satellite keeps constant distance from the earth, and always looks toward earth center.               Manipulate[         Graphics3D[Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, 1], ViewVector -> {2*{Cos[t], 0, Sin[t]}, {0, 0, 0}}],         {t, 0, 2*Pi}]      This should produce the same size of circle no matter what angle `t` is being used, but the above code scales the images. I think I am not using `ViewVector` correctly here. Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.
