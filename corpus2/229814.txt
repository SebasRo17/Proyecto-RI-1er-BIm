It seems to me that programming languages meant for use in science and engineering are consistently _weird_ compared to general-purpose languages. Some examples off the top of my head:   * In Matlab, each function has to be placed in a separate file   * In R, <\- is the assigment operator, as opposed to = in almost every other language   * Matlab, R, Julia and others are all 1-indexed   * Matlab uses % for comments, and not the standard # or // Of course, these languages all have several design features that _actually_ make them easier to use for scientific applications, such as more natural matrix notation. Still, they all inexplicably make all these bizarre choices which don't make anything easier and could easily have been avoided if the language designers had just chosen to do what 99% of other languages do. Is the reason vendor lock-in? A lack of contact with the wider software development community? Something else? I read this thread and didn't find the explanations satisfactory. Just because R were designed as a scientific language doesn't mean it _had_ to completely ignore conventions and use <\- instead of =.
