stuck on a mathematica assignment and could really use some help. A) Fit a function with the shape log(Y) = a0 + a1log(U) to the datapoints (log(Ui), log(Yi) with an least square fitting. Show this in a plot ... B) Use your answer in A) to find a function Y = kU^n that fit to the datapoints (Ui, Yi) The U datapoints is: (600000, 200000, 60000, 10000, 2500) The Y datapoints is: (250, 60, 25, 12, 5) I've done this:               data2 = {{Log[2500], Log[5]}, {Log[10000], Log[12]}, {Log[60000],         Log[25]}, {Log[200000], Log[60]}, {Log[600000], Log[250]}}          fitExample = Fit[data2, {1, x}, x]      Am I right to be using the Fit function this way? How can I use this answer in the B question?
