I'm a junior developer and I find it hard to estimate how much time it takes to finish a bigger software project. I know how to structure the architecture in general, but it's hard for me to know what details I have to do and what problems I have to solve. So it's hard to estimate how much time it will take to finish a bigger project, because I don't know what problems I need to solve and how long it takes to solve them. How do I explain this to a person that is **not a software developer**?
