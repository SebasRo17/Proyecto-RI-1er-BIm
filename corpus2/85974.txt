I am working for a company as a web dev consultant at the moment, and they asked me whether I want to get payed through the Umbrella company or through my Ltd. Which is better for me and why? The @David Thornley made a good point in comments. Don't forget that we are talking about web developing here. I am not sure how is it in UK, but in the country I am from, you get taxed differently for the stuff you do.
