Is there a more general concept or name for what WPF calls "dependency properties"? I imagine this is not a WPF-ism and in fact other libraries or frameworks have employed a similar approach? If so, what are these other instances and what are the similarities and differences compared to Microsoft's dependency properties? I am at a junction where I'm considering adding "dependency properties" to my own type system and object model (unrelated to WPF), as the construction seems appropriate for my design requirements; however, I want to consider what others have created as well, not just WPF's particular implementation.
