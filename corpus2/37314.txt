I have a Mathematica script               table=ParallelTable[f[u],{u,0,40,.5}]     Export["filename.csv",table]      that computes and exports a table of a rather complicated function f. I execute it using the "math -script table.m&" command. As it takes a very long time to calculate this table, I would like to abort the calculation. Is there any way, to obtain the information that has already been calculated so far?
