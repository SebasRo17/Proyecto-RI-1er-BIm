When interacting with Mathematica, I often find myself staring blankly at waves of curly braces, trying to understand how data is organized hierarchically. For example, the beginning of the result to               WolframAlpha["temperature in Toronto yesterday", "DataRules"]      looks like this: ![Waves of curly braces](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3Trq8.png) To visualize the hierarchy, I typically turn to TreeForm, but that's often unwieldy. There's no way to collapse parts of the tree you don't care about (as there would be in, say, a file system browser), so the visualization frequently spreads well off screen or is illegibly small. For example,               TreeForm[WolframAlpha["temperature in Toronto yesterday", "DataRules"]]      produces: ![TreeForm of a WolframAlpha query](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TmeJ4.png) Is there a better way?
