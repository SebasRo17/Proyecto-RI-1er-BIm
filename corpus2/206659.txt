I use a JSON file to populate several drop down lists. The format is:                   {             "value" :"lightyear",             "name" :"Light Year(yl)"         },         {             "value" :"astronomicalUnit",             "name" :"Astronomical Unit(AU, UA)"         },      and so on. I'd like to implement a search box so a user can type "Light year", "lightyear", "lightyears" etc etc. I want to make it possible for them to search for a particular unit. The immediate problem I can see is that I've used camel casing for pretty much all values except those displayed in the drop down boxes. There are two options, I think... Either run the search on the value key of the JSON and search for parts of it so "AU" would still yield Astronomical Unit or to use the value. The other option is to use the value which I think will overcomplicate things. It's not something I've done before and not sure which direction to go in?
