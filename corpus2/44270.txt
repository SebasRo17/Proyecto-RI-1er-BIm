I have data that is in four columns. The x y and z are just the coordinates and the fourth is my data. This is not a function. This is electron density in a copper cell and I'm trying to display it in a way that makes sense. Any help would be appreciated. I was semi-successful in gnuplot but it was hard to see and I could only specify certain boundaries. using `($1:$2:($4>0 && $4<2 ? $3/0)` This might be slightly wrong, but you get the picture. I was saying to only plot z if the data was between certain bounds. There must be a better way and I need your help. Thanks. Here is the structure. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f2m3U.png)
