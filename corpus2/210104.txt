I have a class with a lot of methods. I would like to group similar methods together in their own class, but _all_ of the methods need to extend another class, _ClassC_. So I was thinking of having _ClassA_ , which contains the first group of methods, extend _ClassB_ , which extends Class_C, etc. Is this inefficient in terms of runtime performance, or are they virtually the same? Note: there will be hundreds of instances of this class running at once, so I would really not want to waste memory.
