**Background** I'm currently automating some tests for a plugin for MS Office. We are creating Coded UI tests in VS 2010. I suppose I could use the " _Coded UI test builder_ " tool, but it does not really suit my particular case. Because of this I created my own UI Map class and extension methods for each UI Control/Map where I add different action functionality. For example press buttons or assert some UI values. The scenarios of the test cases are in the test classes. I am new in this area and also I'm new in working as a automation tester. **The question** Would people be kind enough to share their experience and advice for some good practices for test automation on desktop applications from a programming/design point of view?
