`HistogramDistribution` takes a list of data points, creates a histogram from them, and returns this histogram in a form that can be used as a distribution. I already have the binned data, and I do not have the original data points. How can I create a distribution object equivalent to a histogram distribution using this binning data? Let's assume we have the binned data in the same format that `HistogramList` returns. Example data: `bins = N@HistogramList@RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], 1000]`.
