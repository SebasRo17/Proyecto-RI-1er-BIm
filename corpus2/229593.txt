def printMax(a, b):        if a > b:        print(a, 'is maximum')        elif a == b:        print(a, 'is equal to', b)        else:        print(b, 'is maximum')          printMax(3, 4) # directly give literal values     x = 5     y = 7     printMax(x, y) # give variables as arguments      I'm learning python via the byte of python book, and the author uses this example to introduce us to functions. When the author calls the function printMax, he does not use quotation for the numbers 3,4 i.e. he does not use printMax("3","4") which I thought was fine. However, later on he defines a function like so               def say(message, times = 1)        print(message * times)          say("hello", 3)      why does he use the quotations for the message (i.e. why does he use say("hello", 3) instead of say(hello, 3)? How does python notice the difference?
