So after one has programmed and integrated a licensing solution into his or her application, how should one deal with licensing errors? My understanding is: Show whether a license is valid or invalid - and report if the license server is not reachable. Nothing more, nothing less. Licenses could be invalid due to a variety of reasons: Invalid Machine-Code, maximum number of activations reached, invalid licensed version... But should we report them to the user or just tell him "okay", "not okay" or "license server not reachable"? I don't know if this is the right place to ask, maybe security.stackexchange.com is more suitable, but that could be true for ux.stackexchange.com, too... So I'm asking it here.
