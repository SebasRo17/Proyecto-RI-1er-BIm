How can I get Mathematica to simplify the true and false clauses for If[] statements? For example:               bar[a_] := a     FullSimplify[If[a > b, bar[a], bar[b]]]      > If[a > b, bar[a], bar[b]] I was hoping for at least If[a>b, a, b]. I thought that it might be hesitating to simplify bar[] because of possible side effects in the function, but I noticed this:               FullSimplify[If[a + a + a > b + b + b, a + a + a, b + b + b]]      > If[a > b, a + a + a, b + b + b] Note that the conditional clause was simplified, but nothing else was. But if the form is _slightly_ different, it will simplify:               FullSimplify[If[a > b, a - a + a, b - b + b]]      > {a a > b   >  {b True How can I get simplified expressions within If statements? I feel like I'm missing something very basic.
