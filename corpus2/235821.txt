For example with:   Total population = 400000   Number of villages = 800   The average population is 500 How can I randomize the amount of people in each village using a specified deviation (eg +-50) so that it equals the total population? I came up with a solution using this normal distribution class   Basically I created a normal distribution and used the Probability Density Function to determine the amount of villages at each discrete level (until the population total was hit). This is something I wrote quickly to demonstrate:                NormalDist dist = new NormalDist(500.0, 50.0);      int popX = 500;      int numberOfPopXVillages = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor(dist.PDF(popX) * 800)); ;      int totalSum = 0;      do      {          Console.WriteLine(numberOfPopXVillages);          totalSum += popX * numberOfPopXVillages;          totalSum += (1000 - popX) * numberOfPopXVillages;          ++popX;          numberOfPopXVillages = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Floor(dist.PDF(popX) * 800));      } while (numberOfPopXVillages >= 5);      Console.WriteLine(totalSum);      The total sum here is 400000. The algorithm isn't perfect but I'll keep working on it. Thanks everyone.
