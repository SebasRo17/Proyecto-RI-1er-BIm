Currently for school we are working on a research project. The central question of this project is: Which architectural patterns can be detected using static code analysis? With architectural pattern is meant the architectural patterns from the book: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture written by Martin Fowler. During our literature research we didn't find any studies/articals/journals that adress this problem. So for our approach for this rpoject we where thinking to create a prototype of this kind of tool. But first we have to know if there are any (open-source)tools with the same functionality?(detect architectural patterns with a static code analysis) So my question is do you know a tool that kind detect architectural patterns? We know of the existence of tools that can detect design patterns of the Gang of Four. And do you have any suggestions for our approach? Thanks in advance
