I want to get the Permutations on the elements of a list. Then I'm doing this:               a = Drop[Permutations[Range[1, 16], 2], {1, 17}]     i = 15;     While[i <= (240 - 16), a = Drop[a, {i, i}]; i = (i + (16 - 1))]      The first line of the code gives me all the permutations, but I do not want repetitions, like: I already have `{1,2}`, I do not want the `{2,1}`. I'm trying to do this way but there's no result yet. Any help?
