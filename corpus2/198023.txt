In most MVC frameworks, Controller class contains multiple methods, each representing one action. Then annotations and reflection is used to call those methods appropriately. But from OOP point of view, the whole class has many responsibilities, eg. one for each action. Then each action should be represented by it's own class. Does MVC framework that implements actions like this exist? And is there some kind of discussion that discusses pros and cons of both approaches? I believe it would be much cleaner to do it class-way, because it would allow simple extensibility through inheritance without need for annotations. But there would be 'overhead' of many more classes, making it harder to maintain the code.
