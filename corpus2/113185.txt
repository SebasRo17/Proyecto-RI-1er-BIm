Being new to Java I'd like to use the following scenario to steer my learning and could use some advice! First I want to build a Java server app that handles login and client settings, and based on client info pulls up random database entries and sends these random entries to the client on a timer. This must work for many clients, each on their own private timers against the main database, and just keeps looping on timers so it's not a one-shot lookup. Second I want the client to stay logged in all day, and to notify and maybe popup locally with the info from the server. This popup will be a small input form which is then sent back to the server. I can't do this as a web page because I want it to run any time the client wants to start the local app. This could possibly be used as a calendar, meeting planner or schedule notifier for clients which are my user stories. Suggestions on appropriate design patterns and techniques appreciated!
