If I have some string data:               text = StringTake[ExampleData[{"Text", "DeclarationOfIndependence"}], 400]      > "When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to > dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to > assume, among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to > which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect > to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes > which impel them to the sepa" This is what I use to find a specific pattern inside and grab a bit more data around it:               StringCases[text, (y__ /;StringLength[y] == 4) ~~ "entitle" ~~ x__ /;StringLength[x] == 5]      > >     {"God entitle them"} >   **Are there any alternatives, desirably neater ones? Maybe something with regular expressions?**
