do you know of any algorithms which give an exact solution for the Traveling Purchaser Problem. I can only find heuristic and probabilistic approaches. I do have implemented a genetic algorithm so far, which by its nature does not terminate by itself an does not always yield the optimal result. Thus I'm looking for an exact solution to the problem such that I'm able to compare my solution to an exact / optimal value for a given test data set. For those of you who haven't heard of the Traveling Purchaser Problem (TPP), _this is_ **_not_** _the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)_ , but a generalization of it. It thus is also NP-hard.
