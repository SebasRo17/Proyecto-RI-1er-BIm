I have several functions, let's assume they are:               func1[x_]=x;     func2[x_]=3*x-5;     func3[x_]=0.1*x^2;      and a lot more like these. For each and every one of these I want to do the following               xvalues = Range[0, 500, 2.5];     points1 = Map[func1, xvalues];     Do[If points1[[[i]] < 0, points1[[i]] = 0, points1[[i]] = points1[[i]],       {i, 1,  Length[points1]}]     table1 = Transpose[{xvalues, points1}];      Now seeing as I have a lot of these functiones, is there any way to automate this in some kind of routine? While answering, please be aware that I don't really have any extensive Mathematica knowledge.
