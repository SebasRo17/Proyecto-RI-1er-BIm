I've been working on a problem where I need to integrate a function numerically. The function is quite complex and it takes almost an hour for _Mathematica_ to make a plot. To speed the process up I thought that I could implement a parallel NIntegrate function using _ParallelTable[]_. I believe I successfully accomplished that for single numerical values for the limits of the integration but there's something wrong since when I try to make a plot I got a bunch of errors. Here's my code, where instead of my horrible integrand I used the function $f(x)=x$               ParalellNIntegrate[imin_?NumericQ, imax_?NumericQ] :=       (step = (imax - imin)/4;        Total[         ParallelTable[          NIntegrate[u, {u, i, i+step}], {i, imin, imax - step, step}]         ]);     Plot[ParalellNIntegrate[0, x], {x, -1, 1}]          (kernel 2) NIntegrate::nlim: u = 0.25 x is not a valid limit of integration.          (kernel 1) NIntegrate::nlim: u = 0.75 x is not a valid limit of integration.          (kernel 2) NIntegrate::nlim: u = 0.5 x is not a valid limit of integration.          (kernel 1) NIntegrate::nlim: u = x is not a valid limit of integration.          (kernel 2) NIntegrate::nlim: u = i+0.25 x is not a valid limit of integration.          (kernel 1) NIntegrate::nlim: u = i+0.25 x is not a valid limit of integration.          (kernel 1) General::stop: Further output of NIntegrate::nlim will be suppressed during this calculation.          (kernel 2) General::stop: Further output of NIntegrate::nlim will be suppressed during this calculation.      Can somebody help me? PS: I also have this doubt about the step and I think I could use this post to clear it (I do realize that I shouldn't post more than one question per post but it's somehow related and it seems silly to open a post just for this). I divided the interval of integration in 4 regions since my cpu only works with 4 threads could somebody tell me if I'm thinking correctly?
