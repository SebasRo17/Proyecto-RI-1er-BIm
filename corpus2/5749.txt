I work as the back-end developer, front-end developer, systems admin, help desk and all-around 'guy who knows computers' at a small marketing company of about 15 people. I was wondering if others could share their experiences flying solo at companies that aren't necessarily inclined toward the technology industry. I originally took the job in order to transition from front-end developer/designer to full-time coder. It's been a good experience to a point. I definitely get to occupy the role of 'rock star' programmer - because frankly, no one really understands my job. Lately, it feels like a very solitary position. I rarely get to bounce ideas off of people, and everyone looks to me like I have magic powers that will make all the computers work and land us first on Google searches. I've also felt a strong disconnect versus between what we say we want (projects with large, months-long development schedules) versus what we actually do (copy- edit our sites over and over). So who else finds themselves being the 'tech guy' in a company that thinks technology is all a bit magical, and what is your take on your situation?
