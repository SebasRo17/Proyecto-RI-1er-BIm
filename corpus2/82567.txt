My workflow has always been to write one logical step and then run the program and inspect the output. This process have served me incredibly well for assignments in university. However, as I do more development, there are often times when simply compiling and running your code takes 1 to 2 minutes. Examples include uploading a program to a microcontroller, requiring interaction with an external server, and unable to implement automation due to authentication, software architecture, or complexity. These types of tasks are very unsuitable to how I usually program, and I'm having difficulties coding effectively. I usually make a lot of syntax errors and logic errors, most of which I easily catch by testing. However, with such a long wait time, this method is too time consuming.
