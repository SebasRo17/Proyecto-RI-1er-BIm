I've just realised that I've spent more time browsing Programmers.SE than actually doing the exercises I should be doing for my Computer Science degree this hour - they aren't coursework, just timetabled, supported, lab sessions - this time basic SQL SELECT statements. I already know SQL, but I have trouble writing syntactically correct statements first time. The exercises are along the form of "Write a query to get the names of all the pets born more than 10 years ago sorted by owner surname". Is it bad that I'm doing this? I think this is more useful than those exercises, but I'm not too sure.
