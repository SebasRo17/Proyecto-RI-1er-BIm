Scenario: I have a configuration file containing some structured data that is loaded in at runtime and is **not** modified by the application, but is referenced in many places. There are functions that retrieve specific data from the configuration file (after it's been loaded into memory). I'd like to write unit tests that ensure that data has not been changed inadvertently by a developer, is this good practice or overkill? E.g. `Assert(GetDataForKey("SomeKey") == "MyValue")`
