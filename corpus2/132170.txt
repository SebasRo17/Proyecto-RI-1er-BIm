I'm a Java developer and I'm going to start working with Android to get familiar with mobile apps. I've worked with Ajax toolkits, but haven't done any mobile development. I've seen a huge change in development on certain toolkits where the learning curve really jumps up, as in GWT 1.5 versus 2.4. I'm just wanting to jump in and get the basics (along with best practices) down for now. I don't know if Android 2 versus version 4 would do that, but version 4 might just throw in extra features that I might not need to know about for now and take away from my main focus. Is it better to go with the latest version of Android or, to make sure the fundamentals are covered, take an older version that would be easier to get in and start developing with?
