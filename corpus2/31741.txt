**Short version:** What's the simplest way to use MacPorts' gcc with `CreateLibrary`? **Long version:** `CreateLibrary` uses `/usr/bin/gcc` by default on OS X. I can get it to use `clang` by using the option `"CompilerName" -> "clang++"` or `"CompilerName" -> "c++"` (I'm using C++). However, I would like to use MacPorts' gcc because it boosts the performance significantly for this particular program I need to compile. `"CompilerName" -> "g++-mp-4.7"` tells me that > CreateLibrary::instl: The compiler installation directive > "CompilerInstallation" -> "/usr/bin" does not indicate a usable installation > of "GCC" So I tried `"CompilerInstallation" -> "/opt/local/bin"`, which is the location of `g++-mp-4.7`. This results in the same error: > CreateLibrary::instl: The compiler installation directive > "CompilerInstallation" -> "/opt/local/bin" does not indicate a usable > installation of "GCC" Is there a simpler solution than using GenericCCompiler?
