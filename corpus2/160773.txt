In am reading Spring in Action (3rd edition) and here a snippet from it:               ApplicationContext ctx=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("springidol.xml");                 Performer performer=(Performer)ctx.getBean("poeticDuke");                 performer.perform();      It doesn't has any problem,however, when the author introduce the init-method and destroy-method:               <bean id="poeticDuke"             class="com.springinaction.springidol.PoeticJuggler"             init-method="turnOnLights"             destroy-method="turnOffLights">      Somehow the output only got the init-method but not the destroy-method. Then I realized that the context call destroy-method upon its close and I tried to code as following:                   ApplicationContext ctx=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("springidol.xml");                     Performer performer=(Performer)ctx.getBean("poeticDuke");                     performer.perform();     ctx.close();      It doesn't compile because the interface ApplicationContext doesn't have the method close. It only work as following:               ClassPathXmlApplicationContext ctx=new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("springidol.xml");                     Performer performer=(Performer)ctx.getBean("poeticDuke");                     performer.perform();     ctx.close();      Why did the author wrote it that way?
