I want to compute $(t^1+\dots +t^5)(t^2+\dots+ t^6)(t^3+\dots +t^9)$ and find the coefficient of $t^{15}$ for example. $t$ is an indeterminate Now in _Maple_ this is simply as               p:=sum(t^i,i=1..5)*sum(t^i,i=2..6)*sum(t^i,i=3..9);     coeff(p,t,15);      But I can't seem to learn how to do this in _Mathematica_. I have tried using               Series[ %, {t, 1, 10}] * Series[ %, {t, 4, 20}] * Series[ %, {t, 6, 15}]      But it outputs a number(I don't know what this number even is) Where can I find documentation to solve such a problem?
