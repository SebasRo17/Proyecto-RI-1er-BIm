I have a list called diff1:               axis = Table[i, {i, 1, 20}];     data1 = Table[Sin[i/(2*Pi)], {i, 1, 20}];     model1[t_] := a*Sin[b*t];     model1points = Map[model1, axis];     diff1 = (model1points - data1)^2;      One example of the entry of diff1: (a Sin[3 b] - Sin[3/(2*Pi)])^2 I want to minimize the elements of this list with respect to `a` and `b`. How can I do that?
