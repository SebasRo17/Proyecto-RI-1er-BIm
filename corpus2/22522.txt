I have a nested list of numbers like { {36, -244}, {37, -225}, {38, -197}, {48, -200}, {49, -181}, {50, -133} } which needs to be further nested into "bins" according to a rule. I would describe the rule like: Elements belong into one bin when their first sub-elements (36, 37, 38 vs. 48, 49, 50) can form a chain of successive integers or in other words, if arranged from lowest to highest there is no "hole" greater than 1 in the so formed bins. In the following step, how can I tell Mathematica to average the second sub-elements (-244, -225...) inside the former defined bins?
