I have a class that will have a number of external methods that will all call the same smaller set of internal methods. So something like: obj.method_one(a, c) and obj.method_two(a, c) where obj.method_one calls obj._internal_method(a, c, y) and obj.method_two calls obj._internal_method(a, c, z). They're nearly identical but they have one argument at the end that differs on the internal call (which is a constant). I could just copy and paste a few times but I was wondering if theres any way to dynamically create these external methods.
