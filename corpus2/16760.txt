I must do a quick assessment of dozens of fresh students very quickly. I have 30 minutes meeting with each of them (in two or three days). I want to use most of the time to discuss non technical aspects. So I plan to use 10 minutes for technical questions. The same questions for all of them. They are all _hired_ already (they are students), what I need to know is the average level in order to prepare a training. Ideally, the difficulty `must be progressive` in order to set a level for each. Level I will average, and I'll do an average on each question too. **If you had only 10 minutes and 10 questions to ask to a candidate, what would be your top 10 ?**
