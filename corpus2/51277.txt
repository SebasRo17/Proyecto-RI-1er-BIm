I would like to calculate the following recursion with mathematica $$f_n(x)=\int_{B}^{A}f_{n-1}(x-\omega)f(\omega)\mbox{d}\omega\quad\quad f_1(w):=f(w)$$ This is simply the convolution of $f$ with itself in the range $(B,A)$. I think it is possible to rewrite this in ordinary convolution form as $$f_n(x)=\int_{B}^{A}f_{n-1}(x-\omega)f(\omega)\mbox{d}\omega=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{n-1}(x-\omega)f(\omega)1_{\{B<\omega<A\}}\mbox{d}\omega\\=\int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{n-1}(x-\omega)g(\omega)\mbox{d}\omega\quad\mbox{with}\quad g(\omega)=f(\omega)1_{\{B<\omega<A\}}$$ which says that $f_n$ is obtained by convolving $f_{n-1}$ with $g$ $$f_n=f_{n-1}(*)g$$ this corresponds to multiplication at the Fourier domain $$F_n=F_{n-1}G$$ For $n=2$ we have $F_2=F_{1}G=FG$. For $n=3$, $F_3=F_{2}G=F_{1}GG=FG^2$, continuing like this we get $$F_n=F G^{n-1}$$ First of all I wonder if what I have done is correct or is there something missing or incorrect? Next I wrote a code in mathematica as follows to implement this for $n=3$. I wanted it for all $n$ but it didnt work. Here is the code:               Needs["FourierSeries`"]     opts = {Method -> {Automatic, "SymbolicProcessing" -> None},AccuracyGoal -> 8}     a = 2;     b = -2;     f1[x_] := Evaluate@PDF[NormalDistribution[2, 2], x]     g1[x_] := f1[x]*(UnitStep[x - b]*UnitStep[-x + a])     ff1[u_] = FourierTransform[f1[x], x, u, FourierParameters -> {1, 1}]     gg1[u_] = FourierTransform[g1[x], x, u, FourierParameters -> {1, 1}]     den[x_?NumericQ] := NInverseFourierTransform[ff1[u]*gg1[u]^2, u, x,FourierParameters -> {1, 1}, Evaluate@opts]     NIntegrate[den[x], {x, -8, b}, Evaluate@opts]     0.00463943 - 1.7541*10^-18 I      The result should however be $0.00397888$. For $n=2$ namely when               den[x_?NumericQ] := NInverseFourierTransform[ff1[u]*gg1[u]^1, u, x,FourierParameters -> {1, 1}, Evaluate@opts]     NIntegrate[den[x], {x, -8, b}, Evaluate@opts]     0.0105702 + 9.00034*10^-18 I      I get the correct result.. I am really confused. Can anybody see what is the problem here? Thank you very much in advance.
