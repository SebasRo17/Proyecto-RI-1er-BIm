I sometimes post code to PhysicsSE, and I usually convert it to `InputForm` first before posting, in order to avoid pages and pages of `RowBox` and `Offset` fluff. I usually instruct the user to copy/paste it into a new notebook, and use `Cell` > `Convert To` > `StandardForm` in order to get everything properly formatted. Unfortunately, this does not always work. For example, consider the following `StandardForm` code:               Q = Sum[Array[a[10 k], {3}], {k, 4}] // MatrixForm // TeXForm      It looks fine, and in this case there isn't any need to convert to `InputForm`, but that's just because this is meant to be a minimal example. Now let's convert it to `InputForm` (on Mac OSX, this is performed via `Command`+`Shift`+`I`):               Q = \text {MatrixForm}\left[\sum _k^4 \text {Array}[           a (10 k), \{3\}] \r ight]      This is, of course, completely un-runnable, and executing `Cell`>`Convert To`>`StandardForm` fails to produce the original expression, let alone anything which is syntactically correct. Why is this? Is this a glitch with the front end's implementation of `Convert To`? Or am I doing something wrong? The very similar expression               Q = Sum[Array[a[10 k], {3}], {k, 4}] // MatrixForm      gets converted via `InputForm` to               Q = MatrixForm[Sum[charge[[k]]*f[position[[k]]], {k, 4}]]      which is, of course, correct; this makes me suspect that the front-end is getting tripped up by the sequence of two `//` operators. More generally, what do you recommend is the best way to copy and paste Mathematica code to StackExchange sites?
