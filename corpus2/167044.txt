I am looking for an expert programmer to help solve a difficult situation. The interviews so far have been surprisingly disappointing. The best candidate so far is a very experienced programmer who has never used version control software. The problem in itself might not be too serious because it is something which can be learned in a short time. But there is a deeper aspect, which worries me: How is it possible to actively develop software for 10-15 years without ever needing version control? Is the fact itself of not looking for a solution to the problem of tracking changes a sign of a wrong attitude to programming?
