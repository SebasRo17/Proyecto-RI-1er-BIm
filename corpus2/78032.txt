I have a simple encryption/decryption application that I am testing to learn more about security. I found out that if the user modifies the encrypted file, then decryption fails because the hashing algorithm doesn't generate back the original content. What are the common practices that deal with the problem of encrypted files modified by users either intentionally or unintentionally? The only thing I can think of is timestamp checking, but I am not sure how useful that is. About my last statement, I guess I am not sure if there is a way to trick the OS so that the new timestamp is set back to the exact old time stamp although the content is modified.
