**When using TDD, is it bad practice to pass a newly written test with code that could also pass another test?** For example, take the following test (in PHP)               public function WhenSomethingIsNull_ThrowsException()     {         $input = null;         $this->module->someMethod($input);     }      This could be made to pass with the following code               public function someMethod($input)     {         if(!$input)             throw new Exception()     }      This would also pass the test `WhenSomethingIsZero_ThrowsException`. In these cases, should I fix what I know is wrong with this test in the refactoring step? Or only write code which passes this and only this test?
