I am sure there is a term for the following bit of refactoring, but I can't remember it and my Google-fu is failing me! The refactor moves if statements to where they are going to have most impact, for example changing this               $test = someFunctionThatReturnsABool();     for($x = 0; $x < 10000; $x++) {         if ($test) {              echo $x;          }     }      To this               $test = someFunctionThatReturnsABool();     if ($test) {         for($x = 0; $x < 10000; $x++) {             echo $x;          }     }
