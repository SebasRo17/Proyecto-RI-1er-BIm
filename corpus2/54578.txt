The `Plot` option `GridLines` can be specified either as a list of explicit values at which to draw the lines, or as a **function** that calculates the grid lines based on the maximum and minimum values along each axis. In _Mathematica_ version 8, I was able to specify this function for `GridLines` in two equivalent ways:               Clear[gridLineFunction];     gridLineFunction[xmin_, xmax_] := {.1, .2, .5};          Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 1}, GridLines -> gridLineFunction]      ![lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tuluz.png) This follows the example in the documentation, but for simplicity it returns a fixed list of numbers without doing any calculations at all. However, now I rewrite the above by passing it directly to `GridLines` as a `Function`:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 1},       GridLines -> Function[{xmin, xmax}, {.1, .2, .5}]]      ![no lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jb44u.png) This last line is what I get in **version 10** on OS X. It _used to work_ in version 8. And the equivalent construct _still works_ for the `Ticks` option:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 1}, Ticks -> Function[{xmin, xmax}, {.1, .2, .5}]]      ![ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UknOh.png) Is there any reason I'm overlooking why this `Function` approach no longer works in `GridLines`, or is this a bug?
