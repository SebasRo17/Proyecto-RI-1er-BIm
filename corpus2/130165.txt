While working on multitouch, one of the problems I've run into is the fact that nobody seems to do gesture recognition without some kind of init event, whether it's a mouseclick or contact with a capacitive touchscreen. Is it possible to do an "always listening" gesture handler? If so, how to do it without mirroring input in realtime and thereby imposing gloomy processor overheads? Is there some kind of downsampling (ie take every nth input from the cursor)?
