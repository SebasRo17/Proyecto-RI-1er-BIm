This seems to be a quite a simple problem but I cannot make it work.   I am trying to find all values within a given range for which the real part of the Zeta function vanishes on the line: $\;z=\frac{1}{2} + i\;y$. Given the following plot:               Plot[{ Re[ Zeta[ 1/2 + I t]]}, {t, 14, 14.6}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/msoer.gif) I would like to get the values: $14.13...\;, 14.5....$.
