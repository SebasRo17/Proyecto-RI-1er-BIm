Say this is my list:               mylist={{1,4},{1,6},{1,11},{2,12},{2,14}}      I want to do an operation that looks at the first element of each pairs, and for all those that match, average their second elements, and put that "first element and averaged second elements" pair in a new list. So my final product would be:               newlist={{1,7},{2,13}}      A caveat however is that the first elements are not obvious integers like in my example. They could be any number and would not easily be iterated over as they would be in my example. I imagine I could do this with loops but I was wondering if there was a more elegant Mathematica "list-manipulation" way. Thank you!
