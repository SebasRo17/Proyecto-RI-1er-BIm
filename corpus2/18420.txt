I have a package I want to distribute. I wrote the package in Version 9 under a Mac OS X operating system. I want to `Encode[]` the package. The end user will run the package on a full Mathematica Version 9 license running on a Windows OS. As I don't have access to a Windows machine to test this I wondered if anyone knew whether Encode[] is operating system specific? Will a package encoded on OS X run on Windows?
