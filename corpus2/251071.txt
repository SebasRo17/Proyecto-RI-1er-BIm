I've been trying to develop web applications while at the same time creating the testing. I understand unit testing, I can declare a test method and test specific methods in my application. But I don't see what is the best way to use selenium web driver for testing. I tried to test the a specific site for broken links or broken images and I had to use an external http connection library since selenium doesn't provide header results etc. It is very slow to traverse a whole site. While you can just pass the URL to W3C link checker and you're done. Are most developers creating a class for each page and testing individual ui elements since traversing the whole site is a lot more complicated. What are the benefits selenium brings or ui testing that can't be tested for with unit testing?
