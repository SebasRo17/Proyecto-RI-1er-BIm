I use the `CustomTicks` package, because the built-in tick labeling leaves a lot to be desired. Even just putting the tick marks on the right instead of the left is a real pain without `CustomTicks`, from what I remember. I think this would be an issue even without this package, though. Here is what I type in:               << "CustomTicks`"     Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Ï€},        Frame -> True, Axes -> False,        FrameTicks -> {Automatic, StripTickLabels[LinTicks], Automatic, LinTicks},       BaseStyle -> 18]      and here is what I get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tFmfP.png) I think the tick marks on the right look awful. They would be better if aligned on the decimal rather than on the left. But how do I fix this? My current workaround is to make another version of the plot with tick labels on the left, which usually are aligned properly because they align to the right. Then I cut the labels from that image and paste them onto the image I want. Any other solution?
