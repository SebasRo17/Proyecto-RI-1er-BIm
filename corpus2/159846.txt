I am reading 'The Standard C Library' by PJ Plauger which is really interesting. The book explains not only how to USE the library but also how it is implemented. I have finished reading the `ctype.h` section and in the header the functions are declared as both macros AND functions. For example               int isdigit(int);      but also               #define isdigit(c) (_Ctype[(int)(c)] & _DI)      I don't understand why BOTH are used? Also, if I try to recreate my own custom `ctype` header and implementation, I can only compile successfully if I remove the macro (comment out the define). This aspect was not really explained in the book. Can someone please explain?
