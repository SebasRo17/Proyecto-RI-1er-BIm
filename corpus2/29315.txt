I am hoping to evaluate the following integral               Integrate[((r^3 - 7)^(2/3)*(1 - (r^3 - 7)^(2/3)/r^2))/r^3, {r, 2, Infinity}]      but Mathematica informs me that this integral "does not converge on {2,$\infty$}." However, the numerical integration command               NIntegrate[((r^3 - 7)^(2/3)*(1 - (r^3 - 7)^(2/3)/r^2))/r^3, {r, 2, Infinity}]      yields `0.139837` without mention of any difficulties. Which should I believe?
