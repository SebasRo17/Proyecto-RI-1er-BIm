Earlier, I asked a question about how to measure the quality of a project. The outcome of that question was that the quality of the project can be divided into two parts:   * Internal quality (code quality, measurable by code quality metrics)    * External quality (Acceptance test, how well the software meets the requirements) So based on that, I want to set up some research and validate the outcome of the project. The problem is, I will conduct this research on my own, so it's not possible to run the project once in BDD style and the other one in waterfall by myself. It's also not possible to compare BDD and waterfall projects on a larger scale, due to the fact that there are not enough BDD projects that can be measured because of the age of BDD. So, my question is: did anybody face this problem? How could I execute my experiment in such a way that it is of scientific value?
