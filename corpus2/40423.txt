I have a somewhat long computation running in the background. I would like the Mathematica icon on the taskbar to flash once the computation is done. For example, Microsoft Outlook reminders make the taskbar flash: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cZXRE.png) How can I achieve the same effect in Mathematica? Is there a Mathematica command that makes the Mathematica icon in the taskbar flash? **What I've tried:** `Beep[]` can be useful, but if you leave the computer for a while, you can miss the beep. The advantage of flashing is that it remains flashing indefinitely. Another alternative is `MessageDialog[]`, but you have no way of knowing that a message is up if Mathematica is minimized. It would be useful if `MessageDialog[]` produced the flashing in the taskbar, but that doesn't happen.
