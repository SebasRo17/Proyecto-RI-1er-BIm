I'm creating the design for a browser bookmark merging program and I've ran into a design problem that I've seen before yet I've never come up with a good solution for it. So lets say I have a Browser class:               Browser:       String bookmarkFilePath       String type       Bool bookmarkFileExists()      When my program runs I will want to have hard-coded values of common browsers and the locations of their Bookmarks file:               Object with hard-coded values:       "~/Library/Application Support/Google/Default/Bookmarks", "Chrome"       "~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist", "Safari"      **Is there a design pattern or object type that could effectively take an object with hard-coded values (Browser name / bookmarks file path) and uses it to instantiate (and possibly manage) other (Browser) objects?** Also, flexibility is important since there are edge cases such as Firefox's file path to the bookmarks file is always different and some searching needs to be done. **EDIT: I will be implementing this in Python. _Sorry for not mentioning this before_.**
