I took a Class in college (A.I.) and I found it pretty interesting, but didn't go much further than that (I graduated that semester so I wasn't able to take any more classes). So it's something that's been kind of coming back up as a "side" interest that I kinda wanted to study on my own, I have a ton of e-books and documents but the problem is they are VERY advanced and extremely math/algorithm heavy (which I can understand).....however none of them really explain how you would go about it 'code wise'......so I guess what Im asking is, is their a beginner resource to this kinda stuff (Bayesian Networks/Machine learning/Neural Networks) and such that isn't SO math heavy. I understand why the math is there, but when it doesn't really explain how you would go about 'programming' such a system.....well it gets kind of confusing to move forward with.
