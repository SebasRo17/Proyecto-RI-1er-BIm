So I've had a few situations now where programmers have passed the interview teams with flying colors, only to find when they arrive on scene, they demonstrate an extreme touchiness any time any criticism is leveled their way. I'm not talking about off-day irritability, but a 24/7 bruised ego thing. For certain employees this pertains to code review feedback, but others it can even include debugging suggestions (even if they're right). How do you filter out touchy candidates during the interview process in a manner that won't get you in trouble with HR? (I'm thinking something far short of Blade Runner here). Additionally, how can you help those types of programmers better deal with both real and perceived criticisms?
