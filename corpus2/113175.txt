> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How can I find a good open source project to join? I've heard allot about open source software and would love to help the community and gain experience in software development. The problem is, I'm kind of a beginner. I have some experience in Obj- C, Java, and Ruby. How can I be useful, and how can I, say, fix bugs ? Could you recommend some simple software that I could look at and learn from, then try to help?
