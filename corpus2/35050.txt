I would like to create some density functions based on some distance measure $D$. As a base density function lets say I have a Gaussian density $f$ with mean $-1$ and variance $1$. I would like to create some smooth and nice density functions $g$ randomly which are at least $\epsilon$ close to my base density $f$. The set of all possible densities can be written down as $${\cal{F}}=\\{g_0: D(g,f)\leq \epsilon\\}$$ with $$D(g,f)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(y)\log \left(\frac{g(y)}{f(y)}\right)\mathrm{d}y$$ and since $g$ are densities, we also have additionally $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(y)\mathrm{d}y=1,\quad g(y)>0 \quad\forall y$$ How can I create such $g$ functions in Mathematica? is there a simple way? Thank you very much for reading this post and thanks in advance for any help.
