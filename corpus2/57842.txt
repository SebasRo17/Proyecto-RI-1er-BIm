I'm trying to create a manipulate plot showing the electric field due to a collection of point charges. At the moment I've created such a plot which allows the x and y positions of each charge to be manipulated using sliders, however what I would particularly like to do is to be able to click and drag the points on the plot. I have created locators which can be manipulated like so, however I can't work out how to attach a function to them. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
