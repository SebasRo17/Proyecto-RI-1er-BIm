I've created several systems already, a web based menu system, a payroll system and I am currently developing a patient administration system, I know java,C,C++ C#, javascript PHP and other languages. but the thing here is that I feel I lack knowledge of good math. I am still studying in college but it seems to me that I need to know more about math that concerns programming, what or which part of mathematics should I study for me to improve my programming skills? Algorithm designs? Algorithms? What branch of mathematics?
