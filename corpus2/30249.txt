If one executes the following code               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], InputAliases -> {"aa" ->       "AFunctionWithAVeryLongName[\!\(\*TagBox[FrameBox[\"input\"],\"Placeholder\"]\)]"}]      the front end will change `ESC`+`a`+`a`+`Esc` into a long expression with a placeholder. I want the placeholder selected after the replacement. If I try to use `SelectionPlaceholder`, instead of `Placeholder`, then a character from `AFunctionWithAVeryLongName` gets selected. If I try to include a tab at the end of the string,               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], InputAliases -> {"aa" ->       "AFunctionWithAVeryLongName[\!\(\*TagBox[FrameBox[\"input\"],\"Placeholder\"]\:0009\)]"}]      the tab goes in literally as a tab character, not a tab command. Also, I want the output to have a string, say "input", in the placeholder. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9x4E.png)
