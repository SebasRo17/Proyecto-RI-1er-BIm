I have a function $f(x)=x^7+k$ I want to iterate $xn+1=g(xn)$, 50 times starting with $x0=1$ and keep the last 10 values I want to assign these values to a function `y` and be able to use `y` to calculate this iteration for any input constant $k$, eg $k=0$, $k=0.1$, then store all the corresponding 10 values I have extracted for $k=0$, $k=0.1$, up to 1 in a table. Is this possible? I can't figure it out. I have only done this and I am stuck: `Take[NestList[f, 0, 50], -10]`
