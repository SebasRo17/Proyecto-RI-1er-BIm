Basically I am searching for a way to add the letter `u` to an existing list of variables `{a,b,c,d}` to obtain the variable list `{ua,ub,uc,ud}`. I am trying to make an function for an automatic calculation of the propagation of uncertainty.               U[term_Expression, varlist_Expression] := Sqrt[     Sum[i,{i,     Function[var,       Power[D[term, var], 2]*u] /@ varlist     }]]      The Input `U[a*b, {a, b}]` gives me `Sqrt[a^2*u + b^2*u]` but I want it to be `Sqrt[a^2*ua + b^2*ub]`. Probably this is a very easy task but I am struggling for hours with this small problem. Maybe you know a solution? Thanks! **UPDATE** Made it with               U[term_, varlist_] := Sqrt[Sum[i, {i,      Power[       Function[var,          D[term, var]          ] /@ varlist*        ToExpression[StringInsert[#, "u", 1] & /@ ToString /@ varlist]       , 2]      }]]      Thank you!
