I am working on a stylesheet for a handout I am making and I want to make my own "definition" box format. So I use the "Format"->"Edit Stylesheet" menu option and get the stylesheet inspector. I then type in the name of my new stye name "DefinitionBox" and give it the style that I want. The problem is that when I apply this style it doesn't indent withing the group (ie Section or Subsection) it is in, instead it just spans the full window. For the life of me I can't figure out what option controls this. Any suggestions?
