I am looking for a substitution command which will write out powers of expressions like this: $$\frac{a ~b^3~ c}{d~ e^{3/2}~ f^2}\to \frac{a ~b~b~b~ c}{d~ e^{1/2}~ e^{1/2}~ e^{1/2}~ f~f}$$ mathematica code to experiment with:               (a b^3 c)/(d e^(3/2) f^2)      Please note, this is needed to carry out substitutions on very large expressions, so that a `ComplexityFunction` is not an option since a `Simplify` will take forever to evaluate. **EDIT** I want to do this since I plan to apply substitutions for expressions like $$\frac{a b}{e^{1/2}}\to q ~~~\text{ and } ~~~\frac{b}{e^{1/2}f}\to p$$ which do not get recognized while all the terms are cluttered into one heap. **EDIT2** Maybe, as some point to start with, I should ask how to make mathematica take some literate input without performing any kind of simplification to it. Such that an input $b+b$ would still display as $b+b$ instead of the automatic $2b$? Is this possible?
