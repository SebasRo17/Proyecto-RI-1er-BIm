I'm developing a DBMS that should be able to connect to IBM DB2 via the DRDA protocol. I found a DRDA reference manual that mentions "DRDA Implementation Programmer's Guide, SC21-9529" as a publication about DRDA, and seems that this manual is exactly what I was looking for. The problem is, I am unable to find it on the net. Where can I obtain this document or another comparable document that explains implementing DRDA?
