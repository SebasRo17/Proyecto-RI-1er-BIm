I would like to have two `Graphics` objects displayed side by side such that:   * they are mirror images of each other   * if I change the left-hand one interactively using _Drawing Tools_ , the other one is updated automatically. I can't seem to convince `Dynamic`, `Manipulate` and friends to do this for me. How can I do it? A more basic question would be: how do I create a variable which holds a `Graphics` object and such that its value can be changed interactively using _Drawing Tools_?
