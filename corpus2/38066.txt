I'd like to see how close I can fit an exponential function to a cosine function in the domain of $\;-\frac{\pi}{2}$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in the least squares sense.               FindFit[Cos[x], {A*Exp[l*(Cos[x] - 1)], -π/2 <= x <= π/2}, {A, l},  x]      > >     FindFit::fitd: First argument Cos[x] in FindFit is not a list or a > rectangular array. >   I could create a table for `Cos[x]` to pass as the first parameter but I feel like I'm approaching this wrong and should be able to give _Mathematica_ my problem in symbolic form. Perhaps, I should try Minimize but I didn't get any results out of it.               Minimize[{(Cos[x] - A*Exp[l*(Cos[x] - 1)])^2, -π/2 <= x <= π/2}, {A, l, x}]      > >     Minimize[{(-A E^(l (-1 + Cos[x])) + Cos[x])^2, -π/2 <= x <= π/2}, {A, l, > x}] >
