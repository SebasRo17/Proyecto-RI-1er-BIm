I need to start the design and development of a new framework to interact with an open source ECM. This inludes a customized data model to help web site developers interacting with this ECM, so they don't need to care about the details of nodes manipulation and other low level details. That's just a bunch of classes and methods to develop. I have some doubts about how to handle the organization and managment of that project: Are there some general rules to follow, tips, best practices or something to keep in mind for developing this kind of project? I'm sure there are some difference between the development of a framework or library and an application.
