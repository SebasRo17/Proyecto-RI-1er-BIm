I have the impression that Google has become unusable when searching for programming related questions. Example: I'm Googling for               XML-RPC Redstone Cookie      I'm expecting results where all three terms are contained. I don't care for results where one term misses. I guess until some months ago Google just worked this way, i.e. all terms were included. Somehow this feature is gone now (Google apparently thinks it is more intelligent than the user and knows what the user is searching for). So I helped myself putting a + in front of every word. This is, however, a bit cumbersome. And for the last weeks, it even doesn't work anymore in all cases, Google ignores the +. So how do you search for progamming related problems? Do you still use Google? If yes, which techniques do you use to get the right results? Or do you use another search engine? Which one?
