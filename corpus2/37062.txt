I'm evaluating the integral of a Lorentzian, which I know equals one. First I define the function and evaluate the integral in two slightly different ways. Surprisingly, I do not get the right answer when I do symbolic integration first.               g[x_] := (a/(2*\[Pi]))/((x - x0)^2 + (a/2)^2);          Integrate[g[x], {x, -Infinity, Infinity}] /. {x0 -> 10} /. {a -> 4}      > Undefined               Integrate[g[x] /. {x0 -> 10} /. {a -> 4}, {x, -Infinity, Infinity}]      > 1 What is the issue here?
