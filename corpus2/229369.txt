I use java language to develop android application, after static analysis, the tool warns about high efferent coupling. What is the reason of this warning? Is it about AComModel which is extended by other class? There are 4 classes below which the tool warns us about them. I hope I asked logical question, but I really don't understand what is the problem?               public class AComModel {             public String GetComBusinessKey() {             return "none";         }     }               @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)     public class StepOneCom extends AComModel {              public View vi;         public ArrayList<SummaryViewModel> lstSmr;              @Override         public String GetComBusinessKey() {             return "shvi";         }          }               @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)     public class StepTwoCom extends AComModel {              public ArrayList<AccViewModel> lstAcc;         public SummaryViewModel c1;                   @Override         public String GetComBusinessKey() {             return "shvi";         }          }               @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)     public class StepThreeStepTwoCom extends AComModel {              public StepFourCom stepFourCom;              @Override         public String GetComBusinessKey() {             return "cashadvi";         }     }
