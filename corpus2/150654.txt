Me and a friend are looking to team up for some freelance web designing. We both are very strong PHP coders and website designers, but I am better at design and he is better at PHP. So, I'll be controlling the stuff the user sees, he'll be controlling the stuff the user does. In order to speed up development, I'm wondering if anyone has experience or recommendations for asynchronous web designing and coding. So far my best idea is to create a doctrine of which tags and classes every element should be wrapped in (if any), then have us developing via FTP. He would create the code that spits out snippets of HTML, and I would simply style those snippets and wrap it in the page. Does anyone know of a better way? So, any ideas?
