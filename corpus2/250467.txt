Two of the most popular dynamically typed scripting languages, Python and Ruby, do not make a distinction in syntax between the declaration of a variable and assignation of a value to it. That is in both languages, declaring a variable `n` and assigning a value to it would look like so:               n = 10      And assigning a new value to the variable later on would look just the same. This creates two major problems:   1. A typo in a variable's name when changing it's value would create a new variable and cause bugs.   2. It makes the intentions of the code less clear. Hard to know where a variable is first declared and used, might make the code more confusing. What I don't understand is why these languages don't have a `var` keyword to use on declaration, to make a distinction between a declaration and an assignment. This doesn't make the language any less dynamically typed, and I see no drawbacks. What is the advantage of not having to explicitly define a variable?
