I'd like to note your experience of full scale IDEs on Linux. I personally work mostly with `vim`, however other programmers would like to see a real IDE. So I'd like to hear your personal opinion about different IDEs and comparison between them, in following context:   * C++ and maybe some C development (not Java, Python and other stuff)   * Server side programming (no need for GUI development)   * Working on Linux not "cross-platform" development. Opinion needed regard:   1. How stable is it? If IDE crashes I don't need it.   2. Comfortable to use.   3. Powerful for debugging.   4. Integration with various build systems   5. Scalability over huge projects (projects of hundreds thousands of lines of code) I used to work with KDevelop and it was very nice IDE and seems that KDevelop 4 is a huge progress. It seems also that many rather use Netbeans and Eclipse.
