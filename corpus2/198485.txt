I've seen some projects that - with each new year - start to change all files in their source-tree to update the copyright year. Isn't this just pushing hot air on a level of magnitude? AFAIK:   * Copyright year is based on relevant changes of a work (also) - not only because of a trivial change of the copyright year in a file-header that is the only change.   * Changing nearly all files without an actual need brings the code out of order in version control. I can't help myself but have problems to see why someone wants to do such superfluous stuff, albeit I know some projects are doing this (for example Zend Framework 1 in 2012). Is there any use in changing the copyright year in each file only because Jan 1st has passed?
