A few use cases: (1) This, as expected, returns (almost) immediately:               f[x_?NumericQ] := Evaluate[(Pause[1]; x)]     Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 1}]        (2) This takes forever:               f[x_?NumericQ] := (Pause[1]; x);     Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 1}, Evaluated -> True]      (3) This is much faster than (1):               f[x_?NumericQ] := {(Pause[1]; x), x x};     Plot[f[x][[1]], {x, 0, 1}, Evaluated -> True]      (4) This returns immediately ... with a "wrong" plot:               f[x_?NumericQ] := {(Pause[a = x + 1]; a), x};     Plot[f[x][[1]], {x, 0, 1}, Evaluated -> True]      (5) While this, as expected, returns immediately, with the "right" plot:               f[x_?NumericQ] := Evaluate[(Pause[a = x + 1]; a)]     Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 1}]      I would like an "authoritative" explanation of cases (3) and (4) ... the rest I think I'm able to understand, but posted for completeness, and to get a complete answer that could be useful for others too.
