I am trying to solve the following PDE:               -D[c2*p[c1, c2, w], c1] +        D[((2*Um/L)*c2 + ((Um/L)^2)*c1)*p[c1, c2, w],         c2] + (1/2)*(\[Sigma]^2)*(Um/(L*Pi))*D[p[c1, c2, w], {c2, 2}] -        D[(c2*(1 - 2*Sqrt[3]) - c1*(Sqrt[3]*Um/L))*p[c1, c2, w],         w] + (3/2)*(\[Sigma]^2)*(L/(Um*Pi))*D[p[c1, c2, w], {w, 2}] == 0      for `p[c1, c2, w]`. I also have the following values for the constants:               Um = 4.315;     \[Sigma] = 1;     L = 50;      However, if I can get the solution of this PDE in terms of `Um,\\[Sigma],L` then I would prefer this. I tried `DSolve` but to no avail. I will solve for the constants using appropriate initial and boundary conditions later. Can someone please help.
