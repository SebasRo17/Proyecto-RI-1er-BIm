The thing is, eager loading some object with all of it's associations reduces the queries made to the database, but the query time is greatly increased.   The question is: This increased query time in the end pays off the database not being hitted so often? It seems to me that you are avoiding one problem and falling into another one.   Obs.: Would put eager-loading tag if i had reputation enough. Someone could create it and edit this observation.
