Apologies for stating my problem poorly in the first instance, thank you for the help in narrowing down the issue. **Problem** For those interested, it's for the exact unbiased inverse of the generalized Anscombe Transform, as given in this paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2012.2202675. I'm trying to integrate, for a given value of $y$ and $\sigma$, the function $$ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f_{\sigma}\left ( z \right ) \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left ( \frac{y^{k}\mathrm{e}^{-y}}{k!\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^{2}}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\left ( z-k \right )^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}} \right ) \mathrm{d}z $$ where $$ f_{\sigma}\left ( z \right ) = \left\\{\begin{matrix} 2\sqrt{z+\frac{3}{8}+\sigma^{2}}, & z > -\frac{3}{8}-\sigma^{2}\\\ 0, & z \leq -\frac{3}{8}-\sigma^{2} \end{matrix}\right. $$ which gives the equation in the reference below: $$ \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} 2\sqrt{z+\frac{3}{8}+\sigma ^{2}}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left ( \frac{y^{k}\mathrm{e}^{-y}}{k!\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^{2}}} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\left ( z-k \right )^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}} \right ) \mathrm{d}z $$ In the reference, the values of the above function are tabulated, presumably in Matlab, for $\sigma \in \left \\{ 0.01,...,50 \right \\}$ and $y \in \left \\{0,...,200 \right \\}$. The authors have made this table available for download, but I want to do it myself. However, I can't get it to work - Mathematica won't evaluate it:               func[z_, y_, sig_] :=       Piecewise[{{2 Sqrt[z + 3/8 + sig^2],z > -3/8 - sig^2}},0.]*       Sum[((y^k )* Exp[-y])/(k! * Sqrt[2 \[Pi] sig^2]) *          Exp[-((z - k)^2) / (2 sig^2)], {k, 0, Infinity}]     NIntegrate[func[z, 5, 2], {z, -Infinity, Infinity}]      Have I made a mistake somewhere? Or misunderstood the integral/problem as given? **Update** A suggestion is to replace the infinite sum with an upper limit of ~50 as it converges quickly. This does allow Mathematica to now evaluate the integral.
