Recently I started same projects to improve my programming skills, so I tried to develop a point of sale software. I started to bay the required hardware (ticket printer, Barcode Scanner….) to make my personal lab, but I’m unable to find how to implement the payment process using an ATM terminal. Is there any possibility to simulate the payment process whiteout having the equipment?
