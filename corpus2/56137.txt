Over on genealogy.SE, I proposed a method of manipulating images to make "bleed through" less visible and the handwriting on the correct side of the page more legible. Here are the original images: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2hf7N.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WnVtF.jpg) The idea is to make a mirror image of the other page, and then remove things that are dark on the flipped page and lighter on the target page, and similarly keep things that are darker on the target page than the flipped page. Here's the flipped page:               page17cropflip = ImageReflect[page17crop, Left]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9BeF.jpg) Here was the set of commands that worked tolerably well in this case (it looks better at full size):               With[{brightness = -0.3`, contrast = 0, final = 0.903`,        highbleed = 0.159`, lowbleed = 0.221`, method = "Cluster"},       Binarize[ImageAdjust[        ImageClip[         ImageAdd[Blur[page18crop, 3],           ImageClip[page17cropflip, {lowbleed, lowbleed + highbleed}]], {0,           final}], {contrast, brightness}], Method -> method]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Makel.png) But I needed to crop the images by hand (I used `ImageDifference` to help line it up) so that the bleeding through text lined up with the actual text on the image of the facing page. Is there a way to automate this?
