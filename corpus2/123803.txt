I was wondering whether there were any estimating models for projects which use the results of previous projects. For example, imagine I want to develop an application for a phone based on a web app I completed last month. Say the web app took 1000 hours but that I don't know anything about mobile development. If you wanted to add another number into the equation you could say that 50% of the features implement in the web app will need to be implemented for the mobile app. Where would I even start to form an estimate for the new project? Thanks in advance.
