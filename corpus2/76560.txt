Given something like this: 1 5 3 4 = 18 I need to determine (using an algorithm) if there is a combination of operators and brackets that bring me to 18. Only "+" and "*" and "(" and ")" are allowed. Example: 1 + 5 + ( 3 * 4 ) = 18 Beside brute force, is there any particular algorithm that is able to compute all the possible combo in reasonable time? RPN may help in order to encode the possible solutions, but the same are a lot (4^n ?).
