Many of my co-workers take pride in writing complex algorithms and programs, ones which take significant time to completely grok. I (strongly) tend towards the opposite end. I'm proud when I write a program which a novice (or client) can trivially see is correct, by reading my source code. I'll often take time to mercilessly re- factor, rewrite a given piece of code over, and over, and over, again, until I'm sure that it can be read quickly, requires as little knowledge of specialized APIs (or even references to an English dictionary) to parse as possible, and is as close to natural language as I can make it. This leads to some problems, though, when it comes to convincing (non- technical) clients and employers that my work is worth the money invested. Surprisingly, few people are willing to pay the extra money it takes to obtain code that they can verify for themselves is working as they think it works. In this context: **I'm wondering if there are any good tools for displaying refactoring work**. I usually **use git as a code repository** , and have an almost nervous tick around committing even the smallest changes to my local repo. I'm **fairly sure that most of the information required to show the re- factoring effort is recorded in my git history**.
