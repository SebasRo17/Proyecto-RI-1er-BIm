We have been using Team Foundation Server (TFS) for source code management of our solution which contains components for a number of platforms - asp.net, windows & android so far. We now wish to develop iOS apps for the solution but is there any integration possible between XCode and TFS? What's the best way to use TFS version control with Xcode now that I find out we need to write some iOS apps? We will also eventually want to have automated builds for a Continuous Integration process
