We are developing a project with three members. I am the permanent member, we hired a contractor from a company to be a team lead and one very junior coder. Now the contractor is doing the server side coding with classes and modules while the junior member and I are doing front client. The problem we face is that the junior member and I are finding it very hard to understand the contractor's code. Our skills are not at his level and he is using all sorts of advanced function and write very concise code with very little documentation. When we ask for help, he gets angry and says that we don't know that. I have raised this issue, but it comes out every now and then. I can understand only 50% of his code and the junior understands only 10% of it. What should be done int his scenario? We can't force him because we need him, but its difficult for us to proceed. What should we do? And also every time we do our part of coding he can always pick errors and tell how to do it better. It is good, but it also means that do we have to check every line of code with him. I was confused that if we have genius coder in team of 5 then that genius will always write better code. So does it mean that   1. he needs to check code for every junior member and change it   2. he leave some loopholes and ignore them because the senior member will always have better way to do the job?
