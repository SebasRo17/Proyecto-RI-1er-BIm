I want to evaluate a mathematical function of $K$ variables each of variables varying between 1:N. One way to do this is writing $K$ loops and varying variables accordingly, as shown below:               For x1 = 1:N         For x2 = 1:N              ...                 For xK = 1:N                    A(x1,x2,...,xk) = f(x1,x2,...,xk)                 End xK              ...         End x2     End x1      I want to know is there any other way to do this without $K$ loops? Since I want to write a routine doing these evaluations for all possible $K$'s, it isn't possible to write varying number of loops in a routine, so what should I do?
