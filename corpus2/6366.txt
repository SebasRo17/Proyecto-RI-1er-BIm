Specifically, I want to take some elements of the lowest level of an array, and then sum over these elements while holding the higher level. Sorry for my vague expression, maybe an example would make it clear: An array of 3 levels:                try = {{0,{a,b,c}},{{d,e,f,g},{h,i,j}}}      I want to obtain `{{0,{a,b}},{{d,e},{h,i}}}`, and then sum over to obtain `{{0,a+b},{d+e,h+i}}`. Following illustration of Mathematica, i tried:               try[[All,All,1;;2]]      but it could not work. As to summation,               Total[try,{-1}]      could sum over all elements of the last level, however I have no idea how to sum over part of the last level. Solution?
