I have two functions that I need to inverse Fourier transform and I was trying to get Mathematica to help me. I tried simply using the`InverseFourierTransform` function but, since they're complicated 2D functions it just took 7 hours and gave me nothing! I thought `NInverseFourierTransform` would be a good alternative but I keep getting error messages. I think I'm using the function correctly because I ran it with a couple of easier functions first to check and the results came out as expected. The functions look like this:               Uq1[alpha_, oneoverr_, Ge_] := alpha + (1 - alpha)  HeavisideTheta[Dot[Ge, Ge] - oneoverr]);      and               Uq2[alpha_, oneoverr_, Ge_] := (1 + alpha)/2 + ((1 - alpha)/Pi) ArcTan[ Dot[Ge, Ge] - oneoverr];      where alpha and oneoverr are just constants and Ge should be a 2D vector, but I've just been leaving it as 1D to minimise the evaluation time while I'm trying to find a method that works. I tried               Needs["FourierSeries`"]          Plot[NInverseFourierTransform[Uq2[-1, 20, t], t, w], {w, -20, 20}, PlotRange -> All]      and got an error message saying that the integrand evaluated to non numerical values. I'm sorry it's all a bit rubbish but I'm incredibly new to Mathematica and any help would be greatly appreciated!
