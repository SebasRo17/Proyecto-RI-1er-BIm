Systems programming and desktop application development is a well established field. In recent years, web and mobile development have shown rapid expansion. As a software engineer I understand that _programming is programming_ , and C++, Javascript, and Android APIs are tools that any engineer worth his salt can handle. Unfortunately, there exist recruiters, managers, and companies that don't understand that skill isn't necessarily tied to tools. Also, some companies just aren't interested in providing the ramp-up time required when hiring an engineer with little direct experience with a software tool that is used by their existing development team. Does this combination of increasing demand for applications built with recently established tools/platforms and recruiter/HR figures' juxtaposition of _programming_ experience with _tools_ experience cause a (albeit arguably incorrect) perceived shortage of skill applicable to new technologies? To phrase it differently, given two similarly talented engineers, is the one doing C++ application development less valued in the market than the one with some web applications under his belt?
