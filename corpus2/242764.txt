I have a Rails model `email_condition_string` with a `word` column in it. Now I have another model called `request_creation_email_config` with the following columns   1. admin_filter_group:references    2. vendor_service:references    3. email_condition_string:references `email_condition_string` has many `request_creation_email_config` and `request_creation_email_config` belongs to `email_condition_string`. Instead of this model a colleague of mine is suggesting that storing the word inside the same model as comma separated values is more efficient than storing it as a separate model. Is that all right?
