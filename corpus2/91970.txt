I received this response from Jeff while researching hit counters. He said page hits are incremented in a `buffered write scheme,` and that a views table does not exist. Can you explain what a buffered write scheme is, please? I would appreciate answers not too heavy with technical jargon. In particular I'm interested in how such a scheme can be implemented to track page hits. I'm curious how hit data gets persisted since it is needed to prevent users from simply refreshing a page to increment page hits.
