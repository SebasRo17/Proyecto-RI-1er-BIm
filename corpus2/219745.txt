We are developing an enterprise network appliance which has got some GPL softwares like linux and apache and some others with APL license. But the core of the service is proprietary software and access is provided only via a web interface. My query is what all I need to do in order to comply with GPL license in this scenario. Would providing a list of Third party softwares used in the appliance in the web interface be sufficient?
