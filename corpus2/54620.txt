Here is the scenario: You have number of open notebooks at the same time, and made some changes in all or some of them but have not yet saved the changes. Mathematica does not have something like _save all_ that will save all and any open files that needs to be saved before closing. (At least I do not see it under `File`) So I expected that when one clicks on the close all windows on the main icon, that it will prompt one to save or not save all the open notebooks that needs this action done on them, one by one. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SPAHi.png) What happens is this: It asks about the first open notebook, then when answering the question, expecting it will now ask about the next open notebook, instead it does nothing. Leaving the remaining notebooks open as is. So one have to click and click and click again on `close all windows` until all open notebooks that needs to be saved are saved. So if one has 10 open notebooks, they have to click 10 times on `close all windows` and click again to answer the question. This is 10 additional clicks. Other apps I used would ask the user for each open file in turn, or provide a _save all_ or when closing, they would ask the user if they want to save all or discard all, etc... Is there a way to get Mathematica to do this so one does not have to keep clicking on things? A palette that does _save all_ open notebooks would be great. Finally, after closing all windows, and with all those clicks, the main Mathematica icon remains there! So one has to click again to quit. (I actually do not see this splash window below at all, until I have closed all windows. It seems to be hidden somewhere during normal operations or while a notebook is open and this only shows up if all notebooks are closed, not sure) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T4bGF.png)
