Lets say I want to compute the following function in mathematica: $G[n,k]=G[n+1,k-1] + G[n+2,k-2]$ where I know that $G[n,0]=n$ and $G[n,1]=n^2$. So, for example, $G[3,2]=G[4,1]+G[5,0]=4^2+5$ or, less trivially, $G[5,4]=G[6,3]+G[7,2]=(G[7,2]+G[8,1])+(G[8,1]+G[9,0])=((G[8,1]+G[9,0])+G[8,1])+(G[8,1]+G[9,0])= 3G[8,1]+2G[9,0]$ So I attempt it with the following code               RecurrenceTable[{s1[n, k] == s1[n + 1, k - 1] - s1[n + 2, k - 2],         s1[r, 1] == r, s1[r, 0] == r^2}, s1, {n, 2, 6}, {k, 2, 4}] // Grid      However it spits out lots of error messages relating to functions being called with two variables when only one is expected.
