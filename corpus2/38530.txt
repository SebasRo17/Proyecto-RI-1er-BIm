I have a list:               a = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 7, 8}};      Using `Partition` and `Map` I get:               Partition[#, 4]& /@ a      > >     {{{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}, {{5, 6, 7, 8}, {5, 6, 7, 8}}} >   And now, I would like to get a list which looks like:                {{{{1, 2},{3, 4}}, {{1, 2},{3, 4}}}, {{{5, 6},{7, 8}}, {{5, 6},{7, 8}}}}      I tried to play around with `Partition` and `Map`, but I did not manage to create such a list. Of course there are easy ways to do it using `Do` loops and `AppendTo`, but I very much need to avoid `Do` loops. Does anybody see the way to create the list?
