I am working with a client right now that wants me to sign a contact with a warranty for a year for no additional charge. As well as any reasonable changes he wants during the contract that are outside of the guidelines for no additional charge while not affecting deadlines. And lastly documentation and training for all staff for no additional charge. Red flags are going everywhere in this contract and I wanted to hear from professionals how you guys handle / what you charge for documentation, training, warranty, changes in scope etc...
