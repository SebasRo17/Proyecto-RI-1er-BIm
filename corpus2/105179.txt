I am looking for a wiki or wiki-like system for writing and managing specification and documentation for a software project. I know there are lots of wiki-implementations available, but are there some that are especially well-suited for this kind of task? Actually it doesn't have to be a wiki, just a system that makes it easy to write and navigate specs and documentation, and which support change tracing.
