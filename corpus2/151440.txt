I've been developing the client-side for my web-app in JavaScript. The JavaScript can communicate with my server over REST (HTTP)[JSON, XML, CSV] or RPC (XML, JSON). I'm writing writing this decoupled client in order to use the same code for both my main website and my PhoneGap mobile apps. However recently I've been worrying that writing the website with almost no static content would prevent search-engines (like Google) from indexing my web-page. I was taught about this restriction about 4 years ago, which is why I'm asking here, to see if this restriction is still in-place. **Does heavy JavaScript use adversely impact Googleability?**
