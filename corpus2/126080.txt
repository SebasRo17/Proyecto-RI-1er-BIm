Problem: Run commands in the form of a string.   * command example: `/user/files/ list all;` equivalent to: `/user/files/ ls -la;`   * another one: `post tw fb "HOW DO YOU STOP THE TICKLE MONSTER?;"` equivalent to: `post -tf "HOW DO YOU STOP THE TICKLE MONSTER?;"` Current solution:               tokenize string(string, array);          switch(first item in array) {         case "command":             if ( argument1 > stuff) {                // do the actual work;             }     }      The problems I see in this solution are:   * No error checking other than nested ifs-else inside each case. The script becomes very big and hard to mantain.   * Commands and responses are hardcoded.   * No way of knowing if flags are correct or missing parameters.   * Lack of intelligence to suggest "you might wanted to run $command". And the last thing I can't address is synonyms in different encodings, example:               case command:     case command_in_hebrew:         do stuff;     break;      The last one might be trivial, but well, what I want to see is the solid fundations of this kind of program. I'm currently programming this in PHP but might do it in PERL.
