I cannot find a good way to add arrows along a parametric curve that I used `NDSolve` to get. I have written everything inside `Manipulate`.               Manipulate[           Module[{Tf, Tm, Ta, Cp, Caf, km, Ea, Rho, DeltaH, UAV,         k, Cps, Qg, Qr, x, sol, p1, p2, p3, p4, z},       Tf = 298; Tm = 298; Ta = 298; Cp = 4; Caf = 2; km = 0.004;        Ea = 1.5*10^4; Rho = 10^3; DeltaH = -2.2*10^5;        UAV = 340;            k[T[t_]] = km*Exp[-Ea*(1/T[t] - 1/Tm)];       Cps = Rho*Cp;       Qg[t_] = -k[T[t]]/(1 + k[T[t]]*Tau)*Caf*DeltaH;       Qr[t_] = Cps/Tau*(T[t] - Tf);       x[t_] = 1 - Ca[t]/Caf;       sol = NDSolve[{          D[Ca[t], {t, 1}] == (Caf - Ca[t])/Tau - k[T[t]]*Ca[t],          D[T[t], {t, 1}] ==            UAV/Cps*(Ta - T[t]) + (            Tf - T[t])/Tau -DeltaH/Cps*k[T[t]]*Ca[t],          Ca[0] == Cao,          T[0] == To},         {Ca[t], T[t]},         {t, 0, 800}];       p1 = ParametricPlot[{T[t], x[t]} /. Flatten[sol], {t, 0, 800},         PlotRange -> {{290, 400}, {0, 1.1}},         PlotPoints -> Automatic]],     {{Tau,45,""},10,100},     {{To,310,""},298,320},     {{Cao,2.4,""},0,5}]      This is the most I can condense it for y'all. I want to add arrows along the solution plotted using `ParametricPlot` I have tried a number of different things but it looks like `Graphics[Arrow[ ]]` is meant more for fixed points and not manipulated curves. Am I right about that or can I put arrows in my plot? I have looked at this post Plotting a set of trajectories but I've been having a bit of trouble following the code after a certain point. Yes, I asked this question on Stack Exchange but I was told to come here instead.
