Applications can always throw errors. If such an error occurs, the user should be notified, because what he asked the application to do has not succeeded. However, how much information should the user be given? I think most of us agree on not showing a stack trace (Should a stack trace be in the error message presented to the user?), but I can't find a question about the rest of the error contents or what to show to the user. For example, a language supporting exceptions (.net, java) has the exception type to share, where the exception occured, and a somewhat clarifying message to go along with the exception. Should this also be hidden from the user? Or should we show this anyway? Or should we show a generic message? or should we show one of a number of messages based on what the underlying exception is?
