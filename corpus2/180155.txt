Assume I have a public source code repository. Am I violating copyright laws if there's any old commit where I have not yet added all copyright info for _other_ people's open source code? Details: Consider this theoretical scenario:   1. I copy-paste _someone else's_ open source code files into a repository.   2. I commit.   3. I prefix copyright and licensing info at the top of the above-mentioned files.   4. I commit.   5. Many months passes, many people fork various versions of the master branch. Now, many months later, I realize that there are files in commit no. 1 with no copyright info. Do I have to squash the two above-mentioned commits, and rebase the whole repository? (Although it's been published! Everyone would be annoyed?) Or does it suffice that the current repo version provides all needed copyright info? Rephrased, for Git: If the HEAD of all Git branches, and all "published" Git tags, contain all required copyright and licensing info, do you think that suffice? And it'd be other people's responsibilities if they check out other commits and redistribute? Or am I the culprit, and will be thrown in prison?
