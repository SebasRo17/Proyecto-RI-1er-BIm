I am developing an application where I am taking dynamic gestures as input and then mapping them to keyboard controls. By dynamic gesture, I mean for example hand moving from left to right or hand moving right to left. I have four gestures: hand moving bottom to top, top to bottom, left to right and right to left. I am able to recognize gestures but the problem is how to decide the start and ending of the gesture on a continuous video input. What is the most efficient and effective algorithm for detecting this on a video input?
