When I start a Mathematica 8 session (either command line or with the notebook front end), I notice that there are several packages that have already been loaded for me (using `SystemInformation[]`):               PackagesLoaded -> {JLink`, PacletManager`, WebServices`, System`, Global`}      I understand System` and Global` and even WebServices`, but why JLink`? Does Mathematica have a primary dependency on Java? What does it use it for?
