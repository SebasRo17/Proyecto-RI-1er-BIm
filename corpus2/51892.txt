We have been using Hudson for quite a while and we loved it. Now many Hudson- developers have "left the building" to create their own: Jenkins (which means the project has been forked). As Hudson/Jenkins users, we are now worried whether we should opt for the original "big and stable" producer Oracle, or the "small and dynamic" newcomer Jenkins. **EDIT** : Our worries are mainly due to the fact that we did not really hear about this fork/split through any official ways. It looks like a guerilla action including the hijacking of logos and trademarks (after all, the copyright must be at Oracle, no? I'm not sure). So we're kinda missing professionalism here, as in well-organised course of action involving press relases, etc. Maybe we just missed that... What are good objective reasons to decide for either project in the future? Can we postpone that decision until later, or is that too risky? Here's one opinion about this: http://www.itworld.com/development/136173/more- concerns-surface-hudson-jenkins-split Why did you choose either one?
