I have a nested matrix `n`:               n = {{a, b}, {c, d}}     a = {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 1, 0, th}, {1, 0, 0, sh}}     b = {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 0, 0, th}, {0, 0, 1, sh}}          c = {{0, t, q, dh}, {1, 0, 1, th}, {0, 0, 0, sh}}     d = {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 1, 0, th}, {1, 0, 0, sh}}      With thanks to Kuba and Mr.Wizard 'comparison-operation-for-nested-matrices' I could get a _combined_ nested matrix: _ncombined_ (on which a comparison operation was applied)               ncombined= {{        {{0, t, q, dh},          {0, 1, 0, th},          {1, 0, 1, sh}}},        {{{0, t, q, dh},          {1, 1, 1, th},          {1, 0, 0, sh}}                }}      and with thanks to Kgular getting-good-looking-matrix..I could add a vector `m` as:               m = {rr, kk}      to the _ncombined_ as bellow:               pp = Transpose[Insert[Transpose[ncombined], Flatten@m, 1]];     ppgoodlook=MapAt[MatrixForm, pp, {{All, All}, {}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xgvwm.png) I am so sorry if my question maybe will not well written while I have so much tried to write it more obviously. Also I will bring the image of the desired result. question: Since, number `1` is not repeated in the same elements of `a` and `b` , also for `c` and `d`, how can I refer each of `1` in the `ppgoodlook` to the main sub_matrices such as `a`, `b`, `c` or `d` (from which, `1` is gone to `ppgoodlook`) in order to obtain the bellow result (However this referring is regardless to the letters of sub_matrices such as `sh`,`th`, `q`, `t` and `dh`) : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/u40sz.png)
