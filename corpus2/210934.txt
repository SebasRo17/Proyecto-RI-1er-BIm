I know Lisp and Haskell are functional and logic programming languages respectively, but what exactly does this mean? How do they differ from other languages? I've heard that learning these will make you a better programmer and improve your logic. Is this true, and if I go learning Lisp or Haskell to a competent level will my programming improve and will I be better at handling any problem in any language? I just wanted to know to see if they are worth the effort of learning. Also are these languages useful in areas such as GUI and graphics or are they just useful for console applications?
