I have a site done in Rails, which uses javascript to load files and generate forms for the user to input certain information. Those files and parameters are then to be used in a fortran code on the server. When the UI was on the server (using Qt), I would create a parameters file and execute the fortran code using threads so I wouldn't block the computer. Now that is web-based, I need to make the server and browser talk. What's the procedure for that? where should I start looking? I'm already using rails + javascript. I need that extra tool to do the talking, and no idea where to start.
