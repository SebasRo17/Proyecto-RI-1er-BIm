I am studying Spring framework, in web.xml I added following which is a bootstrap listener. Can anyone give me a proper idea of what is a bootstrap listener?               <listener>         <listener-class>org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener</listener-class>     </listener>      You can see the doc here: ContextLoadListener > Bootstrap listener to start up and shut down Spring's root > WebApplicationContext. Simply delegates to `ContextLoader` as well as to > `ContextCleanupListener`. > > This listener should be registered after `Log4jConfigListener` in web.xml, > if the latter is used. > > As of Spring 3.1, `ContextLoaderListener` supports injecting the root web > application context via the `ContextLoaderListener(WebApplicationContext)` > constructor, allowing for programmatic configuration in Servlet 3.0+ > environments. See WebApplicationInitializer for usage examples...
