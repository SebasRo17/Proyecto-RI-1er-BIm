For the definitions,               t = 1;     f[x_, y_] := t (x + y);     v[3] := {1, 1};     g[u_] := f[v[u][[1]], v[u][[2]]];      the following two expressions yield different results, despite the only difference being the name of the iterator.               Table[g[s], {s, 3, 3}]     Table[g[t], {t, 3, 3}]      I believe this is related to how `Table` applies the value of its variables, as mentioned in http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/23533. Are there other functions that behave similarly (albeit bizarrely)? Other than using a different variable name for the iterator, are there good ways to avoid this issue?
