I am planning learning Model-View-Controller (MVC) development using Java. While reading I came across a post which mentions **java.util.Observer** and **java.util.Observable** for MVC development. As I never heard of it before, upon more googling I came across this SO post, which discusses some design flaw with the above-mentioned classes. My question now has three parts   1. Are these classes still used in Industry for MVC development (except Eclipse as mentioned in the SO post)?   2. What are the flaws with these classes and why/why not should one use them?   3. Are there some ways MVC projects are developed in industry? (would be nice if you can answer this in general terms, NOT looking for answers like **SPRING** :P ) **[edit: both for desktop and web applications]**
