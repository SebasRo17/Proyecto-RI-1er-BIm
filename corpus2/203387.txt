in iOS development, I have often seen people creating a networking module to interact with their APIs. This module generally sits on top of a networking framework like MKNetWorkKit or AFNetWorking. In most of the cases, It's all about sending GET,POST request and parsing the response which is in most cases JSON. What extra practical benefits that these libraries provide that an iOS developer should be leveraging which the plain Cocoa Networking APIs lack ? I can understand RESTKit as one exception where it takes care of the conversion of JSON to native objects and also interfaces with Core Data but what about others ?
