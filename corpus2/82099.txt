My team leader has this terrible habit of mucking with the database schema, and making changes that would cause severe breakage on the code base (without really consulting me on how the changes would affect the code base). Normally, I would just live with it, but we have a deadline in 2 weeks and this has been happening ever since I started 1 and a half months ago. I was brought on, to speed up the development of the project. Due to the deadline I am already putting in 60+ hours a week, and dont really have energy left to deal with this (I have tried in some ways already). We are only a 2 man team, and besides changing the database on a daily basis, he has not contributed much in the sense of actual development (coding). Currently, I am feeling like I am doing all the work, plus having to 'fix' what he breaks with his changes. How does one deal with this? I have already spoken to our manager about his lack of effort in the development department. He has been there 6 months longer than I have, but I have written 95% of the code when you exclude the 5th normal form database monstrosity he 'contributed'. Any suggestions? **Post-mortem:** On Friday we had a discussion with manager, and I made my worries known. This led to a bit of confrontation, but overall I felt the manager was siding with me. So at least we have our data freeze in place now, let's see how it goes from here.
