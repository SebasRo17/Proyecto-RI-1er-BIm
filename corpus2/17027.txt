> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  1 Plot, 2 Scale/Axis   >  Generating a broken or snipped axis in ListPlot I have data in several ranges which I, when I plot together, is not very useful. I was thinking about removing the regions where no data exist (see data.png), e.g. shrink the plot scale in those regions. In other words, specifying multiple ranges for the PlotRange option: PlotRange-> {{xrange1,xrange2, xrange3},yrange} How would I go about this? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/af9JN.png)
