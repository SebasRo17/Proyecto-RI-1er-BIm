I have two arrays of length `n`. One of them is obtained by experiment, so every element of the array is a number. The other array is parametric, each element is a combination of a parameter and numbers. There are 8 parameters. In theory, arrays one and two must be the same. I want to find the best possible set of 8 parameters which fit the parametric array to the experimental one. How can I do that in Mathematica? `FindFit` needs an array and a function. I do not know how to fit the two arrays. * * * I tried to subtract the two arrays and use `NMinimize` to minimum the new array with respect to the parameters. It didn't work. It returns:               NMinimize::bcons: The following constraints are not valid: {0.004 -4 (E^(-          (0.002/Subscript[<<2>>])) Subscript[a, 1]+E^(-(0.002/Subscript[<<2>>])) Subscript[a,           2]+E^(-(0.002/Subscript[<<2>>])) Subscript[a, 3]+E^(-(0.002/Subscript[<<2>>]))           Subscript[a, 4]),4-4 (E^(-(0.002/Subscript[<<2>>])) Subscript[a, 1]+E^(-          (0.002/Subscript[<<2>>])) Subscript[a, 2]+E^(-(0.002/Subscript[<<2>>])) Subscript[a,           3]+E^(-(0.002/Subscript[<<2>>])) Subscript[a, 4]),<<48>>,<<1588>>}. Constraints should           be equalities, inequalities, or domain specifications involving the variables. >>      Mathematica thinks that the first argument of `NMinimize` contains some constraints, which is not the case. It thinks so perhaps because the first argument cannot be an array.
