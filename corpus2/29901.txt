I want to produce an array from expressions given by               test[one][1] = 3;     .      .     test[one][5] = 7;      etc. Normally would use `Table[test[one][i], {i,N}]`, but for this you need the value of `N` that may not be known (without keeping track of it via some other means). I would like to be able to read the maximum value of the integer inside `test[one][ ]` and use this to construct the array. For expression such as `test[1] = 5`, this is straight forward since `DownValues[test]` can be used, but when adding another level the head becomes "test" and `DownValues[]` will not work.
