Being new to unit testing I would like to know if I am supposed to test the values of objects returned from methods when doing unit testing. As an example, consider the following classes:               public class Person     {         public int Id { get; set }         public int Age { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public Pet Pet { get; set; }     }          public class Pet     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public int Age { get; set; }         public Breed Breed { get; set; }     }      And a method with the following declaration:               public Person GetPerson(int id) { ... }      I am now curious if I am supposed to create a test that checks to see if the various properties of the Person are correct (GetPerson_PersonFound_PersonHasCorrectName() and so on)? I suspect that I, under normal circumstances, should? All depends on the requirements? If those properties should be tested, am I then supposed to dig into Pet and check those properties as well? What about going even further, down into Breed? Can add up to quite a few tests quite quickly.
