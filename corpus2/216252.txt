Currently I have a command-line application in C called `btcwatch`. It has a `-C` option that it can receive as an argument that compares the current price of Bitcoin with a price that was stored beforehand with `-S`. Example output with this option is:               $ btcwatch -vC  # -v = verbose     buy: UP $ 32.000000 USD (100.000000 -> 132.000000)     sell: UP $ 16.000000 USD (100.000000 -> 116.000000)      The dilemma is whether to use colour for the `UP` or `DOWN` string (green and red, respectively). Most command-line applications I know of (apart from git) stay away from colour in their output. In my desire for `btcwatch` to look and be quite "standard" (use of `getopt`, Makefiles, etc), I'm not sure if colour would look out of place in this situation.
