I've never attempted anything like this before but what I want to do is code a browser for Windows. I know that I can use the web-browser control that Microsoft has released, but I'm interested in seeing how the problem is solved from a lower level. So I want to know what layout engine I should be looking at? Or is a layout engine the best way to go? I've been looking at WebKit, but it seems rather Mac-centric, so I'm wondering if there are any more practical one's for windows? Has Microsoft released the source code for their webbrowser winforms control in the .Net framework? That would be dependent on the CLR anyway, I suppose? Any suggestions?
