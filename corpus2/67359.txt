I started a project repo on codeplex and haven't publicly published it yet. I realized that the name I gave to it is not appropriate and would like to change the name of the project before publicly releasing it (they have a 30 day deadline). The name of the directory that hg clone needs, i.e., `dirname` in `https://hg01.codeplex.com/dirname` is ok, but the project shows up in a different name in codeplex, and that is the name I want to change. Is this possible?
