From what I have read about SQL Server Resource Governor, there really aren't any cons. I'm looking at implementing it into our infrastructure where we host websites as well as a management system plus reporting. The management system requires data to be loaded which has to be done out of hours because its quite resource intensive and has a knock-on effect to the websites. So, using the Resource Governor to split out the resources makes sense. Any thoughts?
