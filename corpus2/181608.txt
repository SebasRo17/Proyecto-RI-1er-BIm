Consider someone is writing a message (or a question at StackOverflow). The context is following: > In my code, I have the following line:   >  `int foo = Bar();` > > However, the compiler **returns** an error:   >  _line 42: Bar() is unknown function_ I'm puzzled to choose a proper verb instead of **"returns"**. I've seen people using various verbs for it, but I stuck every time I read it:   * "returns" can be confused with a function return value;   * "throws" is for exceptions;   * "prints" has a little sense as the compiler output is not always printed;   * "outs", "outputs", or "gives" do not sound professional;   * "the compiler complains" sounds a bit like personification of the compiler; What is the proper verb in this situation?
