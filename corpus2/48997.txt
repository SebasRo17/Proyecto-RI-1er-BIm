I am trying to find a function that gives me the divergent part of series in any case. The method "Series[]" does not work because `Series[42,{n,0,-1}]` gives as result 42 (which is not divergent in n) The method "SeriesCoefficient[]" does not work because I do not know the lowest order, so that `SeriesCoefficient[1/n^2 + 1/n + 2 + n^2,{n,0,-1}]`only gives 1 (from the 1/n-term) but I loose information about the 1/n^2 term. Is there a possibility to combine the advantages (to eliminate the disadvantages) of both approaches? Thanks for your answers.
