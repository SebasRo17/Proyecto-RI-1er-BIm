I'm currently reviewing a system built by some developers that previously worked at my job. The system works pretty well from a user's point of view, but when delving into code review it's a utter mess. I'm more than convinced that the way the application is built won't hold up for future updates, let alone high increases in usage. The problem is that I know how bad it is, but my superiors don't. How can I prove it to my manager so he actually sees the problem and can be convinced to do minimal triage on the current codebase, and in the near future start a new line of development for the next version of the application?
