I'm having issues working with code from Mathematica 9.0.1 since I've updated to 10.0.0. My previous code involved using packages to set functions, and then those packages were loaded and the functions called using a front-end notebook. These functions mainly involved the user inputting a file and selecting certain variables to end up with a final output of several plots. My issue is that my code is now generating two dialog boxes when running the code, stacked on top of each other. Is there any way to get this to stop without adding "Abort" to the end of all my set functions with dialog boxes? Sample Code:               importSpectra:=(          (*Creates a dialogue box which asks the user to input the file      location and name of the data they wish to input. *)     DialogInput[DialogNotebook[{         Grid[{             {TextCell["File to be Imported:"],Button["Select File",file=SystemDialogInput["FileOpen",directory]]},             {Button["Clear File",Clear[file]],Dynamic[file]}         },Alignment->Left],         DefaultButton[]     },WindowTitle->"Import Spectra"]];          (*Cancels the command if the user does not enter a file name. *)     If[file===$Canceled,Abort[]];          (*Imports the file and starts a new dataset. *)     import=Import[file];          (*runs another pre-set function*)     processData;          );      I've checked that this isn't due to any bugs with the functions called later on. Even just setting a simple dialog box that has DefaultButton[] to close generates two dialog boxes.
