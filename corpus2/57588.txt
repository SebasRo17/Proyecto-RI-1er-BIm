I would like to join an open source project since I think I am good enough at programming to progress onto reading others code and to modify it. But the problem is, how would I choose an open source project to work on? I know many languages and chief ones that I am good are python, C++ (not really very good at C, the lack of object orientation is difficult for me) and Java. For C++, I am proficient with Qt. I would like to start with something that isn't huge, and hasn't reached a phase where the bugs are so complicated it would take me a month to understand what affects the bug. Any suggestions? At the current time, I don't use any libraries in either of the mentioned libraries that I would need to modify (AFAIK).
