Rod Lm helped me to generate the following code, which I want to extend a little bit. So my intention is to use the threshold (the green line) as boundary in the following way: as soon as the process hits the threshold (watermark) it stops and is also excluded from the calculation of the mean function. So all processes which equal or fall beneath the threshold should stop and all processes that remain beyond the threshold should continue and the mean should only be calculated from the processes that remain beyond the threshold. Is this or something similar even possible? Thank you. the code:               Manipulate[SeedRandom[seed];     meanvector := Mean[assets];     assets = Table[     RandomFunction[GeometricBrownianMotionProcess[μ, σ, S0], {0, time, 0.1}]["Path"], {P}];     G1 := ListLogPlot[     assets, GridLines -> {{}, {threshold}}, GridLinesStyle -> Directive[Green, Thick], Joined -> True, AxesLabel -> {"Time", "St"}, PlotLabel -> Style["Forecasted Stock Price\n (Brownian Motion)", Bold], PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> Directive[{Thin, Lighter@Gray}]];          G2 := ListLogPlot[     Mean[assets], Joined -> True, PlotStyle -> Directive[{Thick, Darker@Red}]];         Show[G1, G2],         {{S0, 25, "Initial Stock Value"}, 1, 500, 0.5, Appearance -> "Labeled"},         {{μ, 0.08, "Drift μ"}, 0.01, 0.2, 0.01, Appearance -> "Labeled"},           {{σ, 0.2, "Standard Deviation σ"}, 0.01, 1, 0.05, Appearance -> "Labeled"},             {{P, 6, "Paths"}, 1, 20, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},             {{time, 10, "Time t"}, 1, 20, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},             {{threshold, 25, "Watermark"}, 1, 500, Appearance -> "Labeled"},             {{seed, 1, "New Random Case"}, 1, 100, 1},     Button["Set Initial Values", {S0 = 25, μ = 0.08, σ = 0.20, P = 6, time = 10, threshold = 25}, ImageSize -> 150],                 ControlPlacement -> Left]
