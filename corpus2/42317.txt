I am attempting to solve a PDE as prescribed in a paper I am reading; however, Mathematica doesn't seem to be happy with the way I am posing the problem. Im my case, r(t,100) is an approximation of r(t,inf).               d = 27;     k = 10;     s = 1;          sol = NDSolve[       {D[u[t, r], t] == d*(1/r^2) D[r^2*D[u[t, r], r], r],         u[0, r] == 1,         Derivative[0, 1][u][t, s] == (k/d)*u[t, s], u[t, 100] == 1},             u, {t, 0, 10}, {r, 0, 100}]      I am receiving an error stating that my boundary condition u(t,100)==1 is not specified on a single edge of the boundary of the computational domain. The answer is probably very simple, however I am just not seeing it.
