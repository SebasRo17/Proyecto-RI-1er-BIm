From Section 5.3 of Google's paper describing MapReduce. > "A Map function extracts a 10-byte sorting key from a text line and emits > the key and the original text line as the intermediate key/value pair.

I don't understand how the actual sorting happens. As far as I understand, they Map function extracts a key value pair, and then the Reduce function somehow spits out the data sorted. What is a "sorting key"?
