I have the following Mathematica animation:               Animate[Plot[k*x^2, {x, -2, 2},        PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-10, 10}}], {k, -2, 2, 0.1}]      I also have a sound file in the same Mathematica file, which is A VERY SHORT music clip, in "wav" format. The clip is about 32 seconds long. Now I want to integrate this sound file into the above animation: The following command will do the job, but it will make the animation WAY TOO sluggish, and almost useless:               Animate[Plot[k*x^2, {x, -2, 2}, PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-10, 10}},        Epilog -> {EmitSound[snd]}], {k, -2, 2, 0.1}]      Could you please suugest a better way of doing it? Thank you very much!
