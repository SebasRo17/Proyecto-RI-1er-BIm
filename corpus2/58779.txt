So I've got to work with this set of code here for a re-write, and it's written by people who speak both English and French. Here's a snapshot of what I'm talking about (only, about 4000 lines of this)               function refreshDest(FormEnCours,dest,hotel,duration) {         var GateEnCours;         GateEnCours = FormEnCours.gateway_dep.options[FormEnCours.gateway_dep.selectedIndex].value;         if (GateEnCours == "") {               FormEnCours.dest_dep.length = 0           } else if (FormEnCours.dest_dep != null && FormEnCours.dest_dep.type && FormEnCours.dest_dep.value != "ALL") {           if (Destinations[GateEnCours] == null || Destinations[GateEnCours].length == 0) {                RetreiveDestinations(FormEnCours,GateEnCours,dest,hotel,duration);           } else { refreshDestSuite(FormEnCours,GateEnCours,dest,hotel,duration); }         }     }          function refreshDuration(FormEnCours,GateEnCours,DestEnCours,hotel,duration) {         // Refresh durations         var FlagMoinsDe5Jours = "";         var Flag5a10jours = "";         var Flag11a16jours = "";         var FlagPlusDe16Jours = "";     .......       Is there any approach that I, as a speaker of only one of these languages, can use to make this entire process a lot less painful for both figuring out what everything does, and then refactoring it?
