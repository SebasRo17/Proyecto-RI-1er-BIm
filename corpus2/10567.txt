Ok looking for some really subjective answers. My company has traditionally been a Linux shop, we manufacture and sell purpose built boxes for video security. We recently decided to build an Embedded Windows Standard 7 box because it shortened our development and time to market, and because of all the tools are available off the shelf for windows. What I am looking for are some solid answers as it relates to the security of WES7 vs. Linux? How stable is WES7, how prone is it to hack attempts, virus attacks etc. From a marketing point of view what could or should one say are the benefits of using WES7 over Linux? Are there any? What comparisons are there between the security of desktop Windows 7 and Embedded Windows Standard 7? Any responses would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
