I was absolutly sure that I need one (and some SO users too), but it turns out that my case was easily refactored with simple `List<object>`, and more I think about it I am no so sure anymore that one is needed and generics classes for collection managment are sufficient, I am just curious :) btw. there is a similar question, but that question assumes that such class is needed, and only one comment suggest that maybe is not needed. [EDIT] oh f*, I was ment to write OrderedDictionary not SortedDictionary, sorry folks, edited my post
