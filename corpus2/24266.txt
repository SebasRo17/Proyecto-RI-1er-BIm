I have a set of points in the 3D space and I want to draw the bounding convex polyhedron of those points. A very naÃ¯ve solution would be to draw a triangle between every three points:               Graphics3D[         {EdgeForm[None], Polygon[Part[pts, #] & /@ Subsets[Range[Length@pts], {3}]]},          Axes -> True]      However, this method is very inefficient. It takes a few seconds to be drawn on my laptop and whenever I want to rotate it using the mouse, it doesn't move smoothly. I know what the issue is: I am drawing too many triangles, many of them are not even visible (since they are placed inside the polyhedron). But how can I fix it? Here is an example and the set of the points: ![Polyhedron](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w7TBN.png)               pts={{0., 0., 0.}, {0., 0., 1.79176}, {0., 1.79176, 0.}, {1.79176, 0.,        0.}, {0., 1.79176, 0.}, {0., 0., 1.79176}, {1.79176, 0., 0.}, {0.,        1.79176, 0.606136}, {0., 0.606136, 1.79176}, {0., 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0., 0.606136, 1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0., 1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136,        0.}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.}, {1.79176, 0., 0.606136}, {0.606136,        0., 1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.}, {0.606136, 1.79176,        0.}, {1.79176, 0., 0.}, {0., 1.79176, 0.}, {0., 0.,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0., 0.606136}, {0.606136, 0.,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.}, {0.,        1.79176, 0.606136}, {0., 0.606136, 1.79176}, {0., 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0., 0.606136, 1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136,        0.}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.}, {1.79176, 0., 0.606136}, {0.606136,        0., 1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.}, {0.606136, 1.79176,        0.}, {1.79176, 0., 0.606136}, {0.606136, 0., 1.79176}, {1.79176,        0.606136, 0.}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.}, {1.79176, 0.,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0., 1.79176}, {0., 1.79176, 0.606136}, {0.,        0.606136, 1.79176}, {0., 1.79176, 0.606136}, {0., 0.606136,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.374693}, {1.79176, 0.374693,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.374693}, {0.374693, 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0.374693, 1.79176}, {0.374693, 0.606136,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.374693}, {1.79176, 0.374693,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.374693}, {0.374693, 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0.374693, 1.79176}, {0.374693, 0.606136,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.374693}, {1.79176, 0.374693,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.374693}, {0.374693, 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0.374693, 1.79176}, {0.374693, 0.606136,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.374693}, {1.79176, 0.374693,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.374693}, {0.374693, 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0.374693, 1.79176}, {0.374693, 0.606136,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.374693}, {1.79176, 0.374693,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.374693}, {0.374693, 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0.374693, 1.79176}, {0.374693, 0.606136,        1.79176}, {1.79176, 0.606136, 0.374693}, {1.79176, 0.374693,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 1.79176, 0.374693}, {0.374693, 1.79176,        0.606136}, {0.606136, 0.374693, 1.79176}, {0.374693, 0.606136,        1.79176}}
