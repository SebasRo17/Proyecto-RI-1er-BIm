Thanks to this great topic, I've found the `FrontEndToken` that I was looking for: `"DeleteGeneratedCells"` (well, it is also written in `Help` but I've found it later :) **Question:** I would love to execute it in `NotebookObject` without confirmation through the automatically displayed `ChoiceDialog["Do You really want to..."]`. Is it maybe a case of `FrontEndTokenExecute` **parameters**? I suspect I can deal with it by setting some global options for _Mathematica_ but I would rather leave them.
