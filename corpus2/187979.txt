Say you have               class A {     }          class B {     }      One type dependency is "method parameter":               class A {     }          class B {       public void M(A a) {       }     }      Another is "method returns":               class A {     }          class B {       public A M() {       }     }      Then C, an adapter from A to B, could be identified by a class that exhibits both of the above dependency characteristics:               class C {       public B M(A a) {       }     }      I just seems like something that could be approached with some formal methods and I'd be interested to read about them if they are out there?
