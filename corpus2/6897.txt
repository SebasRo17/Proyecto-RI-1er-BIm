The documentation for CompilationTarget says, "if you do not have a suitable C compiler then you will not be able to set CompilationTarget to C". Well at this time, I don't have a compiler installed on either of my computers running Windows XP, or Windows 7. Is it safe to say that any compiler that will run with my OS will be "suitable"? If it isn't that simple, can you recommend a compiler?
