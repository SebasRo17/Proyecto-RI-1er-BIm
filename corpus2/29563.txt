The following command gives `0` in _Mathematica_ 9.0.1.               f[a_, b_] := Exp[I*(a*x^3 + b*x^2)];     Integrate[f[a, b], {x, -Infinity, Infinity}, Assumptions -> {a > 0, Element[b,Reals]}]      This seems to be wrong, see the following article:   http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5031 Is this really a bug and if yes, is it known (is it perhaps even some instance of a bigger problem)?
