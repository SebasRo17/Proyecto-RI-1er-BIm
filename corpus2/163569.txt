In an interview someone asked me : How do we manage 2 transactional/dao methods in a single transaction. Desired capabilities:   1. If anyone of them fails we need to rollback both methods.   2. Both of the methods can be called separately attached with a single transaction.   3. The management should be on DAO layer, not on service layer. I think : the question relates to spring transaction management.
