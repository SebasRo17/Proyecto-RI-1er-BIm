I currently have a List of the form,               {{String_1, 8.}, {String_2, `101.}, {String_3, 37.}, ..., {String_n, 28.}}      Along with another list,               {{8, 37, ... }, ..., {..., 28, 101}}      And I would like to return,               {{String_1, String_3, ...}, ..., {..., String_n, String_2}}      In short, I would like to replace the lists of numbers in the second list with their corresponding strings (given in the first list). I imagine this has quite a simple solution, but searching through Mathematica's documentation hasn't been very fruitful. Any help is appreciated.
