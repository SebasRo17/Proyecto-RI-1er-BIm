I'am planning my website over here based on MVC. And I am thinking about a webservice (who knows, maybe one day I'll create an android app or something). The site and the webservice will behave diferently from each other. So what should I do? Write different controllers for each... or stuff IFs all over the place? For example: on the site, the controller will act as such:   Password correct?   \---->redirect user to welcome screen   Password incorrect?   \---->render login page again   But the webservice will simple show a json like:   {message: 'wrong password/sucess'} Which one you think is the best approach?
