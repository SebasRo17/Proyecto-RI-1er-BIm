Am I considered "technical"? I am starting my third company, and in the process of doing so, I meet investors. They seem to be all caught up in whether a startup has a technical co-founder. Ok. So what makes a person technical? Here's some info about me. You be the judge.   * I have worked for software and internet companies for 18 years.   * I have built web sites.   * I am starting my third company.   * My business partners build the web architectures for the businesses I dream up.   * I've successfully launched technical products for mobile and web in the US and Internationally.   * I do the rest of the work.   * I have a Github account.   * I've built my own gaming PCs. But I may be taking the question too literally when asked "Are you technical?"   * I don't code, but I can read code well enough to copy/paste it.   * I've worked on command line editors like emacs and vi, but it's not my forte. Or should I just lighten up and answer "Yes" when asked?
