I have a script written to test a package as follows:               SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];     << test`          A = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}     cp = CharacteristicPolynomial[A, L]     sol = Sum[L[n, cp], {n, 0, 1}]      Which outputs "L+ Null". The package is as follows:               BeginPackage["test`"]          L::usage="description goes here"          Begin["`Private`"]          ClearAll["Global`*"]          L[n0_,cp0_]:=         Module[{n=n0,cp=cp0},         L[n_,cp_]:=             L[n,cp]=                 Which[                     n==0,L[0]=1,                     n==1,L[1]=L,                     n==2,L[2]=Simplify[-(cp-L^2)],                     n>2 && EvenQ[n]==True,L[n]=Simplify[L[n/2] L[n/2]],                     n>2 && EvenQ[n]==False,L[n]=Simplify[L[n-1] L[1]]                     ]     ]          End[]     EndPackage[]      Essentially, my function "L[ ]" has 4 possible outputs:   when n=0 L[0]=1,   when n=1, L[1]=L,   when n=2, L[2]=Simplify[-(cp-L^2)]   when n>2 and even, L[n]=Simplify[L[n/2] L[n/2]]   when n>2 and odd, L[n]=Simplify[L[n-1] L[1]] Why is L[0,cp]= Null, when all of the other possibilities work?   If I try just L[0,cp] (no Sum[ ]) I receive no output. What does that mean?   Is Which[ ] the best method of approach in this situation?
