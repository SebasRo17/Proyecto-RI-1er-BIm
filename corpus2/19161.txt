I'm working with lists of lists of lists. Each box with information has a specific format like                 information = {{a},{{b}},{{{c},{d}},{e,{f}}},{g}}      and so together they look like                 {{{a},{{b}},{{{c},{d}},{e,{f}}},{g}},{{h},{{i}},{{{j},{k}},{l,{m}}},{n}},...      and this goes over the whole screen. I want to make the inner and outer brackets in an expression like **{{** a **}}** look different, possibly down to all levels. Is there a way to highlight the bracketing in such a way that I can _see_ the different levels of the list?
