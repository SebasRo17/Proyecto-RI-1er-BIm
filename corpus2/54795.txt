I want to save a certain graphics by pressing a button. Thinks work fine for something like this               Button["Save",      export = Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 10^3]];      Export["test.pdf", export]      ]      By increasing the number of data points the button press doesn`t generate test.pdf file anymore               Button["Save",      export = Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 10^7]];      Export["test.pdf", export]      ]      Simply executing               Export["test.pdf", export]      after pressing the button, generats the pdf file. What is the cause of this behaviour? Thanks in advance for your help
