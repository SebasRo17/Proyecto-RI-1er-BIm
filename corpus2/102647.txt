A business has five discrete streams of business requirements to be implemented in software. There is a team of ten developers. A "naiive" organisational solution is to split the team into five "teams" of two (one per requirements stream). But I feel this compromises the integrity of the team (making teamwork more difficult, causing silo effects, making communication harder etc). Has anyone any insight into how best organise a developer team like this to deliver against multiple requirement streams? Is it workable to have fewer development teams than there are requirements streams?
