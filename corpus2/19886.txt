I'm working on making some `BarCharts`, however, some of my data is contained within a small range so I want the plot to start above 0 and cut-off the bars below that, however, when I try to use `PlotRange` the bars are not cropped properly (they extend below the axis) and if you try to introduce `ChartLabels` they are cut in half!               BarChart[RandomReal[1, 10], BarSpacing -> Large, ChartLabels -> Range[10]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hUd3M.png)               BarChart[RandomReal[1, 10], BarSpacing -> Large, PlotRange -> {Automatic, {0.2, 1}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rJ8Di.png)               BarChart[RandomReal[1, 10], BarSpacing -> Large, PlotRange -> {Automatic, {0.2, 1}}, ChartLabels -> Range[10]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m0fp9.png) I've tried playing around with `ImagePadding` and `BarOrigin` but nothing seems to work. Is there a better solution? With a `ListPlot` adjusting the `PlotRange`               ListPlot[RandomReal[1, 10], PlotRange -> {Automatic, {0.2, 1}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4XBrD.png)
