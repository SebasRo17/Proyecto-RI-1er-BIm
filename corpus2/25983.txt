I have a set of points:               pts={{2.28571, 2.79821}, {2.28571, 3.79821}, {2.28571, 4.79821}, {3.57143,        1.1375}, {3.57143, 2.1375}, {3.57143, 3.1375}, {3.57143,        4.1375}, {4.85714, 0.316071}, {4.85714, 1.31607}, {4.85714,        2.31607}, {4.85714, 3.31607}, {4.85714, 4.31607}, {6.14286,        0.316071}, {6.14286, 1.31607}, {6.14286, 2.31607}, {6.14286,        3.31607}, {6.14286, 4.31607}, {7.42857, 1.1375}, {7.42857,        2.1375}, {7.42857, 3.1375}, {7.42857, 4.1375}, {8.71429,        2.79821}, {8.71429, 3.79821}, {8.71429, 4.79821}}      And I am trying to make its Bounded Voronoi Diagram. When using DiagramPlot I get proper result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/k1Stb.png) But when using BoundedDiagram with bound: `{{0, 0}, {10, 0}, {10, 6}, {0, 6}}` following error occurs:               RowReduce::luc: Result for RowReduce of badly conditioned matrix {{-10.,0.,600.},{-7.99361\[CenterDot]10^-15,3.12639\[CenterDot]10^-13,-1.60087\[CenterDot]10^-12}} may contain significant numerical errors. >>      And actually description of this error hardly suggests why this occurs. How to workaround this? EDIT: when points are moved randomly just a bit in random direction function doesn't fail.
