**Quick background** \- I work in a bank doing financial modelling where I need to do some domain specific programming, but otherwise it's only statistics and presentations. **Situation** \- Software has always been my first "love", but due to various circumstances I did not take up a career in the software industry. I have a very good graduate degree in Theoretical Computer Science - so I understand what it means when people talk about traveling salesmen, lambda calculus or whether P=NP (examples). I intend to get into programming full time in the next couple of years. **Chosen path**   1. Get really good at something - I have chosen the HTML5 "ecosystem" comprising HTML, Javascript and CSS. Over the years I have programmed in C, Haskell, Erlang, C++, Javascript, Common Lisp, Basic and Logo but not sufficiently proficient in any of them.   2. Establish myself as an expert in the community primarily through blogging and participating in projects / forums / events related to the same. Then I can try and establish some freelancing business or convince a startup to hire me. **Questions** \- Are there any well known examples of people who have taken a similar path after working in a completely unrelated field for years (7, in my case)? Am I completely delusional and two years is too short a time?
