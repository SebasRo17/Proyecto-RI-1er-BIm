I've been working in a very small team for PHP development and we've been using an ad-hoc, "Invented Here" style guide. Now that our team and codebase is growing, we would like to use a more broadly-used style guide that would be, if not an official standard, a de facto standards used in many PHP communities. Does such a thing exist as it exists in the C/C++/Java/Javascript/etc. circles ?
