I am a Hobbyist Java programmer and I would like to further my programming skills by learning C or C++ and Python. I have read many C vs C++ articles but none of them contain the information I'm looking for. I would like to know if it is better to learn C or C++. In most articles I read most people recommend C++ saying that it is better because it is OO and is easier to write GUIs in or they don't recommend C saying that you will learn bad FO habits. But I can program in Java which is OO so the FO habits won't stick. As for the GUI, I think python might be better suited at handling that. I would also like to know which is better for python. i.e. which works more well with python or which runs faster with python etc. So do you recommend C and python and java or C++ and Python and Java P.S I do most of my programming on linux.
