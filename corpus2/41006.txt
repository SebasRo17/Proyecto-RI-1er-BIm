How do I plot something like $$\{(x,y): 1 \leq x^2 + y^2 < 9\}?$$ I want to be able to make the boundary $x^2 + y^2 = 9$ dotted line and the unit circle filled and coloured region in between? I tried using               RegionPlot[1 <= x^2 + y^2 < 9, {x, -3.5, 3.5}, {y, -3.5, 3.5},        Frame -> False, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, Axes -> True]      But that gave me a bolded boundary on $x^2 + y^2 = 9$
