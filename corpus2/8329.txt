I have two `Button`s within a single panel. My problem is that after deploying that panel, the second `Button` is not working in the `CDFPlayer`. But it works in `Notebook`. Why is it not working in the CDFPlayer?               Panel[Row[{Button["Speak", Speak["HI"]],      Button["Speak2", (CreateDialog[     Button["Ok", Speak["infratab"], Method -> "Queued"]];),      Method -> "Queued"]}]]
