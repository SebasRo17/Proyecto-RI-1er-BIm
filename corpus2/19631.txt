I think it's safe to assume that for most programmers, producing documentation is not as fun as actually coding. I think it's also safe to assume that most good programmers recognize the need for useful documentation, and the code that they write is not an exception by any stretch of the imagination. So, I'd like to know: what's the best documentation you produce (and source code doesn't count). Answer can be anything from comments to unit tests. The bigger question is _why_ is that the best documentation you produce?
