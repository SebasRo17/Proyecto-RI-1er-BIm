Do you find reasonable to practice coding dojos on a regular basis? I understand dojo may be a good starting point to introduce somebody to some approach but what is the point of making similar dojos regularly? So currently we have two teams which are working on real project written in TDD. One team wants to work on TDD-oriented dojos regularly and other prefers to practice it only on real tasks. Who is right?
