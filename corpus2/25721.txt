I have one big list with many sublists inside. All sublists consist of three numbers. For example:               {{83, 85, 82}, {65, 49, 46}, {65, 76, 45}, {70, 65, 84}, {73, 72, 65}, {40, 84, 72}, {69, 79, 80}, {69, 78, 73}, {78, 71, 41}, {10, 10, 49}}       This is part of a list and I want that each sublist is one point on graphic. For example RGB(83,85,82) is color of first pixel, then 65,49,46 is color of the next pixel and so on. Is there any way to plot that list in such way that one sublist represents one color in RGB system and somehow to specify the width of a plot. Thanks.
