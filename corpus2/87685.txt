I just got a position at a big, well-known C#/.NET company. The thing is that I don't know any C# or .NET at all (they know that) and I want to learn as much as I can before I start, to not waste time (and money). How do I learn C#/.NET quickly and efficiently? Resources? Great tutorials? Videos? EDIT: I forgot to mention that I have a couple of years experience with Java. So I am not new to programming - just new to .NET. UPDATE: Thank you for all your replies. I have ordered "Essential C# 4.0" and until then, I will go through some of the guides / tutorials and the general documentation at MSDN.
