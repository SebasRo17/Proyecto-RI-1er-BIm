As a beginner programmer I've only worked with programming computer based applications, but a question has been coming to my head very often since I started programming and I can't get it answered properly. Machines don't act on their own, that's the programmer's job, he tells it what to do and when to do it, but my curiosity lies beneath computers. I'll take the examples of an ATM software on this post but keep in mind there are many others such as a washing machine display, or a TV, mobile phone, you name it. How exactly is the software for these kind of machines built? I imagine it can't be identical to computer-based programming. What language do they use to make such things work and how does one get the job done? Are there programmers specialized on this kind of programming? What is the process of making these machines come to life?
