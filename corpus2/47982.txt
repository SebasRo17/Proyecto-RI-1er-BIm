I get a hit on performance with the `Exp` function depending on the range of my inputs. for example, with:               w1 = RandomComplex[-20000 I, {10000000}];     Exp[w1]; // Timing          w2 = RandomComplex[-20 I, {10000000}];     Exp[w2]; // Timing      Results in 2.4 and 0.4 sec respectively. What mystifies me is that the involved numbers are not in a numerically "interesting" range. The transition to slower times starts gradually at about `-500 I` and asymptotically stabilizes by about `-10000 I`. Past these ranges the timings are stable:               w = RandomComplex[-I, {1000000}];     t = Table[{10^n, Timing[Exp[10^n w]][[1]]}, {n, 1.5, 5, .01}];     ListLogLinearPlot[t, AxesLabel -> {"Scaling", "Time"}]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fYrA4.png) Any ideas what might be happening here? Any simple fixes to get faster performance with high scaling factors?
