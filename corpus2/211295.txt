I haven't found much on this, but what I did find doesn't explain it well enough (at least for me). What makes the application I make portable?   Or what defines a portable application?   Is there a specific difference that makes an app portable or not? I always thought if I just made an executable file and some images I could just copy that folder and take it to another computer on a flash drive. But, if you could what is the purpose of having "portable" apps? I know I have asked a range of questions, but I suspect an answer that addresses one of the questions will cover them all.
