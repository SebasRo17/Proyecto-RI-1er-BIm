Sometimes _Mathematica_ takes quite a while to finish calculations and it would be convenient to be able to move away from the computer while it is working. I was wondering if there is any "clever" hack that can be used purely within _Mathematica_ to e-mail updates on the computation. I can think of a very rough way of getting an update other than actually accessing the machine, which would be by exporting some output to a file in Dropbox. From another machine connected to Dropbox I could see when the file is updated. But this seems to me like a very ugly solution. A less ugly solution would be to write an external script, probably with python, and then have _Mathematica_ run it at some point in the calculation. This would allow for both e-mail and text message updates (using Skype or a similar service and the appropiate python modules). Is there any way to do something similar purely within _Mathematica_?
