As a long time cut and paste coder I never committed much of the syntax of a language to memory. Even worse, I now use google to solve many of the coding problems which are of the type typically used in job interviews. This has greatly increased my productivity, the quality of the end result and stops me perpetuating the same bugs across all my code. However it means I don't actually remember the detail of the solution. For some reason in a job interview "I would look that up on google" does not seem to be the right answer. Am I better off in the interview to pass no comment on my coding style and simply pull out an iPad and produce the solution?
