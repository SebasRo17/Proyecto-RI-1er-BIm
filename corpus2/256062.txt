For comparison, for a runtime fatal error, it is often that the cause of the error is way before the error crashes a program. For a logic error, it doesn't crash a program. It happens when the state of the execution of the program isn't what we expect for the first time. The cause of a logic error in a program, I think, just like the cause of a runtime fatal error, is where you make correction and the program will not have the logic error. I wonder if the cause of a logic error must be where the error happens, or can be way before that? Thanks.
