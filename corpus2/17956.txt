My question is as follows. Suppose we have a function $f(r)$ and we want to study its asymptotic behavior at infinity ($r\rightarrow \infty$). For example, the function may reduce to $-\frac{a}{r}$ or $b e^{-cr}$ at infinity. How do I identify the constants $a,b$ and $c$ using _Mathematica_? Or, more generally, how do I identify the asymptote of a function? Can anybody point out useful built-in functions? I am interested in the function: $$ f(r)=-\frac{\sqrt[3]{3} e^{-2 r/3}}{\pi ^{2/3}}-\frac{\sqrt[3]{2 \pi } e^{2 r/3}}{5 \left(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{\pi } e^{2 r/3} \sinh ^{-1}\left(2 \sqrt[3]{2 \pi } e^{2 r/3}\right)}{5\ 2^{2/3}}+1\right)} $$ or               f[r_]:=-((3^(1/3) E^(-2 r/3))/\[Pi]^(2/3)) - (E^(2 r/3) (2 \[Pi])^(1/3))/(      5 (1 + (3 E^(2 r/3) \[Pi]^(1/3)           ArcSinh[2 E^(2 r/3) (2 \[Pi])^(1/3)])/(5 2^(2/3))))      I expect this function to have -$\frac{1}{r}$-behavior. How do I check it? I am not interested in a numerical value of the limit (which is 0), but rather in a function the original function reduces to at infinity. P.S. Using _Mathematica_ for a week
