Currently I am developing Multi-Branch Retail software. All branches have the same set of items. However, each one has its own stock quantity. My question is, what is the best practice to apply in branch quantity control for items? I am currently thinking about the following design:               Item Table      ========     -Id      -Description          Branch Table      ========     -Id     -Description          Branch Quantities Table      ========     -Id      -ItemId (FK to Item Table)     -BranchId (Fk to Branch Table)     -Quantity (This contains the quantity for a specific item)           Is this a good design? or any suggestions?
