I have just found a perfect fit solution for a problem I was having in O'Reilly's _Perl Cookbook._ The problem is, the book is copyrighted, and I could not find anything that looked like a license to reuse the code. On the other hand, I suppose "programming cookbooks" are more or less explicitly made with the intent that the reader will reuse some of the code that is provided. Legally, can I just reuse the code, or do I have to rewrite it? If this is relevant, my intent was to release the project I am working on under the AL/GPL dual license, which is the norm for Perl. I suppose this question could apply equally well to any programming cookbook with no explicit license.
