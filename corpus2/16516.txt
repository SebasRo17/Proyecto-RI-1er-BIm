Version 9, windows 7: When I use `ListLinePlot` Tooltip does not work any more. It seems to have been lost somewhere. With same data, Tooltip works ok using `ListPlot`.               data = Table[Tooltip[{x, x^2}], {x, 0, 10, .1}];     ListPlot[data]     (* Tooltip shows ok *)          ListLinePlot[data]     (* Tooltip does not show up *)      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6BFH7.png) Looked at possible issues for `ListLinePlot` and do not seen mention of this. question: How to make Tooltip work with `ListLinePlot` thanks
