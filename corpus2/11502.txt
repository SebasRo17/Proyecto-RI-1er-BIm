For example I have a string               "ABCDEabcde1234"      I would like to split it into               {"AB", "CD", "Ea", "bc", "de", "12", "34"}      How can I achieve this? I have looked at the `StringSplit[]` documentation but that seems like it only works for splitting a string by character, not length.
