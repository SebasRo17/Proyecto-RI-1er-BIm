I have a rectangular matrix, which is `m`-by-10. Each element is either 0 or 1. I would like 0 to correspond to white elements, and 1 to red elements. This works fine if `m = 100` or similar small values:               m = 100;     list = Table[Table[RandomInteger[], {j, 1, 10}], {i, 1, m}];     Tally[Flatten[list]]     MatrixPlot[list, FrameTicks -> None, ImageSize -> {300, 300},       ColorRules -> {0 -> White, 1 -> Red}]      ![MP1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cohTl.gif) However, if I choose `m = 200`, the coloring becomes strange and no longer only white or red:               m = 200;     list = Table[Table[RandomInteger[], {j, 1, 10}], {i, 1, m}];     Tally[Flatten[list]]     MatrixPlot[list, FrameTicks -> None, ImageSize -> {300, 300},       ColorRules -> {0 -> White, 1 -> Red}]      ![MP2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fqtji.gif) Why do I see orange if each element is either 0 or 1? Is there any way I can correct this so that the only colors that appear are white or red? Setting `ColorFunctionScaling -> False` does not seem to correct the problem: ![MP3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cnixq.gif)
