I am implementing RSA encryption on a Android App so that I can send SMS message securely, each phone will have its own public and private key generated by the App. But am stuck deciding the best way to store the keys, my options are:   1. Create a keystore and hold the public and private key in the keystore.   2. Save the public and private key to separate files.   3. Use sharedpreferences to store keys. I was also thinking of encrypting the private key with blowfish if just stored in a file. Can anyone help explain to me which is the most secure option?
