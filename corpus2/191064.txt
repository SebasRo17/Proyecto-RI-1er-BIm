Let's say I have an animal class...with fields of name, height and weight. I want to create a bird class which is an animal, but it has also, say, wing size. How can I do that? My general idea is creating the animal class, and the bird class which inherits animal, and has additional field ...but then different kinds of birds would inherit that class. **My Questions:**   * Is my solution an appropriate OO approach to this type of problem?   * Is there a known design pattern for handling data modeling problems of this type?
