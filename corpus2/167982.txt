When I want to learn a vast topic on Wikipedia, I don't know where to start. For instance say I want to learn about Binary Stars, I then have to know other things linked on that pages and linked pages on all the linked pages and so on for the **specified number of levels**. I want to write a web crawler like HTTracker or something similar, that will display a hierachy of the links on a certain page and the links on those linked pages. **I wish to use as much prewritten code as possible.** Here is an example: **Pretending we are bending the rules by grabbing links from only the first sentence of each page** The example archives and "processes" _two levels deep_ The page is Ternary operation ## The First Level In mathematics a ternary operation is an N-ary operation ## The Second Level ### Under Mathmatics: Mathematics (from Greek μάθημα máthēma, “knowledge, study, learning”) is the abstract study of topics encompassing quantity, structure, space, change and others; it has no generally accepted definition. ### Under N-ary In logic,mathematics, and computer science, the arity i/ˈærɨti/ of a function or operation is the number of arguments or operands that the function takes ### Under Operation In its simplest meaning in mathematics and logic, an operation is an action or procedure which produces a new value from one or more input values ## \------------------------------------------------------------------------- I need some way to determine what order to approach all these wiki pages to learn the concept ( in this case ternary operations )... Following along with this example, one way to show the path to read would a printout flowout like so: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1fLex.png) This shows that the first sentence of the Mathematics page doesn't link to the first sentence of pages linked on ternary page two levels deep. (Please tell me how I should explain this ) ---> In other words, the child node of the top pages first sentence, ternary_operation, does not have any child nodes that reference the children of the top pages other children nodes- N-ary and operation. Thus it is safe to read this first. Since N-ary has a link to operations we should read the operation page second and finally read the N-ary page last. Again, **I wish to use as much prewritten code as possible** , and was wondering what language to use and what would be the simplest way to go about doing this if there isn't already something out there?
