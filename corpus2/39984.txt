I need to solve an polynimial equation, but when i try to use Solve or NSolve in mathematica, its cant find the solution in appropriate time (i interrupted calculation after 5 hour left). The equations is:               Remove["Global`*"];     g = 9.8;     C1 = 3.6;     C2 = 0.25;     C3 = 666;     C4 = 2;     c = -36;     e = 0.86;     P0 = 24.44;     h0 = 0.1;          h = h0*(1 + C3*P^C4);     NSolve[{P/P0 == ((1 - e*(1 - h/e))/(1 - e))^((2 + c)/3)/(1 - h/e)^4.65}, {P}]      Maybe my computer is too weak or I'm using the wrong method?
