I am reading in some data from a CSV file that has a line which gives titles to each "column". **Here is an example:**               Entry No,Val1,Val2,Val3,Val4     0,1.01,1.345,5.234,345.45     1,2.456,1.256,250.56,45.027      In reality this file has 20 or so values on each line, and therefore 20 column titles on the first line. I want to display this data in a table, so I first import the file and then display it like so:               dataSet1 = Take[Import["data_set_1.csv","CSV","HeaderLines"->1]]      TableForm[dataSet1]      I want to be able to manipulate and plot my data later so I am pretty sure I have to remove the line containing the labels using the "Headerlines->1" option. I would like the table to display the column titles that were on he first line of the CSV file. I know that I _could_ specify them manually, but I think there should be someway to do this because I deleted them the set using "HeaderLines"
