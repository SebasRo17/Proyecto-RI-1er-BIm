I have little knowledge about the subjects of compiler construction and parallel programming, so please bear with me. This is a course about compiler construction, and we are asked to learn CUDA while taking the course because the professor would like us to write a compiler for a simplified language. That compiler is supposed to be doing the work in parallel at some specific stages. My understanding was that the scanner, parser, semantic analyzer, code generator and the optimizer are inherently sequential. I have written some parsers for very simple tasks before, so my understanding is based on little bit of theory and little bit of experience. I would understand how to incorporate shared state at some point in the construction of the compiler to do multiprocessing, but not SPMD. **What components of a compiler can be parallelized(e.g. using CUDA as in my case, SPMD model in general)?** _SPMD_ : Single Program Multiple Data
