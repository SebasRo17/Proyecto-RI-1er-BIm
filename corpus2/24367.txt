I have got some impulse response data that I would like to transform via `Fourier` to get the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the performing loudspeaker. The final goal is to show (e.g. via `ListDensityPlot`) how the calculated amplitude-frequency characteristics is dependant on the window I choose to transform (truncation of low frequencies). The issue I have is to get `Fourier` to behave like desired - I am unable to reproduce the frequency response that I got out of another 3rd part software. The issue: There is no `SampleRate` option for `Fourier` (and I got a sampling frequency of 48kHz) The following example illustrates the issues:               data = Table[Sin[x], {x, 0, 100}];          ListPlot[     Take[10*Log10[(Abs@Fourier[data, FourierParameters -> {1, -1}])^2],      Floor@(Length[Fourier[data, FourierParameters -> {1, -1}]]/2)],      Joined -> True, PlotRange -> Full]      ![fourier](http://i.stack.imgur.com/upOQF.png)               Periodogram[data, FourierParameters -> {1, -1}, SampleRate -> 1,      PlotRange -> Full, ScalingFunctions -> "dB"]      ![periodogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dZunU.png)
