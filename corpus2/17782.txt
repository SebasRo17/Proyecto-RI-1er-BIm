I am running _Mathematica_ 7\. Suppose that I plot $\sin(x)$ for $x = 0..10$ and frame the plot using `Frame -> True`: > >     Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> All, Frame -> True] >   > > ![Plot 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/djEIO.gif) Now suppose that I would like the horizontal axis to have ticks every $0.5$ (which it does), but with the ticks _labeled_ only every $1$. Is there a way to do this? `FrameTicks` seemed to be a possibility, but when I used `Range[0, 10, 1]` in the bottom horizontal axis specification, I lost the (non-labeled) ticks at every $0.5$: > >     Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> All, Frame -> True, >      FrameTicks -> {{Automatic, Automatic}, {Range[0, 10, 1], Automatic}}] >   > > ![Plot 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QjacX.gif) Thanks for your time.
