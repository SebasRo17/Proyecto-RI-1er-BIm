In CrossValidated, the answer to a question on prediction of number of viewers of Gangnam Style is given in R. I have mapped the answer directly to _Mathematica_ :               S0 = 10000000; a = 0.00000005; b = 0.01; k = 1.2;     views = {{0, 0}}; S = S0; inf = 1;     For[t = 1, t < 365, t++, dS = -a*inf*S;       dinf = a*inf*S - b*inf;       S = S + dS;       inf = inf + dinf;       noviews = Last[Last[views]] + k inf;        views = Append[views, {t, noviews}]];     ListPlot[views]      ![Result from function](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SOsyb.jpg) However, this doesn't really feel or look like good _Mathematica_ code. I tried to follow the advice in Alternatives to procedural loops and iterating over lists in Mathematica. But I get stuck in trying to create the function that the `FoldList` should use. It seems like the solution would be to have `FoldList` create a number of lists, one for each "state" variable. So my question is: how do I rewrite the `For` loop that has a number of "state" variables and where the output depends on both these variables and earlier values of the output?
