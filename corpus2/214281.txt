Since this statement is so common: `while (true)` (Java) or `while (1)` (C) or sometimes `for (;;)` Why is there not a single instruction for this? I could think that an instruction that could do it is just `do` but `do` requires a `while` at the end of the block but it would be more logical to write an infinite loop like this               do {          //loop forever          }      Why not? AFAIK the instruction `do` always requires a `while` at the end but if we could use it like above then it would be a clear way to define something like `while (true)` which I think should not be written like that (or `for (;;)`).
