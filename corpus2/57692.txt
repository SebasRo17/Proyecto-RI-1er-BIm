Since upgrading to _Mathematica 10_ on Mac OSX I have come across a number of instances of this error, which occurs using Probit and Logit model fit. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1gD6T.png) A bit of googling show this is something to do with the estimation algorithm. But the issue is more complex. When I estimate the model straight from this dataset I get the error, but when I first take the values of the data, then fit the model, I get the expected result. Here's an example               var = {age, gender, photo6};          mTest = SemanticImport[        "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3997716/test.csv"];          testFit =       mTest[ProbitModelFit[#, var,          var] &, {#age, #gender, #photo6, #rawM} &]          testFit2 =       ProbitModelFit[#, var,          var] &@(mTest[All, {"age", "gender", "photo6", "rawM"}] //           Normal // Values)      Output of this is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WeBRA.png) Why the two different results for the same calculation? Is there a workaround that allows the estimation to proceed when directly using the dataset?
