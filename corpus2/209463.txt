If I learn to build web applications with the .NET stack in C#, say MVC, entity framework, linq, etc., will that be of any benefit to me in developing native Windows program executables? I see benefits for using Visual Studio, the language, such as C#, just general experience in programming. But I don't know if there is any direct relationship between asp.net and native programming.
