There is ambiguity in all papers I have read so I would like to ask about the following requirement: **Requirement: Being a Game master, I can access the GM menu by typing "menuInvoke".** Trying to do that as a regular player - is **that a negative test or still positive in terms of verifying the requirement?** Because some authors say negative testing means dealing with inputs unknown to specification, which would not be this case as the spec does say you need to be a Game master, implying it is not allowed for the other ones. However if you think like that, it is always implicit: range 1-1000 implies that nothing else can be entered, yet we test it as a negative test. An example of ambiguity: Login system. Some say that providing incorrect password to receive Login error is negative test but I agree with the others - it is plain positive test as the requirement definitely specifies that only a user with valid password can login.
