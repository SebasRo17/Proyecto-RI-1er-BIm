I have a project that will need to handle 1000s of requests a second with a decent amount of processing for each. For the most part, the processing will be done on a list of items, basically filtering it and returning a smaller list. This process can be done in parallel fairly easily and I should also say, speed is important. I've narrowed my language of choice for the project down to clojure, erlang, and go, and have researched them all to a moderate degree. My question is, what factors should I be looking at in my decision? What language is better for what (examples would be great)? Because it's a little difficult for me to tell.
