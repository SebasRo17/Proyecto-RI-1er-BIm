I'm about to start writing a library to support machine learning algorithms (decision trees, ANNs, Bayes nets, etc.), and I'm planning on making this a very general library. By this, I mean I want to be able to plug this module into as many languages as possible. To clarify, here's why I've started writing it in C++ (Windows headers):   * I know I can import C++ libraries into C#, and I've heard you can import C++ into Python. So, obviously, the library can be used in 3 languages, possibly 4 if I don't use system-specific headers.   * Is there a language where I can cover a wider spread, weighted by popularity of languages? (For example, C# and C++ have pretty high weight to me because I use both frequently, Python less so.)
