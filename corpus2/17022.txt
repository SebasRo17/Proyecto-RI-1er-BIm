When a hyperlink is created in a notebook, there does not seem to be an easy way to actually edit the hyperlink (maybe to correct the URL). To make some text HYPERLINK, one selects the text using the mouse, then does a right-click and then selects `Make HyperLink ...`, then a popup menu comes up where one enters the actual URL. Then clicks ok and hyperlink is made. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0aIEr.png) Now the text becomes a hyperlink. But how can one bring this menu back up in order to modify the link if needed? Right-clicking on the now hyperlink does not bring up the above menu used to create the hyperlink. Selecting the cell and typing `Ctrl+Shift+E` is not really practical, as the cell can be very large and contain many links. question is: How to bring up the original menu used to make the hyperlink in order to modify any specific link when needed?
