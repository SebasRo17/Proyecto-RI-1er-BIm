If you are an independent consultant/contractor, working for multiple clients, how do you sell your services? Do you believe applying to job offers for regular positions and offering your services to the hiring manager is a good strategy? My opinion is that a contractor is a great idea to see if you really need to take in a full-time employee, and thought if I could explain this to managers they would be open. What do you think?
