I know a lot of software shops keep binaries under source control. However, our shop had come to store entire frameworks on the repository: DirectX runtime, CUDA, nVidia Optix, whatever. It is said to make a dev machine setup easier (supposedly, get latest and start coding). However, it considerably bloats the repository and burdens it with irrelevant history. I've never seen such a usage pattern. Do you consider it a good practice? [EDIT:] I have no problem with source-controlling isolated 3rd party binaries. The question refers to entire framework runtimes, typically consisting in 10+ binaries. As an extreme example, take Windows SDK (which we don't keep on the repository, thank god, but I see no difference in principle).
