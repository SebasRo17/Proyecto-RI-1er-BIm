Everyone knows that the "current" way to do things is to have user-readable URLs. Like: http://example.com/blog/edit/1234 Rather than: http://example.com/blog.php?action=edit&id=1234 When exactly did people start making web technologies handling this though? I remember in the dark ages of the early 2000s, I don't remember ever seeing a friendly URL. In fact, I think Stackoverflow (in 2008/9) may have been the first time I noticed them. When exactly did this become so popular, and what were the first servers/frameworks built with friendly URLs in mind? I'm interested as well in when rewriting to friendly URLs became common, and when serving friendly URLs natively became common
