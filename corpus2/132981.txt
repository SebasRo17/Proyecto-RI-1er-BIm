I'm not 100% sure this is approriate here, but I figure the area of study is particular to programmers, since it's open source software. If it's better posted somewhere else then please say so and I will post it there. * * * Can anybody point me in the right direction of any studies on businesses and consumers adopting open source software? Ideally, I'd like some qualitative information on why both parties choose (not) to adopt open source software, but raw numbers are good too. Any relevant experiences and case studies of this from users would be welcome as well.
