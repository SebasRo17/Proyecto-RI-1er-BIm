Imagine I have file called `strings.dat`. Inside this file there is alot of string, for example: one million. **String are sorted**. Now I want to find specified string, so I can write method like this:               public long FindByName (string text)     {       // ...     }      This method can return to me a position within a file where this string occurs. But iterating through lots of data is not efficient. I can do some indexing system, like an `Dictionary<char, long>` which tells about at what position within file is placed first string with its value starting from given char. Example: if I got 5 strings: hello   hello2   world   world2   Zzz So my dictionary will be like:   h 0   w 2   z 4 But it's not efficient if I will have 1000 string with "d" char as first letter, and 10 million with "r" letter. Do you know any good algorithms do ahieve what Im asking for?
