Given that out and ref parameters have slight different connotations would writing code like below be considered a bug (even though it doesn't cause an issue at present), or just a lack of understanding on ref and out parameters?               public void MyMethod()      {         int myInt = 0;         MyMethodWithRef(ref myInt);     }          public void MyMethodWithRef(ref myInt)     {         // not used before being assigned a value.  Does an out parameter make more sense then           myInt = 5;     }      I understand that this is the incorrect usage of ref but if you saw that in code constantly or even once would you consider it a bug and hence fix it as well as inform the original coder or just do it as part of general refactoring practices?
