Somewhere I saw a rant against java/javac allegedly using a mix of Windows and Unix style like               java -classpath ... -ea ... Something      IMHO, it is no mix, it's just like `find` works as well, isn't it? AFAIK, according to POSIX, the syntax should be like               java --classpath ... --ea ... Something      and `-abcdef` would mean specifying 6 short options at once. I wonder which version leads in general to less typing and less errors. I'm writing a small utility in Java and in no case I'm going to use Windows style `/a /b` since I'm interested primarily in Unix. What style should I choose?
