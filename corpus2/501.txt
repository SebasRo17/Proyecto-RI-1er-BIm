No matter how much you love a programming language, there are always a few details in it that arenâ€™t quite as nice as they could be. In this question, I would like to specifically focus on **syntax elements.** In a programming language that you use frequently (perhaps your favourite programming language, or perhaps the one you are forced to use at work), which syntax element do you find most unreadable, unclear, inconvenient or unpleasant?
