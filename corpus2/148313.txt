I typically implement graphs as doubly linked lists but this is fairly space inefficient in my experience as I need k pointers/references for k neighbors so for an undirected graph I'd have ~2k neighbor links within the lists if my math is right. Is there a better way of saving space? I know that some of the links can be made singular if the graph is directed but is there a way to do a better job of this?
