I am new to the construction and design of a web app so I'd like some advice please (Django is my framework). I'm trying to code up a "how-to" website instructing users the step-by-step process for doing a certain task. I'd like the navigation of the website to be something like this... http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa991542.aspx ...in which there is a tree-like navigation on the left-pane that lists each step (e.g. Step 1, Step 2, etc...) that expands and loads the instructions for each step into the right-pane. I don't want to reload the page each time so that leads me into AJAX. At this point, I'm not sure how to implement this. Do I store the HTML/CSS into a database to be pulled when the user clicks on certain links? Or do I write the HTML/CSS into my template files with `display: hidden` to be changed to `display: block` when corresponding links are clicked?
