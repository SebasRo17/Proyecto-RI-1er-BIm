I am currently attempting to use .NET/link to call a third party DLL from _Mathematica_ using `DLLDefinedFunction`. I have been able to link against and call many of the functions in the DLL, but have encountered issues with one function in particular, which attempts to read in data from a file whose path is hard-coded relative to the current working directory. Forgive my ignorance, but as I am not "au fait" with .NET, I don't know how to determine what InstallableNET32.exe is using as its working directory, or how to change it to something else. (I do know how to change the working directory for the MathKernel, but based on my experimentation, any changes to the kernel's working directory do not appear to "flow through" to the InstallableNET runtime.) Could someone please provide guidance on how I can identify, and then change, the working directory being used by the InstallableNET runtime (Is this an example of another undocumented feature in .NET/link, like the `"Force32Bit"->True` option?)
