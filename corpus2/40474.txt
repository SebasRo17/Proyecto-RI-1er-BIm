For a single project in Workbench, the "Find Definition" feature (F3, when a function name is selected) takes you to the place where the function was defined, see documentation. According to this documentation, Workbench should find your definition in any .m file in current workspace, which is not the case for me. Even for project 'App1' which has reference to function from 'App2', the Find Definition cannot find function in 'App2' (which also shows as blue color of the function, meaning Workbench doesn't know its definition). ADDED according to @magma: When I tried to get the definition of a function written in a different .m file, the Find Definition feature did not work. I even tried with all relevant .m files open in different tabs, to no avail. Anybody has a clue? thanks Peter
