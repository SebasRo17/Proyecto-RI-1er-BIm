I've been freelancing for a local game development shop. Most of the projects we worked on were brought in by an external contractor. This guy now wants to do business directly with me for some new projects which have nothing to do with games, and thus _wouldn't require the skills of my previous clients_. They heard about it though, and they are now pissed at the contractor for not going through them, but I suspect he doesn't really care and will pursue anyway. As an independent worker, should I even care ? If so can I make everyone happy ?
