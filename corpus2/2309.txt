I'm having trouble with a non-linear fit: `fit = NonlinearModelFit[data, y0 + A Sin[\[Pi] (x - xc)/w], {y0, xc, A, w}, x]` where `data` has about 15 thousand points and looks like this: ![data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QOe5a.png) **The data can be downloadedhere.** Mathematica gives the following adjusted parameters: `{y0 -> 30.4428, xc -> 1.54318, A -> -0.000528519, w -> 0.999975}` However, this is a terrible fit: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xvok3.png) I wouldn't complain, except that there is an obviously better fit: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cnu4l.png) with the parameters: `{y0 -> 30.45775, w -> 752.71185, A -> 3.62443, xc -> 872.72035}` This best fit is returned by Origin without effort. What can I do to achieve the same with Mathematica? (I like Mathematica!)
