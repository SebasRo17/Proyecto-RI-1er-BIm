I'm working on an open source cross-platform client/server app. It is fairly complex and it's taken months for a group of developers to get it where it is now. At one point the team lead decided to implement a feature on his own. He had some development experience, but not a lot. He failed and the other developers finished the job for him. Since then his attitude got a lot more negative. He's trying to tell developers that their work is of poor quality and that all work should first be discussed with him. The current setup is that all team members are marked as "project owners" and thus have equal rights in the project. The team leader is now offering the developers the choice between always talking to him first or being demoted from project owners to contributors. So what are our options as developers? What arguments we can provide to the team leader to calm him down? Is it possible to save the project or is it better to fork out now? An important issue is that lately we had no active ticket system, and I personally think that this was the reason the mess appeared. So... any ideas?
