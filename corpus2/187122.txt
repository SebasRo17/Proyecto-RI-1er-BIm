Basically we now have 2 developers for an iOS project, 2 developers for an Android project and 1 designer doing designs for both projects. Right now, the way we exchange designs and images is through mail...so not very advanced or efficient. We're switching to Dropbox, but I feel like we could go a step further and somehow integrate the process into Git. For the iOS project, we are using Git, and I'm thinking that it might be a good idea to introduce the designer as well to Git. The problem is that, being a designer, it might be a bit difficult for him to understand source version control. As the 2 iOS devs, we'll probably be doing a lot of commits, branching, merging, but the designer will most likely only have to update images every now and then. We'd like to keep the setup as simple as possible (especially for the designer). We are using GitHub, so their OSX application might come in very handy for this. Does anyone else have experience or best practices about how to set up the branching/merging and integrating a designer into a technical Git project? Articles, blog posts etc. are welcomed as well.
