Okay, this might sound lame, but it is actually a difficult question (for me at-least)... Now there are many mapping software like Google Maps, Apple maps and others whose existence is outside my knowledge. But my question is how do they work? Do they use GPS to get the images or something? Even if they do, how do they give the 3d view of places? I don't think GPS can zoom to that extent... Even if they use GPS, how do they get access to the GPS satellites? I know that it is an expansive question but any help would be truly appreciated...
