I'm currently working with Wordpress (GPL). I understood basically when you write a plugin/module/etc. it becomes GPL since it's considered dependent of Wordpress.   But on the contrary images and css from themes, are not due to be GPL (they are considered independent data files that could have meaning even without Wordpress)   And that just blurs things a little bit for me. What if I create a mathematical library non GPL. Then I create a Wordpress plugin that use that library?   Will it makes my library GPL? Would it means I cannot bundle them together? Not even put them on a single zip file? What if my library is a Web service? And what if the web service is self hosted? May I bundle it with the plugin code altogether? If I can't make any kind of bundle without GPL being propagated, how comes one can bundle a theme (feat. css + images) for Wordpress?
