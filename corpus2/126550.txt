As far as I know, the terminology comes from how the **inheritance hierarchy** is traditionally displayed, with the extending types at the bottom, and the parent types at the top. This is a bit pointless, unless you feel like calling the following _leftcasting_ and _rightcasting_. ![horizontal inheritance hierarchy](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YUSl.png) I am _not looking for opinions_ why the terminology is as is, but they are more than welcome as comments. I am looking for references on **who first introduced up and downcasting, and why they decided on that name**.
