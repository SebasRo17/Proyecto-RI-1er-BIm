Is there a way to set a transparancy channel in a raster image used for a texture in 3d graphics? this creates a raster image with a transparency channel:               img = SetAlphaChannel[Image@Table[0, {400}, {400}],              Graphics[{GrayLevel[0], Disk[]}]];      This works just fine in a 2D graphic:               Graphics[{Thick , Red, Line[{{0, 0}, {1, 1}}], Inset[img], Thick , Blue,             Line[{{1, 0}, {0, 1}}]}]      (Sorry.. I cant post graphics). But in 3D my transparent region is just white..               Graphics3D[{Line[{{1/2, 1/2, 1/2}, {1/2, 1/2, 3/2}}], Texture@img,          Polygon[{{0, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {0, 1, 1}},          VertexTextureCoordinates ->             {{0, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1},{0,1, 0}}]}, Lighting -> "Neutral"]      Any ideas? Ive already treid the rendering options here with no joy: Transparent textures don't show \-- the point of this is to import real raster images and set a transparancy mask by the way.
