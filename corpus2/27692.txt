Let's say I have a section in a notebook, which I begin with a `cmd-4` keystroke. I type in some text and expressions, and now I want to introduce a subsection for some subordinate material. I type a `cmd-5`, write a title, build up my stuff, and now I want to pop out or "return" to the main stream of the section ("back to our regularly scheduled programming"). But I don't see a way to do that. The subsection fold-bars (on the right-hand side of the notebook display) seems to continue to the very end of the section or to the beginning of the following peer subsection. To close off the subsection, it seems I must create a new subsection.
