I'm currently doing some research into development with the Microsoft Kinect product. My project manager has come up with a potential design for mounting the camera to do the capturing. However the solution means that the camera might be subject to vibrations as the platform it is on is directly connected to where the subjects will be moving. It was my thought that vibrations would effect the quality of the results, however I could not come up with a viable explanation as to why, other than it's the same as if you held a camera in your hand and your hand was shaking vs using a tripod. Do vibrations effect the depth measurements on a Kinect and if so how can I explain this in simple terms to my PM to help come up with a better design to attach the sensor to?
