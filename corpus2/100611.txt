what is the best approach to learning for an undergrad operating systems course in order to understand the concepts and get a good grade in the exam? I know that some courses can be mastered through diligently reading the textbook or attending lectures while for others the concepts can only be understood by doing hands on projects. Is there a general studying approach that should be adopted for this type of a course? I know this may be subjective but I am looking for personal experiences/study methods by those who have taken similar courses to see if there is one particular method that worked well for the majority.
