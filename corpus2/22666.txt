I want to find roots of a function that is very slow to calculate (the function itself involves a bunch of FindMaxima) so I interpolate the function in a region where I think it likely the the root is, since I have very little certainty where the root is I have to interpolate an absurdly large region. Is there a way to have InterpolatingFunction remember the original function and expand its domain when evaluation is attempted outside it?
