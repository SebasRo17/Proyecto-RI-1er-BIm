One of the new features in v10 is support for connected devices. How can I find out if a particular device is supported by Mathematica? Is there a complete list? Is support being added continually? The documentation says: > Many classes of devices listed in the Wolfram Connected Devices Project are > immediately supported within the Wolfram Language. Out of curiosity, I connected a Garmin n√ºvi50 and ran `FindDevices` to see if it would recognize it and be able to import tracks. I got the result:               {DeviceObject[{"Camera", 1}], DeviceObject[{"FunctionDemo", 1}],       DeviceObject[{"RandomSignalDemo", 1}], DeviceObject[{"WriteDemo", 1}]}       The only device it recognized here was the built-in camera. Is `FindDevices` generally sufficient to find out of a device is supported, or is manual configuration necessary for some devices?
