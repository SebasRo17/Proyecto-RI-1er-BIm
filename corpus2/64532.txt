In licenses such as that of libjpeg and freetype, there are clauses like the following: > (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying > documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of > the Independent JPEG Group". or: > o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that > the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the > distribution documentation. Is putting a notice in a text file in the installation directory enough? Or is a more obvious notice typically needed? For a non-open-source end application, what's the usual way to display these mandatory acknowledgments?
