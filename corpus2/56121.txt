I'm fairly new to Mathematica, and I'm trying to solve a complicated equation with multiple variables. I've tried the following...               Reduce[-2 (m^2/36 + n^2/4)^(1/4) Sin[1/2 ArcTan[n/2, -(m/6)]] == y, {n}]      Where I would like to have n on one side of the equation, defined by m and y. Is this the correct notation and I just need to wait longer for the equation to solve? Or am I making a mistake somewhere?
