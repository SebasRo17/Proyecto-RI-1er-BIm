What is the best way to keep third-party source code up to date? For instance in my app, I'm using third-party source code from an open GitHub repository. What I've done is that I have downloaded the zip of the source code, unpacked it and imported it in my iOS app and then started modifying this source code to my hearts content. So this third-party source code has been working great for me, but now some months later the developer of the third-party source code released an update to his code from `1.0 -> 2.0`. Now of course I want to have this update as well in my iOS app. What would be the easiest way to migrate my `1.0` third- party source code (together with all my additions to the code) to `2.0`?
