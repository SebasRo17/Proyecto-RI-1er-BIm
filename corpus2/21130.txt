Before I describe the question, I'd like to say that I've seen the excellent answers posted here but have not managed to get them to work for my own data. I have a list of values that I would like to plot in polar coordinates. The values represent the position of a series of coupled pendulums, and as such while the angle changes the radius does not. Here is a sample of the data for the pendulums, at a certain time `t`.               position = {       {-1.25084, 1}, {-1.42995, 1}, {-1.7497, 1}, {-1.83175, 1}, {-1.733,1}, {-1.86803, 1},        {-1.79935, 1}, {-1.87909, 1}, {-1.78354, 1}, {-1.81614, 1}, {-1.58559, 1}, {-1.71751, 1},        {-1.72079, 1}, {-1.60622, 1}, {-1.72122, 1}, {-1.46695, 1}, {-1.62577, 1}, {-1.75079, 1},        {-0.89456, 1}, {-0.950143, 1}, {-1.5654, 1}     }      What I would like to do is to color each of the pendulum based on their position; that is, the first pendulum (with angle -1.25084) would be colored purple, the next (with angle -1.42995) slightly purplish-blue and all the way to the last pendulum (with angle -1.5654) being colored red. The purpose of coloring the pendulums as such is that, as I vary time `t` using `Manipulate`, I would then be able to track the pendulums by their color. My attempt at this is below, but somehow it doesn't work in the way I intend it to.               n = Length[Transpose[position][[1]]]     position = Transpose[{Transpose[position][[1]], (1 + 0.001*Range[n]/n)}];     (* adding a small modifier to the radius of each pendulum to allow me to         identify the specific pendulum and give it a color later *)     pendulumcolor = ColorData["Rainbow"][1000*(#2 - 1)] &;     (* defining a colour function that extracts the pendulum number and relates         it to a color *)     ListPolarPlot[position,        PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}},        PlotStyle -> Thick,        Joined -> True,        ColorFunction -> pendulumcolor] /.          Line[a__] :> {AbsolutePointSize[8], Point[a]}      My output looks something like this, which is definitely not what I intended. The colors of each point should be different, rather than being all red. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CTyqf.png) **Edit** :In response to VLC's request, a sample of my code is provided below.               n = 100;     (* n is the number of pendulums in our system *)          pendulumplotstyle =        Table[Directive[PointSize[Large], ColorData["Rainbow"][Mod[i, 10]/10]], {i, 0, n}];     (* every ten pendula are coloured to span the color of the rainbow *)          Manipulate[       ListPolarPlot[List /@ funcposition[tdummy],          PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}},         PlotStyle -> pendulumplotstyle],       {tdummy, 0, 10, 0.001}]      In the above code, we have a function `funcposition[t]` that gives the position of the pendulums as a function of time `t`. This function is a numerical solution to an ODE that I'd rather not put up because of the length. The code will not work as-is due to the presence of `funcposition[t]` but it should give a good idea of what I'm doing.
