To me, Idiot Proofing just means making sure the user can't break a piece of software even if he tried. For instance, if a value is read from a text box, and is converted to a double, if the underlying software is idiot proof, it won't break if the user types in a non-double value. I recently wrote up a development schedule and one of the items was named "Idiot proof UI". The people I am building this software jokingly feigned offense to the term, but I can see where this term would actually make people upset. What's a nicer way to say this?
