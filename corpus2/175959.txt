Not all languages support java-like annotations or C#-like attributes or code metadata in general, however that doesn't mean it is not possible to have in languages that don't have this. An example is PHP with Stubbles and the Doctrine annotation library. My question is, is there anything like this for C?, or are there any reliable ways of doing reflection with extended code metadata in C? Ideally, I'm looking for something that reads javadoc-like comments. Edit: The reason for me ***needing*** as opposed to just wanting, is that I need to generate C code and code-metadata from a database, as well as being able to edit that metadada and update the database. The volume of the work (~15,000 variables/structures/functions to generate from this database) justifies the solution.
