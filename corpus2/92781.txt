I'm preparing a course dedicated to fresh graduated CS students. I have to name it. Is there an English word or sentence to define all the practices you don't learn at college/university? Here are a (partial) list of things are not teach to most students I interview or talk with:   * Unit Testing + mocking   * Design Patterns   * Agility (such as Scrum or Extreme Programming)   * DRY, YAGNI, SOLID, DIP, KISS, ...   * Source Control, DVCS, ... I once heard "Software Industrialization Practices" (literally translated from French), and while it sounded great in French, I'm not sure it does in English.
