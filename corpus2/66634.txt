I am trying to implement my computer system following the unix philosophy i.e. I want to edit files, read/send email, store data and browse the web, all using tools that comply with the unix philosophy. Others have defined the unix philosophy better than I, but suffice it to say that I mean tools that "do one thing well", work with unix pipes and can be easily scripted. I'm looking at tools like ed, edbrowser, nmh and uzbl. However, I wonder where like-minded people on the internet 'hang out' (e.g. a wiki or forum)? Is there any internet community, or linux distribution community, that has a large group of people who also wish to implement all their work through unix philosophy tools? Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
