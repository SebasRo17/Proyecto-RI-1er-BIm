I am a junior developer who has been working at a new job for a few weeks. I am working with a large framework for scientific desktop software, adding pieces of functionality. While there are general aspects of the job that are appealing (such as the people and the pay), I have to admit that I find the work unrewarding and boring. I feel disappointed because I do like programming in general. I'm concerned that if I "settle for" this job - or this position within this job - I may lose my love of programming. I think that I am getting frustrated because it is hard to get feedback on the correctness of my code that I'm writing. It is hard to unit-test. Testing involves firing up the program and stepping through the code. I do not feel like I have a mentor. My impression of the code base is that it does not use much in the way of OOP principles. (Perhaps many of the people who have worked with it are more experienced as scientists than developers.) Do you think I'm being soft/naive/idealistic and should continue to work with this code for a year or two (and do more personal projects on the side)? Or do you think that I should go with my gut feeling and try to find a new job where I can work with higher quality (maybe TDD) code?
