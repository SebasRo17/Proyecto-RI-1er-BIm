I have the following notebook:               $Assumptions = Flatten[{Thread[{c0, c1, p, w, e} > 0],Thread[0 <= {{r, i, x, alpha, beta, gamma, {1 - alpha - beta - gamma}, {1 + r - i}, {1 - x}} <= 1}], Element[{c0, c1, p, w, e, r, i, x, alpha, beta, gamma, {1 - alpha - beta - gamma}, {1 + r - i}, {1 - x}}, Reals]}]          case11 = ((1 - x)*alpha*(c0 + e + w + w/(1 + r - i)));          case12 = ((1 - x)*gamma*(c0 + w - p/(1 + r - i)));          case13 = x*(c0 - p);          case21 = ((1 - x)*(1 - alpha - beta - gamma)*(c0 + c1/(1 + r - i) + e+ w+ w/(1 + r - i)));          case22 = ((1 - x)*beta*(c0 + c1/(1 + r - i) - p/(1 + r - i) + w));          case23 = (x*(c0 - p));          f = case11 + case12 + case13;          h = case21 + case22 + case23;          g = e + w + w/(1 + r - i);          occc=g/h;          ocdc=g/f;      I would like to check if `D[occc,p]` is positive, i tried to run the `Positive`, but seems it does not work, it did not give me True of False as a result. I believe I need to have more condition to make `D[occc,p` to be positive, I would like to know those conditions,the word "conditions" i would like to see is something like c0>p, can _Mathematica_ tell me? Thanks
