I have recently noticed that the Sun Java code has been released as GPL V2 code (see Google code repo). Does that mean that all applications written in Java and linked to Sun APIs (beans, and so on) are also in GPL ? If we strictly follow the GPL then this should be the case (Libs should be in LGPL, not GPL if we want to build proprietary software on top of it). Is there another commercial licence which can avoid such an issue ? I cannot believe this is the case. There must be an explanation on this. Regards, Apple92
