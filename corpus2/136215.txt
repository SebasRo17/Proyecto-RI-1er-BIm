I've been looking around and I've found some questions similar to mine but have never been quite satisfied with the answers. I'm more or less a Java n00b, although I am moderately proficient with C++ and I would consider myself intermediate to advanced, as a programmer in general. I'm looking to write a program in Java that functions similarly to a tuner - what I want to do is record an instrument's pitch over about a 3 second time frame, and to measure the average deviation. (This is for a band class.) What I'm thinking is that I'll have a big array of numbers, and each entry in the array will be a number in terms of frequency. I want to be able to loop through the array, and calculate the average Hertz for displaying it on screen or something. So what I want to do is have some way of "polling" (for lack of a better word) the microphone to see what frequency is being inputted right that instant. Is there a simple way to accept audio input from a microphone in terms of Hertz? This will be in Java, under a Windows platform.
