`MatrixPlot` is very nice to have a first look of data, I would like to have a `MatrixPlot` with tooltips for each value. I tried adding `Tooltip` to all the values but it didn't work. My matrix is not very big (~20x25), so each square is visible. **EDIT:** This is the version I did using the answer of Heike:               matPlot[matWithTooltips_, opts : OptionsPattern[]] :=       With[{dim = Dimensions[matWithTooltips],         mat = matWithTooltips /. Tooltip[a_, ___] :> a},       DynamicModule[{pt = {0, 0}, ij, xy, label, direction},        direction[mxy_] := 1 - 2 Boole[Thread[mxy > dim/2]];        LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt],         Dynamic[          xy = Floor[pt];          ij = {dim[[1]], 1} + Cross[xy];          label = If[And @@ Thread[1 <= ij <= dim],            {{FaceForm[], EdgeForm[{Thick, LightGray}], Rectangle[xy]},             Text[              Framed[Replace[                Extract[matWithTooltips, ij], {Tooltip[a_, b_] :> b,                  Tooltip[a_] :> a}], Background -> White],              direction[xy] + xy,              -1.2 direction[xy]]},            {}];          MatrixPlot[mat, Epilog -> label, opts]],         AutoAction -> True,         Appearance -> None]]]      The main improvement is that it can receive a matrix with its own tooltips in the data. Thanks to all for the help.
