I want to create an image of a rectangular prism, but there is no built-in primitive for it. One method to display a prism is shown in whubers's answer to Mathematica for teaching orthographic projection. What are some alternative ways to display prisms using `Graphics3D`, either with polygons or as wireframe-type models? Assume that the prism cross section is defined by a list of points in the plane.
