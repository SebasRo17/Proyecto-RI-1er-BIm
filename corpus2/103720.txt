It is always difficult for me to choose between singular and plural forms for classes names: > >     CustomerRepository vs. CustomersRepository >     CustomerService vs. CustomersService >     CustomerController vs. CustomersController >   And for composite names it is even more difficult: > OrderCustomerRepository vs. OrderCustomersRepository vs. > OrdersCustomersRepository What approach do you prefer and why?
