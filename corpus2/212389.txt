As Go seems able to performance match C and with Google obviously biased towards Go, I feel that it would be great way for Go to gain more traction. The way ChromiumOS/Chrome has jumped from an Ubuntu base to a Gentoo base, while they have the ability to avoid both and create exactly what they need from scratch, leads me to believe it could be something in the works. Time would of course be a factor, as would the lack of existing libraries as compared to C and Linux, but done in parallel whilst the current Linux based machines gain traction would mitigate any time to market issues for them. I'm a rank amateur when it comes to low-level programming though, are there any technical limitations in the language to prevent this from happening?
