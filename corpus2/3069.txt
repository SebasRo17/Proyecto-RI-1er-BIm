If you browse the code golf questions on StackExchange, you notice a ton of non-standard but real world (Eg not brain-f*ck) languages like F#, Scala, R, J and Clojure. Visiting their websites, some of the languages look interesting solving problems in whatever language your already using. However there is coding in spare time, and coding for money. The closest thing we have to the truth on who uses a language is the TIOBE Index, which lists none of the above languages in the top 10-15. Which makes me wonder if I'll ever use them. Should I even bother learning some of the small niche languages? It doesn't seem I would be making money, and some will probably fail anyway.
