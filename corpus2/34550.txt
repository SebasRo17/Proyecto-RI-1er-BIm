I have been fiddling around with a problem for a while now, and hope you can help me. Have searched for previous solutions, but nothing seems to work. My problem is as follows: I have _XAMPP_ installed on my _Mac_ , as I use it as a localhost for some webpages. One day I got the idea that I wanted to connect _Mathematica_ to the _MySQL_ database, such that I could pull some data from the database, and work with it. I have tried, following the documentation, and write:               Needs["DatabaseLink`"];     JDBCDrivers["MySQL(Connector/J)"]      > > >>     JDBCDriver["Name" -> "MySQL(Connector/J)", >>      "Driver" -> "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "Protocol" -> "jdbc:mysql://", "Version" -> 2., >>      "Description" -> "MySQL using Connector/J - Version 5.1.13 - This supports all known >>          MySQL server versions.", "Location" -> "/Applications/Mathematica.app/ >>          SystemFiles/Links/DatabaseLink/DatabaseResources/mysql.m"] >>                 OpenSQLConnection[ JDBC["MySQL(Connector/J)", "localhost:3306/kbm"],                         "Username" -> "username", "Password" -> "*******"]      > > >>     During evaluation of In[6]:= JDBC::error: Communications link failure >>   >>     The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. >>     The driver has not received any packets from the server. >> >>   >>     $Failed >>   I am certain that _MySQL_ listens on pot `3306`, I am certain that the database `"kbm"` exists, and I am certain that username and password is correct. So why doesn't it connect? I have with success connected to the _MySQL_ database through Terminal, and can conclude that it works. I have also read somewhere that sometimes replacing `"localhost"` by `127.0.0.1` works, but having tried that out, it still didn't work. Hope someone can help. **Edit** The config.inc.php file looks as follows:               /* Authentication type */     # commented out by xampp security     #$cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'config';     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type'] = 'cookie';     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'root';     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = '';     /* Server parameters */     //$cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = 'localhost';     //$cfg['Servers'][$i]['connect_type'] = 'tcp';     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['compress'] = false;     /* Select mysql if your server does not have mysqli */     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['extension'] = 'mysqli';     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = true;          /*     * phpMyAdmin configuration storage settings.     */          /* User used to manipulate with storage */     // $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlhost'] = '';     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controluser'] = 'pma';     # commented out by xampp security     #$cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] = '';     $cfg['Servers'][$i]['controlpass'] = '*******';      The rest is commented out.
