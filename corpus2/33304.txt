Here is a bit of code:               funlist = {Plot,ListPlot};     Input[Panel[PopupMenu[Dynamic@whichfun, funlist], "blabla"],Dynamic@whichfun]      The idea here is to select what function you want to use (`Plot` or `ListPlot` in that case) and to give the expression you want to be evaluated by this function (for example `x,{x,0,1}` for `Plot`). I have been struggling with this code for a few hours so if anyone has an idea. I am aware that something like:               PopupMenu[Dynamic@whichfun, funlist]     InputField[Dynamic[expr], String, ContinuousAction -> True]     Dynamic@(whichfun @@ (ToExpression@expr))      with `InputField` fed by `{x, {x, 0, 1}}` would work.
