The Workbench webpage describing new features in version 2 lists the ability to "Search notebook documents with the Mathematica pattern search utility" under the heading **Mathematica Front End Integration**. Does this feature in fact allow the user to search a Mathematica notebook document directly (i.e. interactively from within the front-end) for string pattern expressions, and if so, can anyone provide instructions on how to use this feature? The `NotebookFind` command does not appear to support searching for string pattern expressions which raises the question of whether or not Workbench is using an undocumented Mathematica command and/or option to search for the pattern.
