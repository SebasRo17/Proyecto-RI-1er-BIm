I was plotting a `VectorPlot` and restricting it to the physically meaningful region using `RegionFunction`. To my surprise, the result for the following code was an empty plot.               tempa = 0.2;     vectorfield = {(0.02*x y)/(x^2 + y^2)^(5/2),        1/(x^2 + y^2) (x^2 (1 - 0.008/(x^2 + y^2)^(3/2)) + y^2 (1 + 0.016/(x^2 + y^2)^(3/2)))}     VectorPlot[vectorfield, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},       RegionFunction -> ((tempa^2 < (#1^2 + #2^2 ) < 1 && #2 < 0) &),       VectorColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]      Investigating the problem further by removing the `RegionFunction`, I realized that the probem was with the vector's value at the origin, which is very large. In fact, the following code with the RegionFunction option removed returns the following image.               VectorPlot[vectorfield, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},       VectorColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]      ![VectorPlot with one visible arrow](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1lrvU.png) By adding the options of `VectorPoints` and `VectorScale`, I was able to display some meaningful information, as shown below.                VectorPlot[vectorfield, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},         VectorPoints -> {20, 20}, VectorScale -> 0.5,         RegionFunction -> ((tempa^2 < (#1^2 + #2^2 ) < 1 && #2 < 0) &),         VectorColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]      ![Modified VectorPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F03nP.png) Alternatively, using `VectorScale` as follows                VectorPlot[vectorfield, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},         VectorPoints -> {20, 20}, VectorScale -> {Automatic, Automatic, If[#5 > 3, 0, #5] &},         RegionFunction -> ((tempa^2 < (#1^2 + #2^2 ) < 1 && #2 < 0) &),         VectorColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]      seems to be a better way to scale the length of the vectors, but it still doesn't help with the `ColorFunction`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J8aXw.png) > I would expect Mathematica to scale the colors of the vectors based on the > range of norms in the `RegionFunction`. Is this not the case, or is there > something wrong with my code?
