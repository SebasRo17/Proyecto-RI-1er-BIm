I am trying to import data from a CSV file into Mathematica that contains _line feeds_ in certain elements that I wish to be properly rendered in Mathematica. I suppose this has something to do with the type of form (InputForm, StandardForm, etc.) that Mathematica uses on and after import. I know I am missing something fundamental but have not found it yet. I do not want the solution to this problem to contain any Mathematica code in the CSV file. Lets take graph labels as an example. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pzGL6.png) I would like one vertex label to have _two_ on the first line and _deux_ on the second line. I have tried entering the data in various ways with no success. Here is what I have tried.   1. two[LineFeed]deux **Result** : is shown above. There IS a linefeed but the control code name is also rendered.   1. two\ndeux **Result** : No line feed at all. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kh4nw.png)   1. two.0Adeux (i.e. using hexadecimal code) Result: Same as [NewLine], get the line feed but the hex code is printed too. Thanks in advance for your help. Jeff Lapides
