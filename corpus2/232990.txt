What is the word used to describe the type of programming languages that provide explicit syntax for defining classes and that support inheritance? For example: "A ______ language, such as C++, Java, C#, or D." I keep thinking "object oriented", but that also includes languages like Lua and JavaScript, which aren't quite what I'm thinking of. I am sure there is a definitive term for this group of languages, I just do not know what it is.
