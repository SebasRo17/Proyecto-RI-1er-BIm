The company I work for has decided that the source code for a set of tools they make available to customers is also going to be made available to those customers. Since I am the author of that source code, and since many source code files have my name written in them as part of class declaration documentation comments, I've been asked to remove author information from the source code files, even though the license headers at the beginning of each source file make it clear that the company is the owner of the code. Since I'm relatively new to this industry I was wondering whether it's considered typical for companies that decide to make their source code available to third parties to not allow the code authors to take some amount of credit for their work, even when it's clear that the code author is not the owner of the code. Am I right in assuming that I don't have a say on the matter?
