I'm currently tasked with writing a wcf service that, for now, will only used inside the company network, the problem is that I'm not sure how I should handle the operations it exposes. The software that will use this service will have to modify similar tables in different ways. For example a table, that has columns a,b,c and d. Program X only updates columns a and b, while program Y updates b,c and d. I feel that a generic Update method that accepts the whole record is easier to write and makes the service less bloated. But it does feel less secure, and would probably make it harder to understand for new developers. How do I best handle these situations on a service level? edit: Yes the tasks are in a sense unique, but the problem is that it's difficult to figure out how unique the service should be. Do I make a general service to allow access to the data, and let the details of those tasks be handled client-side? Security concerns are not that high. The biggest concern is maintainability and ease of understanding. At this moment we have 20+ databases where some of them have 100+ tables.
