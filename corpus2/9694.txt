I have a friend who has been doing QA for about a year and wants to further their career. I have always leaned to C using gcc and makefiles as you have to do everything yourself. I have also read the best ways to teach a beginner to program, but in this case should I start with the technology his company uses, namely .NET? Is there any drawback to learning a object-oriented high-level language first, or should I stick with C?
