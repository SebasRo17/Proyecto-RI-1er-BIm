I'm looking to create dynamic menus with multiple options, and would allow multiple selections. For example, mousing over an object (let's say a black circle of rad 1), a menu would popup at MousePosition[] with two options of "red" and "5". Selecting red would create a new circle, red with rad1, and selecting both would give a red circle of rad 5. How would I create temporary/dynamic menus similar to the standard right-click (disappears after clicking away), except with multi-selection? Edit: I got carried away with my end-goal example. All I am wondering is if Panel is the correct function to use here with multiple checkboxes (the documentation examples did not have what I expected). ![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/GQksx.png)
