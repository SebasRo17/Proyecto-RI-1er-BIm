I was wondering why won't mathematica give a result where the function is also `Log10`, instead it gives the ordinary `Log`. Is it because the `Log` fits the problem better than the `Log10` or... ?               Clear[x, a, b, c, d]          Data = {{0, 0}, {1, 6.91}, {2, 9.2}, {3, 11.4}, {4, 13.4}, {24,          39}, {25, 40.5}};          aa = NonlinearModelFit[Data, {a + b*Log10[c*x + d], c > 0, d > 0}, {a, b, c, d}, x];          aa // Normal          Show[Plot[aa[x], {x, 0, 100}, PlotRange -> All], ListPlot[Data, PlotStyle -> Directive[Red, PointSize[0.02]]]]
