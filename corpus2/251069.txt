My project is organized in layers like   * Configuration   * Controller   * Service   * Repository   * Domain Our REST Controller is in the Controller layer. We need to connect to another API via REST calls and I'm not sure if I should make a new Controller or do it in the Service layer. I'm going to implement the REST calls with Spring's RestTemplate. The way our API will be used is like this:   * REST call is made that goes through our REST endpoint.    * Our REST endpoint will call the third party API (either by calling another controller method or a service method).   * We will then do a conversion between our format and the third party format   * Then we will return the JSON of our format back to the client
