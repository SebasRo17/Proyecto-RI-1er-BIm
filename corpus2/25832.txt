I've got a list manipulation optimization problem. Consider a two-dimensional nxm list `list1`, and a three-dimensional nxmxm list, `list2`. Is there a faster way of taking the following product?               Table[list1[[i]].list2[[i]].list1[[i]], {i, 1, length}]      I know that Table operators are notoriously slow, and this seems like there might be a built-in list-manipulation operator to accomplish the same thing, or something very similar.
