I would like to prevent the welcome screen from showing up after I close my last notebook. This is not an issue on my Windows machine, so I suspect it is system dependent. I am running Ubuntu 11.10. Any ideas? Edit 1: This only happens when I close the last notebook by clicking on the "x" button. As Szabolcs pointed out, I can avoid this issue using File -> Quit or Ctrl-Q. This seems to be a Linux-specific problem.
