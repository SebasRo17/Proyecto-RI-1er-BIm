I am currently trying to break through the intermediate coder stage to advanced and needless to say it's been tough. I have been working through several books with example code. I have felt lately that taking the example code, changing it to fit my own similar project, breaking it, and fixing it, is more effective for learning than simply re-coding line after line of example work. Does anyone else similar or contrasting opinions? Will this method pay off in the long term? Thoughts on this method of learning? Thanks!
