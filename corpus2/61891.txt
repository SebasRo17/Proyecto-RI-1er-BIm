Please take this question seriously. I have some moneys and ideas and I would like to hire developers/graphics to write down my ideas into a website. I could do it all myself, I have the right knowledge but I don't have time. Now the problem is: If i hire some good developers and tell him my ideas who assures me he will not steal my idea and build the website on his own? (take the social network film) The best thing to do would be to create a team with firends and make it, But sincerly in my city and in my country my friends maximum are able to do is start pc -> open facebook.com What would be your moves? Other than the "steal part" I would like to know tips for the team-management too
