**I know about`static final` equivalent to `#define` , But I am not looking for it** I have used `#define REP(i,n) for(__typeof(n) i=0; i<(n); i++)` in C++ and after that I can use `REP(i,10)` instead of `for(i=0; i<10; i++)` in the whole program. But is there a way to do this in Java? I want a version of `#define REP(i,n) for(__typeof(n) i=0; i<(n); i++)` in Java. I try it with `static final` but can't figure out.
