Please consider the following examples for a `ListLinePlot` and `ListPlot`               data=Prime[Range[25]];     lstlinePlot=ListLinePlot[data];     lstPlot=ListPlot[Tooltip@data];      **Displaying plot-values** As I would like to give the user the chance to retrieve plot-values directly from the plot, I thought to overlay `lstlinePlot` with `lstPlot`, whereas for the latter the plot-values are displayed via `Tooltip`:               res=Show[{lstlinePlot,lstPlot}]      To evaluate two plots based on the same data seems to me rather time consuming. I wonder whether there is a more efficient way to make the plot- values available as via `Tooltip` (I thought of enabling a "display modus" within `Mesh` but this does not seem to exist.) **Retrieving plot-data directly from plot** It would be nice to be able to click on the line of `lstlinePlot`, press the copy shortcut (e.g. cmd+c) and paste the data into another notebook or into a txt-file (as plain text maybe). I know how to retrieve data from a plot (e.g. `lstlinePlot[[1, 1, 3, 2, 1, All, 2]]`) but I would like to make data available via copy-paste.
