I´m new to using units in Mathematica. I have read other similar posts about this issue but I haven´t found an answer so far. My problem is simple: I want to plot a certain function with a certain unit. In my case, I want a graphic in Angle - mm. I have this function depending on a.               f[a_]:=(1 - Cos[0.017 a])*(Quantity[45.2,"Millimeters"]) +      (Quantity[145.`, "Millimeters"])*(1-Sqrt[1 - 0.097 Sin[0.017 a]^2])      When I plot it using               Plot[Evaluate[f[a]], {a, 0, 720}]      I get a results which is 1/1000 times the correct one (which should be in mm), so I assume that it is being shown in m. But in general, there is no way to know in which unit the graphic is being shown. Or is there a way to do this? Thank you for the help.
