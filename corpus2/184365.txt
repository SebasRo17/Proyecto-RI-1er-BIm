I just read an interesting article called Getting too cute with c# yield return It made me wonder what the best way is to detect whether an IEnumerable is an actual enumerable collection, or if it's a state machine generated with the yield keyword. For example, you could modify DoubleXValue (from the article) to something like:               private void DoubleXValue(IEnumerable<Point> points)     {         if(points is List<Point>)           foreach (var point in points)             point.X *= 2;         else throw YouCantDoThatException();     }      Question 1) Is there a better way to do this? Question 2) Is this something I should worry about when creating an API?
