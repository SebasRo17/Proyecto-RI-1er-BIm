This might be a really stupid question, but I have no idea how to get my copy of Mathematica to run on a remote server in the cloud. I have a Webfaction account and a copy of Mathematica installed on my computer, but I don't know how to actually set up, install and run a Mathematica kernel in the cloud. I understand that beginners' questions are generally not well received on Stack Exchange, so just a pointer to a site or page where I could find instructions would be enough. I've tried finding some myself but have come up completely blank. Thank you
