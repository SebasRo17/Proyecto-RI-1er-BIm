I have a list which has a date and a amount, I need to create a list that has the cummulative total with the date. I have the following result:               {{{2009, 8, 3}, 1829.}, {{2009, 8, 4}, 1113.}, {{2009, 8, 5}, 730.}, {{2009, 8, 6}, -243.}}      What I need:                {{{2009, 8, 3}, 1829.}, {{2009, 8, 4}, 2942.}, {{2009, 8, 5}, 3672.}, {{2009, 8, 6}, 3429.}}      I have just spent over an hour trying to figure this out, any help is most appreciated.
