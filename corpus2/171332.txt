Is there a reason why the source code of software mentioned in research papers is not released? I understand that research papers are more about the general idea of accomplishing something than implementation details, but I don't get why they don't release the code. For example, this paper ends with: > Results > > The human line drawing system is implemented through the Qt framework in C++ > using OpenGL, and runs on a 2.00 GHz Intel dual core processor workstation > without any additional hardware assistance. We can interactively draw lines > while the system synthesizes the new path and texture. Do they keep the source code closed intentionally because of a monetization they intend to make with it, or because of copyright ?
