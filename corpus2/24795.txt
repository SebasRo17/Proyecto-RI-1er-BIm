Unlike the function Clear, the function Unset does not work for string patterns. Given the name of a variable as a string, how can you unset the corresponding variable? Example: Given:               x = 10;      trying to unset later:               Unset[Symbol["x"]]      results in               Unset::write: Tag Symbol in Symbol[x] is Protected. >>      Using `With`:               With[{var = Symbol["x"]}, Unset[var]]      results in               Unset::usraw: Cannot unset raw object 10. >>      Note that `Clear["x"]` is not an option, because it also removes all `DownValues` associated with `x`.
