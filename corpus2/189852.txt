I know that N-Tier intended to separate layers on different network but I would like to have the same code separation in codeigniter I got this idea to have **Model** : for database CRUD - > Data layer **REST** API : for business logic—> Business layer that calls CRUD method from models **Controller** & **View** are going as before and flow will be **View** <—> **Controller** <—> **API** (with Business classes) <—> **Model** I wanna know what kind of drawbacks it can be such architecture
