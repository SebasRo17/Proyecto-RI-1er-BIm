For some legal reasons I haven't worked for anybody for the last 12 years. I am a java web developer or at least I am thinking so. For this period I have been working on my project- some sort of business network - and I did few small jobs, so right now I feel I am far behind in terms of my skills and the skills needed today. I lingered too long on Struts and Hibernate and thought that could the job for my project. I need to get a job, right now, so I am spending most of my time brushing my skills. My question is: What are the current necessary skills that could convince employers to hire me regardless of my past employment or the lack of it. Right now I am on AspectJ, IoC and Spring
