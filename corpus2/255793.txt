I've two tables and I want to select only the rows of the first table which it's 'id' field is not in a second table. I'm completely new to SQL. Any hint? For example, suppose I have a table of users with the following fields: id, password, location, description, among other fields. I have another table that holds the banned users, with two fields, id_user and id_blocked. My guess is SELECT u.id, u.pasword, u.location, u.description FROM `table_users` u WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT bl.id_blocked FROM `table_block` bl WHERE u.id = bl.id_blocked) is that correct?
