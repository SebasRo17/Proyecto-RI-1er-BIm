I have a 3D Y-Shape hollow tube, not so good surface.                Import["http://dl.dropbox.com/u/68983831/tube02.vtk", "Graphics3D"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A2k9g.png) I tried to use following vertex data plot and generate mesh.               pts = Import["tube02.vtk", "VertexData"];     Graphics3D[Point@pts]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5LztT.png) Question: How to plot a smooth surface from vertex data and then generate tetrahedral or simple mesh? I was trying to use following thread to solve my problem: How to calculate volume of convex hull and volume of a 3D object and My donut has holes in it!.
