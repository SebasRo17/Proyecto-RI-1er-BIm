How to scrape headlines from New York Times, Wall Street Journal main pages to create datasets similar to this service? Importing HTML from nyt.com (HTML4) results in a `String` and the markup is not preserved. Is there a workaround? For wsj.com (XHTML) is either not valid (is there a W3C XHTML validator?) or a problem for XML`Parser. Any clues?
