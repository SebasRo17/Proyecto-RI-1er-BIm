Let's say I have a `Histogram`:               Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[10, 2], 500]]      ![Histogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/s8zAD.jpg) and I want the bars positioned to the left of 8 on the horizontal axis to be a different colour. The _Mathematica_ documentation shows how to do this for the height of bars, but not for their position:               Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[10, 2], 500],       ColorFunction -> (Which[# < 40, Yellow, 40 <= # < 90, Red, True, Blue] &),       ColorFunctionScaling -> False]      ![Histogram2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bKZPg.jpg) How do I call the positions of the bars from Histogram and put them into my `ColorFunction`?
