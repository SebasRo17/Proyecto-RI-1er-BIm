I want to learn linux kernel, I think it's kinda hard to understand the whole thing as many of you mentioned in other questions, anyway, I'm really interested in the process management part of it. I wanna do something really small first, and I hope one of you can help me do it, which is booting the pc and printing some text and shutdown, Is there a code (bootstrap program) small enough to do this, where I can just copy it to a cd and boot the pc and print something and then shutdown? Thanks,
