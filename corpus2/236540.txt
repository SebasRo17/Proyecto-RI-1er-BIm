I was looking at the terms of use for CocoonJS and noticed this section > License Grant. By uploading User Content via the Services, you expressly > grant, and you represent and warrant that you have a right to grant, and do > so grant, to Ludei, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, > reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, and > make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or > likeness as contained in your User Content, if applicable, in whole or in > part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter > developed, solely for use in connection with the Services. I am not too clear on the legal jargon, but to me this sounds like I'm basically giving someone unrestricted access to any intellectual property that I have submitted to their servers, and the ability to use my identity in any form as they wish. Can someone clarify what the excerpt means?
