So I found this very interesting library in Google Code site. It turns out it is advertised as "LGPL", which is good enough for me. However, in the README file of the library the author contradicts himself saying it is not available for commercial purposes. I'm guessing that when you sign up to create your project in Google Code you can only choose open source licenses. Open source licenses allow selling software, offering commercial support, etc. So my guess is that either the author confused the word "commercial" with "proprietary", or that he just wanted a good place to host his software even violating GoogleCode standards... The thing is, if I want to use the library, which licence should I consider the software to be under? I've already asked the author by email but he has not replied. Thanks very much.
