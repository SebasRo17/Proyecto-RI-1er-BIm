I asked a question a while back about knowing when you're ready to look for a job and got positive replies. Now I'm working on writing up a resume to begin my job search. The title pretty much sums up the question, what should a self-taught programmer who has nothing but personal project experience put in a resume? PS. What I really want to ask is for someone to take a quick look at my resume(draft) but I know that's too specific here. Is there a place where I can ask this type of question? **EDIT:** Thanks to everyone for the feedback. I've finished a RC version and will hopefully be entering the job market soon.
