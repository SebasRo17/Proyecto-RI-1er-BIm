I have a rectangle with specified dimensions and I'd like to fill it with text, so that the text uses all (well, as much as possible) of the available area. I tried to do it with               Framed@Pane[       TextCell[ExampleData[{"Text", "LoremIpsum"}],        TextJustification -> 0, TextAlignment -> Center, ImageMargins -> 0],        ImageSize -> 1/2 {1920, 1080}, ImageSizeAction -> "ResizeToFit",        Alignment -> {Center, Center}]      I'm not concerned about the little gaps caused by the `TextJustification` option, but `ImageSizeAction -> "ResizeToFit"` bothers me because it leaves empty spaces at the top and bottom of the rectangle. This becomes more apparent when the rectangle size gets bigger, and I want to make some very large images. Rectangle size 960x540: ![small rectangle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9zlHy.png) Rectangle size 1920x1080: ![bigger rectangle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MfcfU.png) I would expect that the font size would increase to fill the empty space, but this does not happen.
