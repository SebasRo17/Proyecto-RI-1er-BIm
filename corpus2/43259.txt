This is my 3rd Order IVP. `D[y[x], {x, 3}] == (m/2)*((D[y[x], x])^2 - 1) - ((m + 1)/2)* y*(D[y[x], {x, 2}])^2`. Initial conditions given are as follows `y[0] = 0; y'[0] = 0; y''[0] = 1; (* This is the First assumed value of y''[0] for initializing shooting method using RK 4rth order method *) ` For this problem y'[infinity] is equal to 1, I want to loop the shooting method using Runge Kutta 4 th order method in such a way that after calculations, it will check the y'[] value at sufficiently large value of x and from experimental results, for x ~ 7-8, f'[] is 1. To Use RK method I redefined the equation like               D[l[x], {x, 2}] ==  z; D[y[x], x] ==  l; D[z[x], x] == (m/2)*(l^2 - 1) - ((m + 1)/2)*z*y;      Now I could write one loop for RK method but this is proving out a bit tough for me because I have to generate a list for different values of f[0] { 0,1} and m is also a variable with range (0-1) step size 0.01 & then I have to deal with 3 equations simultaneously. I am solving this over C programming but its not that efficient. I dont know how to go ahead. If anyone could throw some light.....
