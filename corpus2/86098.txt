Our team is distributed in space and time, so we have no ability to discuss the architecture of the code in real time. How can we discuss it via documentation: write code interfaces/ comment/ modify, track history of the code architecture? Are there some specific tools for this? What are the best way: class diagrams, code interfaces, something different? We are using c# and VS2010
