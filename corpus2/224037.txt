I am working (alone) on an application that is a music portal where you can search for artists, songs etc ... The C# solution consists of:   * a class library that contains all the stuff to access the web service   * the application itself I've recently started using Git and figured out the benefits it does provide to a project but there's something I couldn't figure out, on Visual Studio there is the option to commit a solution which leads me to the following question : Should I commit each project individually or the whole solution ?
