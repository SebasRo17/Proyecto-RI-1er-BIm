I know it's a strange requirement but we want to create some version string which wouldn't change and that would prevent a user to notice that after an update, the version is the same as before. Example               asfkl1sd35f1s3df15s53dfs1df3sd15s3fsf      But this is quite ugly and may attract too much attention :) Simple strings on the other hand are easily distinguishable and one may notice that it does not change in time... So basically we want to have the same version but we don't want to hear users complaining that they updated the application and the version is the same. Any ideas?
