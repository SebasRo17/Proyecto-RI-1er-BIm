Should every piece of code put online have a licence with it, or should it explicitly mentioned that it is in the public domain? I'm writing a simple python script that will take a project euler problem number and save a file with the question text as comment. As I was creating the directory and initializing git I added a licence file, which got me thinking is it even necessary to put a licence for something so simple. So, should every project no matter how trivial have it's licence explicitly mentioned or is it just overkill to put a licence with such small scripts? What is the recommended practice here?
