I've been a developer since 2009 and I've learnt a lot of languages since, but I've always wanted to understand and be able to code in the lowest level language so I can directly (or at least very close to directly) speak to machines through my code. There was a point in time when someone showed me how to do an if statement in assembly, but out of all the books that I got, I could never really understand where/how to start learning to code in assembler. any help please? I'm obsessed with learning this! PS: if you have any software suggestions, I use ubuntu and am looking to convert to backtrack soon, so it would be preferred if you could give me something that'll be easily installed on debian linux, otherwise don't sweat it, give me the name of the windows software and I'll find an equivalent myself
