I am using Java. How does an event source like a (button in a GUI) knows which method to call in an interface? For example, I am listening to Mouse Events and have implemented a Mouse Listener interface in my class then how would the event source know whether it should call `mousePressed()`, `mouseReleased()` or some other abstract method in the in the interface? I am aware that using `addMouseListener(this)`, provides a way for the event source to call the method of an interface.
