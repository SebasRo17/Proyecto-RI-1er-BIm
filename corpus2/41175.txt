Suppose that I have two linear functions               f[x_] := f0 + f1 x     g[x_] := g0 + g1 x      and a (possibly rather complicated) set of conditional expressions, obtained through Reduce. For example, we might have something like this:               conditions = (f0 == f1 && g0 == 0) || (f0 == g1 && g0 == f1)      What I would like to do is write something like               {f[x],g[x]} /. conditions      and receive as output the set of pairs of $f$ and $g$ adhering to that formula. In this case we'd have               {{a + ax, bx}, {a + bx, b + ax}}      (or maybe `{{f0 + f0x, g1x}, {f0 + f1x, f1 + f0x}}` to stick with original variable names). How can I do this?
