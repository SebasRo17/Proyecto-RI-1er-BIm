I'm reading Code Complete 2, and I'm at the chapter where it says to (paraphrasing) "avoid programming through the interface." Why is it bad to program "through" the interface? A more concrete example: if I have a method of a class that submits a funny picture, what's wrong with it logging me in also? Should I simply provide more "helper" methods that do it automatically? Would it be preferred to break it up into:   * set_login(username, password)   * login()   * submit_picture(funny_picture)   * easy_submit(funny_picture) # where it will log in (if not already) and submit
