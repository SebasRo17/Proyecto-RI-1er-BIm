I'm now learning Gerrit (which is the first code review tool I use). Gerrit requires a reviewed change to consist of a single commit. My feature branch has about 10 commits. The gerrit-prefered way is to squash those 10 commits into a single one. However this way if the commit will be merged into the target branch, the internal history of that feature branch will be lost. For example, I won't be able to use `git-bisect` to bisect into those commits. Am I right? I am a little bit worried about this state of things. What is the rationale for this choice? Is there any way of doing this in Gerrit without losing history?
