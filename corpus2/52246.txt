I am trying to solve the following hyperbolic equation with given boundary conditions: ![two muppets](http://rogercortesi.com/eqn/tempimagedir/eqn4118.png) I choose as initial condition $u=1$, and evolve the above hyperbolic equation until reaching a stationary state with some predetermined tolerance. Spatial derivatives are approximated by taking standard centered differences everywhere. The _Mathematica_ input is:               φ[z] = q*(1/z + (-1*q)/(-1*z));     η[z] := k* (1/z + (-1*q)/(-1*z));      r[ρ, z] := sqrt[ρ^2 + z^2];          NDSolve[ {Derivative[u[t, ρ, z], {t, 2}] ==         Derivative[u[t, ρ, z], {ρ, 2}] + (1/ρ)*          Derivative[u[t, ρ, z], {ρ, 1}] +           Derivative[          u[t, ρ, z], {z, 2}] - ((φ[z]^4)/4)* (            Derivative[(η[z] + u[t, ρ, z]  - 1)/φ[                z], {ρ,                1}] Derivative[(η[z] + u[t, ρ, z]  +                  1)/φ[z], {ρ, 1}] +             Derivative[(η[z] + u[t, ρ, z]  - 1)/φ[                z], {z,                1}] Derivative[(η[z] + u[t, ρ, z]  +                  1)/φ[z], {z, 1}]) *((η[z] +                u[t, ρ,                 z])*((η[z] + u[t, ρ, z])^2 - (φ[z]^2)/                2) )^(-1), u[0, ρ, z] = 0, u[t, 6, z] = 1,        u[t, ρ, -6] = u[t, ρ, 6]},       u[t, ρ, z], {t, 0, 10}, {ρ, 0, 6}, {z, -6, 6},       Method -> {"MethodOfLines",         "SpatialDiscretization" -> {"TensorProductGrid",           "DifferenceOrder" -> "Pseudospectral"}}]      which gives errors. I would like to ask if you could help me to solve this problem.
