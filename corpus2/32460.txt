I am using a `Histogram3D` plot to view the correlation of the R & G of an RGB image. Naturally, I want the bins to have a color corresponding to their $x$, $y$ (R,G) position on the chart. Unfortunately, `ColorFunction` for `Histogram3D` only supplies one argument, height, not $x$ or $y$ position. Is there a way to color each bin based on its $x$ and $y$ position within the histogram? (i.e. `RGBColor[x,y,0]`) Here is how I am generating my (uncolored) histogram:                   Histogram3D[Transpose[{                                Flatten[ImageData[jpeg][[All,All,1]]]                               ,Flatten[ImageData[jpeg][[All,All,2]]]                                }]]
