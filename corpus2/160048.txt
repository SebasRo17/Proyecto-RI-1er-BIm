I've been spending this week teaching kids (11-18) to program. Teaching them the core concepts and the logic has been going fine, but I've noticed one snagging point for them all: syntax. I feel like teaching them the syntax of the language comes a massive second to the core concepts and logic. However, with struggling with the syntax, they aren't learning as effectively. More often than not, their logic is good enough. The problems they have are related to syntax. Does anybody know of an effective way of teaching syntax? I've been thinking about creating a cheat sheet showing the syntax for different statements (assignment, if, while, for, etc) but feel this might be a bit of an information overload, has anybody any experience with using this method? Hopefully this question isn't considered off topic!
