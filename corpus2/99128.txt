So, I'm planning to write a C++ library and I want it to be cross-platform, and as this library won't deal with UI and I want it to have as little dependencies as possible, I won't be using Qt (actually Qt won't really help me to achieve what I want, all I plan on using is STL and Boost). Now when it comes to build a cross-platform project, I really like QMake as it's extremely easy to use and I have experience with it. I also heard good things about CMake, though I really doubt it's as easy to use as QMake. Anyway, here is my question: Should I stick with build automation tool that I know or is QMake just out of context for a non-Qt project? Should I take this as an opportunity to learn CMake? Or is there a better alternative to these two?
