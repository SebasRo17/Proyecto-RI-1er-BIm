I am a configuration manager. I did my internship for 6 month before and they hired me for just 3 months now. They hire a new person for CM team today, I am worried they'd kick me out. Right now I maintain their CM software, because they develop it by themself in Oracle. My question is when you're working in a place where they don't pay so much, do you put yuor code free for them? Or as much as they hire you they can use your own code & package? (I mean special package such as get export data in excel). I write program in Oracle forms...
