Quoting from Wikipedia > The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent > convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and > XML documents. and from wc3 > In order to provide a precise, language-independent specification of the DOM > interfaces, we have chosen to define the specifications in OMG IDL Now I have been programming in Java, C# and PHP and in all these languages the keyword `interface` is provided, but how do you implement a language- independent interface? How come you can write an interface without a programming language? Moreover how can you interact with the DOM using any programming language? If someone invented a new programming language, what are the steps he needs to do to be able to interact with the DOM?
