I have a project that requires a client app to communicate with a server. I was wondering if there is a way for the client app to detect available servers and "know" by some method or another which server is the one it needs. The client is built with .net and c#, the server is a simple SQL database.They are on the same network. Is there a built in mechanism to do this or is the task more complex then it seems at first? I don't have more details ATM, it's still just an idea. The reason behind it is that when a user uses the client app, we don't want him to enter connection strings manually if he doesn't have to.
