I have lots of ideas for products to be built. The problem is that I have less than a year of professional work experience and I am afraid of getting **judged negatively in the future** based on what I produce now. I have no clue if my code is any good. I am not familiar with any of the coding patterns. All I know is to build products that work. I want to have a public profile in github for my future projects and I will try hard to make sure that it is well commented, is optimized and clean. These are the things that I fear getting exposed publicly:   1. My code may not be highly optimized.   2. Wrong usage of certain libraries or functions which coincidentally get the job done.   3. Not knowing or following any coding pattern.   4. Lots of bugs/ not considering corner, edge cases   5. Fundamental lack of understanding and application of certain concepts such as thread safety, concurrency issues in multi-threaded programming, etc. Should I go ahead and get started or continue to stick to building stuff locally and privately till I get more experience. I don't want the mistakes made here to haunt my career prospects in the long run.
