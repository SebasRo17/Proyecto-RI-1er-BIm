In my application I want to use a mixture of several algorithms described in some recently published scientific papers. But I have some legal questions. **Q1** If an algorithm was published in a scientific paper, and the authors were affiliated with academia not some private company, can it be protected by a patent at the same time? I read somewhere that it is not possible to obtain a patent for something that was described in details in a publicly available source. **Q2** If I use some algorithm described in a paper do I **have** to give credit in "legal" or "about" sections in my program or is it just voluntary and would be simply nice of me? It is **not** that I don't want to give credit. It is rather that I don't want to reveal what the program is based on internally and would like to hold copy- cats off for as long as possible.
