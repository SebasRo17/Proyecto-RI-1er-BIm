Are there screencasts on the Internet showing screens of programmers that decided to record their daily work and show their programming style? I'm interested in seeing how other programmers effectively use tools like an editor with various features, debugger, looking for bugs, profiler etc. Maybe such "crazy programmers" exist that record everything they do and in the evening they realize that they did great mental job very efficiently and have the record, can additionally comment their intents which they still remember and share their effective hacks and coding style with other programmers. Is there such a resource for learning (doesn't matter if free or payable)? One particular portal or company which is focusing on this particular type of training and is leading in this area is sufficient for the answer.
