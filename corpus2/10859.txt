I am a Java developer with more than 10 years work experiences. I have been working on investment banking industry since 2002 and I plan to continue my career in this industry. But recently I am a little confused about the direction to take in my career. I want to be expert in some aspects, but don't know how to develop myself. Could experts in this industry please help to shed light on this? Thanks in advance. Most of my experience is focused on trading system development including fixed-income and cash equity.
