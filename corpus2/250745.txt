I have a general question regarding best practices. I have a small team working on a medium-scale software project, which involves integrating code from different environments, etc. The project is a standalone piece of desktop software. Based on lessons learned from a similar prior project that went badly, I am trying to implement some better software engineering practices. I'd like to start by automating daily builds. We use SVN for source control, and all the developers are working in the trunk, including me. My question is rather simple: Where locally do we do the daily builds? Should I make another folder on my local machine that is the "daily build" folder? Should I set up a virtual machine? Should I suck it up and do it in my development folder? I understand the revision control paradigms pretty well. I'm mostly looking for how folks implement it _in practice_.
