I notice that when I paste my graphs in word sometimes they are not very well readable. A colleague of mine send me a graph made with Sigmaplot. The first figure is made with Mathematica, the second one with SigmaPlot. I'm not be able to reproduce the black border in my PlotMarkers. Could you help me? ![Mathematica](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r3gYy.jpg) ![SigmaPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KEM55.jpg)
