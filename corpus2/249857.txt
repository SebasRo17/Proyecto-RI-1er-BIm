Suppose I have a `MyList` class which extends `ObservableCollection<MyObject>` where `MyObject` has the `Boolean` Property `Enabled`. Let's say I want the number of `MyObject` objects that have the Property `Enabled` equal to `true`. Should define this as a Property or a Method? In `MyList` class, should I use:               public int GetNumEnabledMyObjects(){         return this.Count(o => o.Enabled == true);     }      or               public int NumEnabledMyObjects {         get {             return this.Count(o => o.Enabled == true);         }     }      I looked at Properties vs. Methods in MSDN Design Guidelines and I'm leaning towards a method since it might be considered expensive enough.
