I use `ListContourPlot` to show exclusions in a physical parameter space. I have restrictions like `A < 5` and `B > 120`. I also have data lists in the form of `{{Input1, Input2, A, B, C, ...}, {Input,....}}`. I create lists of triplets with the inputs as x and y coordinates and the interesting quantity as a third: `AList = {{Input1, Input2, A}, {Input1, Input2, A}, ...}`. Then I simply use `ListContourPlot[AList, Contours -> {5}, ContourShading -> {None, Red}]` to create a red shape that covers the excluded area. I do this e.g. in red and blue for A and B respectively. Then I use `Show[LCP1, LCP2, ...]` to overlay them into a single plot. Now, it would be nice to also show the area that is excluded by A and B in a third color. Is there a possibility to create contours based on two criteria? I manged to get what I want, by creating a list of elements that fulfill criterion A and then plot the exclusion for B the same way as above then doing it once over with a list of elements that fulfill criterion B and plot the exclusion for A. This is cumbersome, however, so I wonder whether it is possible to do it in one step.
