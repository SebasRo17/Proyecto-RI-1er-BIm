I have watched the active record classes in our project grow into large, do- it-all classes. When you need anything about a user, for example, you should go to the `Person` class. While this makes perfect sense when you consider the domain, in reality, the `Person` class is a mishmash of lots and lots of functionality, which do get modified sometimes as the domain becomes clearer, which means both SRP and OCP are violated. Is this one of the things that comes with the Active Record pattern, or are we doing it wrong?
