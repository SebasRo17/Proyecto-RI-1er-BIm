I have tried `Reduce` and `Solve` in Mathematica, as well as have a long list of tries in Maple, but cannot seem to get anywhere solving the following for `V`:               V^P * (V-1)^Q == c^(P-Q) * X^Q * (V-c^2)^Q,      where `P`,`Q` are positive integers; `V>0`; `U>0` and `X = U^Q * V^P`; `c = Exp[t/2]` where `t` is `i` times a real number. Any suggestions would be great. Btw, I can share a Maple file (http://ubuntuone.com/5WGrFF8PYXR8LSwNB95SRW) where I tried a Fixed-Point/Contraction attempt, a series inverse attempt, and even the Lagrangian Inversion method. For the most part I seem to run out of computing power when I try to get to decent orders of approximation... P.S. I am looking for a symbolic solution, at least to a few orders.
