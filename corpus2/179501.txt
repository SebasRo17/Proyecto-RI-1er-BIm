I'm creating a stack oriented virtual machine, and so I started learning Forth for a general understanding about how it would work. Then I shortlisted the essential stack manipulation operations I would need to implement in my virtual machine:               drop ( a -- )     dup  ( a -- a a )     swap ( a b -- b a )     rot  ( a b c -- b c a )      I believe that the following four stack manipulation operations can be used to simulate any other stack manipulation operation. For example:               nip  ( a b -- b )       swap drop     -rot ( a b c -- c a b ) rot rot     tuck ( a b -- b a b )   dup -rot     over ( a b -- a b a )   swap tuck      That being said however I wanted to know whether I have listed all the fundamental stack manipulation operations necessary to manipulate the stack in any possible way. Are there any more fundamental stack manipulation operations I would need to implement, without which my virtual machine wouldn't be Turing complete?
