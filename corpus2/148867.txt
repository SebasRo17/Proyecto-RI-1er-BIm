During all my professional lifetime that I have been programming in Windows enviroments, I advised my friends and coworkers to not use a DSN database connection in their applications, based on my own personal conclusions, but I really haven't seen any evidence of them. I know that using a DSN connection via ODBC data source, implies that this connection will use an ODBC driver. I know by some documentation that ODBC is an language-agnostic, OS-agnotic API to connect to databases, everything that carries this level of flexibility comes with some downpoints (could be possible that some specific functionability can't be used with ODBC) or could be that the performance could be lower than using a more direct API (OLEDB or other). I know that using a DSN-less connection has some problems by itself like securely storing the access information to the database server/file ( can be solved with some kind of encrypter on the data), or unexpected changes in the name of provider used in the connection drivers (Specific case of old informix drivers). Is this correct, or I'm missunderstanding something?
