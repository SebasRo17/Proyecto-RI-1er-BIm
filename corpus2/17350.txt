I have a matrix whose dimensions are 26x26x3. For my assignment I have written a program which is using a `Do` loop (maxx=maxy=10,maxz=2):                Do[       n = 0;       h=0.4;       k = Table[              If[a <= #1 <= a + h && b <= #2 <= b + h && c <= #3 <= c + h & @@ pts[[w, t]], 1, 0],               {w, 1, Length[pts]},               {t, 1, Length[pts[[w]]]}           ];       pls = Plus @@@ k;       For[i = 1, i <= Length[pls], i++, If[pls[[i]] > 0, n++]];       n,        {a, 1, maxx, h}, {b, 1, maxy, h}, {c, 1, maxz, h}     ]      At every iteration I get a new value for n and I have to assign it to the correct position of my matrix as efficiently and fast as possible. I don't have a counter. So, I am a bit confused. How can I solve this issue? On the other hand, can I create a matrix by saving n at the end of the `Do` loop? Any help is appreciated.
