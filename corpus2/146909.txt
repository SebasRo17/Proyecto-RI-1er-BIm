I am a Java developer, but I was asked to learn about applying Six Sigma with the goal of increasing our organization's profits. I have read that Six Sigma can be applied in all environments, but I'm interested in the nuances of applying it to software development. Which concepts of Six Sigma can be applied to a software development environment and how can I effectively apply them? Are there any resources that discuss Six Sigma being applied specifically within a software development environment?
