I am about to start learning C++. I currently am a PHP programmer, I also know how to write Java code and create Java GUI applications. I have browsed http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ and to me it looks fairly similar to what I already know, just a few language syntax differences here and there. I want to create a C++ GUI application, and from what I researched, it sounds like using `Qt` and `Qt Creator` is a good place to start. So, is using `Qt` and `Qt Creator` a good/decent way to start to learn C++ GUI programming or should I do it some other way?
