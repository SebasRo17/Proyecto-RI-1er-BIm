I'm a very lucky individual who's managed to push a job I enjoy as a junior developer (I say push as I was hired as a Business Analyst but moved into development by proving I could do the work). I'm happy with my salary and working conditions. BUT (Seriously, why wouldn't there be a but?) the people I work with are... in a word... up themselves. I have two senior developers - brilliant minds, great work but complete knowledge horders. I feel like there's a lot I _could_ learn from them but very little they're going to _let_ me learn. As I'm early in my career and really want to become as great at this as I can - how important is learning from others (outside of the Internet) at this point in my career? Am I doing myself a disservice that I'm going to live to regret later in my career by staying here and not seeking out a workplace that has people willing to teach me and help me to further my skills?
