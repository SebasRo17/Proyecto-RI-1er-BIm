I've been observing programmers that are great at reading foreign, messy and undocumented code. At the same time they tend to also write messy code without documenting it. Is this common or just a coincidence? My theory is that since they can understand almost anything, they don't see the need for quality code. While I'm not that good at interpreting foreign code, when I write new I try to show the intent in the code and use plenty of comments, so that I myself could understand it later. Does this make sense?
