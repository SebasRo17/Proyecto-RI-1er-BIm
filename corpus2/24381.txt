**UPDATE** Today I was having these WaveletScalogram problems again. I think this is ultimately some kind of interaction issue with `Dynamic`. I have narrowed it down to this:               Graphics[Raster[{{0}}, ColorFunction -> "AvocadoColors"]]      Run this line, and then disable Dynamic Updating ("Evaluation" menu) and run it again. On my computer it comes out blank when Dynamic Updating is disabled. If you remove the `ColorFunction` option, it will work fine with or without Dynamic Updating. So new question: Why does this happen? Is it a bug? I wonder if others can even reproduce this. * * * **Previous version of this question:** I was trying to export `WaveletScalogram` plots (to image formats) in parallel, and some of the images were coming out blank. I've managed to reduce the issue to what appears to be quirky `Rasterize` behavior on `WaveletScalogram` plots specifically, in parallel computations. I'm on version 8.0.4.0 on Win7 64. With the following:               ParallelTable[      Rasterize@       WaveletScalogram[ContinuousWaveletTransform[RandomReal[{0, 1}, 2000]]],      {f, 4}]      I get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jbIBE.png) Change `ParallelTable` to `Table`, or remove the `Rasterize`, and I get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v5pON.png) I'm just wondering if this is actually a bug or I'm just missing something. **update** I was able to get it to work by hard-limiting the number of kernels to the number of cores on my system (a monstrous 2 cores). The "Parallel Kernel config" is a little confusing in this regard, since I have to set it to "1 parallel kernel" to get 2 parallel kernels controlled by a 3rd master kernel O_O Still this Rasterize behavior is uncalled for, I think.
