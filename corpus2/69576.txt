I'd like to use vim for writing SQL queries, but I haven't figured out yet how to get two key features that I use all the time in programs like SQL Yog. I usually just start up an instance of Yog in the background, cut-and-paste my SQL into it, hit F12 which auto-formats the whole thing. All the SQL keywords are automatically capitalized as soon as the text is pasted. I then copy it back into whatever other tool I'm using (often SQL Query Browser at work) and go from there. The benefits of these two features are worth the extra effort. Anyone know how I can set up vim to do this? I still may need to cut and paste back into Query Browser, which is acceptable to me, but I'd like to stick with vim for all my editing. Thanks.
