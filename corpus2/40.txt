I had always wondered if there might be a way to write a function, which I'll call `OEISData[]`, that more or less works as a curated data function for The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. I would imagine that the usage might be a little something like this:               OEISData["A004001"][9]     5          OEISData["A003418"][Range[8, 15]]     840, 2520, 2520, 27720, 27720, 360360, 360360, 360360          OEISData["A005849", "Keywords"]     {"hard", "nonn", "nice", "more"}      An API or something to retrieve data from the OEIS site might be needed for an implementation of this function. Is a function like this possible, with what _Mathematica_ is currently capable of?
