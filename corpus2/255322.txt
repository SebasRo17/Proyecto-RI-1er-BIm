In our team, the product owner only gives us a 1-liner summary. The developers then come up with a PoC, which the product owner reviews and the cycle repeats. The challenge here is 2-fold:   1. Time: We have to create the PoCs asap, so that they can be reviewed   2. The Developers are actually defining the look and feel of the product - a lot of UI PoC and some controller development to back it up. But BDD doesn't gel into the "creative" process of product envisioning. Typically, BDD requires you to take a product specification, and then codify it using Jasmine etc.  Can any BDD experts please suggest a way to blend the creative thinking process with BDD?
