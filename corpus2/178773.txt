This is a question about solving a particular problem I am struggling with, I am parsing a long list of text data, line by line for a business app in PHP (cron script on the CLI). The file follows the format:                   HD: Some text here {text here too}              DC: A description here         DC: the description continues here         DC: and it ends here.              DT: 2012-08-01              HD: Next header here {supplemental text}              ... this repeats over and over for a few hundred megs      I have to read each line, parse out the HD: line and grab the text on this line. I then compare this text against data stored in a database. When a match is found, I want to then record the following DC: lines that succeed the matched HD:. Pseudo code:                   while ( the_file_pointer_isnt_end_of_file) {             line = getCurrentLineFromFile             title = parseTitleFrom(line)             matched = searchForMatchInDB(line)             if ( matched ) {                 recordTheDCLines  // <- Best way to do this?             }         }      My problem is that because I am reading line by line, what is the best way to trigger the script to start saving DC lines, and then when they are finished save them to the database? I have a vague idea, but have yet to properly implement it. I would love to hear the communities ideas\suggestions! Thank you.
