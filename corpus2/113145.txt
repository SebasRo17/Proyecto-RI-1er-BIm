I was under the impression that the concepts of time and memory complexity are a must for graduates of compsci courses, but having studied engineering I have no knowledge if that is the case. I have recently been surprised to interview some graduates of a local college that do not even know the concept. I guess my question is: Is the concept of computational complexity important for software developers? And should it be taught in undergraduate courses?
