I create several ParametricPlot3D's that all should look the same: `BoundaryStyle -> Thick`, `AxesEdge -> {{-1, -1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, -1}}`, `Boxed -> False`, etc. To ensure consistency and make changing the options easier, I would like to specify them only once. From what I've understood, it's possible to change the default options of ParametricPlot3D permanently by using `SetOptions`. I don't particularly like this solution, because it would affect the appearance of all ParametricPlot3Ds. Alternatively, I tried using               para := {BoundaryStyle -> Thick, AxesEdge -> {{-1, -1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, -1}},              Boxed -> False}     Show[ParametricPlot3D[{u, v, 0}, {u, 0, 1}, {v, 0, 1}], para]      but here MMA complains > An unrecognized option name ("BoundaryStyle") was encountered while reading > a Graphics. This is the original code for one ParametricPlot3D:               ParametricPlot3D[{u, v, 0}, {u, 0, 1}, {v, 0, 1},        BoundaryStyle -> Thick, AxesEdge -> {{-1, -1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, -1}},       Boxed -> False]      Any suggestion is much appreciated.
