I often fight with myself on whether to put certain keys in my web.config or in a Constants.cs class or something like this. For example if I wanted to store application specific keys for whatever the case may be..I could store it and grab it from my web config via custom keys or consume it by referencing a constant in my constants class. When would you want to use Constants over config keys? This question really applies to any language I think.
