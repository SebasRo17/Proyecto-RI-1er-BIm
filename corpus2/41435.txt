I have two separated matrices in the form                X[[i*dx,j*dt]] and V[[i*dx,j*dt]]       where i & j are integers from (1 to N) & (1 to M). V & X are velocity and space respectively in phase space. I want to figure out a two dimensional (V-X) plot of these two matrices for different values of time (which is j*dt) in a sequence manner. I can use the following command to plot it for an specific time (e.g. j*dt=5) for all space:               ListPlot[Table[{V[[i,5]], X[[i,5]]}, {i, 1, N}];        But I'm in trouble to show it in sequence . I tried "Manipulate" command:               Manipulate[ListPlot[Table[{V[[i, j]], X[[i, j]]}, {i, 1, N}]], {j, 1, M}];      But unfortunately it doesn't work. Just notice that I need 2-D figure that represent a (V-X) plot of all space for different times. I don't know what should I do.
