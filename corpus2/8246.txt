> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Automated testing for compatibility with older Mathematica versions On my personal computer, I am running version 8.0.4, but on a compute cluster I would like to work with, they have stuck with version 6. With two major releases between the two, there is a lot of functionality in my version that is not present on the cluster. How might I detect which functionality will not be present on the prior versions? Obviously, the simplest method is to load the code into the prior version and determine which functions do not have a definition, but I would like to know before I run something on the older version if it will work, or not. Similarly, some functions have changed behavior or call signature between releases, so how might I detect this, also?
