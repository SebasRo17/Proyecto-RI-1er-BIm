To someone who knows database internals this may be an easy question, but can someone explain in a clear way why storing large blobs (say 400 MB movies) in the database is supposed to decrease performance and what exactly does that mean? This is a claim often found throughout the internet, but I've never seen it really explained. To be specific, I'm referring to SharePoint/MSSQL performance, i.e. file- upload performance, site browsing, displaying lists, document opening etc. - operations that are said to become slower once a database gets too big. Blob externalization to filesystem (which in SharePoint is called Remote Blob Storage, aka moving files out of the database, leaving only a reference) is supposed to solve this to an extent, but what exactly - at the bottom level - is the difference? It's obvious that backups would take longer with giant files stored in the database ... but what operations exactly are impacted and what's the underlying mechanism of it (i.e. in what way are files stored on filesystem outside of the database accessed or stored differently)? Suppose a simple table containing columns `ID(guid, PK), FileName(string), Data(varbinary(max))` \- would large `Data` column really slow down operations such as displaying a list of files on a website (which I assume internally means running `SELECT FileName FROM table`), or inserting a new row? It's not like the actual binary content columns are indexed. I know there have been some questions like this asked already, but I've not found an adequate explanation.
