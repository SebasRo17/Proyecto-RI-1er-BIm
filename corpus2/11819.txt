In today's news, scientists found a bright object on one of Curiosity's photos (it's near the bottom of the picture below). It's a bit tricky to find - I actually spent quite some time staring at the picture before I saw it. ![Bright object](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z2jmA.jpg) The question, then, is how one can systematically search for such anomalies. It should be harder than famous How do i find Waldo problem, as we do not necessarily know what we are looking for upfront! Unfortunately, I know next to nothing about image processing. Playing with different _Mathematica_ functions, I managed to find a transformation which makes the anomaly more visible at the third image after color separation -- but I knew what I was looking for already, so I played with the numerical parameter for `Binarize` until I found a value (0.55) that separated the bright object from the noise nicely. I'm wondering how can I do such analysis in a more systematic ways.               img = Import["http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/694809main_pia16225-43_946-710.jpg"];     Colorize @ MorphologicalComponents @ Binarize[#, .55] & /@ ColorSeparate[img]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tm6mR.jpg) Any pointers would be much appreciated!
