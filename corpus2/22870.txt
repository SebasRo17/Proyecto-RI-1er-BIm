Suppose I have an transport equation with an initial conditions:               sol = NDSolve[{D[y[x, t], t] - 4 D[y[x, t], x] == 0,                    y[x, 0] == 1/Sqrt[2 \[Pi]] Exp[-(x)^2/2],                    y[10, t] == 0},                    y[x, t], {x, -10, 10}, {t, 0, 5},                    MaxStepSize -> 0.1];     Plot3D[Evaluate[y[x, t] /. sol], {x, -10, 10}, {t, 0, 2.5},             PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nq2mJ.png) Suppose the packet is actually a probability distribution. The packet is moving to the left, and at some later time, part of the probability density goes out of the left boundary such that the sum of the probability density in the domain [-10,10] is less than 1. My question is, what should I do such that, at every time step, the sum of the probability density in the domain [-10,10] is 1?
