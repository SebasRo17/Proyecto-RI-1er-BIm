My situation:   * I have written a framework before I started my new job. I own the copyright.   * It has a bunch of boilerplate logic inside of it, like any piece of software. (duh!)   * I don't want to use the whole framework in my new job, but **I do need to re-use some parts of it** in a similar framework that I am building for my new job.   * It is impractical to re-implement / re-think all the logic from scratch. It is a lot of logic and logic is logic, you can't make it much different. For example, how many different versions of a HashMap can you code? I bet they will be very similar and the third version can claim that you violated the copyright of the first version. :(   * It is impractical to try to re-invent the API. Can you re-invent the API of a HashMap? Maybe you can change `put(k,v)` to `add(k,v)`, but not much more than that. My idea to protect myself and my previous code: I will tell my employer that I am building the new framework based on a previous one that I have written under the MIT license. So in the future if I use my previous framework someplace else, **or even another derived version of it** , that has some pieces of code similar with this new framework I am building now for the employer, they won't be able to say I am using their code, the one I wrote for them. My questions:   * I am not distributing my code to anyone. I don't have to distribute my MIT licensed code to anyone, if I own the copyright, correct? I mean, can someone request that I release my code that I now claim it is under MIT license? It would not be the end of the world and I would certainly agree to do that under a legal threat.   * Does this strategy make any sense? My final goal is to be able to use a derived version of my previous coded framework without losing the copyright to it. At the same time, i do not want to distribute this code as an open-source project to anyone. I have other open-source projects, that I freely distribute, but this one I would like to keep it to myself so I can use on my jobs (not contractor jobs). It is like **claiming that you have a framework under the MIT license, without actually distributing and/or showing to anyone**. If it is out there, free and easily available, my employers don't need me anymore. They can just take the code and give it to someone else to use it. Notes:   * I have listed this framework as a previous invention before I started the job.   * I have not released this code anywhere. It is on my private SVN repo I host in my private server. My idea in a nutshel:   * My plan is to keep the previous code to myself, use parts of it in this new framework I am building for the employer and **tell the employer it is work derived from a MIT licensed framework I have coded before and have not distributed to anyone** ". I am not forced to distribute a software I coded under MIT license, am I? If later, some legal claim happens (hopefully not), i can immediately paste the license on all the sources and show/release the code.
