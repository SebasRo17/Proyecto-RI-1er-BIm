Sorry for the confusing title. Let me explain: I am currently trying to get a site developed. My current developer has taken the site about as far as I think they are capable of and I am planning on hiring another developer to put the finishing touches on it, debug it and upgrade some of the more technical details. The site is hosted on my current developer's server. They are scheduled to work on it until mid-April, at which point they will transfer the site to my server. I would like the new developer to get started on the upgrades to the site as soon as possible. So my question is this: Is it possible for the new developer to start working on upgrades to the site while it is still on the old developer's server (and without the old developer knowing about it)? Would the new developer have to create a mirror site and work on it that way? I'm having trouble imagining if this is possible so any advice you can offer would be much appreciated!
