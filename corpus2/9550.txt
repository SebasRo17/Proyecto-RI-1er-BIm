Please consider the following:               InputField[Dynamic[X1], Number, Alignment -> Center];     InputField[Dynamic[X2], Number, Alignment -> Center];     Slider[Dynamic[Y1], {0, 200, 1}];     Slider[Dynamic[Y2], {0, 200, 1}];     Dynamic[FK, Dynamic[X1*(1 + Y1/100)]];     Dynamic[MK, Dynamic[X2*(1 + Y2/100)]];     Dynamic[HK, Dynamic[FK + MK]];     HeadTest = NumberQ[#] & /@ {X1, X2, Y1, Y2, FK, MK, HK}      Why would `FK`,`MK` and `HK` not have the head `Number`? (I guess I just did not understand how to use `Dynamic` and `DynamicModule`.)
