I found that this was the case with Eclipse. When I first started learning Java a lot of people told me to start with NetBeans because it's easier, comes with a lot of predefined functionality and most of the configuration is done by default. Indeed it seemed like an easy IDE but I just hated the way it looked. The UI to me was horrible. Then I downloaded Eclipse. I was pretty impressed with it. Everything looked shiny, fonts looked awesome and the UI in general was amazing compared to NetBeans'. So I stayed with Eclipse. Has something like this ever happen to you? Should the UI be of such a relevance to a programmer, is this bad ? The problem of the UI extends to everything for me, not only IDE's (e.g. even on linux I have to customize the WM the way I want before starting working with it).
