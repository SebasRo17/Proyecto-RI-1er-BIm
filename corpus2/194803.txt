So I have a quick question about the linear probing method of collision resolution in hash tables. So by definition a linear probing method would look like:               while (hashTable[hash] != null)         hash = (hash(key) + step) % tableSize;      But in my case I know exactly what the table size will be, I know all the keys, so I'm wondering if this is a valid alternative implementation:               while (hashTable[hash] != null) {         if (++hash == hashTable.length)             hash = 0;     }      I'm sorry if I made it too confusing, but I'm a little confused myself... If you can't get what I'm asking, a simple explanation of how linear probing would be implemented would be very helpful, and ps: I'm working in java. Thanks alot
