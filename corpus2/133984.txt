Every time I start a project, I decide at crucial moments to completely change the core classes and get caught up in obscure errors. I try planning in advanced and usually start off on a good foot but then I go to it another day and decide I would like to do it 'another way'. Is there a standard, of sorts, when starting a project such as mapping out classes and starting with unit tests? What is a good convention when planning and starting a medium project. The last project and started was a projectile motion simulator - I know, predictable.
