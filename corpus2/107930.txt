I used Foxpro 2.6 a decade ago. In my present company, few new projects are being developed in Visual Foxpro 9.0 and few projects are on .NET platform. From time-to-time I notice how Visual Foxpro is more powerful as compared to .NET when comparing dependency issues. Here are some of the advantages of VFP I noticed:   1. There is no hard and fast rule to use another full-fledged RDBMS. Even though the latest version of Visual Foxpro can be connected to SQL Server, but I have seen very large projects still, happily, using the old DBF. With .NET you have to connect to another RDBMS and it just adds to your Setup dependency.   2. Foxpro has built-in rich reporting capability since the time of DOS era, whereas .NET developers have to depend on Crystal Reports, SSRS or other third-party variants.   3. Visual Foxpro 9.0 has .NET capabilities as well. However, it is not dependent on .NET and therefore your final executable doesn't need .NET framework installed, which is again a dependency.   4. I have seen very large databases of Foxpro in few major government organizations, successfully running from a long time. These organizations don't feel a need to shift to SQL Server, not because of migration risks, but because they are happy with VFP. I want to step into VFP world but I read somewhere that Microsoft is stopping further developments of VFP and also stopping support to VFP 9.0 from 2015 onwards. What you guys suggest?
