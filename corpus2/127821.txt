I see lots of discussions flying around about performance of db 'x' or that moving from 'x' to 'y' improved our site performance. I'm yet to see proper benchmarking that works across different types of databases.   1. **Is it possible to write a meaningful benchmark that could be used across multiple db types, such as Relational, Document-oriented, etc.**   2. **How would you go about designing such a benchmark?**
