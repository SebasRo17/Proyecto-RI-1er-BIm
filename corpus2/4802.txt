Is there a way to add a title to an X3D (3D) plot that is exported using `Export[]`? I didn't have much success with exporting a `Text[]` into an X3D file. I also know that X3D files have several properties (meta tags) that could be helpful, but I don't know how to specify them in the `Export[]` command.               plot = Plot3D[x^2 + y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, PlotLabel -> "MyPlot"];     scaledPlot = plot /. Graphics3D[gr_, opts___] ->         Graphics3D[GeometricTransformation[gr, ScalingTransform[{1, 1, 0.5}]], opts];     Export["plot.x3d", Show[scaledPlot, Graphics3D[Text["MyPlot"]]]]
