Having to work with large files now, I would like to know when the java libraries will start switching to long for indexing in their methods. From Inputstreams read(byte[] b, int off, int len) - funnily there is long skip(long) also - to MappedByteBuffer to the basic indexing of arrays and lists, everything is adressed as int. Is there an official plan for enhancment of the libraries? Do initiatives exist to pressure oracle into enhancing the libraries, if there is no official plan yet?
