My (new) development team is setting up its software development environment. I won't describe the whole scenario, since that's another, much-maligned question. Anyway, we're going to have services such as source control (mercurial), a wiki, an issue tracker, a file/document server, DNS and possibly other things. My question: Is it a good idea to put as many as possible as these on a single 'kitchen-sink' server machine? Or is it better to spread them out as much as money, power and server room space allows? **Notes:**   * I know that some things have to go on a different server, like continuous/periodic building, with a lot of crunching involved. I'm talking about the (theoretically) lighter stuff.   * Our team has 4 people, expected to grow to maybe double that within the next couple of years.    * We're not going to be 'hammering' services, as far as I can tell.   * The expected hardware for the server is a plain vanilla PC, ~ $1,000 at most, maybe with an SSD.
