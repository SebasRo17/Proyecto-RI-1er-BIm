`URLSaveAsynchronous` can download one url page, how to download 100000 urls in an efficient way? And better to with an whole progress bar. I've downloaded 90000 htmls a web-dictionary in mathematica this way, I think it's interesting.               progress= 0.;     progFunction[_, "progress", {dlnow_, dltotal_, _, _}]:= Quiet[progress = dlnow/dltotal]     Dynamic[ProgressIndicator[progress]]          cells = Table[Defer[URLSaveAsynchronous][urls[[i]], names[[i]], progFunction,      "Progress" -> True], {i, 10000}];      Here is the working Document.               CreateDocument[ExpressionCell[#, "Input"] & /@ cells]      Maybe can speed up it? Another aspect is how to do the whole job in Mathematica more comfortably. To build the download tasks took so much time in the working document which looks like I'm not downloading in an asynchronous way.
