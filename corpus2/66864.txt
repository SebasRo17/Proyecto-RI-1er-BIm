If you were putting some work of yours online (say, a research project still in development or something alike) and **_it had to_** be made available to the public, but you wished that if someone uses it, he has to acknowledge the original author (i.e. you don't want anyone pushing your research as their own) what would be a good licence to use? In other words, you wish to protect your own work which, were it not for some rules, would never been actually made public.
