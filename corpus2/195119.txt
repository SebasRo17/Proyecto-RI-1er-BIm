To learn `class`es and objects at my university, students are required to develop a simple game (nine-mens morris or something similar) using Java. Java is used because of its libraries and tool support. What is the counterpart for C++. * * * _Background_ : I am a researcher at a university working with drones. The programming language for the research group is naturally C++. However, like most universities the introductory language of choice where I work is Java. The problem is when the students join the research group, it is hard work to "unlearn" Java for C++. IMHO, it hurts more than it helps. I want to propose teaching C++ instead; but I need to offer an alternative for learning `class`es and objects.
