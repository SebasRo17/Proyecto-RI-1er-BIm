I'll graduate next year and the campus drive has secured me a couple of jobs with what we call the "big" companies. But I had approached a startup recently as I really liked their projects and am also currently working with them, as an intern (though I work from home, keeping contact with my mentor there). I like the way they work, and they're offering me a position of software engineer with a nice pay-package. But the question is, if I join this startup as my first job, will I, should I choose to switch, be accepted in any of the "big" companies? I'm sure many of you must have encountered such a situation from either perspective - the job seeker or the employer.
