By introducing LINQ to SQL, I found myself and my .NET developer colleagues gradually moving from TSQL to C# to create queries on the database. Entity Framework made that shift almost permanent. Now it's nearly 2 years that I use LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Entities and haven't used TSQL that much. Yesterday, a colleague encountered a problem (he had to create a SP) and we went to help him. But we all found that our TSQL knowledge was diminished for sure, and a simple SP that seemed trivial to us 2 or 3 years ago, was a challenge to be solved yesterday. Thus it came to my mind that while TSQL's life is attached to SQL Server, and logically as long as SQL Server lives and doesn't change it's SQL language, TSQL would also live, practically it might die, and soon very few people might know it. Am I right? Do existence of ORMs like Entity Framework threaten TSQL's life and usability?
