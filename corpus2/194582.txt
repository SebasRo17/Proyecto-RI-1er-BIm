Has anyone ever come across this problem? When you have a team of developers working on a project, how can you measure their contributions to said project? Is there a "formal" way of doing it? Number of commits? Number of bug fixes? Lines committed? Or maybe on a ticket basis? I'm trying to think of a workflow where a group of developers can work seamlessly interchanging tasks and at the end of the month, getting paid for they contributions (or merit if you will). I hope this question is not entirely out of place here, if it is, feel free to close it.
