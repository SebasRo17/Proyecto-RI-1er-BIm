I tried to convince _Mathematica_ 8 to plot a density map of a function: $$f(x,y) = \frac{2(x^2 - y^2)-1}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}$$ with color scheme called "TemperatureMap". At $x = \pm 1$, $y = 0$ it's completely correct, but at $y = \pm 1$, $x = 0$, it shows white color, where, in fact, it should be blue. I'm only interested in the region $x^2 + y^2 > 1$, so I added the command: `ColorFunctionScaling -> False` and manually rescaled my function to take values only between 0 and 1: $$g(x,y) = \frac14 (3+f(x,y))$$ as I know where the maxima and minima occur in the region I'm interested in. The plot is even more strange, leaving almost no blue and, of course, at $x = 0, y = \pm 1$ it's white. Whole input I used was (PlotPoints so I can get higher quality plot, Exclusions so I can see where's the boundary of region I'm interested in):               DensityPlot[(3 + 2*(x^2 - y^2)/(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 1/(x^2 + y^2)^2)/       4, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}, PlotPoints -> 100,       ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap", Exclusions -> {x^2 + y^2 == 1},       ColorFunctionScaling -> True]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3SdZj.png) I expected a similar density map to the second image on this page. Instead the space approximately $(y/1.2)^2 + x^2 < 1$ is white. The region left of the white part is not exactly an ellipse, it looks like a ladyfinger. Where did I make a mistake? I tried to plot a constant function 0 and 1 while `ColorFunctionScaling` being false and it correctly showed whole plot blue and red respectively. I don't have the slightest clue what went wrong. I'd appreciate any help.
