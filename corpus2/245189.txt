I understand the basics of what data races are, and how locks/mutexes/semaphores help prevent them. But what happens if you have a "race condition" on the lock itself? For example, two different threads, perhaps in the same application, but running on different processors, try to acquire a lock _at the exact same time_. What happens then? What is done to prevent that? Is it impossible, or just plain unlikely? Or is it a _real_ race condition waiting to happen?
