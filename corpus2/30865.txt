I'm trying to demonstrate the aliasing effect using sound, that is, when the sample rate is fixed and the sound frequency is increased, we would hear the sound pitch go down when we pass the Nyquist frequency. Here is what I tried so far:               Manipulate[      EmitSound[       Play[Sin[ω* t], {t, 0, 0.2}, SampleRate -> 900]], {ω, 200, 6000, 10}]          Manipulate[      EmitSound[       Play[Sin[ω* t], {t, 0, 0.2}, SampleRate -> 8000]], {ω,200, 6000, 10}]      Question: The sound is a little bit lag to the slider. Is it possible to create a more responsive one like this               Manipulate[EmitSound[Sound[SoundNote[n, 3]]], {n, 1, 10, 1}]
