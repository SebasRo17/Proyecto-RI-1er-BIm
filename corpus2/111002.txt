This is the excerpt from the project's Github page. > _Gremlin provides graph traversal related syntactic sugar to Groovy. Groovy > provides dynamic language syntactic sugar to Java. Realize that anything you > can do in Java or Groovy can be done in Gremlin._ The documentation keeps referring to Groovy & Java. I need to learn it but I am not a member of Java family -- and will likely never be. Can I still learn Gremlin? Can someone point me to some docs/articles that explain Gremlin without assuming Groovy or Java acquaintance?
