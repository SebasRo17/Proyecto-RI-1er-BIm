**Preface** `foo`,`bar`,`baz` are instantly recognizable signifiers of example or pseudo code. Their popularity seems to be a strong indication that the programming community accepts them as a good way to indicate the author is showcasing a non-specific implementation of code. As this q+a reveals they are classified as metasyntactic variables. While the history of these words seems to be rooted in over 50+ years of usage I can't find any resources studying their effectiveness. **Question** Rather than take it a face value that their ubiquity is evidence for the effectiveness I'm wondering if there is **evidence** about the impact on linguistic comprehension. To clarify, I know that `foo` is understood as signifying pseudo-code, but I'm referring to comprehension _of_ what the pseudo-code means. **Why** I have re-read the FAQ many times and before I get accused of being chatty I'm not trying to elicit a discussion, I'm not looking for personal anecdotes, I'm asking a question that is relevant to the programming community at large though it's on the edge of our concerns. I realize that there may be not anything published in this area but in case there is it'd be helpful to know in either case.
