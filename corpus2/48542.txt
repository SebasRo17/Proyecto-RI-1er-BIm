I was trying to evaluate the following expression:               RegionPlot[a > 0 && 2 a + b == 0, {a, -2, 2}, {b, -1.5, 1},         PlotLegends -> "Expressions"]      The output is: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2v6Ml.png) I think this is unexpected. Think about when $a = 0.5$. So, $b = -1$ which is within the range $[-1.5, 1]$. So, this values and other such values should be in a gray region in the plot. But they are not there. Any help?
