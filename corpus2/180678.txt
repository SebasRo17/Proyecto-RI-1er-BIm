Recently, I've been trying to implement some working version of the Glicko Rating System for fun. However, I fail to understand how to programmatically isolate `R` in Step 2. As you can see `R` appears on both sides of the equation and for a variable number of instances. How would I programatically solve for `R` using python? Thanks for any help :) EDIT: Actually shouldn't the `R` in step 2 be `R_0` on the right hand side of the equation? Is this a typo? Note in "The Glicko system" by Professor Mark E. Glickman, the equations are identical except for all `R`s being on one side and `R'` being on the other.
