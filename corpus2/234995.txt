When studying OOP by myself I often encounter UML class diagrams. I understand them, but don't completely know how to write them. Meaning, I don't entirely know what each kind of arrow means, and things like that. 1- How important is it to learn the 'language' of UML class diagrams? If it is something worth the time, could you forward me to a good, cohesive yet sufficient source? 2- If/when I do learn to draws UML class diagrams: Are all the little nuances important, or is it that every developer draws UML diagrams a little differently?
