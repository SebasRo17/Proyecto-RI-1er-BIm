I'm really a noob on _Mathematica_. I would like to create a layout of multiple plots in _Mathematica_. I've a function that calculates the solution, over time, of a system of differential equations. The results are to be plotted. In order to compare different solutions, I want a plot showing a 6X6 grid of `LogPlot`s. I'm adding an example of my code               function[a0_, b0_, c0_, d0_, e0_, f0_] :=       Block[{replacerules, sssol},         replacerules = {a -> a0, b -> b0, c -> c0, d -> d0};         sssol  = NSolve[Sys /. replacerules, {x,y,z}], ];         numint = NDSolve[ SysDiff /. sssol ,{x,y,z},{t, 0, 100},];         p = LogPlot[x[t] /.numint, y[t] /.numint, z[t] /.numint];         Return[p]]          Manipulate[       GraphicsGrid[ Table[function[a, b, c, d, e, f],        {a, -1, 4},        {b, -1, 4}]],       {c, -10, -4},       {d,  -4,  2, 1},       {e,   1, 20, 1}]      This is a really really simplified version of the code. I hope it can help. My function takes as input some parameters and uses them to calculate the solution of a system of differential equations. Then everything is plotted with the help of Manipulate and Table to combine different parameters values.
