Questions like 'What sort of jobs are available in Houston', or 'What do developers get paid in London' are notoriously off-topic here. My question is: where do those questions belong? Is there a suitable place online that I can pose these sort of questions, or do some research into how the market looks on the other side of the world? With a medium-term plan to move internationally, it would be helpful to know what the potential job market might look like in my destination. Different technologies and vendor products are more popular in different regions, the relative pay rates vary dramatically, and skills required for different industries (technology, communications, manufacturing, marketing) are very diverse. This sort of information is very valuable. Where can I find it?
