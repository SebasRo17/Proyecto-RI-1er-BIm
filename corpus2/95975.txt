I had taken a telephonic interview and the interviewer has given some problem for which I was supposed to give him the algorithm. Since its was a telephonic interview and I had no paper or pen, so I could not give him the correct solutions. So I got bit demotivated that my problem solving skills are very low (I have a decent exp on developing software). How do you overcome these kind of situations and suggestions to improve algorithm skills especially while facing these kind of tactical interviews.
