I'm an experienced desktop developer who's recently begun writing iOS apps and would like to venture into Android development as well. I've been hearing a lot of talk surrounding the Appcelerator Titanium framework lately, but I'm not sure I fully understand it's purpose. As I understand it, it's a framework for building native mobile apps using web technologies. If I don't have any web dev skills, are there any ways that using Appcelerator Titanium would benefit me? Thanks for your thoughts, I'm going to continue researching this right now.
