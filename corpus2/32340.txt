Imagine that in this toy code I want to evaluate just the selected (blue) expression: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4vSS2.png) To get as output result: {09/14,09/15,09/16,09/17,09/18,09/19,09/20} There is some shortcut to do this? I'm looking for something like `Command`+`Shift`+`Enter` (Mac). But I don't want it to evaluate in place, but as an output. Maybe something that I can put into KeyEventTranslations.tr Today I have to copy the code to outside the module, or comment the rest of it. In this toy code it's a easy task, but for bigger code it's very annoying to do.
