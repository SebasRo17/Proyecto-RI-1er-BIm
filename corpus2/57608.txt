I am encountering compatibility issues when loading `DumpSave`(d) definitions in V10 that have been created with earlier versions. V10 appears to be unable to digest `InterpolatingFunction from earlier version. When looking at an example functions in both versions I get the following: Definition from the Documentation               points = {{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {5, 0}};     ifun = Interpolation[points]      In V9.0.1 this is digested as:               ??ifun     Global`ifun     ifun=InterpolatingFunction[{{0,5}},{4,3,0,{6},{4},0,0,0,0,Automatic},{{0,1,2,3,4,5}},{{0},{1},{3},{4},{3},{0}},{Automatic}]      In V10:               ??ifun     Global`ifun     ifun=InterpolatingFunction[{{0,5}},{4,3,0,{6},{4},0,0,0,0,Automatic,{},{},False},{{0,1,2,3,4,5}},{{0},{1},{3},{4},{3},{0}},{Automatic}]      Particularly the second part is not identical: V9.0.1:               ifun[[2]]     {4,3,0,{6},{4},0,0,0,0,Automatic}      V10:               ifun[[2]]     {4,3,0,{6},{4},0,0,0,0,Automatic,{},{},False}      Can somebody explain the differences to me? Is there a way to still be able to use the old definitions (which were time consuming to create) in V10?
