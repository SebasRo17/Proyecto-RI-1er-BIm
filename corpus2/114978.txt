I've got two very bright kids who are showing interest in learning programming. Of course their primary goal is to develop video games. They have decided they want to be game developers when they finish their schooling! However, I seem to have been reading a lot lately about how software companies are frustrated with the level of math skills in their job candidates - apparently schools are not teaching math adequately for programming. There are already other questions about how to teach programming to kids but I'm more specifically interested here in improving kids relevant MATH concepts & skills. What specific suggestions can you give? Just for the record, I'm not seeking to force math on them as a chore rather I'm wondering if there's something enjoyable I could get them to do and they could learn from it at the same time (e.g. similar to how Lego Mindstorms gets recommended for teaching kids programming). Mind you, if someone recommended some great math book that helped their kid that would be great too.
