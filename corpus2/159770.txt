I am building a tool to access some data on a site (Fitocracy) and I would like to turn it into an unofficial partial API, as no official API exists. If you are not logged in, you cannot get access to any data, so my tool uses Ruby's mechanize to log in (with my account) and scrape some data from a page. How should I handle this when I turn it into an API? I am worried that people won't feel comfortable sending their login credentials through an unofficial API and I don't want to just circumvent the login to the site by giving everybody access through a dummy account.
