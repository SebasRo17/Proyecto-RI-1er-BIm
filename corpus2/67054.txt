In my team, everyone would like to do everything, including backend, frontend, middle layer. I told them that we should divide the work according to roles and area of expertise. What are the pros and cons of dividing the work vertically (each user story is done by the same person from the back end to the front end) versus dividing the work horizontally (each abstraction layer is done by the same person)?
