`InverseFunction` works well for globally invertible functions, like               f = 2*# + 2 &;     InverseFunction[f]      > >     1/2 (-2 + #1) & >   However, how would one for example find the inverse of $f(x)=x^2$ around $(x,f(x))=(1,1)$? My _Mathematica (8.0.4)_ gives me a warning about multivalued inverses in this case, as well as the result $-\sqrt{x}$, which is not the branch that I'm looking for:               f = #^2 &     InverseFunction[f]      > >     #1^2 & >   >     InverseFunction::ifun: >       Inverse functions are being used. Values may be lost for multivalued > inverses. >> >   >     -Sqrt[#1] & >   So: How can I specify the neighbourhood a function should be inverted on?
