I'm doing my first group project in a class where most quarters 40% of the students have failed. I believe the reason for this is the poor quality of teaching in the class. For example, the instructor did not know that scriplets in JSP was bad practice. (I learned JSP this week and I know that.) He didn't know that Swing GUIs were supposed to go on the EDT. He didn't know that static imports were bad practice. I could go on. The project is to design a web application for a quiz website. There is a lot of extra credit available, and it is possible to get 200%. This is my first group project. I am worried about the failure of most of my peers, and I want to avoid it. **What obstacles might I face when working on a project like this and how can I overcome them?**
