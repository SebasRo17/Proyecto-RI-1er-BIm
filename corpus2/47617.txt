I want to explain this summation to _Mathematica_ , For $a >0$ define $n_u, n_d \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that if $\{ a \} \leq 0.5$ then $n_u = [a]-1$ and $n_d = - [a]$ and if $\{ a \} > 0.5$ then $n_u = [a]$ and $n_d = -([a]+1)$. Now compute the sum, $\sum _ {n = n_d} ^{n_u} (1+2n)Log[a^2 - (n + \frac{1}{2} )^2] $ Can someone help me write this in _Mathematica_? * * * Withe everything that I tried so far, _Mathematica_ produced a complex number as the answer! I don't know how _Mathematica_ is adding up a finite number of real numbers to get a complex number!
