I have a friend who has asked me to teach him how to program. I was thinking that using a language that I do not know could be beneficial because:   * I will learn something new too.   * That will make me slow down, as I've been told that I usually explain things too fast. So now I need to find some balance between what is didactic for a _newbie_ and is useful to me. My draft of requirements:   * Not C, Java or Python (because I already know).   * My personal interests now are on Erlang, Scala and C++ (but they might be too hardcore)... I could refresh Scheme or Prolog too.   * Need a good IDE or REPL to play with.   * Clean and simple language.   * Good (and free!) documentation.   * Some practical for the real world (i.e. making a web application, image processing, statistical analysis...) About the methodology, I was thinking about this sequence:   * Introduction to logic.   * Basic maths and algorithms.   * Software design principles.   * Some foundations on computer technology.   * Make some large project. So, any suggestions about the language or methodology? **edit** : My "student" is a 28 years old MD, his goal is to make a web site for medicine students. As he is also into research, so I think he could find immediate use to his new programming skills for data analysis and plotting. Ultimately I might help him directly with the project.
