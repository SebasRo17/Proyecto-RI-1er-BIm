At the white regions of this image I want to add a few random arrows. I would like to realize two different of adding the random arrows:   * The arrows may not leave the white region   * The arrows have to leave the white region -                img = Import["ExampleData/spikey2.png"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Sggh2.png) How can you do this with Mathematica? In particular I would like to know how to detect the white regions, and how to store this information. If I give you an arrow can you tell me whether it crosses non-white parts of the image? There is not much space for the arrows in this picture. It would be good to add a bit of white canvas to create some space for the arrows.
