I know that the command `LaunchKernels[]` starts up four kernels on my machine:               LaunchKernels[]     {KernelObject[1, "local"], KernelObject[2, "local"],       KernelObject[3, "local"], KernelObject[4, "local"]}      I also figured out that the command `SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], Evaluator -> "xyz"];` should then set the given Notebook to be evaluated on some kernel "xyz", but I cannot find the right syntax for this "xyz" to refer to for instance `KernelObject[1, "local"]`. What should I write there? **EDIT** This is the relevant command: `FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken["ModifyEvaluatorNames"]]`. Create a couple Kernel names and evaluate in parallel.
