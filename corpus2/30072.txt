UPDATED to clearify I want to construct a stacked barchart from a list with three elements:               list = Table[{i, x, y}, {i, 10}]       where x has a value between 0 and 100, and y has a value between 0 and 100 so it looks like this:               llist = {{1, 6, 611}, {2, 57, 732}, {3, 5, 526}, {4, 91, 72}, {5, 45,      583}, {6, 98, 552}, {7, 16, 981}, {8, 54, 439}, {9, 80, 804}, {10,      9, 633}};      I want to stack y based on brackets of x (eg. brackets of size 10). Based on the list above this gives the following brackets.   * Bracket `0 - 10` consists of $y$ value (s) `611, 526, 633`   * Bracket `10 - 20` consists of $y$ value (s) `981`   * Bracket `20 - 30` consists of $y$ value (s) empty    * Bracket `30 - 40` consists of $y$ value (s) empty    * Bracket `40 - 50` consists of $y$ value (s) `583`   * Bracket `50 - 60` consists of $y$ value (s) `732, 439`   * Bracket `70 - 80` consists of $y$ value (s) empty    * Bracket `80 - 90` consists of $y$ value (s) `804`   * Bracket `90 - 100` consists of $y$ value (s) `72, 552` The result should look something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uZVhV.png) Some context: this is a plot I want to make to show how much influence is exerted (y values) on certain policy positions (x values). The first elements are actors. So Actor 1 exerts 611 influence on policy position 6 (first bracket 0-10). For each bracket I want to visually see how much influence is exerted by the actors and how this looked stacked
