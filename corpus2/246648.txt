I'm in a situation at work where I have to transfer responsibility of a large code base that I inherited, re-factored and enhanced to another developer. This is the first time that I have to do such a thing and although I always thought it would be trivial the actual steps I have to follow seem vague. The code base I maintain is a module that includes a lot of stuff such as   * A persistence layer   * A service layer   * A presentation layer which sadly has a lots of business code in it   * An interface for module interaction I also have very good knowledge of the business assumptions made when it was developed as well as its technical foundation. I know that I can go with my mind's flow and give it my best but I prefer to do it in the most professional manner I can. So, I would like to ask you for advice on how I should approach this situation. Are there any standard procedures and good practices that I could follow?
