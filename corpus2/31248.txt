I was wondering how to apply Markov steady-state chains to a simple case in genetics, eye colour. Assuming the probabilities of being brown, green or blue eyed, given your parents were a certain colour combination are:               Br + Br - Br 75%  , Gr 18.75% , Bl 6.25%     Gr + Br - Br 50%  , Gr 37.5%  , Bl 12.5%     Bl + Br - Br 50%  , Gr 0%     , Bl 50%     Gr + Gr - Br 0.5% , Gr 74.75% , Bl 24.75%     Gr + Bl - Br 0%   , Gr 50%    , Bl 50%     Bl + Bl - Br 0%   , Gr 1%     , Bl 99%      Corresponding matrix:               {{3/4, 1/2, 1/2, 0.005, 0, 0}, {0.1875, 0.375, 0, 0.7475, 1/2, 1/       100}, {0.0625, 0.125, 1/2, 0.2475, 1/2, 99/100}}      I want to find the steady state for the eye colour of the population.
