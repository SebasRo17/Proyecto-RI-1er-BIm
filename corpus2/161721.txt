I am used to Java and therefore always think conditions are interpreted from left to right, i.e. there is a vital difference in `null != $obj` and `$obj != null` Now this seems not to be the case with PHP. Can I do something wrong in PHP when I always start with `null` on the left- hand side? Can I keep my behaviour from Java or do I need to train myself to do something else when dealing with PHP conditions?
