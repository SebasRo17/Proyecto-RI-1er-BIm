I have a list               l={{0, 0, 0, 3}, {0, 0, 0, 3}, {0, 0, 1, 2}}      And I would like to obtain the number of zeros in each sublist:               NZ=Table[Count[l[[i]], 0], {i, Length[l]}]      which will return the list: `{3,3,2}` . Is there a way to use `Map` to accomplish this more cleanly? What I would like to do is write something like: `Map[Count, l]` which will of course fail because `Count` needs a pattern to count.
