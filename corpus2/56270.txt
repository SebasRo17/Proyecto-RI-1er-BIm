I already found a similar question here on SO, but almost all of the answers were more philosophical, rather than practical. I'd like some PRACTICAL ideas about how to make my programming course more interesting. It doesn't matter how much effort it takes. I thought about asking my students to pick a topic in the beginning of the course and to work on it as some kind of a real, small, startup project that they could financially exploit once it's finished. But I'm afraid that most of them will not take the project to its completion, and that it could become very boring. Also I thought about involving them in Torcs, but I'm afraid most of them wouldn't be up to the task. Btw, Torcs is Car Racing Simulation, but there's an API for developers so they can develop their own AI for the driver, and then race their car against other programmers' AIs. I'm not asking here for problem examples, as I asked a separate question about that. I need ideas about making my lectures more interesting and fun.
