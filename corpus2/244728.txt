I am currently doing some research for a project. The setup is simple, I have a computer running a service in my home network and any device connected to that same network should be able to discover the service automatically and use it. I have no specific technology requirement whether it is on the server or client side. The client knows about the service definition. Other than that I have no idea what strategy to use, what technology to look at or whether I should go for a SOAP or a HTTP based service. I think going HTTP with REST API is the best for targeting all devices but I am opened to any suggestions. Thanks.
