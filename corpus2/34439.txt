Integrate[x^(1/3) AiryAi[x], {x, 0, ∞}]     (* Integrate[x^(1/3) AiryAi[x], {x, 0, ∞}] *)          Integrate[x^a AiryAi[x], {x, 0, ∞}] /. a -> 1/3     (* Gamma[1/3]/(3^(1/9) Gamma[1/9]) *)        * Why do I need to generalize/parameterize an integral sometimes to get a closed form result? Should cases like this be considered as bugs?   * How can I tell what kinds of generalization may help in a particular case? Do you know any other tricks besides replacing a constant with a parameter?
