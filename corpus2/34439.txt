Writing a GUI for a program has always been a daunting, depressing, and frustrating task. It doesn't matter which language, its extremely hard to get what I want. Especially in compiled languages like Java where a change takes a minute or two to build. The result is that I increasingly use GUI designers for some of my project. Sure there is some spagetti code, but as long as I leave the configuration and a note saying "This was designed with X" I have no qualms with doing this. Is this an okay way to design a GUI? More importantly, is this what most people do? Or is the common way to just sit down and write it out?
