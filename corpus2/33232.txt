Suppose that $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, and I have observed some entries of $A$, say, $A_S$ ($A$ restricted on $S$) for some subset $S$ in $\{1,...,n\} \times \{1,...,n\}$. I want to know if it's possible that $A$ has rank $1$. So this can be reformulated as the following question: does there exist vectors $x$ and $y$ such that $xy^T$ restricted on $S$ equal to the observed values $A_S$? Is there a good way to test this in Mathematica? (the dimension $n$ could be large, but the set $S$ would be a set of a relatively small size in comparison with $n^2$)
