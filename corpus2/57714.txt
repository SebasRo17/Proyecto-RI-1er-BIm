This doesn't work...               DateListPlot[{{DateObject[{2014, 1, 1}], 1},      {DateObject[{2014, 1, 2}], 2},      {DateObject[{2014, 1, 3}], 3}},       Joined -> True, GridLines -> {{DateObject[{2014, 1, 2}]}, None}]      Neither does this...               DateListPlot[{{DateObject[{2014,1,1}],1},     {DateObject[{2014,1,2}],2},     {DateObject[{2014,1,3}],3}},      Joined->True, PlotRange->{{DateObject[{2014,1,1}],DateObject[{2014,1,3}]},All}]      Converting the values in GridLines and PlotRange to DateLists works. It seems a bit of an over-sight not to support DateObject here. The question is should this work?
