Initially I was interested in renderring a 3D analog of a blurred disk like this               DensityPlot[1 - HeavisideLambda[(x^2 + y^2)/8]/2, {x, -4, 4}, {y, -4, 4},       FrameTicks -> False, ColorFunctionScaling -> False,       ColorFunction -> "SunsetColors", PlotRange -> {0, 1},       PlotPoints -> 50]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oxsud.png) The only idea that came to my mind was playing with `Opacity`, which gives hardly an impressive result:               Graphics3D[{Orange}~Join~        Table[{Opacity[i], Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, 1 - i]}, {i, 0.1, 1, 0.1}] //        Flatten]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7PgYj.png) So, **1) is it possible to get "true" blurred ball and 2) how to extrapolate this idea to other 3D objects?**
