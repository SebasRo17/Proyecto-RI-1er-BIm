I've started to work with web development using PHP as server side programming language. In that time I didn't know the benefits of object orientation and had a hard time trying to write more maintainable code (for instance, spliting presentation from logic, and etc). After some years I knew about ASP.NET MVC and I gave it a try. I've learned how to work with the .NET plataform using C# programming language and I really found awesome how better structured my applications could be using good object orientation (dependency injection for instance was something that when I saw it for the first time I thought: "that's everything I always needed"). The point is that although I'm happy working with ASP.NET MVC, I still need in some projects to work with PHP, however I was wondering if it's possible to bring all the benefits from object orientation to PHP. I didn't find a way to do so on my own because for instance, PHP is not strongly typed so that it becomes a little complicated to make use of dependency injection as I've learned when working with ASP.NET MVC. Also, many of the things I've learned when working with MVC in ASP.NET although very cool and useful I didn't find a way to do the same in PHP. Now here comes the question: does anybody know about resources to learn how to take benefits of all that cool things from OOP to PHP? I'm interested in any resources: books, tutorials, videos, etc. Thanks very much in advance, and sorry if this question is silly.
