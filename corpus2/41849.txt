I always see job positions for web companies for Machine Learning. For example facebook always has this type of job opening. Anyways, i was curious as to what exactly do web companies use machine learning for. Is it for giving people ads based on their site surfing history or something like that. I want to know because i have some experience with machine learning and it sounds like a fun thing to work on as long as i can convince the business guys to go ahead with it.
