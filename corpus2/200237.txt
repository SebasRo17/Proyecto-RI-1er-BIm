This is more of preference question that I wanted to toss out to other developers to learn a bit more about others process when developing a site. Every time I start a site I feel I could save a lot of time if I had a better starting point to work from. I have a 'starter' folder that has a CSS folder, a JS folder, an index.html file, etc. that I use as a guide, but I make tweaks every time I build a site, so I feel like I end up working from the last site I built instead of the starter folder most of the time. I figured there has to be a better way to setup a starting place that gets you up and running programming a site more efficiently. What do you use handle this in your workflow? Where/how do you save code snippets to reuse from site to site, etc.?
