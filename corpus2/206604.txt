I am a little confused on both pointers and reference. From my understanding pointers are addresses in memory. If I pass a variable using pointers and reference to a function, any manipulations of the variable in the function will change the original variable. I read online that passing by reference is not encouraged because it can get messy code easily. I also read here (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7058339/c-when-to-use-references-vs- pointers), that we should avoid pointers if we can. My question is when should pointers and reference be used? I know pointers are used in Xcode for strong references and reference counting. Since, higher level languages like c# have garbage collector, does that mean we shouldn't ever use pointers and reference in them?
