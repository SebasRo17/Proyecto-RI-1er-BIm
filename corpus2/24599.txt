I want to speed up my code, i.e., replace `Select` by `Pick`. I think using two `Pick` expressions isn't pretty, but I have no good idea on how to combine them.               Select[Permutations@ Range@9,         #1 < #4 < #7 && #1/(10 #2 + #3) + #4/(10 #5 + #6) + #7/(10 #8 + #9) == 1 & @@ # &]          Pick[#, #1/(10 #2 + #3) + #4/(10 #5 + #6) + #7/(10 #8 + #9) & @@ Transpose @ #, 1] & @       Pick[#, Thread[#1 < #4 < #7] & @@ Transpose@#] & @ Permutations @ Range @ 9
