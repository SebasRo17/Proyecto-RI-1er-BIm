I have a huge transition matrix (81x81). The matrix is too huge to paste here, so I store it in this notebook. (There are constraints on the symbols: $0<p_b<1$ and $0<p_g<1$. If further constraints are needed, $0<p_b<0.5<p_g<1$) The terms are either in symbols or rational numbers, or the mixture of both. I tried to solve for its equilibrium distribution using `LinearSolve`, but the execution lasted for one day and ended up using up all work PC's physical RAM and swap space (16G in total) but no results could be obtained. Now I'm thinking about getting the equilibrium distribution by matrix multiplications, since for a transition matrix $\mathbb{M}$: $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mathbb{M}^n=\mathbb{A}. $$ The rows of $\mathbb{A}$ is the equilibrium distribution, provided the equilibrium exists. Operationally, I will repeatedly multiply the transition matrix and do `Simplify`. **I need the symbolic expressions rather than the numerical results for particular $p_b$ and $p_g$.** I would like to know if this method will work and if anyone has done the same before.
