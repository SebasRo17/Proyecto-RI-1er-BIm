I want to solve the equation $\frac{abi}{a+bi}=4-2i$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. I know from hand-solving the answer is $a=5$, $b=-10$. How do I get _Mathematica_ to tell me this? I tried:               Solve[a b I/(a + b I) == 4 - 2 I, {a, b}]      but this returns               {{b -> -(((2 + 4 I) a)/((-4 + 2 I) + a))}}.      I tried               Solve[a b I/(a + b I) == 4 - 2 I, {a, b},Reals]      but this returns               Solve[a b I/(a + b I) == 4 - 2 I, {a, b},Reals].      Is there a simple way of getting _Mathematica_ to solve this, without knowing lots of special _Mathematica_ commands? In searching out the answer on this site, I see workarounds that a newbie to _MMA_ would never think of themselves, nor understand what they are doing that gives the right answer.
