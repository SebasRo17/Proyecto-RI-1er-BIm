I'm looking for a specific diagram I saw recently. It was a combination of three diagrams, showing   1. A project with Test First Unit Tests having less bug fix time / system testing   2. A project with Test Last Unit Tests having a reduced amount of bug fix time / system testing.   3. A project with no unit tests having most after care  It looked roughly something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bFVdq.png) I would like to find this again. I know I could tidy up that visio mock up but I would like to be able to present it in context. I think it's from a book I've read recently, but equally could be from an article on the web. Scanning my bookshelf and google images and my history has not been able to pin it down. Books I can recall reading (but I couldn't see it in any just now) in the last couple of months:   * Clean Code / Clean Coder by Bob Martin    * Art of Unit Testing (2nd)   * Dependency Injection in .Net
