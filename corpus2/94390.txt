What I mean is, do people print some kind of line item form? What data does it contain? What are the line items usually? Otherwise, do you just present a written document describing with a paragraph? Do you show the number of hours or just a lump sum? Perhaps you only show dollars per hour and an estimate of the hours. Do you give multiple estimates, a high and a low? Is there any best practice for making sure you don't screw yourself or your client? Just trying to get an idea of a few samples of what a client might want to hold in their hands or see on their LCD screen so they can authorize the work that is being presented and agree on the cost.
