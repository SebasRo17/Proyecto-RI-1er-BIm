I want to find which files are recently modified in a specific directory. For this purpose, I wrote a function named `Test`. The function's argument is `DirectoryPath`, and it returns file names whose file dates have been modified. In this example the functions runs once every five seconds. For this purpose I wrote the following code, but it shows all the file names that are in the directory. That means it doesn't check the `ModificationDate` with `lastModified`.               Test[directoryPath_] := Module[{taskId,        fileNames = FileNames["*", SystemDialogInput["Directory"]],        lastModified,        result},       (        lastModified = Table[{}, {Length[fileNames]}];        result = Table[{}, {Length[fileNames]}];        taskId =          CreateScheduledTask[          Table[(With[{             i = i,              modificationDate =                Table[FileDate[Part[fileNames, j], "Modification"],                 {j, 1, Length[fileNames]}]              },            (If[(Part[lastModified, i] === Part[modificationDate, i]),              (Part[result, i] =  ""),               (Part[lastModified, i] = Part[modificationDate, i];               Part[result, i] = Part[fileNames, i])])]),           {i, 1, Length[fileNames]}],          {OptionValue[ScanRate], \[Infinity]}];        StartScheduledTask[taskId];        {taskId, Dynamic[result]}        )]          Test[SystemDialogInput["Directory"]]      How can I solve this?
