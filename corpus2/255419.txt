The MASM32 documentation clearly states that the GPL violates MASM32's license, and therefore cannot be applied to projects built with MASM32. > The MASM32 project **cannot be used to create open source software** or any > other project under any form of licence that requires the user of the MASM32 > project to surrender the rights they are afforded under the MASM32 licence. > In particular the MASM32 licence completely excludes projects licenced under > the GNU organisation's published GPL licence and/or variants. However, no guidance is given on what licenses _are_ MASM32 compatible. My best guess based on the general push for freedom and not restriction in the MASM32 license is that the MIT license would be compatible. However, I'm not a lawyer. Anyone else gone down this path already and figured out which licenses are able to be used with MASM32?
