I have an application which does heavy autoloading, meaning, that only two classes are "included" directly. For every module tha the application has (total like 14 modules), that module defines an autoloader. However, I wanted to know if is too time expensive to load all classes using autoloaders and what could I do to speed it up. As a side note, at this point I'm not experiencing a slow application, I'm just trying to predict if it could happen. Thanks in advance
