Sometimes I stare blankly into space or sketch ideas and write some pseudo codes on paper. Then I scratch it out and start again, then when I think I have the correct solution for the problem I begin writing the code. Is it normal to think for days without writing any code? Is this a sign that I am approaching the problem entirely wrong? It makes me nervous to not getting any tangible code written in my IDE.
