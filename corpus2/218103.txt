In my design, I have multiple models and each model has a controller. I need to use all the models to process some operation. Most examples I see are pretty simple with 1 view, 1 controller, and 1 model. How would you get all these models together? Only ways I can think of are 1) Have a top-level controller which has a reference to every controller. Those controllers will have a getter/setter function for their model. Does this violate MVC because every controller should have a model? 2) Have an Intermediate class to combine every model into a one model. Then you create a controller for that new super model. Do you know of any better ideas? Thanks.
