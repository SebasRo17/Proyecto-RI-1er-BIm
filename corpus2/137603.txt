My program uses the following define statements:               #define LOWEST_PATIENT_ID 10000     #define HIGHEST_PATIENT_ID 99999     #define LOWEST_CRITICAL_STATUS 1     #define HIGHEST_CRITICAL_STATUS 100      used in this type of code:               do{        scanf("%d", &c_status);        }while((c_status<LOWEST_CRITICAL_STATUS)                ||(c_status>HIGHEST_CRITICAL_STATUS));      I'm unclear about how this is more secure. or is it the typedef statement that is secure?
