I've been looking for some implementations of `Service Layer` and `Controller` interaction in blogs and in some open source projects. All of them seem to refer `DbContext` object in repository classes but avoided to use in service classes. Service classes essentially using a `IQueryable<T>` references of `DbSet<T>`. I want to know why this practice is good and why `DbContext` shouldn't have a reference in Service Layer.
