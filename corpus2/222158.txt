I'm working with a team building a RESTful web service, and our current implementation utilizes the user's email as a unique identifier for the user resource, yielding URIs like the following: `https://www.domain.com/users/example@gmail.com/resource` Emails are guaranteed to be unique in our system, and we've handled when the user changes his/her email, so it seems OK. But is it _correct_? The debate is whether we should use an immutable user ID instead, which in our case would look more like: `https://www.domain.com/users/a36571b87be464728c8d/resource` Or perhaps something else altogether. For instance, several Google APIs simply use `/users/me/resource` and identify the user via auth data. In a nutshell, is it acceptable to use a unique but mutable identifier in our URIs, or should we use an immutable one? Thanks!
