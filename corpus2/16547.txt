How can a notebook be saved without including the front end version? If you open a `.nb` file, you'll see something like               FrontEndVersion -> "9.0 for Mac OS X x86 (32-bit, 64-bit Kernel) (November 20, 2012)"      close to the end of the `Notebook` expression. I would like to simply not have this option. **Use case:** Mathematica will issue a warning when opening a notebook that was created in a newer version (for example when using version 8 to open a notebook created in version 9). This applies to palettes as well. When distributing a palette (such as the SE image uploader) to people with both version 8 and version 9, I need to make sure that the palette doesn't have `FrontEndVersion` that indicates version 9, otherwise people with v8 get a warning. I would like to keep the flexibility to generate the palette in v9 though, and just test with v8 occasionally. My current options are either editing out the version info manually from the `.nb` or generating the palette only with v8.
