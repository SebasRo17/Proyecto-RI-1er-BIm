I'm currently working on a speech introducing an introduction to C++ programming manual. The speech itself is going to be about the topics within the manual (which are very basic concepts, such as data types, ect..) I'll be giving this speech to students who are **not familiar to C++ or even programming in general** , and I'm looking for an attention grabber to begin my speech with such as a fun fact or quote about C++, or an interesting statistic regarding C++. I am wanting something the students will understand, and that sparks their interest. Does anyone have any good ideas that I can use? Thanks!
