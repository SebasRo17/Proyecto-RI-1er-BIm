I am part of a development team that is relatively new to `Scrum`, suppose that at the end of the sprint a few large stories are either `in progress` or were not `accepted` by the PO. Firstly, what happens with those user stories? Do you just carry them over into the next sprint? If so, should they be re-estimated? In my view the work remaining on these user stories can be minimal or a lot? If not, why not? EDIT: In my specific case, the stories were not completed because of an impediment that was a few days long, not because of user story underestimation. For those of you that it may help, we are using `VersionOne`
