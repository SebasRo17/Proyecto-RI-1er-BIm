I have a `BarChart` used to show traffic on a network interface. I have data for every 0.5s, upto 1 min, which gives a lot of points. Is there a way to make it look less chaotic and messy?               data = Import["/Users/matek/NetworkTest/without_use_in_and_out.csv", "Table"];          maxValues = 121;     labelValues = Range[0.0, maxValues*0.5, 0.5];     Show[         BarChart[             data[[1 ;; maxValues]],             ChartLegends -> Placed[{"Outbound (TX)", "Inbound (RX)"}, {{0.5, 0}}],             ChartLabels -> {labelValues, None},             AxesLabel -> {"Duration [s]", "Bandwidth [byte/s]"}         ],          ImageSize -> 600,          BaseStyle -> {12, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"},          PlotRange -> All      ]      The result ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IFboA.png) It's evident that the ticks and ChartLabels in the resulting BarChart look awful.
