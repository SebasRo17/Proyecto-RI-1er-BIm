Trying to plot with complex quantities seems not to work properly in what I want to accomplish. I would like to know if there is a general rule/way of plotting when you have complex counterparts in your function. I tried looking up `ContourPlot` and `DensityPlot` but I only have one single variable as `ContourPlot` asks for two variables in order to plot. The expression I am trying to plot is as so:               eqn := (25 Pi f I)/(1 + 10 Pi f I)     Plot[eqn,{f,-5,5}]      If there something else that is missing here?
