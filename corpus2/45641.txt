Many companies have annual reviews and/or performance appraisals for their employees. I've heard that it's generally a good idea to muster up some hard data to analyze and bring to the review. The better the data, the better the chances to help support a promotion or raise. What I mean by hard data, are _tangible numbers_ \-- something that can be _measured_ and/or _calculated_. Obviously data that a developer would have access to. Something _intangible_ would be how beautiful the code a developer has written. I think this would be very hard to measure, nor would upper management care for it. My question is: For a software developer, **what kind of hard data should be analyzed and brought to a review to help highlight good work that was done?** An example I've been given in the past: The support tickets produced by each project a developer was involved in. Are the numbers low? Are the rate per month getting lower? Etc.
