I am researching a software reliability model that has many parameters that need to be estimated. I want to use a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to estimate those parameters. After I searched this site for similar problems, I know that `SuperLog` in SMLE.m package is helpful for MLE. And I find the paper(http://www.tri.org.au/RoseSmithD.pdf), this paper provided code of SMLE.m in Appendix B. I try to copy code from Appendix B and follow instruction in the lower half of page 230, but I still can not get the expected result(See following image). Can anyone help me? My research is suspended for this point.Thanks in advance. **SMLE.m** which I copy from the paper:               (*:Name: SMLE *)     (*:Authors: Colin Rose and Murray D.
