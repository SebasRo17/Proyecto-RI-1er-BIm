I am trying to systematically obtain the distance between two given locations using the Google Maps API Distance Matrix facility: developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/ From the example they give in the web: I'd use: > > URLFetch["http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/distancematrix/xml?origins=Vancouver+BC|Seattle&destinations=San+Francisco|Vancouver+BC&mode=bicycling&language=fr- > FR&sensor=false"] and then parse the xml data. Now if I want to do this for many cities, I would build a string with URL changing the appropriate `origins` and `destinations` and other parameters. However, it looks pretty cumbersome to me and I feel that there should be a more efficient way to do it. Perhaps using the `parameters` option in `URLFetch`. So, there is the question, using the Google Maps API, given two locations is an more efficient (faster) way to obtain its distance? Thanks in advance!
