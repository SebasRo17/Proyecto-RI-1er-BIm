As developers we constantly strive to solve problems of the masses. We also constantly look for new methodologies, languages and possibly organizations to help us further our ability to solve problems. I feel as if I've always been one of the top members on my team. I also feel that I look for ways to improve my work in ways others often do not care to. I'm starting to feel a little burnout from ~6 years of supporting technology. I blame the fact that I do work so hard and hold myself to high expectations. Some of the greatest devs on the planet do not even write code for a living any longer. Often, its burnout. Some have said they grow tired of "the game", but I wonder if the problem is a bit simpler. One of "carrying the weight of the world on our shoulders". If you feel you are a strong developer and also feel that this is not a problem for you, please enlighten me with your approach. How do you stay up to date with tech, help others and solve problems quickly/accurately without getting all wound up?
