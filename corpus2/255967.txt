I am new to Android development and just installed the new Android sdk with Eclipse and ADT bundle. From this question, I knew about installing Intel X86 system image. But, I have one confusion about installing intel x86 for which I couldn't find any solution on internet. In SDK manager, Intel x86 system image installation options are shown for each API level as in the picture. image is here (Since I have no privileges. Hope someone will correct it) So, my question is that, do we need to have intel x86 system image for all API levels? (I am making an application which will support from Android ICs to kitkat.)
