I have created a Windows Form project (VS solution) under a TFS 2010 project. I may eventually add more solutions to the TFS project. **My question** : Can we create a Use Case WIT for a specific solution within a TFS project? Furthermore, is it possible to create a "traceability matrix" that starts at the Use Case level and goes down to the the code level (at least the namespace level) of that particular VS solution?
