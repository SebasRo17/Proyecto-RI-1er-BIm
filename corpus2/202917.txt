I just have read some stuff on enum today. Use of flags with enum was something interesting and new for me. But often practice and theoretical uses are different. I go through many articles they examples they quoted were good to get the concept but am still wondering in what situations one can use Enums with flag to store multiple values? Will highly appreciate if you please can share your practical experience of using enum with flags.
