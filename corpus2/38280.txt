Agile software development is becoming a pretty fun buzzword these days. As a developer, I understand the pragmatic value of iterative development, but (most often) it isn't a developers choice to embrace an Agile approach to software development. It's a top-down management choice! Whether it is crystal, agile methods, dsdm, rup, xp, scrum, fdd, tdd, you name it. It's not a developer choice. For all the managers out there, **what are the biggest reasons for choosing to do Agile development** when (in my experience) most managers haven't even touched a piece of code in their life!
