I wonder what kind of algorithm is used to compute the values for the gamma function. Specifically, I am interested in how the computational load increases when the complexity of the input grows. So, for example, evaluating               Gamma[x + I y]      for integer `x` and `y` and gradually increasing their number of digits will make the computation time longer. What is the corresponding power law for the increase? EDIT: evaluating at `4 Pi + I 8 GoldenRatio`:               data = Monitor[     Table[{k,       N[Gamma[4 Pi + I 8 GoldenRatio], k 10^3]; // Timing //        First}, {k, 1, 10, 5/10}], k];      ListLinePlot[data, Mesh -> All,      MeshStyle -> Directive[Red, PointSize[Large]]]      Now shows ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mqkHh.gif) and I get               line = Fit[Log@data, {1, x}, x]     -3.350 + 2.723 x      not sure if this is relevant or just an artifact.
