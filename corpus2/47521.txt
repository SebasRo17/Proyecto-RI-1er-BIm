I have the following piece of code:               SetAttributes[createPlayers, HoldAll];     createPlayers[names__] :=       (Clear[player];        players =          Table[numOfPlayers = i;           player[i] = {names}[[i]], {i, Length[{names}]}]);          createPlayers["Aron", "Geoff", "Steve"];          gameStats[stats__] :=       Grid[{         Table[SymbolName[Unevaluated[{stats}]][[i]], {i, Length@{stats}}],         Table[{stats}[[i]], {i, Length@{stats}}]         }, Frame -> All];          gameStats[numOfPlayers, player[1], player[2], player[3]] // Dynamic      This does three tasks:   1. A function to create as many players as required. These players' names can then be viewed with `player[i]`. The total number of players is also stored in the variable `numOfPlayers`.   2. It creates three players by the names Aron, Geoff and Steve respectively.    3. `gameStats` creates a grid displaying useful stats about the game.  Functions 1 and 2 work fine. I can't get function 3 to work though. What I am trying to get at is to display a grid with the symbol names in the top row, and their values in the bottom row - like so: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0vOR2.png) Instead the best I can do is this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Xn5G.png) Either the top row displays the variables' values - which means that both top and bottom rows are the same - or it displays this error message. How can I get the top row to display the variables' symbol names properly?
