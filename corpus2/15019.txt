I'm sure there is a very easy way to control this, but I have been searching for an hour now without luck. I plot a function and export it to get a table that I can use in TikZ.               Plot[{AiryAi[x], AiryBi[x]}, {x, -20, 10}]     Export["airyfunctions.dat", %]      The resulting .dat file has numbers with about 16-17 digits (e.g. `4.044732860029933`) whereas I'd like them to have about 5 digits of precision. Also, the table currently separates the coordinates from the plot like: `{x_1,y_1}, {x_2,y_2}, {x_3,y_3}`. I'd prefer if they were formatted instead with spaces `x_1 y_1` and newlines. I tried using `"FieldSeparators" -> " "` without luck.
