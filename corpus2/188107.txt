I'm not a web programmer at all so I really have no idea: You'll notice that websites like Stack Exchange have links like this:               http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/188078/policy-and-practice-on-code-maintenance      As you can see, the link includes the "page name" ( _Policy and practice on code maintenance_ ). We know this is unnecessary, since I could just use               http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/188078      instead. Curiously, upon using this link, the site will replace it for the one with the page name. My question is: why do some websites put the page name in their links? What advantages or disadvantages come from that? The only advantage that comes to my mind is the fact that the link becomes more user friendly since it is easier to identify what the URL is about. But I wonder if there are more technical aspects behind this behavior.
