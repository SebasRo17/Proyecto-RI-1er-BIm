I'm writing a paper on the topic of applications affected more by memory performance than processor performance. I've got a lot written regarding the gap between the two, however I can't seem to find anything about the applications that might be affected more by memory performance than by processor speed. I suppose these are applications that make a large amount of memory references, but I have no idea what kind of applications would make such large number of references to make it stand out? Perhaps databases? Can you please give me any pointers on how to proceed, some links to papers? I'm really stuck.
