I see that I was a real "doofus" here and my original question was flawed. You can't divide a polygon like you can a circle or a rectangle, except in special cases... I should have seen that right away, as always, I learn so much connecting with users here.... I can still use the solutions that are being posted, but limit the divisions to special cases... sorry for the poorly thought out question.... I'm working with a grade 7 student and going over fractions.... it's always fractions... I have a simple demonstration that shows fractions, and then emphasizes equivalent fractions by subdividing the pieces.                Manipulate[           Graphics[{             Flatten[{Red,           Disk[{0, 0}, 1, {(# - 1)   2 \[Pi]/divs,  #  2 \[Pi]/divs}] & /@            Range[pieces]}],             {Thickness[0.005], Circle[]},             {Thickness[0.005],          Line /@ Table[{{0, 0}, {Cos[i], Sin[i]}}, {i, 0, 2 \[Pi],             2 \[Pi]/divs}]},             {Thickness[0.001],          Line /@ Table[{{0, 0}, {Cos[i], Sin[i]}}, {i, 0, 2 \[Pi],             2 \[Pi]/(mult divs)}]}},       ImageSize -> 600],           {{divs, 2, "divisions"}, 2,  10, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left},      {{pieces, 1, "pieces"}, 1,  divs, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left},      {{mult, 1, "multiplier"}, 1, 10, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left}      ]      ![pie in pieces](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ieItg.png) Same idea with rectangles                    Manipulate[      Graphics[{             {Pink, Rectangle [{0, 0}, {60, pieces 100/divs}]},             {Thickness[0.005],          Line[{{0, 0}, {60, 0}, {60, 100}, {0, 100}, {0, 0}}]},             {Thickness[0.005],          Line /@ Table[{{0, i 100/divs}, {60, i 100/divs}}   , {i, 1,             divs}]},             {Thickness[0.001],          Line /@ Table[{{i 60/divs2, 0}, { i 60/divs2, 100}}   , {i, 1,             divs2}]}                  }, ImageSize -> 500],      {{divs, 2, "vertical"}, 1, 10, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left},      {{divs2, 1, "horizontal"}, 1, 10, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left},      {pieces, 1, divs, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left}      ]      ![rectangle pieces](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fL7xo.png) Okay, my polygon demonstration is sort of working, but way out of my depth here... if I "subdivide" the polygon to show equivalent fractions, I'd need to find points on the polygon, but the "easy" points are on the enclosing circle.               Manipulate[Module[{perimeter, spokes, shaded, minispokes},            perimeter =         Line[Table[{Cos[i], Sin[i]}, {i, 0, 2 \[Pi], 2 \[Pi]/divs}]];       spokes =         Line /@ Table[{{0, 0}, {Cos[i], Sin[i]}}, {i, 0, 2 \[Pi],            2 \[Pi]/divs}];       minispokes =         Line /@ Table[{{0, 0}, {Cos[i], Sin[i]}}, {i, 0, 2 \[Pi],            2 \[Pi]/(mult divs)}];       shaded = {Green,          Polygon[Flatten[{ {{0, 0}},             Table[{Cos[i], Sin[i]}, {i, 0, pieces 2 \[Pi]/divs,               2 \[Pi]/divs}], {{0, 0}}}, 1]]};       Graphics[{shaded, {Thickness[0.005], perimeter,           spokes}, {Thickness[0.001], minispokes}}, ImageSize -> 500,         PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}]       ],      {{divs, 5, "sides"}, 1, 12, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left},      {{pieces, 1, "pieces"}, 1, divs, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left},      {{mult, 1, "multiplier"}, 1, 10, 1, ControlPlacement -> Left}      ]      ![polygon pieces](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ByjUL.png) Hopefully my problem makes sense. How would I create those subdivision lines so the endpoints are on the polygon, not on the circle? I'd welcome any suggestions, feedback, etc. Tom
