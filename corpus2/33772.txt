_**Problem Description:_** **Today，I countered a integration problem that I must plot the 2-D graph of Abs[x]+Abs[x+y]==1.** I plots it step by step by hand: When x>=0, x+|x+y|=1                  y>=-x    2x+y=1        y<-x     y=-1      When x<0, -x+|x+y|=1                  y>=-x    y=1        y<-x     2x+y=-1      ![the 2-D graph of Abs\[x\]+Abs\[x+y\]==1?](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w1i5B.png) _**However,I want to use Mathematica to solve it._** Have a try:               Plot[y /. {Solve[Abs@x + Abs@(x + y) == 1, y]}, {x, -1, 1},      AspectRatio -> Automatic]      but the Mathematica give the warning information: “Solve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Solve, so some solutions may not be found; use Reduce for complete solution information. >>” So I think my solution has flaws.My question is how to revise it or give another method to solve it?
