I am trying to use a program written by someone else. When I run the program, I am supposed to get a number as a result, however, what I got is some complicated result with "InterpolatingFunction" and "Developer`PackedArrayForm". I am wondering whether there is any package I should load in that causes this problem? I upload the program I am trying to run in the following link: https://user.iter.org/filesharing/?uid=d2bc26f7-c4c4-406b-8337-cb2d26772db4 Thank you very much for your help!
