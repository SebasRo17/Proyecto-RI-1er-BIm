I just learned about rubber duck debugging, where the programmer explains code, line by line, to a rubber duck or other inanimate object in order to find the problem. This approach sounds time-consuming, but seems to work well from what I've read. Can someone with experience with this approach tell just how effective this is, and whether this is a time-efficient way to debug faulty code compared to other techniques, such as stepping through a program and watching variables in a debugger?
