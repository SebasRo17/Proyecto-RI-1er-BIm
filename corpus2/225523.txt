I'm trying to get to grips with unit testing. Say we have a die which can has a default number of sides equal to 6 (but can be 4, 5 sided etc.):               import random     class Die():         def __init__(self, sides=6):             self._sides = sides              def roll(self):             return random.randint(1, self._sides)      Would the following be valid/useful unit tests?   * test a roll in the range 1-6 for a 6 sided die   * test a roll of 0 for a 6 sided die   * test a roll of 7 for a 6 sided die   * test a roll in the range 1-3 for a 3 sided die   * test a roll of 0 for a 3 sided die   * test a roll of 4 for a 3 sided die I'm just thinking that these are a waste of time as the random module has been around for long enough but then i think if the random module gets updated (say i update my Python version) then at least i'm covered. Also, do I even need to test other variations of die rolls e.g. the 3 in this case, or is it good to cover another initialized die state?
