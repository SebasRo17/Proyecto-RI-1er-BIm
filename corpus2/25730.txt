I use Mathematica and Pythonika to run Python code inside it. And I'm not quite sure what causes my issue: all `unicode` Python objects look like this: `А\\.00л\\.00е\\.00к\\.00с` (instead of `Александр`), i.e. there is an extra symbol after each letter, and thus the string is truncated (its length remains same). At the Pythonika page the author mentioned that unicode is supported, although not well-tested. Anyone experienced this? What are the possible workarounds?
