If you find out a way to interact with a web service API that is not publicly documented as available, and can emulate it within an application you develop, is it illegal to do so? Furthermore is it illegal to charge for a product that you build to interact with these services (maybe all that's needed is a reference to the 3rd party)? An example would be, lets say, Google didn't advertise how to do a search in your program, but you found out how and made it so people could do the search differently than how Google presents it, can you build against the service you discovered and sell a version of it?
