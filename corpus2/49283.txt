I know that I can use the `Notation` package to define my own custom notation. This works great for `StandardForm` output, but I would like the notation to apply when I convert it to TraditionalForm`. For example:               Notation[△ θ_ ⟸ △[θ_]]      This tells _Mathematica_ that if it finds a laplacian operator, mathematica should display it without the brackets. This works fine in `StandardForm`. However, if I use `TraditionalForm`, then _Mathematica_ inserts parentheses instead of following the rule. How can I make the rule apply to `TraditionalForm`?
