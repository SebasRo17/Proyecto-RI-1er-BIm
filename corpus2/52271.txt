I am trying to construct a matrix `A` which depends on variables `x` and `y` through iteration. My code is:               Nmax = 2;     For[iw = 1, iw <= 5, iw++,               A[x_, y_] :=        Normal[SparseArray[{{i_, j_} /; j == i :> iw + 2 (Cos[x] + Cos[y]),          {i_, j_} /; j - i == 1 :> 1, {i_, j_} /; i - j == 1 :> 1}, {Nmax,           Nmax}] ]              ;       Print["Testing A-matrix at (x,y)=(\[Pi]/2,\[Pi]/2)"];            MatrixForm[A[Pi/2, Pi/2]] // N      ]             MatrixForm[A[Pi/2, Pi/2]] // N      You can see that I am trying to construct a matrix where the diagonal elements are decided by the function `2 (Cos[x] + Cos[y])` and loop index `iw` and all offdiagonal elements are assigned to be 1 . However, I do not see the matrix when I try to see the matrix for each loop! Instead, the code shows the matrix outside the loop. Why is it so?
