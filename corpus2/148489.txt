I am learning Django and new to web development. Please excuse me if you find this question too dumb. So, I am creating a Facebook application using Django which I would like to host in Google App Engine. The project would be focusing on reading RSS/ Atom feeds of any website (That's all I can say now). I am sure enough to process the RSS/Atom files but I am worried about the front end (User Interface) part - "The design part". I don't know HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript (I can handle simple HTML stuff but that doesn't lead to any designing thing). First, I thought of using tools like dreamweaver or any equivalent software for designing UI but when I really started learning django and getting into it, It seems to be a "not possible" thing. So,   * How should I design the UI part of my site? Can't I use tools like dreamweaver?      * If NO, what's the best way for guy like me who doesn't know JavaScript/ CSS     * If YES, what's the best open source alternative to dreamweaver?     * Can Google App Engine handle all this suff?   * How people who deal with Django edit those template pages. The Django mentions the it will separate the logical (views) and design (templates) parts so that different departments in a company can handle separately. But Considering the fact that the Django's HTML pages are filled with "tags" which are no way related to HTML (designing), how UI people handle it?
