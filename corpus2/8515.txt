I have a background in economics and I'm very interested in learning _Mathematica_ but I'm afraid of starting out because I have seen that most programmers already have a good background in some kind of procedural language, and I don't! My goal is to start learning _Mathematica_ , and take it as my Swiss army knife. I don't want to spend time to become good in another language first, and start to study to be a good software developer in _Mathematica_ only after that. So, my question is: Is it strictly necessary to have a prior knowledge in another kind of language, or one can master, from level zero, and be a great Mathematica programmer just starting programming through _Mathematica_? It seems to me that there aren't any efforts (books, tutorials, documentation) in this sense directed to the self learner. What do you think? Is there a way?
