I am having a problem with pattern testing on variables during function definition               nfun[M : Repeated[_?(test1&&test2||test3..)&, {10}]]:= N@(Norm@(Sin[#] & /@ M))      I want to have a few tests on the vectors `M` that I want to feed `nfun`. One example that does not work if I want to test if `M` has `Integer` entries using `Repeated` is the following.               nfun[M : Repeated[_?IntegerQ, {10}]]:= N@(Norm@(Sin[#] & /@ M))      Here goes another filed trial with the same aim.               nfun[M_?((VectorQ[#, IntegerQ]) && (Length[#] == 10)) &]:= N@(Norm@(Sin[#] & /@ M))
