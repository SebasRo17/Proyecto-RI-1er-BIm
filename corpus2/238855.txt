Consider the following situation:   * She uses Django (BSD) for a website.   * She uses Haystack (BSD) for textual search in the website.   * She uses the backend of haystack, xapian-haystack (GPL), to use Xapian (GPL) as the search engine of Haystack. Question: must she distribute the source code of her website under GPL (or equivalent)? My question is specific on whether the source code is considered to be a derivative GPL code. Pragmatically, I would say the code is written entirely in Python+Django+Haystack, and Xapian could be substituted by other search engine. Indeed, the difference in the code is as simple as               HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {         'default': {             'ENGINE': 'haystack.backends.xapian_backend.XapianEngine',             'PATH': os.path.join('tmp', 'test_xapian_query'),             'INCLUDE_SPELLING': True,         }     }      or               HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {         'default': {             'ENGINE': 'haystack.backends.elasticsearch_backend.ElasticsearchSearchEngine',             'URL': 'http://127.0.0.1:9200/',             'INDEX_NAME': 'test_default',             'INCLUDE_SPELLING': True,         },     }      But I would like very much to have a second opinion on this.
