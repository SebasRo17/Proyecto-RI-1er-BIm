As a graduate fresh out of college with a clean slate, how can one go about being a good programmer who writes good maintainable code? How does one learn good coding practices and apply them? Can one get these skills by reading any specific books on Software development or is it something that comes purely from experience? (I don't like to believe that it's purely experience based since I see people here complaining about bright co-workers with years of experience writing bad code). What are some suggestions on getting good at writing clean code? Passion and ability are assumed.
