I am currently working with a product that is effectively a glorified CRUD application. (It is a C# .NET 4.0 desktop application backed by an Oracle 11gR2 database.) The client program presents a list of "screens" that the user can open; each presents a view of some data and a number of buttons used to perform operations on the data. Currently, these screens are configurable to the extent of deciding what data to show on the screen and what each of the buttons should do. However, what I would like to do is to make each control a "module" and allow the user doing the configuration to drag and drop these modules into a wireframe to create a customised screen on-the-fly. For example, I would like a "grid" module (we effectively already have this as a WPF control) such that I could have as many "grids" on a screen as I like, and each could have a different configuration - e.g. what fields are shown, and which fields are editable. Further, each grid could be linked so that selecting an item in one grid would cause related data to load in another grid. How do I approach this design?
