Today I lost a method that I was using since my co-worker redefined it to take its superclass instead. So after synchronizing with the repository I had trouble. Would it had been better in this case to use some annotation like `@Deprecated` instead of removing the method so that I would get an error message telling my that the method was deprecated? Can a version control system or an IDE work around situations like this by deprecating methods instead of deleting them?
