I have a website that is build with asp.net web forms. I would like to refresh design (using css, html5, responsive design) and also change it from web forms to asp.net MVC. To me this is more of a frontend project. Since there is already existing backend, it is "only" necessary to reuse it in MVC. Should I first start with design update or MVC? This project if far more easier, than starting a new website from the start, or am I mistaken?
