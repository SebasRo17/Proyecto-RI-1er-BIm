Consider this example:               data = Table[{i, i + 20 Sin[RandomReal[-i, i]][[1]]}, {i, 1, 1000}];     Plot[x, {x, 0, 1000}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Thickness[0.01]},        Epilog -> {PointSize[0.02], Point[data]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WSdQH.jpg) It can be seen that the points are rendered over the main plot and makes it invisible. How to control the layers of plot so that to send a layer backward or to bring it forward.
