I'm confused about some of the notations of UML class diagrams. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfBSY.png) Pretty sure I know what **Association** means. Any relationship between instances of two classes, where an instance of one class needs to know about an instance of the second class in order to perform it's work - is an Association relationship. An Association often means class A has a reference (field) to an instance of class B. However, I'm having trouble understanding what the **Aggregation** and **Composition** arrows mean. Part of my confusion was caused by encountering different definitions of these notations. Two definitions of the **Aggregation** notation: **Definition 1:** An Aggregation notation between two classes is suitable whenever an instance of class A **holds a collection** of instances of class B (e.g. a List, Array, whatever). **Definition 2:** An Aggregation link between two classes is suitable if an instance of class A holds a reference to an instance of class B, **and the B instance is dependent on the lifecycle of the A instance.** Meaning: When the instance of class A get's deleted, so will the instance of class B. The instance of class B is **entirely contained** by the instance of class A, as opposed to the instance of class A simply owning a reference to the instance of class B (which is regular Association). Regarding what the Composition notation means and how it differs from the Aggregation notation, I'm not sure. Please clarify the definitions and help me understand. Concrete examples would be welcome.
