Just out of curiosity what's the difference between a small, medium and large size project? Is it measured by lines of code or complexity or what? Im building a bartering system and so far have about 1000 lines of code for login/registration. Even though there's lots of LOC i wouldnt consider it a big project because its not that complex though this is my first project so im not sure. How is it measured?
