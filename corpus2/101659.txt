I would just want to ask what Java frameworks are worth learning, specially when it comes to web applications, but other frameworks are welcome too. Could you please state:   * The learning curve    * The availability of resources   * The performance of that framework   * Would you recommend it or not I want to study frameworks on my free time. If it's not too much a bother thanks to those that will answer! If it's too vast: How about for web applications? Should I learn Spring or Struts 2? iBatis or Hibernate? Stuff like that Still if it's vast: What frameworks would you recommend out there? Really. Anything. I want to learn and I'm used as a JEE guy now so if it's related with web app then I would take that as a bonus.
