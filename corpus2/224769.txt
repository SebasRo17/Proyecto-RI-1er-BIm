We are a group of 5 developers(scientists end engineers) that write code in C++. What we would like to do is to make all the code available to all the developers easily. The first step in this process was to set up a SVN server, and it worked fine. Now we are facing another need: we would like to have a system were all the base classes, mathematical libraries, algorithms are public and accessible to every developer. Something like a Wiki, or like the root documentation http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TH1.html. A sort of site where you can upload code, you can describe it and you can point out how to use it. Do you have any suggestion?
