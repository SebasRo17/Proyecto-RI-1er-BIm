I'm importing data from Excel. It appears that the sheet number needed in the Import statement is taken from the order that the sheets appear in the open Excel file. I need to import 2 of the sheets from an Excel file. I'd like to do it via the names of the sheets, or at least by some attribute that won't change if I add or delete other sheets or re-order the existing sheets. Can this be done?
