I've been trying to hack up an annotated Spring MVC web app but it's proving pretty hard to call a URL of my web app which fires a request to a remote API (UK Police data) and recieves a reply which I can then return as JSON. I've been trying to use Spring's RestTemplate. The odd JavaScript example that I've glanced at does seem to be suited to that task a lot better and more simplistic than a full blown servlet. **Is that an opinion that you also share and can back up with a good, clear simple example?** JavaScript does seem to provide a good platform for this kind of task **Or, in other words, is it simpler to create a "web-app" with JavaScript that does some REST calls and renders the response than trying to do it with Spring?**
