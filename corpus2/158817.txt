My situation is that I have been offered a job working on a product for a small company. I'm currently working for a large corporation for a respectable salary considering my experience. Long term I am interested in creating my own products and starting up my own company. I've been offered a job to develop a product that I would be primarily developing. I looked at the idea and I think it is a pretty good idea and has a reasonable chance of being successful. I told him that I would be interested in earning a commission from the sales of the product. Considering that I would be developing the product what percentage would be reasonable to ask?
