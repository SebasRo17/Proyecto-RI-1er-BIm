I have a data set of the form $d=\\{(y_1,x_1),(y_2,x_2)...(y_n,x_n)\\}$ for a large $n$. A non-parametric plot of this data (a scatter plot where all observations are sorted along $x$ and joined with a line in the $y-x$ plane) looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WdMXQ.jpg) I want to know how to construct (or define) an empirical distribution, for which the CDF corresponds to this plot. I know that the function `EmpiricalDistribution` could create a distribution function from $d$. The question, however, is how to generate in Mathematica a function from an empirical CDF.
