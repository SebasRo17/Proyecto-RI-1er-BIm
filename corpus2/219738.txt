Task - Consider an array of n elements. Count the number of pairs that satisfy condition X (sum of the two elements < an arbitrary number, k) . The basic approach I could think of would be O(n^2), where I evaluate all n*(n-1)/2 pairs. How can I solve the problem in a better time frame i.e., O(n log n) or less? The best approach so far was to sort the array, find where a+b smaller than k then add indice of a to solution. But the process still has to go through n-1 'b's to check for each of them. It's better but still doesn't improve the worst case. Also, this isn't homework. I came across this while preparing for a competition.
