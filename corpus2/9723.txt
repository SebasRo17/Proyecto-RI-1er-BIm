This thought hit me the other day: How would an employer look at a one-handed programmer being interviewed? I wouldn't be surprised if the person behind the desk were thinking: > Hm, he/she only has one hand. One hand is half of two hands, hence he/she > can type half as fast as a two-hander. Programmers type code, thus he/she > will produce half as much code. To wit, a one-hander is half as productive > as a two-handed coder. But good programmers do so much more than write code: they device algorithms and solutions to nitty problems; they do code-reviews and upkeep a high standard; they detect and fix bugs; and so much more. Most importantly, they think! If you want typing power, hire an orangutang! But maybe I'm barking at a non-existant problem. Maybe employers don't think a physical disability affects their programming skills. How would I know - I've never met a physically handicapped programmer, let alone a one-handed one, to confirm it. What's your experience? Have you, for example, witnessed a physically disabled programmer not be hired because it was thought he or she wouldn't be able to do the job because of the handicap?
