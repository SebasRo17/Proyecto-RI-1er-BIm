Since this site is read by a global audience of programmers, I want to know if people generally agree that the vast majority of software innovation - languages, OS, tools, methodologies, books, etc. - still originates from the USA, Canada, and the EU. I can think of a few exceptions, e.g. Nginx webserver from Russia and the Ruby language from Japan, but overwhelmingly, the software I use and encounter daily is from North America and the EU.   * Why? Is history and historical momentum (computing having started in USA and Europe) still driving the industry? And/or, is some nebulous (or real) cultural difference discouraging software innovation abroad?   * Or are those of us in the West simply ignorant of real software innovation going on in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, etc.?   * When, if ever, might the centers of innovation move out of the West? Your experiences and opinions welcome, thanks!
