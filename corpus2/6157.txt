When creating a notebook with images, like photos, the file tends to quickly get big, which makes it difficult to use the notebook format for training material containing a lot of images. Are there different ways of passing an image into a notebook, in what concerns memory used? (please note that the purpose is to show the images in the “middle” of other content, like text, etc, and not simply have the image information in some kind of abstract code) I've noticed that every time I copy an image to a notebook, its `FullForm` reveals that it is "stored" with an "exhaustive" description of each pixel color value(s).   * Is there a way of storing it with indexed color definition (like the GIF format)?   * Is there a way of storing it with some kind of compression (like JPG or similar)? **EDIT:** Meanwhile I discovered the following curiosity: if I `Import` a gif file (of my printscreen), and then save it, my file gets to 150 kb. If I save it again (without changing anything), it gets reduced to 32 kb. If instead of `Import`ing it, I just copy it from the clipboard to the notebook, it always keeps the 150 kb.
