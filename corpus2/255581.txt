Consider a micro service infrastructure in which each service is responsible for one set of activities, and exposes a RESTful interface to its functionality. For example, assume a chat application. We might have one service which is responsible for creating users, and a second service that is responsible for creating messages. Now, we want to create a public-facing REST interface to the application. Are there any best practices for creating this public facade to the micro services? I'm interested in a couple of things, mainly:   1. Which layer should handle authentication/authorization (if the underlying services - do they share this data or each implement their own auth)   2. Clearly in this application messages are sent from users to users. However the message service can easily be written in such a way to be usable for anything. Should the public proxy be the one to determine the user information and then delegate to a message service?
