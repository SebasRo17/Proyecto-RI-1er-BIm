I'm only 13 but i'm genuinely interested in CS and would really like it if I could actually accomplish it. I've read books on C++ and C#, but ALL of them are the same!! They all say "Ok so since you have no prior knowledge in this what so ever, write a snippet that will do this and then make a GUI and then throw it into the Priafdhsu hfad then add the program and then program your own compiler to do some stuff". It's really getting annoying. I've payed near $40 (via Paypal) on ebooks that supposedly taught people to program with no prior knowledge. ALL OF THEM EXPECT ME TO ALREADY KNOW THE LANGUAGE. Is there something that I'm missing or am I suppose to be born with the property of CS? I would very much appreciate it if someone could explain this to me or possibly refer me to a tutorial on Programming Theory that starts from below ground zero as I have know knowledge in CS at all.
