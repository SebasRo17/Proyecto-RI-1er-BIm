Basically, I want to learn lots of programming languages to become a great programmer. I know only a handful to depth and **I was hoping someone could elaborate on how many _classes_ or _types_ of programming languages there are**. Like how you would lump them together if you had to learn them in groups. Coming from a Java background, I'm familiar with static typing, but I know that in addition to dynamic typing there has to be such variety in available languages that I would love to see a categorical breakdown if possible.
