I'm participating in my first hackathon soon. I have a great idea that has been rolling around in my head for a while, and if it takes off I'd obviously like to have my name on it/make some money on it. Is a hackathon a good place to present a project I'm serious about? How will the ownership work? I think I could get the project functional over the weekend of the event, but I'd definitely want to develop it further after. I'd like to be cited with the concept, but people who work with me on it would obviously be partial owners (or whatever would be considered fair). My main goal is for this project to get off the ground, but I also don't want to be left out if it ends up making money.
