Many web sites mostly only do CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations to the database for different URLs. Suppose that we have a 3-tier solution with the database server on a dedicated server and the web server on another server. This question is not about the database server, but the web server. The web server use dynamic content so it execute some code for every request and is communicating with the database server. What should be the limitations of the web server if the web applications aren't computation-heavy under heavy load? Shouldn't the web application be limited of the speed of the database server? or is it limited by the amount of memory? With the speed of CPUs today I don't think that the web servers CPU speed is the limitation. For static content web servers like Nginx and Lighttpd the web server almost always use very little memory and are limited by the disk-IO speed. But how is it for dynamic content?
