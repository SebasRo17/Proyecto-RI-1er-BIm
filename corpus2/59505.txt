Maybe this is something very simple to some of you. Anyway, I think this can be useful to many others like me. I would like to build an output that involves strings, unevaluated expressions and evaluated expressions/values —something like this: > The value for $C_\mathrm{p}$ is $1.5$ and the value for $\delta^*$ is > $0.123$. where _1.5_ and _0.123_ are the result of evaluating respective expressions. This is what I tried:               Cp = 1.5; deltastar = 0.123;     HoldForm["The value for " HoldForm[Subscript[C, p]] " is " Evaluate[        Cp] " and the value for " HoldForm[        Superscript[\[Delta], "*"]] " is " Evaluate[deltastar] "."]      With this result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2FU3f.png) The outer `HoldForm` is necessary to maintain the order of the _pieces_ , that are actually considered by Mathematica as being multiplied. For instance, this piece of code:               Cp = 1.5; deltastar = 0.123;     "The value for " HoldForm[Subscript[C, p]] " is " Evaluate[        Cp] " and the value for " HoldForm[        Superscript[\[Delta], "*"]] " is " Evaluate[deltastar] "."      yields to this output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/npCJV.png) Using `ToString` is not an option when there are superscripts and subscripts, as it is the case (I mean, the raw string output is awful). And because of that, I can't use string concatenation , which would be the most natural approach to me. There should be an easy way to do this in Mathematica, shouldn't there? As I said, I guess there _actually_ is a simple solution for this —that is, **properly building an output text or message that involves strings, unevaluated expressions and evaluated expressions.** Could you help me, please?
