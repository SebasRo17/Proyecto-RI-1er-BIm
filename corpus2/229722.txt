I want to fork an existing open source project to implement a certain major feature based on a research project. I am not sure yet if the changes will end up being open or closed source (the original project is BSD licensed). The point is that I can provide the code for the new feature, but it would take me quite some time to dive into the project and design the interface between the existing application and my new feature. So it would be cool to have a programmer who knows the project already. The question is now if I should just ask among the current developers (dev mailing list) if one of them would be willing to implement the fork (on a paid basis). Is this a generally accepted practice in the open source community? Do you know case histories / examples? (Where has it been known to happen? Where was it known to be refused, and why?)
