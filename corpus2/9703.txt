I would like to make colored scatter plots where the dots are connected by lines. I have tried the following, using `Joined->True` to connect the dots and `Mesh->Full` to actually show the dots. I have tried using both `PlotStyle` and `MeshStyle` to color the lines and dots, respectively:               data1 = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}};     data2 = {{0, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}};     data3 = {{0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5}};          ListPlot[{data1, data2, data3}, PlotRange -> All, Joined -> True,       Mesh -> Full, PlotStyle -> {Red, Green, Blue}, MeshStyle -> {Red, Green, Blue}]      which gives ![ListPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6qaEZ.gif) Why are _all_ of the dots blue? I would like their colors to match those of the lines (`data1` should be red, `data2` should be green, and `data3` should be blue). Is this possible? Thank you!
