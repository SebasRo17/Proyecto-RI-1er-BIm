C is the best language (or maybe the single language) suitable for operating systems, drivers, embedded systems etc. For more complex domains like computer graphics C++ is a better choice. But these applications have thorough performance requirements and they are only feasible to be built in C/C++. Now the question is, if the performance requirements can be achieved in another language, are there any technical reasons to choose C/C++?
