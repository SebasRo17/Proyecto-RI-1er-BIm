Assume we have a multi-dimensional recurrence, e.g. $\qquad\begin{align*} a_1 &= (1,2) \\ a_n &= (1,2) + a_{n-1} \quad, n>1 \end{align*}$ with the easy solution $a_n = (n,2n)$. How can I solve such recurrences in Mathematica? The expression               RSolve[{a[1] == {1, 2}, a[n] == {1, 2} + a[n - 1]}, a[n], n]      evaluates to               {}      in Mathematica 9.0.0.0. Naturally,               RSolve[{       a1[1] == 1, a1[n] == 1 + a1[n - 1],        a2[1] == 2, a2[n] == 2 + a2[n - 1]     }, {a1[n], a2[n]}, n]      works, but this strikes me as inconvenient. Given that the translation is this immediate (provided all occurring lists have the same length) I suspect there might be a way to do it without boilerplate.
