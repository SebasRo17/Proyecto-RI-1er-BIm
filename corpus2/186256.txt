![word extraction illustration](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eDsJK.png) ## My Situation I need to develop an application which does crowd-sourced Image-To-Text service (just like google's reCaptcha). So I need an OCR API which can find words in an image with some text. ## My Research   * I have gone through JavaOCR Library.    * Also Tessaract (which is not implemented in Java & Tess4J Wrapper doesn't have anything I'm looking for). So basically I have nowhere to go, so I need help. ## What I want   * Is there any API (preferably in Java) that does exactly as I have shown in the image above?   * If no such API exists, is there any EXACT algorithms suitable for this process?   * If not, what's your suggestion to achieve this? Note: I don't want another just image-to-text APIs. I need an API which finds WORD LOCATIONS in the input image.
