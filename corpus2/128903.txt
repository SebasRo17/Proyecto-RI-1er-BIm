I am not sure if it's a good idea or not to mention commercial software projects. Right now, I have one desktop software site selling (not enough to support myself yet) and I am not sure what is a good way to use it as a way to convey my skills and experience? Speaking of experience, I've never had a developer job. I've worked by myself developing applications with intention to sell, and one one hand I feel like if I mention this, I might come across as someone who is not serious about getting a developer job, which is not true, my mind is set on getting a developer job. Should I say I gave up the project to look for a job? Or does this appear weak? I just don't know how to tie up my involvement in self started software projects in an interview situation in a relevant manner.
