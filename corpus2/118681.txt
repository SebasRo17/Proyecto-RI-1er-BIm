I am looking for an information system which has the following features:   * upload files and add custom properties depending on file type (e.g., author, composer, painter, singer);   * support for sructured properties (e.g., `painter` is not just a string, it is an object with own properties: firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, placeOfBirth, etc.);   * describe third-party files (given their URLs);   * version control of descriptions;   * search for files and other objects by their properties;   * edit descriptions of files created by others (ability to edit depends on one's reputation, as on StackExchange);   * voting on files (influences reputation), flagging them. I was thinking about implementing it myself using Semantic Web technologies, but still can't believe that there is no very similar system. If there is no such a system, are there any components that I could reuse? If it does matter, I prefer Python, but most software in Semantic Web world is written in Java, so I resigned to the fact that I will have to write some code in Java.
