I made a documented which is to describe the difference between the same logical structure from different version ( e.g Structure A from version 8 and Structure A from version 9 ). Luckily I've got the logical structure diagram from the 2 functional specification. I've managed to copy the image of each logical structure and paste them in MS Word and compare the 2 version side by side. I don't know if there is a standard way to illustrate the difference. I simply draw a cross over the removed logical member from the previous version and draw a rectangle around the new logical member of the next version. I know my way is kinda childish. I am wondering how to present them professionally. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UpGFG.png) In addition, You won't believe this, but MS Word doesn't have a shape of CROSS, so I am actually using a multiplication sign that look like a giant monster: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h5Lim.png) This is why I hate myself. Unlike 2 separated lines, this shape is easy to use, draw and resize. I am wondering if MS Word would care about a normal cross.
