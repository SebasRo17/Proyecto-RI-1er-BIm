I need to get the expression tree for some expression.               expr //TreeForm      The above grabs the expression tree but it isn't in some sort of usable format. Just an image.               Level[expr, {-1}, "Heads"->True]      This does a depth first traversal of the expression tree and does give me a list of all items in the expression tree. The issue with this is that:               expr = a+b*3*c+d     Level[expr, {-1}, "Heads"->True]     {Plus, a, Times, 3, b, c, d}      and now you can see that because of the location of d I have no information on what goes where with Levels. So the question is, is there a way for me to get the expression tree in some format where I can actually tell where everything is supposed to go? Acceptable formats would be of the form of {operator/operatorFunctionName, symbol/value, {operator/operatorFunctionName, symbol/value, {... continues as far as can go}}, moreSymbolsRelatedToFirstOperation} OR {operator/operatorFunctionName, operator/operatorFunctionName, ...} {{symbol/valueForFirstOperator, ...}, {symbol/valueForSecondOperator,...}, ...} OR any other similar format.
