I've been reading about D and Go and how they aim at being compiled to machine code yet be convenient (like garbage collection, no need to manipulate pointers unless needed) and I agree that there is a need for such a language. However designers of both Go and D for some reason decided to invent a new language. Why? Why not take existing language which is popular, proven to be productive but is not compiled to native code like C#? What are technological reasons for that? Would it be hard to implement garbage collection (D does), linq or something entirely else?
