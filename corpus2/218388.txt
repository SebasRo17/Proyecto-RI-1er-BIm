I am a software engineer at a medium sized company. We have a fairly robust testing platform running on TeamCity. It does unit tests on every checkin, and a daily unit test/BVT run. The problem is - we have a great deal of broken unit tests. Quite often, I bring up the pointlessness of unit tests if they are constantly breaking and unmaintained. Being unable to see if a change has caused a regression removes most of the value of a unit testing platform. I would like to get a seed planted that will create a culture of good habits - fixing tests when they're broken, seeing them as valuable, prioritizing the fixing of tests along with other work. I've tried bribery (baked goods!), just plain asking, and speaking to team leads. Everyone says that it's a good idea, but I see to be the only one doing anything about it. What is the best way to get started on encouraging others to fix their tests, and prioritize test fixing within their sprints? If there is a less subjective way to ask this, I would be happy to accept any tips.
