I have just started my C++ lecture class. And the teacher has given us the following assignment. > Write a program that determines whether a number is even or odd. The logic I would use for the program is.   1. Get input `a`.   2. Store `a % 2` as `b`.   3. If `b` is 0, then `a` is even, else `a` is odd. The catch though, is that we have to write the program without the use of a `if-else` statement. I have been thinking on how to approach the problem for the past few hours, but I have no clue what to do. Any hints or suggestions?
