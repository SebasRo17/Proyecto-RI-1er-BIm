I have a DevelopmentConsole class. I am making functionality to register console commands for the subsystems. I don't want the console to know about them but also I don't want them to contain a debug code (like "Console.RegisterCommand..."). I think I should make an additional class hiearachy. For an example I have Player class.               IConsoleBuilder {          RegisterCommand(string command, Func<string[], string> action);      }          PlayerConsoleBuilderClient : ConsoleBuilderClient {          readonly Player _player =  ?inject?              public override void Visit(IConsoleBuilder builder) {              // builder.RegisterCommand("GetName", args => _player.Name) ;          }     }      Here I need to use Reflection to find all ConsoleBuilderClient subclasses. It's not a very good idea, is it? Can you suggest how to do it in a better way?
