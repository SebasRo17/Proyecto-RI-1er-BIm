The functions `SetProperty` and `PropertyValue` can only set a single property of a single vertex, as far as I know. How do I set a property for multiple vertices simultaneously? In the documentation, they recommend using `Do` to set multiple properties, but I've heard that `Do` is not the most efficient way to do things in _Mathematica_. Are there any alternatives? **EDIT :** The only approach seems to make several calls to `SetProperty` or `PropertyValue` (which is faster), one call for each distinct vertex property I want to set. From the answers so far it seems that there is no Mathematica equivalent to `SetProperty` or `PropertyValue` that sets several properties of distinct vertices at once. But I'd still hope that something could be done directly on the `Graph` object, bypassing `SetProperty` and `PropertyValue`.
