I'm using the following to label a MatrixPlot: `FrameTicks -> {{yticks, None}, {None, xticks}},` I'm labeling these ticks with text. It is impossible to get the graph to a reasonable size while maintaining legibility of the text all on a single axis. So what I'm attempting to do is sub-divide my label list, alternating the label that goes to one of two tick expressions: `FrameTicks -> {{leftyticks, rightyticks}, {None, xticks}},` But I have no idea how to do that. As of right now I am sorting the labels alternatively by hand and pasting them in to 'leftyticks' and 'rightyticks'. There has got to be a faster way to drag a list from a file, split it in alternating sequence, and dump the products in to the two tick-label groups, right?
