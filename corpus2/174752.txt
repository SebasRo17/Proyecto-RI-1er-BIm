Currently I am working in a company as a manager (software dev). But I only have 6.8 yrs experience. I joined this company as a software engineer and got promoted to SSE, Lead, and Manager. Some of my team members have better experience than I, and I feel like I need to have more exposure/experience to take these roles. I feel like it is better to be an individual contributor and learn many things for another couple of years and become a Principal Software Engineer, rather than getting involved in management. Options I have:   1. Ask my current employer to make me an individual contributor?   2. Find a new company and join as an SSE to start over?   3. Find a new company for a lead position?  Please advise.
