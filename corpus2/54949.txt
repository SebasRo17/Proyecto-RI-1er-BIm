If I attempt to simplify the sum `ArcTan[1/x] + ArcTan[x]` with               ArcTan[ Simplify[ TrigExpand[ Tan[ ArcTan[1/x] + ArcTan[x]]]]]      _Mathematica returns_ > >     During evaluation of In[103]:= Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0 > encountered. >> >   >     During evaluation of In[103]:= Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0 > encountered. >> >   >     During evaluation of In[103]:= Infinity::indet: Indeterminate expression   >                                     ComplexInfinity + ComplexInfinity > encountered. >> >   >     Indeterminate >   even though the result is $\pm\pi/2$. The error messages occur during the call to `TrigExpand`, and I can't think of a way to avoid them. Also, I tried in vain the assumption `x > 0`, so that the result is not ambiguous. The full expression to simplify is               (1/(16 a))Q^2 (-16 ArcTan[r1/a] + 1/(2 r1^2)(16 \[Pi] r1^2 + 32 r1 a     + \[Pi] a^2 + 8 \[Pi] r1^2 Log[r1] + 4 ArcTan[a/r1] (7 a^2 - 8 r1^2 Log[r1])     - 2 ArcTan[r1/(2 a) - a/(2 r1)] (a^2 + 8 r1^2 Log[r1])))      I know that the `Log`s vanish after simplification and I was trying to prove this with Mathematica. It is possible if I split the expression into several parts, then simplify with the transformation rule for the addition of `ArcTan`, because none of the other methods work in this case, but the transformation rule aborts when it meets an infinite expression.
