I'm researching engineering approaches to software development based on the type of software, for example:   * Custom one-off software (e.g. space shuttle software)   * Whitebox application requiring customised (e.g. Apache Ofbiz ERP - source code is usually downloaded and customized for each implementation)   * Blackbox application without extension points    * Blackbox application with extension points for customisation (e.g. MS Word, SAP)   * ... Is there an established taxonomy of different types of software based on how the software is implemented?
