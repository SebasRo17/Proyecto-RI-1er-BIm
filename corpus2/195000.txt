As an educational exercise, I am looking to implement a constraint solver from scratch. However, since the field is entirely new to me, I am at a loss of where to begin with background research. The problems I aim to address are mostly sets of inequalities, such as `a < b && b < c`, where `a`, `b`, `c` are integers. (While it is possibly not relevant to the question at this stage, I do aim to address problems with other numeric types later on). The algorithms I have looked at so far are in the _branch-and-bound_ and _branch-and-cut_ categories mostly. However, if I am looking for a generic, efficient algorithm, is this what I want to be looking at? It would be very helpful to receive some guidelines here.
