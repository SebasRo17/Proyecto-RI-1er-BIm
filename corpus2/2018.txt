With the following `Dynamic` cell, I can reproducibly crash Mathematica, so do not try this unless you have saved all your work!               l=1;     Dynamic[Sin[l = l + 1]]      This will harmlessly run forever, or **until** you try to _right-click_ on the dynamic output (to get the context menu and perhaps to copy the current value). When you right-click on it, Mathematica crashes. Is there a simple way to avoid or catch this error before it occurs? **Edit** I also see this crash when literally using the example from the documentation for `Dynamic` (under "Applications"):               {Trigger[Dynamic[x, (a = FractionalPart[#]; x = Round[#]) &], {0,         Infinity}],       Dynamic[{Quotient[x, 60], Mod[x, 60], SetPrecision[10 a, 2]}]}      and again trying to right-click. So it's not like I'm doing something outlandish here. **Edit 2** The link Szabolcs found does indeed answer my question:               EventHandler[Dynamic[Sin[l = l + 1]], {"MouseUp", 2} :> Null]      seems to prevent the crash.
