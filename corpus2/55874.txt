Dataset's documentation shows how to leverage GroupBy operator at multiple levels               titanic = ExampleData[{"Dataset", "Titanic"}];          titanic[GroupBy[Key["sex"]], GroupBy[Key["class"]], ratio, "survived"]      Taking a step further, can generate summary graphics in one line:               titanic[GroupBy[Key["sex"]], GroupBy[Key["class"]],       Counts /*        KeySort /* (PieChart[#, SectorOrigin -> {Automatic, 1},           ChartLegends -> Automatic] &), "survived"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p3Gmi.png) KeySort insures uniform color assignment to `True` and `False`; without it, some charts will have inverted colors. Since all charts share the same interpretation, the 6 ChartLegends are redundant. Is there an option for a single legend to appear, outside the frame of the Dataset? Wouldn't it be great if the various Chart functions returned associations like `<|"chart"->Graphics[...], "legend"->Graphics[...] |>` that can be more easily processed. Also, `BarChart[#, ChartLegends->Automatic]` inside Dataset doesn't work, but adding manual values, eg ChartLegends->{"T","F"} works.
