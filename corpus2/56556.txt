I expect to have a chimney-look plot out of the function `z = 1/(x^2 + y^2)`, but what I got is a broken one. Is there a way to get an intact plot from `ContourPlot3D` without any fragment loss?               ContourPlot3D[      1/(x^2 + y^2) - z == 0, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -150, 150}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XMys7.gif)
