In Android, final strings are stored in a `strings.xml` file, which makes it easy to update text, reuse strings and to translate an app to a different locale -- because everything is in one place. However, in all the examples that I have seen of desktop applications all the strings have been hardcoded into each class. Is hardcoding strings into files standard practice for desktop applications? Or is there a better way to do this?
