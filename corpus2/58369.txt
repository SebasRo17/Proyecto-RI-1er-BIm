I want to export a simple animation as GIF. I had a look at here but could not understand what was being described. Any help would be appreciated. For instance, how do I export the following animation as an GIF.               u[x_, t_] = -(1/2) Cos[x - t]^2 + 1;          Animate[Plot[u[x, t],{x, -10, 10},PlotRange->{0, 1.5},PlotStyle->{Red, Thickness[0.005]}],{t, 0, 10, 0.02}]      Thanks, Radz.
