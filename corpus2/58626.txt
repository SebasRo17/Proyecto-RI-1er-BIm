In my code:               summand[k_, x_] := (0.25*x*mu)^k/(k!*Pochhammer[(m + 1)/2, k])*                        Hypergeometric1F1[(m + 1)/2, (m + 1)/2 + k, eta];          cumdistfunc[x_] := 1 - 0.5^(m (m + 1)) Exp[-eta] Exp[Tr[kappa x]] Sum[summand[k, x], {k, 0, 20}]      I have that the summand function ought to be able to be evaluated at `0` so that the value of my cumulative distribution function at `0` is actually `0`. Do you know how I could do that? Thank you so much!
