Here we are in 2010, software engineers with 4 or 5 years or experience, still designing tables with 96 fracking columns. I told him it's gonna be a nightmare.   I showed him that we have to use ordinals to interface MySQL with C#.   I explained that tables with more columns than rows are a huge smell. Still, I get the "It's going to be simpler this way". What should I do? EDIT * This table contains data from sensors.   We have sensor 1 with   Dynamic_D1X   Dynamic_D1Y   [...] Dynamic_D6X   Dynamic_D6Y   [...] EDIT2 * Well, I finally left that job. It is a sign when the other programmer goes dark for months at the time, it is another sign when management does not realise this is a problem
