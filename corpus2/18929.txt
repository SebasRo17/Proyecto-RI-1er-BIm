I want to find the Euclidean distance between one point (x1) and a list of points (y1), which contains a lot of coordinates               x1 = killer[[2]]      > {6.05102, 5.87667}               y1 = victim[[2 ;;]]      > {{1.40687, 4.92494}, {0.419206, 1.70406}, {6.29657,0.577941}, {4.12022, > 4.94952},   >  {2.04784, 5.94545}, {1.29192,1.43152}, {3.26737, 1.90134}, {4.27274, > 0.528028},   >  {2.79659,1.37788}, {5.43955, 1.81355}} Is it possible for me to find the `EuclideanDistance` between x1 and y1, where it will show all results between x1 and each elements in y1.
