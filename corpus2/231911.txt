I'm trying to find something that will allow a web application to analyze the line or microphone input from a client and transmit that data to the server. I've looked briefly at WebRTC and, although I find it to be the most compelling answer 'future-wise', it is (at the time of writing) far from being complete and/or standardized as a protocol. This would be my first web application that would require such functionality. Ideally, part of the sound signal processing could be handled by client-side code to reduce the impact of device latency (say, the time it takes for a sound to travel from instrument to computer, go through digital-to-analog conversion, and then be sent to the app) and internet 'lag'. The signal would, at some point, need to make it back to the server for analysis. It might be a bit high-concept, but perhaps there is a way using an existing plugin - I just thought I would turn to some folks who have spent more time in this realm than I have. Thanks in advance for your time.
