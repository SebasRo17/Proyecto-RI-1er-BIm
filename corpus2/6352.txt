Google has led many useful Java features (guava, gson); now that Oracle has purchased Sun, will it affect its future enhancements and utilization as a development language? What exactly, or even approximately, are the legal ramifications? I thought Java was open source and would therefore remain unaffected ... ? Should Google just buy Oracle to get rid of the whole mess, that would be cool wouldn't it ? Do you think this is the beginning of the end for Java as a widely used language ? Its continued success as an open source/free technology is now doubtful?
