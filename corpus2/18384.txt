I essentially have two questions, both are related. 1) How do I change a value within a list of lists (I provided a example problem)? 2) Why does my code not work? I have a list which was created from the Tally function on a text file. The result is shown below...               tally = {{"tree", 5}, {"State", 6}, {"swimming", 3}, {"began",      2}, {"season", 8}, {"Force", 2}, {"Sooners", 10}, {"three",      4}, {"second", 14}, {"medley", 6}, {"relay", 17}, {"junior",      5}, {"sophomore", 3}, {"freshman", 5}, {"coach", 2}, {"Pratt",      2}, {"think", 2}, {"close", 2}, {"thought", 2}, {"events",      8}, {"finished", 9}, {"individual", 4}, {"collected",      4}, {"honors", 4}, {"along", 2}, {"third", 13}, {"showing",      4}, {"swept", 2}, {"first", 5}, {"Junior", 2}, {"star",      22}, {"freestyle", 4}, {"runner", 2}, {"Sooner", 2}, {"scored",      2}, {"respectively", 2}, {"finishes", 4}, {"Sophomore",      2}, {"opening", 3}, {"finish", 2}, {"lifetime", 2}, {"times",      2}, {"posted", 3}, {"marks", 2}, {"Championships",      3}, {"conference", 2}, {"recorded", 2}, {"vital", 2}, {"relays",      4}, {"school", 3}, {"records", 2}, {"earned", 3}, {"fourth",      3}, {"campaign", 2}, {"against", 5}, {"Northern", 6}, {"Colorado",      5}, {"helped", 2}, {"Arizona", 2}, {"Idaho", 2}, {"named",      2}, {"Academic", 2}, {"backstroke", 2}, {"fifth", 3}, {"regular",      2}, {"winning", 2}, {"victorious", 2}, {"sixth", 2}, {"RioRancho",      4}, {"School", 2}};      I want to be able to find the string "star" within the list and change the associated number with that string to 1000. I tried using the following code:               tally /. _?Last@(First@# == "star" &) -> 1000      It does not work the way I want. The number value associated with "star" remains unchanged. I know there is a way to do this. I just can't see it... Thank you for any assistance!
