Here is what the apple site says: > With Snow Leopard, Mac OS X makes it easy to use scripting languages as full > application development tools. Snow Leopard ships with support for the > RubyCocoa Bridge and the PyObjC bridge. These two bridges give developers > access not only to system APIs, but to Cocoa frameworks such as AppKit and > Core Data, enabling you to build fully native Mac OS X applications in Ruby > or Python. The RubyCocoa and PyObjC bridges allow you to freely mix code > written in Objective-C with code written in the scripting language. You can > quickly build prototypes and then optimise by implementing performance- > critical pieces in Objective-C. How could Python help in this case?
