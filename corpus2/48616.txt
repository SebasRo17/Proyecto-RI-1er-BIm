**Why I Ask this Question:** I've just starting to learn Ruby (and by extension IronRuby since I work in the Microsoft world). I picked up IronRuby Unleased to teach me the basic syntax of Ruby, and any particulars of IronRuby. However, learning the syntax is not my primary goal (if that was, I would just obtain The Ruby Programming Language, which I might get eventually anyway). I say this because I could learn the syntax, but still write programs in a non-Ruby way. Such as:   1. Forcing heavy-handed DI via DI frameworks *****   2. Using Ruby to write mostly C, Java, or Perl type code To me, doing these things sounds the effective equivalent of writing procedural code in Java, or learning the syntax of F#, but writing programs as if the language were C#. **Therefore** , my main goal is to learn to program, to think, in the way that embodies Ruby's:   1. Language idioms   2. Dynamic style   3. Tried-and-true principles and patterns of the community * * * *Response #28 to the link above (Forcing heavy-handed DI via DI frameworks), asks a similar question to the one I post here. The blog's author suggested reading Jim Weirich's code and perhaps Rails. I'm looking for additional suggestions.
