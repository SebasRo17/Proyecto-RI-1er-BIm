I have a list, obtained after differentiating a list of expressions, which contains zeros and symbols, say:               A = {x1^2, x2^2, x3^2, x4^2}     D[A,x3]      results in the list:               {0, 0, 2 x3, 0}      How do I get the position of the non-zero entry, mathematica cannot compare symbols to zero directly. I could convert the elements of the list to strings but is there a faster way?
