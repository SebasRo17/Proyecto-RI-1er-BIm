This is more of a style question, but it is something I am currently pondering for a project of mine. Assume that you're creating an application which is modeling a school. So there are entities like Student, School, etc. Now this is all fine and intuitive until you get down to Class, as (in most languages) `Class` is a reserved word. So, given that `Class` is a reserved keyword, what would you call such an entity that models a school class?
