It seems to me that googling has become an integral part of software development. I spend about as much time googling for an answer and copying code from blogs and examples, as writing new code myself. Are there any best practices for google? Examples off the top of my head:   * use trusted sites for answers, i.e stackoverflow, API project page   * read the comments for blogs listing code snippets   * understand and test code copied from blogs   * when in doubt, google for a solution first before coming up with a new one anymore?
