I was creating a language and discovered that my language tokenizer would have to change depending where in the parse it is. I.e. `abc[1]` would be parsed as 4 tokens (`abc`, `[`, `1`, `]`), where as `{ abc[1] }` would be parsed as 3 (`{`, `abc[1]`, `}`). Is a grammar that would change its tokenizer mid parse defined somewhere? Does a grammar even define such a thing or is it irrelevant to the grammar and is just not really done on a parser level?
