I hope this doesnt get perceived as ambiguous or too vague, but i'm attempting to make a service that monitors twitter and archives tweets. Apart from PHP cron jobs i cant think of any way to detect if there has been a new tweet posted? I'm not too fussed about what programming language i have to write it in, or what framework i have to work in. Also whether its desktop or web based. What route would everyone go down for this? Thanks
