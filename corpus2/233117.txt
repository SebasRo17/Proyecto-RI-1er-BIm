I have a singleton object. It's a DAO that looks somewhat like this (pseudoish code):               class UsersDAO {       public usersDAO init(string sDSN){         variables.sDSN = sDSN;              return this;       }            public array getUsers(){         //do a query to get users, make into array              return aUsers;       }     }      my applications makes an instance of this and uses it throughout the codebase, but I also have another DAO that requires it:               class OrganisationsDAO {       public OrganisationsDAO init(UsersDAO oUsersDAO,string sDSN){          variables.sDSN = sDSN;          variables.oUsersDAO = oUsersDAO;               return this;       }            public array getUsersOrganisations(){         variables.aUsers = variables.oUsersDAO.getUsers();              //getOrganisations for the returned users              return aOrganisations;       }     }      so to make the OrganisationsDAO object I need to pass it the UsersDAO. At a later point in my applications life, I need to update the UsersDAO to include a `public user getUser(int userid)` function. I'm wondering, is there a way of passing through the new UsersDAO to objects that depend on it, without having to restart the application. In this instance the application is a website rather than a desktop based application.
