I graduated 8 years ago and did a discrete mathematics course in my 2nd year, but I've been told that I'll likely be asked discrete maths questions in an upcoming interview. Is there a simple webpage/document that I can use to refresh my memory? I understood the concepts when I took the course 10 odd years ago, but my memory is a bit rusty and I'd like to just refresh it.
