I am new to openGL C++ and what I wanted to know is if there was a pre- existing function in the OpenGL library that would allow me to import a 3d or 2d model? For example, if I make a 3d image using photoshop, or a 3d model using 3ds max could I use a library in openGL example (not real function): glUse3dimage(3dmodel); ? Or would importing images be more difficult and I would have to make my own function? I am not really a good programmer so I wanted to see how difficult this would be. Another question I had was if this was difficult would this be easier using openGL with another language? For example openTK with C#?
