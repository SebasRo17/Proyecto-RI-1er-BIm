I'm working with another programmer and we are always having issues with refactoring or changing each others code. Recently I had to fix a bug, but I pushed the changes before notifying him. He was very upset about it. Should I have talked to him about it before the push? This is a hobby project btw. What is the best way to change other peoples code when we don't have a project manager or coding standard?
