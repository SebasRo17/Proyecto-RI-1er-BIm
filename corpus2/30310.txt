Sometimes one may want to execute a notebook via the command line (for example to run it remotely). As far as I know it's not possible to run notebooks directly, but `.m` files can be executed, typically with code like               math -noprompt -run "<<file.m"      So one needs to convert `.nb` to `.m`. One way to do this is to save the `.nb` as a Mathematica package and then to convert all cells to initialization cells. However, this conversion handles some of the typography (e.g. subscripts) improperly. Is there a less error-prone way to do this? * * * Edit: Examples for things that don't convert: Subscript part notation (`Ctrl+_+[[part]]`) The corresponding `FullForm` is `Part[list,n]`, the converted expression is `Subscript[list, [[n]]]`.
