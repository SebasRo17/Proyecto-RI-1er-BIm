say I have an EntityManager that can `read(PK)` a dataset from the DB and return it. I have an application that will process multiple records, iterate over them and for each, use the EntityManager to read each record. Therefore it would be nice to inform that EntityManager about the coming workload so it is able to preload the necessary data more efficiently. How would you integrate such optional hints into a clean, SoC OO-Design? Thanks alot
