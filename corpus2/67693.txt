I am creating use cases for my web application and I was wondering if a representation of the DB should be listed as an actor. For example a user can check his profile and edit it (assuming that he is logged in). The two use cases would be:   \- User can view his profile   \- User can edit his profile   Would the use cases then be for example:   Actor: User, DB   Use case: View profile   Or can I leave out the DB as an actor? Unfortunately I haven't found any consistent way of drawing the use cases.
