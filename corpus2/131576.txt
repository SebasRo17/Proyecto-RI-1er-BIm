Recently at work there have been increased focus on completion rate and load on the developers in our sprints. With **completion rate** I mean, if we plan 20 user stories for a sprint, what percentage of these user stories are closed at the end of the sprint. And with **load** I mean, if we have a sprint with 3 developers of 60 hours each, i.e. 180 hours for the sprint, how many hours worth of user stories do we schedule for the sprint. So I am really interested in others experience with this, I guess this is something everybody working with scrum deals with. My question is, what completion rate and load are expected/usual, and how are your team doing with respect to these parameters?
