I need to have time differentials to look like the 'textbook'. My code is               Dt[x y^2] /. {Dt[x] -> dx/dt, Dt[y] -> dy/dt}       which gives the output               (2 dy x y)/dt + (dx y^2)/dt.       This is very hard to follow. My question is how can the output be made to look like               2 x y dy/dt + y^2  dx/dt       (only with `dy/dt` and `dx/dt` vertical). Thanks.
