I realize this sounds silly. Let me explain: I just came across this page about using CSS elements to create shapes- square, circle, triangle, star, yin-yang (yin-yang!), etc. using pseudo elements. Having struggled with HTML5 Canvas drawing in the past, I immediately thought that some combination of JavaScript and CSS pseudo-elements should be able to draw just about anything. So I first googled "CSS Fractals". No dice. Then "JS Fractals". Some dice, but not what I was looking for. Am I crazy, or is there potential here? jQuery can add and remove elements from the DOM by the thousands all day long. It seems to me that--given the existence of triangles via pure CSS--there is potential for a nice drawing mechanism (2D and 3D) sans Canvas. Any thoughts, frameworks, tutorials, white papers, etc would be appreciated!
