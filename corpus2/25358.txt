I need to solve the system of equations, call it $S_1$, in the integers $$x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5 = y_1y_2y_3y_4y_5$$ $$x_1^k+x_2^k+\dots+x_5^k=y_1^k+y_2^k+\dots+y_5^k,\;\; k= 2,4,6$$ I used a very primitive code using _KSubsets_ [], _Table_ [], _Sort_ [], and _Do_ [], and with $x_i, y_i\le 50$ found one, $$2\cdot16\cdot25\cdot45\cdot48 =3\cdot9\cdot32\cdot40\cdot50$$ $$2^k+16^k+25^k+45^k+48^k = 3^k+9^k+32^k+40^k+50^k$$ Using this single example, I managed to find a parametrization, so $S_1$ has an infinite number of primitive solutions. However, I would like to find other small solutions to $S_1$, perhaps $x_i, y_i\le 300$, (which hopefully belongs to other families). Is there an efficient way to do it with _Mathematica_? The code I used takes forever if I extend the range > 50. :( P.S. The system $S_1$ leads to an $11$th degree identity, in case one is wondering why I am interested in it.
