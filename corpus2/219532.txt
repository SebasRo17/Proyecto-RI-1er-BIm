We've all faced this. You apply to a cool project and they ask you to send them a piece of your code. On the surface, this look OK and I am fine with it. But what shall I send them? My cool utility? Snapshot of structure in complex project? Something else? So far, I have tried to persuade them to have a desktop share via Skype and that I lead them through code and structure. But somehow clients do not like this approach. So I'd like to hear your thoughts.
