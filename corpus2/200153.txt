I'm adding copyright notices to all my source code files:               Copyright (C) 2013 My-First-Name My-Surname        1. But what if someone else is also named _My-First-Name My-Surname_? What does courts think about that? How would they know who is the real author? Is there something I can/should do about this situation? (So they'd know for sure)   2. What if I change my surname. Then, how do other people know that I'm still the copyright holder? Is there something I can/should do, to avoid trouble with copyright, after I've changed my name? **An example** of when the above could be of interest: Someone gets married and change his/her surname and moves to a new address. Then, even if s/he has submitted his/her source code to the U.S. Copyright Office, that was done using his/her old name and address. Now s/he however has a new name and address. But there is perhaps other people that have the old name (but not also the old address). (In my country, for any first + middle + surname, there are usually many people with that full name.) Apparently people think this is a weird question, but I've read about rather many very decisions made in courts, e.g. someone suing for hot coffee and winning millions of dollars.
