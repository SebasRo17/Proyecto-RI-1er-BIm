Typically when adding locators I would use a button i.e. something along the lines               DynamicModule[{pt={{0,0}}},         Column[{LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt],             Dynamic[                 Graphics[{Red,Point[pt]},PlotRange->{{-2,2},{-2,2}}]                 ]             ],         Button["Add locator",AppendTo[pt,{0,0}]]}]     ]      However, say I wanted to do the same, but within a manipulate and with a `SetterBar[]` (or `Slider[]` or `PopupMenu[]`). I have tried several approaches, but the best I have come up with is at best sketchy. The following code works, but you have to move a locator before a new one shows up (or goes away).               Clear[update]          update[list_, i_] :=If[Length[list] < i, Append[list, {0, 0}], Take[list, i]]<          Manipulate[         DynamicModule[             {pt={{0,0}}},             LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt,(pt=update[#,nrPts])&],                 Dynamic[                     Graphics[{Red,Point[pt]},PlotRange->{{-2,2},{-2,2}}]                 ]             ]         ],         {nrPts,{1,2,3,4},SetterBar}     ]      I have tried to place `Dynamic[]` in various places, but to no avail. Is there some way to use `SetterBar[]` and get as smooth results as with `Button[]`?
