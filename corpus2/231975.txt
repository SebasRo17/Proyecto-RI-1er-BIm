I have 4 years of experience in web development, so: PHP, javascript, Mysql, HTML, CSS, the usuals. I have an interview soon for a position involving c#, wpf and other desktop programming languages. Its a junior position, which I perceive as: someone willing to learn, junior to no knowledge and fast learner. I have very limited experience in c# and wpf but no knowledge of some other requirements. In the initial round of interviews which were conducted via video, so not face to face, I was honest, I told them I am keen to learn, but have limited and no experience in what they offer but I do have transferable skills. Surprisingly to me they offered a face to face interview considering how honest I was about I didn't atm meet much of the desired requirements. What would have lead them to offer me a face to face interview? How should I approach this interview without sounding to repetitive and begging whilst being honest but confident?
