I am trying to understand the linux kernel and there is one thing that is puzzling me for quite a while. As linux is used across variety of platforms (like smartphones,desktop,supercomputers etc) and also on various architectures, so does the same kernel code is used by all or a different one and also since it includes some assembly codes so it must be architecture specific. so do the developers in linux community apply patches to a single kernel or there are multiple versions of kernel each for different architecture and platforms?
