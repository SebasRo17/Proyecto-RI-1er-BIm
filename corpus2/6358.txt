### Description of problem I would like to use Mathematica to display the series obtained by substituting a value for $x$ in a Taylor series expansion. The terms of the series will be rational numbers, so they should be in their reduced forms. For example, consider the following partial sum:               In[1]:= taylor=Series[Log[1+x],{x,0,6}] // Normal     Out[1]= x-x^2/2+x^3/3-x^4/4+x^5/5-x^6/6      If I use `ReplaceAll` to carry out the substitution $x=1$, then I will get               In[2]:= taylor /. {x->1}     Out[2]= 37/60      as opposed to $1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6}$. * * * ### First attempt The first thing which comes to mind is the following:               In[3]:= HoldForm[Evaluate[taylor]] /. {x->1}     Out[3]= 1-1^2/2+1^3/3-1^4/4+1^5/5-1^6/6      Now I just need to replace each of the terms with its simplified versions. The first problem is that `Evaluate` only works on level 1, so the following code does not work.               In[4]:= Map[Evaluate,%,{2}]     Out[4]= Evaluate[1]+Evaluate[-(1^2/2)]+Evaluate[1^3/3]+Evaluate[-(1^4/4)]+Evaluate[1^5/5]+Evaluate[-(1^6/6)]      **Is there a way to carry out an evaluation deep inside`HoldForm`?** I also tried applying `Replace` at level 2, but the correct replacement rule still eludes me.               In[5]:= Replace[                HoldForm[Evaluate[taylor]] /. {x->1},                {x_->Evaluate[x]},                {2}]     Out[5]= 1-1^2/2+1^3/3-1^4/4+1^5/5-1^6/6      If I knew the appropriate replacements to carry out without peeking inside `HoldForm`, say `x_->0`, then the code above would work. **How can I carry out the idea behind`In[5]`?** * * * ### Second attempt If I am satisfied with just having a list of the terms, the following is certainly good enough:               In[6]:= List@@taylor/.{x->1}     Out[6]= {1,-(1/2),1/3,-(1/4),1/5,-(1/6)}      I can use `HoldForm` to prevent `Plus` from collapsing the series while retaining the pretty typesetting on the front end:               In[7]:= HoldForm[Plus[1,-(1/2),1/3,-(1/4),1/5,-(1/6)]]     Out[7]= 1+-(1/2)+1/3+-(1/4)+1/5+-(1/6)      So splicing the sequence portion of `Out[6]` into `HoldForm[Plus[...]]` is just what I need. My plan was to use the splicing trick with `Sequence`, but that does not work within `HoldForm`. For example,               In[8]:= HoldForm[Plus[Sequence[1,2]]]     Out[8]= +Sequence[1,2]      **Is there a way to splice`Out[6]` into `HoldForm[Plus[...]]`?**
