I am trying to build a single page web application that will call multiple web services (both SOAP and RESTful) and aggregate the data in the UI. Initially I though I could do it all client-side, with ajax requests, but I realize that   * If there are many requests, and they are fired per user, the data can take a long time to load.   * If there are a lot of users, then I can easily reach my limit of API calls. So now I'm thinking that I will have to have some kind of server-side process that runs every hour (or whatever), retrieves the items, and inserts/updates them in a database. Is this the right approach? Are there any other pitfalls I need to avoid?
