I understand the difference between the two, but I get questioned by my colleagues of the benefit of labeling requirements as functional or nonfunctional (or transitional). Why bother to do so? He spent what he said was two days going through a list of requirements for one project, and saw no benefit to it, because the end result was to submit the document to another business entity with the edict, "Do it all." What I fear is requirements lumped together in one document. I tried to explain the benefit in practical terms, but couldn't sell it. How do I sell the benefit of documenting which requirements are functional and which are nonfunctional.
