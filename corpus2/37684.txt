My code:               Plot3D[{(2*x*y)/(x^2 + y^2)}, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]      Output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BAZKH.png) And now I can export this to STL by using the export STL command, however, when I try to print this on the MakerBot 3D printer there is a problem because the width of the graph is too thin. I need to increase the thickness of the width of the graph, can I do this in Mathematica?
