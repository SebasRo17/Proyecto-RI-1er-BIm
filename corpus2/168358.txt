I'm writing a software for periodically checking a specific range of networked devices' reach-ability. I'm specifying the address range and the time frequency for checking their reachability, in an xml file. Which technique can I use to check that xml file during the start up of the program for any modifications done in either the range or the frequency and do the necessary update in specific database?
