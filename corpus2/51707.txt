For example, say I have a set of data which takes the form               list = {{1,2,4,5,3,2},{2,3,4,2,1,6},{2,3,4,5,4,3}}        where all of the elements have a length of 6. Then I have to run this `list` through many functions each with various restrictions e.g.:               ptOf[event_]:=px+py/;(px+py)<4,       where `px` is the first element in the 6 vector `{px,py,_,_,_,_}` and `py` is the second element. How would I cut the elements from the original list that do not satisfy this condition?
