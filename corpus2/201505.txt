I'm building a **perl** application which does the following operations:   1. Copy a bunch of files (class **fileFetcher** )   2. Parse each file (class **fileParser** )   3. Store some data from each file in a database (class **dbHelper** ) Now, should I, in my **main.pl** (entry point of the script), construct an instance of **each of these** and call the appropriate methods? or is it better practice to have a separate "Application" class that does all the instantiations and method calls, and let the main script just have a call like `Application.run(args)`? The class, would exist just to instantiate and call methods on things, and doesn't seem right.
