I want to call a DLL in my programming language of 'choice'. The documentation surrounding this clearly states that it must be a 32-bit DLL written in C, C++ or Delphi. _But I wanted to call a DLL written in C#._ It goes on to mention that the default calling mode is **cdecl**. So my question is: why would this be the case? Is there any way to make it _think_ a C# DLL was written in C, C++ or Delphi?
