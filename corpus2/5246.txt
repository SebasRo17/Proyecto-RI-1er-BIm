Is there a way to detect when a key is released, similar to               EventHandler[InputField[], {"KeyDown", "k"} :> Print["k pressed"]]      It seems such detection isn't available at first glance, perhaps it can be achieved some other way? Alternatively is there a way to detect which keys are currently pressed? I know that;               CurrentValue["ModifierKeys"]       Works for `shift`, `ctrl` and such, but I can't seem to figure out how to get a list of regular keys being pressed. Edit: `CurrentValue["EventKey"]` does not seem to work for this purpose as it only detects keydown events, thus you cannot do something like the following which detects shift-up               shiftDown = False;     Dynamic[     If[MemberQ[CurrentValue["ModifierKeys"], "Shift"], (shiftDown = True;),            If[shiftDown, (shiftDown = False; Print["Shift up code"])]         ]     ]      link to MathGroup post
