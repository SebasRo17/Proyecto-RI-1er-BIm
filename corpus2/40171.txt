I am going through some of the items in "Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica, Third Edition". An example of the style used by these authors is:               piriform[a_, b_][t_] := {a (1 + Sin[t]), b Cos[t] (1 + Sin[t])}          ParametricPlot[Evaluate[piriform[1, 1][t]], {t, 0, 2 Pi}, AspectRatio -> Automatic]      Can someone please explain why they use piriform[a_, b_][t_] as opposed to piriform[a_, b_, t_]? Is there some advantage to the authors' form over the latter form?
