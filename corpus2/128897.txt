I'm a first-year PhD student in Ireland. My background is in mathematics, though I'm going to stream my career into programming with Python, Java and C++ languages. I have some good experience with C++ what allowed me to have a presentation in Europe quite recently - I participated in an open-source cloud computing project. I used Python a little bit in this project, though mainly it was in C++. I was reading a beautiful "Thinking in Java" book this summer while looking for a PhD. I have no experience in Java. I learned some Python while writing a website based on Django. I love programming languages since my childhood - I started with Pascal and C. Since then I have not been programming all the time of course. I know some other auxiliary tools like Git, SVN, SQL, XML and javascript. I want to take my concentration in hands and remember design patterns by the way. Now... I have earned some money to have food for 2 years. I really want to find a job, but there is no interesting job on the market or my skills are not enough to get one. So I really want to learn Python and Java in parallel by reading books (have already chosen proper ones), searching google (got used to it) and most important writing code and thus I think to participate in an open-source project again. Could you please list me 2 or 3 projects in Python and/or Java which are currently active (vivid) and useful?
