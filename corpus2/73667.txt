I'm working on a game, and I'm hoping to distribute it through the Android and/or Apple stores. The big decision that I have to make: do I charge money for the game? Or do I put ads in it? I really hate advertising, so I'd prefer not to subject my users to it, but I'll do it if that's the only way to make money. I'd like to hear from anyone who has experience distributing mobile apps. Also, from regular users of the Apple and Android stores; how easy do they make it for you to drop $0.99 on something?
