I'm trying to make a library that will be used by other developers. I want to obey the "don't re-invent the wheel" principle and and I also want to make the deployment a matter of dropping a single .dll into the bin folder. So far, I've chosen an dual MIT/MS-PL license. Is there anything stopping me from compiling other MSPL/MIT licensed code directly into the same assembly as my own? Am I worried about nothing? If this is a legit concern, should I go add a licence/copyright header to each file before I add other code to my code base, since there won't be a nice tidy assembly to delineate where the code came from? Also, I will add the header for you so you can get to writing the answer faster: "You are not a lawyer, you are not giving legal advice, I should fork over my hard earned money to a profession I detest to resolve questions like this instead of asking for free advice"
