![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kyR8i.png) Mathematica code to reproduce:               LogPlot[{x^(4/3), x*E^Sqrt[8Log2[5/2]*Log2[x]],x^2,x^(3/2), x*Log2[x]^2}, {x,10,1000000},        PlotLegends->LineLegend["Expressions",LegendMarkers->Automatic]]      How can I prevent the equations from having their form modified? It would also be nice if I could get `Log2[x]` to appear as $\log_2x$. **Note:** I want to avoid having a second copy of the expressions in the input.
