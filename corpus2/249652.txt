While learning more about IEâ€™s documentMode property, I came across some sniffing code, which, of cause, fails in browsers like Firefox. However, a simplified version of the test would readas such:               if(undefined < 9) planA();     else planB();      Now in Firefox, it fall through to planB(), but so does this:               if(undefined > 9) planA(); // note: greater than     else planB();      The question is, is this the documented behaviour? That is, does the undefined value short-circuit the test?
