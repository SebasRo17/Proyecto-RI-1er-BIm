I'd like to know people's opinions, reactions to clients and technical work arounds (if applicable), to the issue of an enterprise application where a client wishes to use duplicate e-mail addresses? To clarify, when I say duplicate e-mail addresses I mean within the same client system, having multiple users that have the same e-mail address. So not just using generic e-mail addresses but using the e-mail address of another user. e.g. Bob Jenkins: bjenkins@myorg.com James Jeffery: bjenkins@myorg.com **Context** To give this some further context, in the e-learning sector it is common that although all staff in an organisation must complete e-learning - they may not have their own e-mail address so they choose to use their managers e-mail address. Albeit against good practice in public sites... it's a requirement we've over and over again where an organisation is split between office based staff and perhaps e.g. staff in a warehouse. **Where problem lies** Mr Steak, good point, the problem lies in password resets and perhaps in situations where semi-personal information could be sent (not confidential enough to worry about the insecurities of email). Perhaps reminders for specific system actions, which would be confusing for the unintended party to see (if perhaps misreading the e-mail's intended recipient) **Possible solutions**   * System knowing the difference between a "for the attention of" and direct to the person e-mails, including this in the body text.   * Using alternative communication such as SMS   * Simply not having e-mails sent to people who are not the intended recipient.   * Providing an e-mail service ourselfs (not really viable for a corporate IT dept) Thoughts?
