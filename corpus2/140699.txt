Just wondering if anybody has a good convention to follow in this corner- corner-corner case. I really use Java but figured the C# folks might have some good insight too. Say I am trying to name a class where two consecutive words in the class name are numeric (note that the same question could asked about identifier names). Can't get a great example, but think of something like "IEEE 802 16 bit value". Combining consecutive acronyms is doable if you accept classnames such as `HttpUrlConnection`. But it seriously makes me throw up a little to think of naming the class `IEEE80216BitValue`. If I had to pick, I'd say that's even worse than `IEEE802_16BitValue` which looks like a bad mistake. For small numbers, I'd consider `IEEE802SixteenBitValue` but that doesn't scale that well. Anyone out there have a convention? Seems like Microsoft's naming guidelines are the only ones that describe acronym naming in enough detail to get the job done, but nobody has addressed numbers in classnames.
