See examples in: http://www.mathematica- journal.com/issue/v10i1/contents/MathModelicaPaper/MathModelicaPaper_2.html It seems to be ruled out by the statement (Chapter 2 intro): "The subset of the Modelica language described in this section can be used in the simulation models, not in general Mathematica programming." but I just want to make sure I understand what this is saying, for example, does "simulation models" refer to SystemModeler only, or to simulating from within a notebook using WSMLink?
