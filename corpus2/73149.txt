I've met a bunch of "Certified ScrumMasters" as well as "Certified Scrum Product Owners" out there... but I have yet to meet a "Certified Scrum Developer." See: http://scrumalliance.org/pages/certified_scrum_developer Who has taken this course. Was it valuable? Please let me know how your experience went. -=-= Edits -=-= I just realized what the CSD requirements are (below)... what a heavy course load! > CSD Qualifications > > At least five days of formal training are required to earn a Certified Scrum > Developer (CSD) credential. CSD applicants must also demonstrate an > understanding of agile engineering practices by taking and passing a formal > CSD assessment. > >   * At least three days must be technical training through a three-day CSD- > track technical skills course. >   * At least one of the five days must be dedicated to the study of Scrum > through a CSD-track Introduction to Scrum course or CSM/CSPO course. >   * The fifth day is an elective. You can choose from among the CSD-track > courses to develop the skills you feel would benefit you the most in your > role. The two-day CSM or CSPO course fulfils both Intro to Scrum and the > elective requirements. >
