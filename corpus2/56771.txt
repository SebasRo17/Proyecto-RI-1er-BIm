I am trying to solve a model using a constant-elasticity-of-substitution production function, but when I try to solve the first order conditions, I just keep getting back what I typed.               Solve[-i - q + p s^(-1 + a) (1 + s^a)^(-1 + 1/a) - t == 0, s]      > >     Solve[-i - q + p s^(-1 + a) (1 + s^a)^(-1 + 1/a) - t == 0, s] >   Any help on how to tackle this problem would be great.
