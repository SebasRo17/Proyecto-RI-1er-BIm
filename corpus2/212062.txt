I am developing an application which is using JTransforms to compute FFT and InverseFFT. I am planning to sell that application on Play Store. The JTransforms Library is covered under MPL/LGPL/GPL tri-license. Does that mean I have to disclose my application's source code to the community ? Does that mean I cannot use an open-source library to sell non- free application ? I found the following link in which the ScissDSP library is using JTransforms under LGPL license : https://github.com/Sciss/ScissDSP/blob/master/licenses/JTransforms-License.txt Does that mean MPL/LGPL/GPL is sort-of Pick 'n' Choose type of License ?
