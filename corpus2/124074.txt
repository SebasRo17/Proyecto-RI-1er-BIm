Most everyone seems to agree that Reactive Management is worse than Proactive Management; however, it seems that I am constantly seeing Reactive Management from development managers. Logic would suggest that there is some benefit to Reactive Management, since it is seen so often. I tend to see nothing but negative issues coming from this type of management, but I may be naive. In what sorts of programming environments/situations would Reactive Management be advantageous?
