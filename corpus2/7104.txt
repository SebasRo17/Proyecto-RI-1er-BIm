I have a puzzling and very specific question. It may be of limited interest to community. I apologize in advance in this case. Let us see. I am making an illustration to a text that I write in the StyleSheet _Journal Article_. Here is the code:               Column[{   Row[{Rotate[Text[Style["Name of y variable", 18, Bold]], \[Pi]/2], im}],     Row[{Spacer[50], Text[Style["Name of x variable", 18, Bold]]}]   }]      Here is an image with `ImageSize->200` copied from somewhere. For example this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mevtv.png) It is fine, while I keep the result of the above code as an output. However, for the sake of numeration of images through the long document I transform the output cell style into the Figure cell style. Such a cell style does not exist in the default stylesheet, but one finds it in the document prepared with the help of the JournalArticle StyleSheet. My problem is that as soon as I transform the output into the Figure style, the texts "Name of y variable" and "Name of x variable" appear with explicit quotes. It is not unacceptable, but boring, since the unnecessary information is misleading to the reader. I would be grateful for a suggestion, if there is an easy way to remove the quotes.
