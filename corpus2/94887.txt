I used to create a lot of abstract classes / methods. Then I started using interfaces. Now I am not sure if interfaces aren't making abstract classes obsolete. You need a fully abstract class? Create an interface instead. You need an abstract class with some implementation in it? Create an interface, create a class. Inherit the class, implement the interface. An additional benefit is that some classes may not need the parent class, but will just implement the interface. So, are abstract classes / methods obsolete?
