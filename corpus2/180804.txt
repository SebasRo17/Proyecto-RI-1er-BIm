I want to uderstand why there is a method in C# that could reurn a value, for example:               public int Accelerate()     {        Speed++;        return Speed;     }      and a method that does not reurn a value (void)? What is the difference in the following example of the above one:               public void Accelerate()     {       Speed++;       Console.WriteLine(Speed);     }      I see that last one will save us a time rather than defining a variable to hold this field in when creating a new object! I'm beginner, so could anyone explain?
