I have a good colleague at work that I work often and he is pretty smart. He is not a .NET programmer but now is coding for a long time too, mainly C++, Python, etc. I see that he is using Python like guidelines in naming, etc, and in shared code, it looks non-uniform to have things like: getEffectById, etc and many other Python names, etc. How do you guys think I should tell this to him so he isn't offended or think I am looking down on his code or skills, because I don't.
