For a beginner web developer who is still doing web development the conventional way (PHP/J2EE/Struts on server side, HTML/CSS/Javascript on client side), I was bowled over by the recent blog post on Trello technology stack. I can't help feeling overwhelmed by the list of new technologies and frameworks mentioned in this post and specifically the ubiquitousness of Javascript frameworks. My question is, is this the future of web development? Are there any articles, websites or resources that can help me make sense of where each of these new frameworks fit in a modern web application ?
