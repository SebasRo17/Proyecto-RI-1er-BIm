I have to implement Paxos algorithm, to experiment on consensus in an asynchronous distributed system. Following is a pdf related to Paxos: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/past/03F/notes/paxos- simple.pdf I am confused from where can i start my implementation? I am a Java programmer but my teacher suggested me to use Parsec (http://pcl.cs.ucla.edu/projects/parsec/) , which needs me to code in C. But another problem is, Parsec does not support GUI based implementation. I would like to see my implementation with a GUI. Is there any Java based simulation language for discrete-event simulation where i can implement Paxos algorithm for consensus? If no, then is there any other GUI based simulation language in C to implement Paxos?
