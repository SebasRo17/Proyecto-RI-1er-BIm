I was just watching the "Going Native 2012" streams and I noticed the discussion about `std::shared_ptr`. I was a bit surprised to hear Bjarne's somewhat negative view on `std::shared_ptr` and his comment that it should be used as a "last resort" when an object's life-time is uncertain (which I believe, according to him, should infrequently be the case). Would anyone care to explain this in a bit more depth? How can we program without `std::shared_ptr` and still manage object life-times in a **safe** way?
