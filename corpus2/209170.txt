I have to design and build an import script (in C#) that can handle the following:   * read data from various sources (XML, XSLX, CSV)   * verify data   * write the data to various object types (customer, address) The data will come from a number of sources but a source will always have one import format (either csv, xml, xslx). Import formats can vary from source to source. New import formats may be added in the future. The destination object types are always the same (customer, addres and some more). I've been thinking about using generics and I read something about the factory pattern but I'm a pretty big noob in this area so any advice is more than welcome. What is an appropriate design pattern to solve this problem?
