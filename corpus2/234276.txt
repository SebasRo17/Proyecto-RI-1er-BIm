My .NET Windows desktop application creates an HTML report, and has 3 main phases. It may create multiple reports. I show a progress bar so the user knows (estimates) how long it will take (as well as reassure the system didn't crash by an updating GUI). So, if I needed to generate 3 reports, there would be a total of 9 phases (3 phases * 3 reports). The issue I now have, is the process is taking too long. As such, I need to use threads so I can start on phase 1, then open a new thread which completes phase 2 and 3. Whilst phase 2 and 3 are in progress, the next item on the list begins with phase 1 and the process continues. I'm hoping this makes sense. So I'm now thinking what to do with the progress bar since multiple phases will be being run at once. At the moment, the only logical thing I can think of is               Report 1. Start phase 1. New thread -> Phase 2 and 3          Check to see if Report 2 is last report. It isn't, so, during Report 2 phase 2, start Report 2 phase 1. New thread -> Phase 2 and 3          Check to see if Report 3 is last report. It is. So, during report 2 phase 2, start Report 3 phase 1, then continue on the same thread with phase 2 and 3      The above will mean I update the Progress Dialog during phase 2 and 3 of the last Report (and I guess I need to add some checks to ensure the other phases are actually finished). I can't imagine I'm doing any thing new or different to what has been before and as such, I was wondering if there is already a pattern for dealing with type of situation?
