If I write a library that is released under the terms of the GPL v2 (or higher, at option); may that library _depend on_ another library released under the LGPL v3 (or higher), without implicitly enforcing GPL v3. That is, I am purely linking to that library. Reading this and this, I understand that the LGPL v3 and GPL v2 are not "compatible". But it is not clear to me, whether compatibility means only mixing of code, or whether it extends to the linking (without modifying the LGPL'ed library).
