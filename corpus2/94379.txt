I have just accepted the second developer into an open source project. I'm not going to say which it is, for obvious reasons ( _read the rest of this question_.) The project is a C# / .NET projectl A while ago I contacted JetBrains, authors of ReSharper, dotCover, and TeamCity. Since I am the leader of the open source project, I got "open source" licenses for ReSharper, dotCover, and TeamCity. The important part is that the licenses I got for the project, for those products, are for **all** members of my project, not just me. The question is this:   * When advertising that the project requires more people (it does), should I mention the licenses involved? On one had, I feel that mentioning the licenses might make people not really interested in the project apply for it, because they would get those licenses, and thus be people more interested in the licenses than the project, i.e. "noise". On the other hand, the licenses could be a bonus, an ... "upshot" ... and thus might make more people interested in my project, in other words I might attract people that could be a bonus to the project, that weren't aware of it before. So... Should I advertise the licenses involved? Or not? * * * **Edit** : Ok, it's late at night (in my small corner of the world) and having re-read my question, le me make it clear what my question really is about: **Does anyone have any experience, or knowledge, or barring that, thoughts, about what difference it would make if I openly posted that becoming a member of my project would give them licenses for products X and Y, as opposed to not mentioning it until they're already members?**
