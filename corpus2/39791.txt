I am a long time experienced **Windows Forms** developer, but now it's time to **move to WPF** because a new WPF project is comming soon to me and I have only a short lead time to prepare myself to learn WPF. What is the best way for a experienced Winforms devleoper? Can you give me some hints and recommendations to learn WPF in a very short time! Are there simple sample WPF solutions and short (video) **tutorials**? Which **books** do you recommend? Is www.windowsclient.net a good starting point? Are there alternatives to the official Microsoft site?
