For example, if I'm using some MVC-like architecture, which folder structure should I use:               domain1/         controller         model         view     domain2/         controller         model         view      Or:               controllers/         domain1         domain2     models/         domain1         domain2     views/         domain1         domain2      I deliberately left out file extensions to keep this question language- agnostic. Personally, I'd prefer to separate by business domain (gut feeling), but I see that most/many frameworks separate by technical domain. Why whould I choose one over the other?
