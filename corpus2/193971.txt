I am new to freelancing websites. The problem is I have zero rating and I can't get any projects even if I bid the lowest amount. I tried bidding aggressively. I even tried bidding the lowest possible amount to get my first project but still people having higher ratings get the project. This in turn prevents me from getting any rating which prevents me from getting any new projects. I am stuck in this cycle.
