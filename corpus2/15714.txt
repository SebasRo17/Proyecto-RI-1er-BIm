> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to avoid nested With[]? I have many situations where I have a constant that is local to a function, with other constants that are computed from it. I see that I can implement this using nested `With` statements, like               leapSeconds = With[{        usnoData =          Import["http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat", "Text",           CharacterEncoding -> "UTF8"]},       With[{         lineLength = StringPosition[usnoData, "\n"][[1, 1]],         lsCount = Length[StringCases[usnoData, "\n"]] + 1},        DateList[#] & /@ (StringTake[             usnoData, {2 + #*lineLength, 9 + #*lineLength}] & /@            Range[0, lsCount - 1])]]      but this seems cumbersome. Is there a better way to do this sort of thing (I know that for this example I could dispense with the constants, but assume for the exercise that I do indeed need the constants)? Is nesting `With` statments a reasonable approach, or something I've just come up with by not understanding _Mathematica_ very well?
