I develop a cross-platform project (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) and use CMAKE, some python and platform-dependent scripts (sh, bat) for construction. Nevertheless I find the process of construction before release rather boring and annoying. Switching between computers, typing commands, copying binaries, eeww. Does anyone use some kind of building daemon? Something which can build project in the background by request or by reading special git/svn commit message.
