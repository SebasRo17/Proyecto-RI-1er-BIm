I don't know how to get two points at once, if using `Minimize`, only only one point can be got.               Minimize[{Sin[x], 0 <= x <= 4 Pi}, x]      the output: > `{-1, {x -> (7 \\[Pi])/2}}` And the last sentence of the information about `Minimize` gives a definitely declaration, which almost cut off this road: > Even if the same minimum is achieved at several points, only one is > returned. Other similar function like `FindMinimum` seems to be helpless either,so are there any methods to help achieve that goal?
