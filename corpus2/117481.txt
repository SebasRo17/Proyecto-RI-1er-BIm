I think most people would agree that pointers are a major source of bugs in C programs (if not the greatest source of bugs). Other languages drop pointers entirely for this reason. When working in C, then, would it be best to avoid using pointers whenever practical? For example, I recently wrote a function like this:               void split(char *record, char *delim, int numfields, int fieldmax, char result[numfields][fieldmax]);      While not as versatile as a dynamically allocated variable, in that it requires the programmer to know the number of fields in advance and anything over `fieldmax` is truncated (which is sometimes acceptable), it eliminates the need for memory management, and the potential for memory corruption. I think this is a pretty good trade, but I was wondering what the opinions of other programmers on this were.
