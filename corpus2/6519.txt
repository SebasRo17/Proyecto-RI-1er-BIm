Let's say I have some $n \times n$ square matrices $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m$ with exact numbers for entries, and I want to find the subspaces of $V = \mathbb{C}^n$ invariant under these matrices. Is there a clean way to do this? The way I'm doing it seems to require writing ridiculous amounts of code from scratch to do things like calculate intersections, get all the invariant subspaces belonging to a particular generalized eigenspace, etc.
