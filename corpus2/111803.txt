If an application is made during education using an IDE that had an Educational License (provided by the institute), and later the developers decide to release it in the market as a product:   1. Is it legal, and valid to do so?   2. Is it valid to build that application through the free or commercial version of the same IDE, or the project has to be re-coded or developed from the start, entirely on the commercial version of the IDE.   3. What permissions and licenses should be acquired if there is such plan?   4. What are the other things too look for in this regard?   5. If there is such plan, how to prepare for it at the start of the project, like who to talk to and how to talk about it, what paperwork etc. should be done so that in the end, there is nothing illegal.
