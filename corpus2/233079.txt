We have been using SVN for several years. Recently, we switched over to git, since some members of the organization pointed out that if our SVN server dies our team is toast. So far, we've got something worked out with the git workflow, however some team members really do not like this git process. They want to simply right- click on a file and then hit SVN Commit (we're using tortoiseSVN) without having to worry about all this pushing and pulling. I've been asked to provide SVN support for our repository while keeping the git repo (hosted on github) updated. The workflow I'm imagining is that we'll all just do the normal SVN things as before, and then once in awhile I'll just do a push to github to backup our files. What are some options for using git purely for backup purposes (one person would manage the git repo), while everyone uses the SVN repo? I've read about git-svn, but it seems like a completely different tool. Perhaps someone can clarify this? If I checked out a svn repo using git-svn, would I be able to operate on it using tortoiseSVN? Or can everyone else use a regular SVN checkout, while I maintain a git-svn checkout?
