I am new to scrum, project management in general, and i am having problems deciding what to call a feature or a sub-feature (which are tasklists to creating that feature?) especially for the standard things we have in every web app. So i am looking for best practices on how people are creating product backlogs for a typical website software (users, profiles, admin, front-end) . I have this in mind as an example.                - feature: home page           - feature: contact us page           - feature: admin panel                 - create user                    + create database (tasklist)                    + write stored procedures (tasklist)                 - delete user                 - add content                 - delete content           - feature: subscribe                  - create subscribe page      Also, how granular is too granular?
