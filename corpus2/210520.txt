Question: There is an infinite line. You are standing at a particular point you can either move 1 step forward or 1 step backward. You have to search for an object in that infinite line. Your object can be in any direction. Give an optimal solution My approach:                      Go 1 step forward, 2 step back ward             Go 2 step forward, 4 step back ward and so on       Complexity: Lets say the required object is at point n. Total number of steps:                3 + 6 + 9 + .... n      = 3(1 + 2 + 3 ... n)      = O(n^2)      Is there a way to improve the efficiency?
