In our app we are currently saving binary data to the database (terrible, I know; but this is legacy stuff and it wasn't my decision). We're trying to migrate this data out to an external device and I'm trying to come up with a scheme to save these files. We have multiple tenants, I'd like to have a directory per tenant. My scheme for that is to build path using the first-three letters of the tenant. So if you had a tenant called `apple`, its files would be at `/a/p/p/apple`. Within these directories, I will save the files. For the files, I want to generate a random 6-character alphanumeric name (only lowercase characters for the time being because internal reasons). So if we generate a file name called `6a8jxo`, it will stored as `<tenant>/6/a/6/6a8jxo`. With this strategy, each tenant can have a maximum of approximately 916 billion unique files (not that we're attempting to save that many), with a maximum of 46,656 files per directory. If I go for a 5-character name, we will have a maximum of 60.5 billion unique files with 1,296 files per directory. Are there any drawbacks to this approach? I realize that certain directories may only contain one or two files, but in my mind that is not a huge problem. My colleague doesn't want to do it this way; he wants to use an autoincremented field in the database and then base the directory structure on the hex-value (I assume 32-bit) of that instead of using the tenant. With his strategy the hex value would be used as follows: the file will be stored in the directory located at `<tenant>/aa/bbb` where `aa` is the first two characters (most significant nibbles) of the hex value, and `bbb` is the next three. His reasoning is that he only wants to create new directories when one fills up instead of having numerous, partially-filled directories. This approach introduces numerous difficulties on the code side of things and I don't see having completely-filled directories as an argument that justifies the extra effort required to do this. Are there any other strategies or approaches I haven't considered?
