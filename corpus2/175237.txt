I was querying indeed.com/salary to investigate general market trends. When comparing ruby on rails with drupal, you would observe a substantial difference between these two. I'm not sure if the data on indeed.com is reliable or not but I'd appreciate your comments if you have ever tried both rails and drupal. Actually I am a .net developer considering an alternative to my asp.net mvc skills and I like to learn some non-microsoft web programming skills as well.
