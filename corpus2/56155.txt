I would like to have a marker with white as its inner color, to be able to make this kind of graph: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OIQFn.png) If I use `PlotMarkers -> Style["\[FilledSquare]", White]`, it changes both the inner color + border color but not the inner color only. If I use `PlotMarkers -> Style["\[EmptySquare]", White]`, the line of the curve goes above the marker. How could I achieve that?
