I am learning Python currently which wasn't part of my college curriculum. I was asked in an interview why I chose Python and I replied that it is easy to learn and the documentation is very well written. The interviewer didn't reply whether it was a good enough reason. He looked convinced but I cannot be sure. Is a well written documentation along with ease of learning a good enough reason for choosing a scripting language? Or should I have elaborated more about the availability of Python libraries and bigger user base of Python? Just a note. Python wasn't required for the job. The company worked on Ruby- on-rails. Python was in my resume and I think the interviewer just wanted to know what considerations I made as a fresher while choosing a programming language.
