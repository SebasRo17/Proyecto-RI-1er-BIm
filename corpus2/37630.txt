I am trying to connect a classic System Dynamics tool (Vensim DSS) with Mathematica using a DLL that is included in Vensim DSS. Reading though the instructions on how to define DLL functions on how to declare arguments - here strings - I found that if there are [out] strings one should use the .NET class _System.Text.StringBuilder_. So applying the advice given will look like this:               (* definitions *)     $maxBufLen = 1000;     strOutput = NETNew["System.Text.StringBuilder", $maxBufLen];     vensimGetInfo = DefineDLLFunction["vensim_get_info", vensimDLL,     "int", {"int", "System.Text.StringBuilder", "int"}];          (* usage *)     infoWanted = 3; bufLen = $maxBufLen;     vensimGetInfo[infoWanted, strOutput, bufLen];     strOuput@ToString[]       Unfortunately this only works properly for a single string and some information will be returned by the DLL function as a series of null terminated strings that is finally ended by a double null. In such a case the above procedure will only return the first string omitting the rest. What can be done?
