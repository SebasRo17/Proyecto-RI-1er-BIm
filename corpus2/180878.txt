I am working in a Python project that I want to release under the GPL3 license. This project has one file that uses the BSD lxml library . I really need to put reference of the BSD license in the file where I use the library? Or just the GPLv3 of my project covers the licenses restrictions. Library: http://lxml.de Licenses: https://github.com/lxml/lxml/blob/master/doc/licenses/BSD.txt http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt [Edit] I think we're misunderstanding I will not put the source code of the lxml library on my project. I will put the reference for functions of the library. If someone wants use my project, he needs to download separately the lxml library.               import lxml          # do stuff with lxml...     # do stuff     # my code      Only is necessary put the library license if I distribute the lxml source code with my project. Am I right?
