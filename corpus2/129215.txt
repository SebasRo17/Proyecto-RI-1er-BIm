I've once heard a Microsoft architect say that, in Quebec, program output must be in French, including the custom log output that would be used by service technicians in other countries who don't speak French or are Quebecois. Apparently, it's in Bill 101 Article 5. If you read the document _correctly_ (thanks Matthieu), Article 5 says > **5\. Consumers of goods and services have a right to be informed and served > in French.** 1977, c. 5, s. 5. Is what the Microsoft technician saying correct? Does this affect all output from a program, or just the output intended for a French-speaking audience (e.g., the logs in this case wouldn't apply)? Is it only intended for government agencies (including contract work done for them), or does it affect private use and sale, as well?
