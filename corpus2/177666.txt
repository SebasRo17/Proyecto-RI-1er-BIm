I have a few (view) classes. Table, Tree, PagingColumn, SelectionColumn, SparkLineColumn, TimeColumn. currently they're flat under `app/view` like this:               app/view/Table     app/view/Tree     app/view/PagingColumn     ...      I thought about restructuring it, because the Trees and Tables use the columns, but there are some columns, which only work in a tree, some who work in trees and tables and in the future there are probably some who only work in tables, I don't know. My first idea was like this:               app/view/Table     app/view/Tree          app/view/column/PagingColumn     app/view/column/SelectionColumn     app/view/column/SparkLineColumn     app/view/column/TimeColumn      But since the SelectionColumn is explicitly for trees, I have the fear that future developers could get the idea of missuse them. But how to restructure it probably? Like this:               app/view/table/panel/Table          app/view/tree/panel/Tree     app/view/tree/column/PagingColumn     app/view/tree/column/SelectionColumn          app/view/column/SparkLineColumn     app/view/column/TimeColumn      Or like this:               app/view/Table     app/view/Tree          app/view/column/SparkLineColumn     app/view/column/TimeColumn          app/view/column/tree/PagingColumn     app/view/column/tree/SelectionColumn
