I have written a small Java program which i'd like to distribute on my website. I have used a few external librarys which declare following licences: Apache License (2.0), LGPL and one API doesn't declare any licence.. It's open source though. I have spent a lot of time and effort developing my program. That's why I thought of distributing the software so that only donators (no matter how much or little they donate) can use it to it's fullest extent. Non donators get to see a nag screen now and then with a suggestion to donate and can only download one file at a time instead of simultanious downloads. (Yeah my program does some downloading) Can I do that without getting legal issues? On one hand I would like to distribute the complete source of my project but on the other hand that would render the limitation of functions for non-donators useless, because they could simply remove the part with the serial nr check and redistribute my software.. Under what licence should i distribute my program?
