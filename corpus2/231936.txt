I've been asked to draw out the Bounded Contexts (BC) and the possible aggregate and the roots of a School domain. The domain consists of students who study modules on a course. The submit their assignment for a module which is then marked by an external tutor. The 'Marking' firstly sticks out as a BC, but im unsure about the rest... Also a 'module' would appear on multiple Bounded Contexts so how would i handle this?
