Being a long time unix shell person, I prefer Mathematica's command line interface, over the notebook. (command history, etc...) It just learned that on OS X, the cli is available as MathKernel. What I'm wondering now is, is it possible to open graphics (and/or animations, sounds, etc) result, from within the command line?               In[16]:= Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}]          Out[16]= -Graphics-      I would like to be able to view output #16.
