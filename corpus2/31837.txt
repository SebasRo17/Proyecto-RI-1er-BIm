Consider the following typical interactive sequence. First I produce a `ListPlot`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YPqKy.png) OK, not bad, but I want those dots to be bigger, and also joined. First, I make the dots bigger, like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1hena.png) Good. Next, to join the dots, I do this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/amEHg.png) Aaaarrrrrgh! The dots disappeared! Why??? Don't they know _anything_ about usability at WRI? I have tried to achieve the desired effect in a bazillion ways, and they all fail for one reason or another: either the dots no longer look like dots (but rather like diamonds, squares, triangles), or they are no longer the same color as the lines joining them, or something else... So my question is: how can I achieve the simple effect of several plots of (distinctly visible) dots joined by lines, and each plot of a different, but uniform, color? I also have a meta-question: The frustration illustrated by the interaction above is entirely typical of my experience with _Mathematica_ , since day 1. I used to think that the reason why I had such difficulty getting the simplest things done with _Mathematica_ was that I just didn't know it well enough... But this problem has persisted over the years, with hardly any improvement, even though I've devoted considerable effort to learning more and more about _Mathematica_. I have been using _Mathematica_ now for about 20 years (!), and I _still_ struggle _for hours at a time_ with trivialities like this one. This makes me wonder whether these difficulties are really more a reflection with a fundamental flaw in some aspect of _Mathematica_ 's design (one that somehow makes conceptually simple things turn out to be disproportionately difficult). Sure, when one is starting out with some new software simple things may take a long time to accomplish, but _Mathematica_ is the only software that I've been using for more than, say 4-5 years, and that I still have to struggle with for hours to get simple things to work (and very often I just have to give up with)...
