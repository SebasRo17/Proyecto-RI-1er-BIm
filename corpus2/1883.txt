The question is clear and is inspired by this question and the first comment on this question. Although there are many tricks for parallelizing things that are not `Parallelize[]`-able it would be handy to know beforehand whether the function you need is boostable with `Parallelize`. From the official documentation we have the following list:   * All listable functions with one argument.   * Structure-preserving functions: `Map`, `MapThread`, `MapIndexed`, `Scan`, `Apply`.   * Reductions: `Count`, `MemberQ`, `FreeQ`.    * Products: `Inner`, `Outer`, `Dot`.   * Iterators: `Table`, `Array`, `Product`, `Sum`. Does the complete list exist?
