Does anyone have experience running Visual Studio inside a VDI environment?   * Would you recommend it?   * Would you advise against it? * * * **Our Background** Our department is one of the few in the company that doesn't use thin clients. The head of the department is getting pressure that we too should be using thin clients, in a hope that the help desk and server admins will be more responsive to other departments complaints and issues. I agree with the idea behind it, but I'm very leery of running a program like Visual Studio inside a virtual machine.
