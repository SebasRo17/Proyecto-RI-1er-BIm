In JavaScript, there is no such thing as a "private" variable. In order to achieve encapsulation and information hiding in JavaScript, I can wrap a variable inside a function closure, like so:               var counter = (function() {             var i = 0;         var fn = {};         fn.increment = function() { i++; };         fn.get = function() { return i; };         return fn;     {)();         counter.increment();     counter.increment();     alert(counter.get()); // alerts '2'      Since I don't call `i` a private variable in JavaScript, what do I call it?
