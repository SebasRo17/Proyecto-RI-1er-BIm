I have the following function, albeit contrived:               Foo[x_Integer] :=       Module[{i},        i = 1;        While[i <= x && i <= 10, i++];        i - 1        ];      I am looking for the following               Foo[1] = 1     .     .     .     Foo[10] = 10     Foo[11] = 10     Foo[Infinity] = 10      However `Foo[Infinity]` returns `Foo[\\[Infinity]]` and not `10` . Is there an something that I can do, short of: `Foo[Infinity] = 10;` to get `Foo[Infinity]` to return `10` ? The problem is `i <= 10` is static in my contrived example, but will be dynamic in practice.
