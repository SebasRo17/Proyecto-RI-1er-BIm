Suppose I have a list of Ingredients In My Fridge which are going off soon, and a list of Recipes which use up various Ingredients. (Some of which I don't currently have.) Is there an algorithm which produces the optimal set of Recipes, where an optimal set maximises the number of Ingredients In My Fridge used up and minimises the number of Ingredients I Have To Buy From The Store? (Alternate formulation: In a card game, I can combine some Cards according to various Rules; I can also obtain new Cards in various ways. How do I find the best set of Rules to use up the most Cards I have for the minimum effort in obtaining new Cards?)
