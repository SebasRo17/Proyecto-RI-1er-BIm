Is there a way to solve for statistical quantities analytically/symbolically in _Mathematica_? **example 1:**   Lets say that I want to do a calculation that requires Bayes theorem. I know p(a), p(b) and p(a | b). I want to calculate p(b | a). Now, for this simple example, I know the solution, so I could write the relationship myself, but what about more complicated examples? Surely _Mathematica_ is able to solve probability problems like it can solve algebraic ones? I want to stay away from simulation. I want _Mathematica_ to do the five pages of math that I normally do on paper. Can _Mathematica_ do this for me? I'd like to type something like               Solve[p(a) == a1 && p(b) == a2 && p(a|b) == a3, p(b|a)]      and get > >     p(b|a) -> (a3*a2)/a1 >   **example 2:**   I want to use the law of total probability: I know `p(a|b)`, `p(a|!b)`, and `p(b)` and I want to calculate `p(a)`. I'd like to type something like               Solve[p(a|b) == a1 && p(a|!b) == a2 && p(b) == a3, p(a)]      and get > >     p(a) -> a1*a3 + a2*(1-a3) >
