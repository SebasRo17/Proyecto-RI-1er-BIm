The `Ctrl`+`Space` keyboard shortcut is really important in _Mathematica_ for using `Placeholder[]` boxes in input templates. Unfortunately, `Ctrl`+`Space` occupies the significantly more important role of the system-wide Quicksilver shortcut that I'm not really willing to part with, not even while _Mathematica_ is running. Can I change this shortcut in _Mathematica_ to some other key sequence?
