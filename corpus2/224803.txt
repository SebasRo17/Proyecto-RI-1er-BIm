We have developed an application that is sold as an online service. After some time we realized that some of customers would need/prefer/require to have it installed locally on their intranet. However the application was developed using scripting language and we wouldn't want to allow clients to access the source code. The question is: What are the technical downsides of distributing application as a virtual machine image?
