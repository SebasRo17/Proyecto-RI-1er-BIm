I am trying to learn the most useful keyboard shortcuts for doing basic operations such as integration, differentiation etc in standard form. A few questions -   1. I have checked the documentation and i found shortcuts such as Esc[intt]Esc for an integral and Esc[dintt]Esc for definite integral in standard mathematical form but i can't find a short cut for a standard derivative i.e d/dx ? I am aware you can use D[] function but i would like to be able to input in standard mathematical form. Esc[dt]Esc gives me a partial derivative but i just want standard d/dx for single variable calculus.   2. If i enter a indefinite integral and i want to change this into a definite integral is there anyway i can add the upper and lower limits or do i need to re-enter the whole integral using Esc[dintt]Esc ?  Thanks David.
