Assume that you're a sole developer leaving a job. What kind of information/material, outside of the code itself, should you create and leave behind for your replacement? An obvious answer is "whatever you would want at a new job" for sure, but it's been a while since I started a new job, and I forget what the most important things that I needed were back then. I'm thinking:   * accounts/passwords   * location of equipment, backups, software CDs What else?
