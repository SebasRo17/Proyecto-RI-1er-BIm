Both asserts and unit tests serve as documentation for a codebase, and a means of discovering bugs. The main differences are that asserts function as sanity checks and see real inputs, whereas unit tests run on specific simulated inputs and are tests against a single well-defined "right answer". What are the relative merits of using asserts vs. unit tests as the main means of verifying correctness? Which do you believe should be emphasized more heavily?
