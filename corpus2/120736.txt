I understand this site is for programmers, and i have to ask specific coding question. I am doing a software engineering degree and i have been asked to reference at-least 7 books in my definition of prototyping. The best place to ask is here because most of you have probably read books on this and would be able to recommend books to me. I dont mind buying them from Amazon so if you could some books for me that define prototyping or a prototype i would really appreciate it.
