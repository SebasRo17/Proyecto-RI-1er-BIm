My deeply and unevenly nested lists and equations generate a TreeForm image which is too small and compressed to use. Then we must expand it manually by grabbing the edge of the image, and sometimes this requires irritating time and effort, and huge expansions. Will some clever person please show me how to force the size of the TreeForm image to be large enough that no cells in the image overlap vertically? So no level will vertically overlap any other level? Then, in some instances, but not as important, a second option to force the image also to be large enough so no two cells on the same level overlap horizontally? (This latter must be an option only, not the default, because the span may be extremely large horizontally for large databases. Also, it might be best that partial overlaps be permitted.) I imagine running TreeForm with these options, and then being able to use the vertical and horizontal scroll bars to see any part of the nested structure. This would solve a lot of the problems being addressed by other solutions and questions about TreeForm.
