I am writing several packages in collaboration with others. In order to help the group use my packages, I want to provide them with a simple reference of function names and usage messages. How can I best do this? ### Additional information: Although I didn't originally ask for it, I'd like to be able to do the following:   1. save the function names with their usage messages   2. into some text-based file (e.g. LaTeX, HTML, markdown, plain text)   3. that organizes the functions under section headings that specify which package they came from. Here's what it might look like in plain text:               PackageName1          function1 :: does something     function2 :: does something else          PackageName2          function3 :: does it do something?     function4 :: does, perhaps, something      Formatted versions like LaTeX that require compiling are, perhaps, less useful to the community, but they just look so nice :)
