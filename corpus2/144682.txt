I am about to start a new project and must choose a compiler. Because we are working in the embedded domain, one of the criteria that we are evaluating is the size of the output of the compiler. There are benchmarks, such as Dhrystone and Whetstone for evaluating compilers in terms of how compilers handle string, integer, and floating point functions. Is there something along these lines for providing a general comparison of the ability of compilers to produce small output files?
