I'm in my last year in a 4 year CS curriculum and I would very much like to contribute to a FOSS project. Unfortunately, I feel that there is no way I can do useful coding, whether it is bug fixing or feature developing. The C/C++/Java projects we undertake at school are trivial compared to coding for serious projects and when I read the source code of a FOSS project I'm completely at loss. Do you agree there is a gap between CS education and actually programming for a real life project? How big do you think that gap is and how does one overcome it?
