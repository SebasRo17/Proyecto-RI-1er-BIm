Doesn't it seem relatively duplicative to define your Models in your backend code AND on your front end for a rich internet application? I'm porting a GUI application I had written to have a web interface, which is all grand and nice any all, but things like Spine, SproutCore, JavascriptMVC would have you define your models and views and implement specific controllers. Being that I've got a well defined MVC pattern on my backend code (which is making this super easy to port; the views in my app took python dicts and returned python dicts to the controllers which could easy interface with the models; I can just convert these to JSON back and forth to speak to the web front end), why would I want to recreate the entire pattern again on the front end? What are good ways to work around this? Should I just say "screw this" and use something like http://pyjs.org? Should I write a bunch of code to export my models into JSON and then write some JavaScript code to build the Models on the front-end automatically so I'm still only defining them once? What would be the best approach to this?
