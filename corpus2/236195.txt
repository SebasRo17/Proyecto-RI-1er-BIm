I am not doing web programming usually, but while looking at the generated source of a webpage learned that a standard way to refresh a web page is to use `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="_sec">`. I find this an abuse of "metadata" which for my understanding is supposed to be only "data about data" and not something to affect user experience (in this case I cannot imagine how often a page is refreshed qualifying as "data about data"). My questions are 1) Was this way of redirecting, a workaround because early days of html/browsers did not provide another standard way to redirect/refresh? 2) Is my idea/definition of "metadata" as strictly being a description of what the data is all about (like charset, type, keywords etc.) too narrow ?
