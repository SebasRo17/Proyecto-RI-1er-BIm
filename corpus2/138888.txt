I am using the new phonegap 1.5.0 (which is confusingly renamed cordova despite no mention of the rename on the phonegap site), and I'm finding that the white-listing feature on iOS is quite restrictive. I understand that having a whitelist is more secure in that it only allows trusted domains, but what if you want to load urls that have been loaded dynamically? You don't know exactly which domain will be loading, so you can't put it on the whitelist. An example use-case would be ad-serving and opening privacy policies. Why is the whitelist mandatory, and is there a way around it?
