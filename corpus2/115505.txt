I am making a UML diagram. Im wondering if im using the extends feature correctly. I have a marketer that can search contacts but only if they have created them in the first place.... Have i got the right idea. Or should there be an association between the marketer and the update/delete contact too? Should the update/delete even extend the create contact? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qeMtm.jpg)
