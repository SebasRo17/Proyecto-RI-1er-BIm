I'm finishing my dissertation and want/need to provide the source code of some analysis scripts I've used. I did all the version control with `git`. Because I want to publish the results generated with these scripts, I don't want to just put them in a public repository on GitHub. Is it possible to provide an "URL-only" access to a GitHub repo, meaning it is not publicly listed but only visible to persons who have the URL? If not with GitHub, is this possible with another service? I would like to have some kind of GUI to see the code, which is why I don't want to make a zip file with just the source code in it. Edit: To make that point more clear: There should not be any login or registration involved! Type in the URL printed in the dissertation and boom, there's the source code!
