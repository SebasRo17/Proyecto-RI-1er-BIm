I am working on a project that has around a hundred different files (.cpp & .h), and it requires around an hour to build the entire project on MSVC 2008, suppose that I now make a change to any one file, do I need to build the entire project once again, right from the beginning, or is there a way out ? I know it is very very noob like, but I am wasting a lot of time, hence I was wondering
