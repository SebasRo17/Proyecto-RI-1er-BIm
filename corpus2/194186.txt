JavaScript seems to calculate the array length property by the number of the last index in the array rather than counting the number of items in the array. Example:               var testArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];     console.log(testArray.length); //3     testArray[8] = 'i';     console.log(testArray.length); //9      Normally I would use push() and wouldn't add a value to an array using bracket notation, but this was a bit of a surprise. Is there any reason for this implementation of assigning a value to Array.length? The only thing I can seem to come up with is that it just uses the last index as a performance optimization to avoid counting the array items.
