The title pretty much says it all, but the longer story is: I went to a job interview last year for a junior tester position. The first interview was with a person from HR. This is weird, in my opinion the technical interview should come first. We started talking HR specific stuff and some details about the company/job/etc. Then, out of the blue, she just started asking me very general and easy questions about object-oriented programming. Things like what is a class, what is inheritance, what's the difference between overriding and overloading blabla. Now, maybe it makes business sense to make the people in HR memorize some programming questions and answers in order to screen out completely idiot applicants. However, there are a few important setbacks about this:   * most of the time, the HR person will have absolutely no idea what he/she or the applicant are talking about at that moment. So if the applicant's correct answer differs from the one he/she memorized (which it probably will), then he/she will wrongfully consider (with very high probability) that the applicant has no idea about OOP.   * why not just have a senior developer do phone screening instead ? Seems much more effective (and also cheaper).   * my CV was pretty complete, it contained all my relevant skills and projects. Did he/she even bother read it ? Or, if he/she did read it, does he/she just assume that every applicant is lying on their CV ? In that case, why should I ever bother putting one together and sending it to them ? All this definitely raised some red flags in my mind for the reasons mentioned in the list above. We did not move forward for second and/or 3rd interview (the reason for this is irrelevant), but **is it reasonable to consider this a deal-breaker ?**
