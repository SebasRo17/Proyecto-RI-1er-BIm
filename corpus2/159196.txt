I wrote a C# class that is used to start a list of EXEs (not one of mine - third party EXEs I have to run) and keep them running (will check occasionally to make sure it is still running, and start them if not). I am able to test the basic logic of adding, removing, etc fine. How do I Unit Test that the actual work of keeping EXEs will work? My initial thought is to start some dummy EXE that closes itself after 1 second, then use that to test. Is that out of the realm of Unit Testing?
