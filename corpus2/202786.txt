I am not really sure how to correctly describe my question, so please forgive me if this is a duplicate. I am creating a flowchart for my program where I implement a method. Let's assume I call this method **someMethod**. The C code could look something like this:               bool someMethod(int Foo, int Bar)     {         foo += 5;         bar -= 5;         return (foo == bar);     }      This means that my flowchart will have a subroutine block where I call this function. But how do I correctly show the reader which integers I pass? And when I create the flowchart of "someMethod", I face a similar problem: how do I correctly show the reader that Foo and Bar are passed parameters? **EDIT:** From what I have found so far, people have solved it by using the Start block as some sort of function declaration block, where they would replace Start with _someMethod_ and place _foo_ and _bar_ on a new line. But from what I understand this isn't good practice since the start and end of every flowchart should be blocks containing respectively _Start_ and _Stop_. I also have seen people using an IO-block as the first non-start block where they would _"read"_ the passed parameters but that just seems like a hack. But unless there are better ideas, I suppose I'll have to go with that. **EDIT 2:** I am starting to wonder if this question is actually valid for this site. Is nobody using flowcharts anymore as a project preparation method?
