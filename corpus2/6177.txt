Been out of school for about 3.5 years and in the .NET environment doing C# UI work (WinForms/WPF/Silverlight) as well as some Java work, server side. All in all I have done no real web development. I am wanting to expand my knowledge to include some web knowledge. My company makes use of the Spring stack so I was going down that path so that it had value at my current place of employment. They make absolutely no use of Ruby/Rails however that would allow me to learn a language versus a stack. I have thought of going the ASP route which the company also makes heavy use of, since I am familiar with C# and the .NET environment. I am in favor of what MS has brought to the table so me stepping out of the .NET environment feels both interesting and exciting. I'm not sure if I am avoiding ASP to simply broaden my knowledge bank...so based on the above knowledge what route would you all take? What has the most value long term? ASP? Spring stack? Ruby/Rails? Something else I am ignoring...? All input is greatly appreciated, thanks.
