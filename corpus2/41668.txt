I've been working as a **freelancer** for about two years in vWorker. Any person can visit a coder's profile, and see in how many projects the coder has worked on, (if the coders allows) see how much the coder obtained in each project, ratings, feedbacks, etc. Would be good to include a freelancer account in your Resume / CV when applying for a job?   Is it something you would do if you have finished several projects there?
