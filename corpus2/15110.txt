I was playing with a `Manipulate`to visually compare calculating the mean of Normal and Cauchy random data.               Manipulate[      ListLinePlot[       {        Table[Mean@Take[#, i], {i, 1000}] &[         RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[10, 1], 1000]],        Table[Mean@Take[#, i], {i, 1000}] &[         RandomVariate[CauchyDistribution[10, 1], 1000]]        },       PlotRange -> Full,       DataRange -> n,       Frame -> True,       Axes -> False       ],      {n, 50, 1000}      ]      The result looks nice, but there is one problem. It regenerates the random data each time I move the slider for `n`. Is there some way I could set it up so that is only generates new random data when the `Manipulate` is first evaluated and when a button is pushed?
