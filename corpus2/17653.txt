I teach an undergraduate course in Thermodynamics and I would love to use Mathematica to demonstrate the various engineering processes that involve the expansions and compressions of steam and common refrigerants such as R134a. I know that wolfram alpha does provide steam data but I'd rather have this from Mathematica. I also do know that in the Mathematica guide (`guide/ScientificAndTechnicalData`), some data is available but it is generally viscosities, molecular formulae etc. Is there any way I could get steam table data into/from Mathematica? Students generally use steam tables available in their textbooks and that is a fantastic starting point as I would never want to do away with that. However, using Mathematica would be a fantastic way of introducing my students to this wonderful tool that has helped me in my research. This would be very transformative to the way steam tables are particularly viewed as (with general disdain among sophomores and junior level students)!
