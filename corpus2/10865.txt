I am trying to calculate where a beam hits a mirror. The mirror is described by this curve (two facing spherical mirrors):               Mirror[x_] := Piecewise[{        {{Sin[-87.5 °] + 0.5, Cos[-87.5 °]}, x < 0},        {{Sin[-x ° - 87.5 °] + 0.5,           Cos[-x ° - 87.5 °]}, x >= 0 && x < 5},        {{Sin[x ° + 82.5 °] - 0.5,           Cos[x ° + 82.5 °]}, x >= 5 && x < 10}        }, {Sin[92.5 °] - 0.5, Cos[92.5 °]}]      Now, I am just trying to get the crossing point with a line:               p = {0, 0};     v = {1, 0};     Solve[Evaluate[       Simplify[Mirror[s].{1, 0}] == (p + v t).{1, 0} &&        Simplify[Mirror[s].{0, 1}] == (p + v t).{0, 1}        ], {s, t}]      The manual projection (.{1, 0}) is done because of the piecewise defined function, as they do not work with the usual Thread - we worked this out here. This code has been working well since then, but it does not for the current Mirror function. I have no idea what the problem could be. Any ideas?
