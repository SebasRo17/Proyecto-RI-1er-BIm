I have a job interview tomorrow and it's for a junior web developer role. I am really excited about it because I really want to get my foot in the door in this industry. I have been told how the interview will pan out. It will consist of a 45 minute interview with two of their developers and an 'aptitude for programming' test. I am really worried about the 'aptitude for programming' test. Questions I am hoping the stack community can help me out with is:   1. What exactly is this? (as far as I understand it is a written test using a fictional programming language).   2. If you have done this before, either as the interviewer or interviewee, can you give me any advice, hints or help?   3. Are there any online sources that may help with this, i.e. blogs, websites, places I can practice a few online?
