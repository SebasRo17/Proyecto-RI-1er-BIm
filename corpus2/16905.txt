In work we have just started using the Scrum methodology, it is working well but I have a question on the daily sprint meetings. We set aside 15 minutes for the meeting (between the three devs and the scrum master if we think he is needed) but I have found that we have normally finished by 5 minutes. This might be because we have said all that needs to be said but I was wondering what people tend to talk about in them, in case we are missing something. For the record we normally update each other on current objective, troublesome previous objectives and plans for the rest of the day (including if we will not be available on that project).
