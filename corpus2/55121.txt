I'm putting my new copy of Mathematica 10 through its paces and I noticed a weird change in the colouring scheme that I find very annoying, and I'd like to get some insight into why it's happening. The change happens, as far as I can tell, for variables that have been set in some scoping construct which are then used inside of a Manipulate command. Thus, for example, the code               Module[      {A = 1},      Manipulate[       Plot[        A Sin[k x]        , {x, 0, 20}        ]       , {k, 1, 10}       ]      ]      renders differently in the Mathematica 9 and 10 frontends: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j33Jq.png) Playing around in Edit > Preferences > Appearance > Syntax Coloring > Errors and Warnings, the error class that this is attributed to is > Variables that will go out of scope before being used though what that means exactly isn't very clear to me. Therefore, I have some questions:   * Is this in fact an incorrect usage? If so, why, and what alternative construct should I use? (I notice, in particular, that in version 10 the red colour is displayed for Block and Module but not for With.)   * Why did this only start happening in version 10? Which version is right?   * If this sort of code is OK, can I safely disable this sort of error marking? What risks does that entail?
