When I execute the lines               data1 = Table[i + j, {i, 10}, {j, 1}];     data10 = Table[i + j, {i, 10}, {j, 10}];     opts = {ImageSize -> {Automatic, 300}, BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 14}, ImagePadding -> 25};     bothPlots = Row[{ArrayPlot[data1, opts], ArrayPlot[data10, opts]}]      I get the following picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xq2At.png) The space between plot data and frame of the 1x10 array is much smaller than the space between the plot data and frame of the 10x10 matrix. Is there a possibility to avoide that or to set that space manually?
