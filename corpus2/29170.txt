I have seen some programmers tweaking their code over and over again not only to make it 'work good', but also to make it 'look good'. IMO, 'clean code' is actually a compliment indicating your code is elegant, perfectly understandable and maintainable. And the difference comes out when you have to choose between an aesthetically appealing code vs. code that's stressful to look at. So, how many of you actually write 'clean code'? Is it a good practice? What are the other benefits or drawbacks of this?
