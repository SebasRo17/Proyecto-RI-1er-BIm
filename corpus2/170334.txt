Now, in c++ '...' became a first class operator. In speech, how do you pronounce it? So far I've heard:   * dot dot dot   * triple dot   * ellipsis related: Is it OK to replace ... with ellipsis in writing? e.g. "The ellipsis operator expands the pack" EDIT (clarification): We are all aware that '...' as a **punctuation** mark is indeed called ellipsis. But in the context of C++ we don't pronounce the names of the punctuation mark. For example, the '&' operator, depends on the context is pronounced as 'and', 'bitwise and', 'address of', 'logical and' (when && is used), or 'reference'. It is rarely pronounced as 'ampersand'. In speeches, I've a feeling that 'dot dot dot' is used more often. For example: http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/Variadic- Templates-are-Funadic (an excellent presentation about variadic templates). On the other hand, 'dot dot dot' is awkward hard to pronouce ('d' and 't' are both pronounce with the tongue). Can we pronounce it 'unpack'?
