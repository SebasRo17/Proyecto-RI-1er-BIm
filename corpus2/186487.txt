I have started a project where I need to design an application that will work as a code-block editor, much like lego mindstorms and this google project. http://code.google.com/p/blockly/ What are the possible approaches for designing such an application in Java? More specifically, assuming I have one block A, how can I define which other blocks can be connected with it? What I think of is using subclasses and checking the hierarchy, or another possible solution could be some kind of 2D table that will verify a connection is valid(although I think it might get too big?). p.s: I need to force correct structure of code, and not check it with parser at the end. So only blocks that fit together should be connected.
