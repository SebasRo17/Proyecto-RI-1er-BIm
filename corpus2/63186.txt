I would like to make an animation of Molecular diffusion. I have some CSV or binary file with data to create 3D scene with atoms. It has to be fast animation with diffrent camera views and transparency vary depends on atom's energy. Since I code in C# on a regular basis I am going to pick up XNA (later Mono.XNA). Is it the best fit? Is there anything good that reduce the amout of code? Has anyone had problem with porting XNA animation to Mono.XNA?
