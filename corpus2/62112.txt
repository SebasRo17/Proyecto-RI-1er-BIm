In the following code:               <a onclick="javascript:alert()">      how do you name the `javascript:` part? Protocol, pseudo-protocol, scheme, label, prefix? I am only trying to figure out a common name for it, not technically correct term based on what it actually is at the end. So when I say for example "javascript protocol" most people would be able understand what I mean. (I need to use this in a documentation)
