I've tried animating two different sets of 3D plots. Interestingly, one plot will always work, regardless of whether I restart Mathematica, yet another plot will only work in its current Mathematica session. For instance, I have:               h = 1;     α = 1;     H = (1/2)*(p^2 + x^2);     rho[n_] = (1/Pi)*(-1)^n*Exp[-2*H/h]*LaguerreL[n, 4 H/h];     list = ParallelTable[Plot3D[rho[n], {x, -10, 10}, {p, -10, 10}, PlotRange -> All,     PlotLabel -> Style[n, FontSize -> 40], ImageSize -> 800,      AxesLabel -> {Style[x, FontSize -> 30],        Style[p, FontSize -> 30]}], {n, 0, 10}];     ListAnimate[list, AnimationRate -> 1, AnimationRunning -> False]      This yields: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/99THp.png): If I save my file and restart Mathematica, while none of my variables are initialize, the animation is still able to run. However, I have another piece of code to make a different animation:               Clear[n]     α = 0.15;     h = 1;     η = 1;     a = -n - Sqrt[1 + 16 r];     r = η^2/(4*α^2);     qrn = (1/2)*(n + 1/2) + (1/4)*Sqrt[1 + 16 r];     c = 1 - 2*qrn;          Clear[x, p]     ψ[p_] = (1/(1 + α*p^2)^qrn)*  Hypergeometric2F1[a, -n, c, (1/2) +    (I/2)*Sqrt[α]*p]          For[i = 0, i <= 2, i++, Clear[list2]]     For[n = 0, n <= 2, n++,      list2[n] = Append[list2[n],      ParallelTable[{x = RandomReal[{-5, 5}], p = RandomReal[{-10, 10}],        NIntegrate[        Exp[I*u*x/h]*         Conjugate[ψ[p + u/2]]*ψ[p - u/2], {u, -10000,          10000}, MaxRecursion -> 12]}, {40}]]] // AbsoluteTiming     Animate[ListPlot3D[list2[n][[2]], PlotRange -> All, ImageSize -> 400], {n, 0, 2, 1}, AnimationRunning -> False]      This gives: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IWGNy.png) After saving, and restarting Mathematica, I now get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fN0Ge.png) Creating my animation with 40 points only takes a couple seconds, so it isn't terrible that I'd have to recreate it. However my plan is to increase the number of points to more than 12000 and increase `n` to 10, which will take much more time than a couple seconds. Why does one animation run after re-opening Mathematica, yet another animation will give me an error message? As a related question, is there a way for Mathematica to always remember the values of my variables, even after restarting Mathematica? Thanks.
