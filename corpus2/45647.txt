Sorry I am not sure if I got anything wrong with this version of Mathematica and Mac OS X i am running. But every time I export a 3D graph, to png or tiff, I lost the view angle, view vector viewpoint information immediately. To let you know what I meant, here is a simple code: I typed:               x = RevolutionPlot3D[Sqrt[((t/5)^2 - 1)*2], {t, 5, 20}]      And I got a plot               out[1]=       ![Original Plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lv5O3.png) Then I manually rotate the plot so that it looks better, for example like this: ![Manually rotated view](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S5gyA.png) Ok, now, I used Export to export it to png:               Export["test.png", %];      What I got is pathetically, the un-rotated png plot!: ![Exported png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2r6GR.png) This is driving me crazy and dead.. I also tried to set Viewpoint and view vector, stuff to the code, it doesn't work for me either. I also tried Export["test.png",x] too, no luck. I understand I could easily right-click to save, But I need a background-none option to make the graph transparent.. Can any one confirm (this bug?) or i am doing something stupidly wrong? I checked the documentation and googled for 1 hour, nothing found. So the question is, how can I export the graph as it is shown on the notebook (if I can not, then what's the point of allowing us to rotate it..)
