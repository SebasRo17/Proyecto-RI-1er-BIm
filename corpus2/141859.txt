My question may seem silly, but, I've read in many Android books that the better part of Android is Android is open, and iOS is closed. But, from a programmer viewpoint, who cares about this point? Programmers just care about the platform: is it easy to program in, easy to have help in the network, etc. They don't care about whether the platform is open or closed. One book had additional information, but I don't understand it much. Since iOS is not open, Iâ€™d be able to share my work with others only if Apple allowed it. So, if you write an app, and need to share, you must have Apple's permission, but not Android's? Please help me understand this point. I'm preparing for a presentation on Android. And I don't know if I should put this point into my presentation.
