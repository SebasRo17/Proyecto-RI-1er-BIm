In this book review: http://books.slashdot.org/story/11/06/13/1251216/Book- Review-The-Clean-Coder?utm_source=slashdot&utm_medium=twitter > Chapter 4 talks about the coding process itself. One of the hardest > statements the book makes here is to stay out of "the zone" when coding. Bob > asserts that you lose parts of the big picture when you go down to that > level. While I may struggle with that assertion, I do agree with his next > statement that debugging time is expensive, so you should avoid having to do > debugger-driven development whenever possible. He finishes the chapter with > examples of pacing yourself (walking away, taking a shower) and how to deal > with being late on your projects (remembering that hope is not a plan, and > being clear about the impact of overtime) along with a reminder that it is > good to both give and receive help, whether it be small questions or > mentoring others. they talk about how 'being in the zone' - can actually be detrimental to the project. How do you convince your team members that this is the case?
