In the _CDF Infokit_ , one finds the `BriggsCochraneCalculus.cdf` document, which shows a textbook on calculus. I've got two questions about how it was made:   1. How has the bar at the top been made? Instead of the usual _CDF_ commands, like zoom, etc., one finds the title ( _Calculus_ , etc), the name of the author,...   2. How have the different subsections been made, so they could open and close while clicking on the text of the subsection (`"Tangent Lines"`, `"Tangent Lines and Rates of Change"`, etc)? I have tried looking into the `Opener` and `Button` documentation, but I couldn't remake this functionality...
