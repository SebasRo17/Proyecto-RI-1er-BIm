Bear with me, I'm a noob; I simply want to create a radio button bar that selects whether I want to add or subtract two numbers:               {RadioButtonBar[Dynamic[stringvar], {"*" -> "Multiply Numbers", "+" -> "Add Numbers"}]}      And my equation might simply be:               2 + 2      And I just want to change the + to a * interactively. Not sure if this is the right way to do it. Thanks.
