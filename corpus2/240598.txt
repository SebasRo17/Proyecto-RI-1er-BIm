I've developed for several web application projects for the last 3 years, both personal and at work, and I can't seem to figure out whether it's possible for at least _some_ business logic not ending up in the view layer of the application. In most cases there will be problems like "If the user has selected option x then the application must enable him to supply info for y, if not then s/he should supply info z". Or do some AJAX operation which should apply some changes to the model but NOT commit them until the user has explicitly requested so. These are some of the simplest problems I've encountered and I can't figure out how it's possible to avoid complex logic in the view. Most of the books I've read describing MVC usually showcase some very trivial examples, like CRUD operations that just update data on the server and display them, but CRUD is not the case on most rich applications. Is it possible to achieve having a view with no business logic at all?
