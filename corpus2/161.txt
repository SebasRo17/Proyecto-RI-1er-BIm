Mathematica's `Import` command is purportedly able to import .AVI files. However, I find that many files that I want to import do only result in MMA showing a blank frame or another placeholder. All or some of my video-players are able to show these AVI files. This is an example where it works as advertised:               Import["http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/jfkrice.avi", {"ImageList", 2}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oarxf.png) However,               Import["http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/avi/ccvt_box.avi", {"ImageList", 2}]      doesn't work (VLC does). I get an empty white frame. More examples:               Import["http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/avi/sine_wave.avi", {"ImageList", 2}]      (works on VLC and mediaplayer classic)               Import["http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/avi/star_collapse.avi", {"ImageList", 2}]      **BIG-126 MB!!**   Should have looked like this: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DZ32z.png) and works on Windows Media Player, VLC and mediaplayer classic, but I get a white box in MMA. This is on windows 7-64/MMA8.04. I have the k-lite codecs pack installed. * * * **UPDATE** Responding to Thomas' comment below I found most of the sample files I linked to in my original post gone. I tried to gather a new set and found some that worked and some that don't: Importable:               Import[#, "VideoEncoding"] & /@       {"http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/jfkrice.avi",        "http://redmine.yorba.org/attachments/615/MVI_0572.AVI",       "http://www-eng-x.llnl.gov/documents/a_video.avi",       "http://redmine.yorba.org/attachments/628/MVI_4981.AVI",       "http://www.csoft.co.uk/video/original/earth.avi",       "http://www.mysticfractal.com/video/fp.avi",        "http://www.softage.ru/files/video-codec/uncompressed/suzie.avi",        "http://archive.org/download/Architects_of_Tomorrow/2007-12-10-02-39-00.avi"}      > {"msvc", "MJPG", "msvc", "MJPG", "msvc", "msvc", "YUV", "Uncompressed"} Don't import:               Import[#, "VideoEncoding"] & /@      {"https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/export/7213/trunk/opencv/samples/cpp/tutorial_code/HighGUI/video-input-psnr-ssim/video/Megamind.avi",       "http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/avi/verona60avi56k.avi",       "http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/avi/filedoesitbetter.avi",       "http://www.infognition.com/ScreenPressor/browsing-divx.avi"       }      > {"XVID", "MP42", "MJPG", "DX50"}
