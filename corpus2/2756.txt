Coding standards are common in any software development organization, but how important are they to follow? I can understand the need for some consistency, but when dealing with simple things like the position of braces, line length, etc., I'm not sure excessively strict standards contribute much to software development. Isn't it more important that your code is readable, not that it conforms to a predefined standard? It seems they're more like... guidelines anyway.
