I've been very interested in writing compilers but have been scared off by the complexity of it. I've finally took the plunge and started writing my first compiler and the language I picked is Brainf*ck as I think that it would relatively easy to implement and I could implement the full language. This brings me to a question: does the source language matter? Should I be using a "real-world" language and just use a subset of the language (such as a subset of C/Java/etc.)? Is there any benefit to starting with a non-real world language (aka "esoteric")?
