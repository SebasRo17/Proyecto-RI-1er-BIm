I'm developing a software package and would like to make it (and the source) available for personal, academic, or educational use, but _not for commercial use_. Is there such a license? Ideally, it should be reciprocal, so that if someone publishes a modified version, they'll have to grant the same rights. Alternatively, would it be possible to modify the GPLv3 in such a way that it forbids commercial use and grants rights only to non-commercial users?
