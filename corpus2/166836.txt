I have to develop 3 different sites   1. video.com for hosting video    2. audio.com for hosting audio    3. docs.com for hosting docs. _domain names for example only_ Almost 80% of the functionality is the same for all the three, with remaining 20% being completely different features... How do I handle this? How does sites like SO handle this? I am developing this in YII framework and was thinking of having these different features as modules but in this case the menu/code links in html code can become difficult.
