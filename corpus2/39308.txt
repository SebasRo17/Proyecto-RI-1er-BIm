I want to sort table including its legend for graph I have table similar to               M1   M2   M3      1     5    2     3     1    4      4     2   -10     5     7    11     6    -2    1      I want the labellings `M1`, `M2` and `M3` to move with the first row of numbers while sorting by row basis.                   M1   M3   M2          1     2    5         ...........          ...........      OK The code is below               (* Initial matrix *)     h = {{M1, M2, M3}, {1, 5, 2}, {3, 1, 4}, {4, 2, -10}, {7, 5, 11}, {6, -2, 1}}      then sorting by basis `h1 = Sort /@ h` gives                M1,   M2,  M3      1,    2,  5      1,    3,  4      -10,  2,  4      5,    7,  11      -2,   1,  6      I want `M1`, `M2` and `M3` to be together with the fist row of numerical values since they are labellings attached to the first numerical values of each column AS               M1   M3   M2      1     2    5      ..... .... In that way it will be easy to put the legend in graphs
