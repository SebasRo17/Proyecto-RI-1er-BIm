I am preparing a short (1-2 hour) presentation about DIP to several (~5) junior developers (1-3 yr xp) in the office. At the end of the presentation I want to know whether they understood what I was presenting, what are some possible questions that I ask in order to figure out their understanding? Maybe something that can be answered and explained by them in 3 minutes or less?
