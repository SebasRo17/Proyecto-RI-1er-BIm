I am preparing for a technical interview and need to review the basics of major operating systems concepts. We used Tanenbaum's Modern Operating Systems in school for our operating systems course, which is a good book, but too long to be reviewed in the course of a few days. For an example, I am looking for what Programming Interviews Exposed is to Weiss's Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis. Any suggestions?
