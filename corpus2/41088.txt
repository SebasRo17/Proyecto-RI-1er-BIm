I am wondering why _Mathematica_ outputs that the following system "cannot be solved with the methods available to Reduce". $\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2}+n)}{n-1}<\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{2}+k)}{k-1}$ with $k, n \in N$. I used the command               Reduce[Gamma[1/2 + n]/(-1 + n) < Gamma[1/2 + k]/(-1 + k) && k > 1 && n > 1, {n}, Integers]      and tried unsuccessfully to solve for $k$ and $n$. I suppose, I do something improper and _Mathematica_ is capable to solve those kind of inequalities. So, what did I do wrong?
