I would really like to get out of the 9-5 "cubicle" existence and do something where I can work from home, take off when I like, etc. Don't get me wrong... I don't mind working hard, but I just am not enjoying the whole corporate thing where my hours, vacation days, dress code, place of work, etc. are set. I really think this is possible because other developers are somehow pulling this off. But so far it is just in the "dream" stage and I have no idea how to move it forward. I don't know if I want to be freelancer, start my own company or what. In case it matters, I have been working in .Net / MVC for the past few years (both desktop and web) but have experience with other languages as well (Java, C++, Perl, etc.). I don't have much experience with "web design" side of things since in all my jobs other people have handled that while I have worked on the "programming" work. Just to make it more concrete what I want... I wake up on a random Tuesday in June and it's a gorgeous day. I am ahead of schedule on my projects and I don't feel like working ... I want to go hiking. I want the freedom to do that without dealing with some PHB. Another scenario... I do feel like working but I want to go visit an old friend or relative for a week in Bismarck / Budapest / Boston. Said friend has reliable Internet. Why can't I do that? I'm not talking about being irresponsible just a bit more free.
