Not a trial, but a truly free version that they offer users to download.... I was wondering in case I somehow missed the option on their website. Any version of Visual Studio will do. If not, are there any open-source alternatives (that have similar functionality, or possibly degraded equivalent) of Visual Studio? I am running on Windows 7 if that makes any difference...
