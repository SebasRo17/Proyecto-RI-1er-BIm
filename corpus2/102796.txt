I've been the lonely programmer in my work for quite a long time. Usually I've read articles and posts about   * Version Control Systems   * Continuous Integration/Delivery   * Development methodologies: Scrum, Waterfall, V-Model, Agile, XP, etc.   * Software Project Management But almost all of them seem to be focused on TEAMS. I'm not a team, so what would be the absolutely minimum set of practices for just one programmer? Consider the following conditions:   * I don't have conflicts with other's people code.   * I don't need to maintain files/directory trees, my developement environment cares about versioning by itself (image-based development).   * There are no formal requirements, my users don't know what they want and they're are ok with that.   * The only one which could be interested in delivering a release or documentation it's me, basically customer want RESULTS and doesn't care about software methodologies, etc My view is that I don't want to spend (too much) time and energy in anything not directly related with the customer requirements. Any recommendations?
