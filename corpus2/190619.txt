I've written a patch for a GPL'ed JavaScript library. To check how the patch works one needs sample CGI (or PHP) backend. I want to write a demo PHP to show that my JS works and put the open code on my site. The question: What it the best way to have PHP on server both executed and viewed as the source? Note that recently I have ordered a Virtual Private Server with a 5 Gb disk, so there are no troubles with installing new software (if any needed) for me.
