I have an expression which is the sum of many terms of the form $$ \frac{0.00000000274341}{(0.000363856+(0.611425+z)^2)^{3/2}} $$ My problem is that I need to include this long expression in a C++-program I made, so all the exponents $^2$ and $^{3/2}$ I need to bring on a C++-compatible form. If I use `CForm`, then the exponents become `pow(..., 2)` and `pow(..., 1.5)`, respectively. In order to speed up my program, I would like for all the `pow(..., 2)` expression to be converted to `(...)*(...)` and for the `pow(..., 1.5)` to be converted to `(...)*pow(..., 0.5)`. Is there an easy way to do this?
