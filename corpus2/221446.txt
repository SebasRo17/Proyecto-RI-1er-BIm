I am writing a paper on the tension between OOP and Generic programming created by Stepanov. He widely criticizes OOP and says it is "technically flawed" when compared to Generic Programming. Now I know we have plenty of programming languages that support OOP exclusivley and have no Generic support including Google GO for example, that is a modern language that they chose not to implement Generics because of their complexity. I know we have plenty of languages that support both Generics and OOP, for example C++ and Stepanov's famous STL library. _My question is:_ **Do we have any modern programming languages or any at all that support Generics exclusively without OOP?** _EDIT: I would like to add I tried looking around and cant seem to find much so I figured I would ask here._ Just to add that when I refer to Generic vs Object Oriented Programming I am refering to: Generic Vs Object Oriented Programming On the Tension Between Object-Oriented and Generic Programming in C++
