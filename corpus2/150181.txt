I have recently finished an undergraduate course in computer science and I am looking for a job. During the search I encountered several interesting (and tough) problems that needed clever algorithms to solve. I also use google code jam as a practice set. I cannot understand how those solutions translate in solving real world problems. Many problems appear (to me) not only contrived and fantastical but also highly specific to be a general purpose solution (although it isn't impossible to extend them using ingenuity). Are these problems there only to test the problem solving skills or are these some aspect of real world problem camouflaged?
