Is it exists any alternative to SIP protocol? I want implement voice & video chat option in my application. I don't want use SIP, because I need only simple communication without call for landlines etc. It seems to me, it maybe doing with sockets, and audio records, but I'm not sure. I care about the fact that many people (for example 1000) could simultaneously carry on a conversation. Is it possible on regular server? Is it at all possible without a server? Best regards.
