It is clearer how to interview someone experienced in Java / C++ or other languages closer to C#. In these cases the language and specific technologies are less important; what matters are the OOP principles. But how to do it with someone that comes from Progress to .NET and also, me as an interviewer, not knowing Progress at all? How much does Progress experience count for .NET/C# or OOP? Are there programming principles in common between the two worlds? Are these realy two different worlds?
