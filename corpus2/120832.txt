I am new to web development and trying to study various types of websites as case study. Right now my focus is on how search engines works for an eCommerce website. I know basic functioning for a search engine, i.e. crawl web pages, index them and the display the results using those indexes. But I got little confuse in case of an eCommerce website. Don't you think that it would be better if a search engine instead of crawling the web pages containing products, it should directly crawl the database and index the products stored in the database? And when a user search for any product, it will simply give us the rows of the table which matches the user query? If this is not the case, can someone please explain how the usual method works on eCommerce website?
