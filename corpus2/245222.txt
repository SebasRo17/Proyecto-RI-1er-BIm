I have to develop a taxonomy/classification program based on classification algorithms and i would like to have some suggestions. The aim is to help the one using the program to categorize an object (could be a plant, a coin, an animal,...) and to teach what to look for in every step. The program is likely to be coded in PHP. The algorithm also should be able to be module based (multiple types of classification can exist at a determinare level and types of classification should be interchangeable). Example: ![Example of classification](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N8rrC.jpg) Should the program/algo be object oriented? can it be imperative (if/else, case)?
