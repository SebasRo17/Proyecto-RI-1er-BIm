I see that some software have the version number included as a part of their file name, while others do not. I am more used to the latter type, and I think that is more popular, but I see the former type sometimes in javascript libraries. For example, jQuery's file name is like `jquery-2.1.0.js` instead of `jquery.js`. Whenever I update these types of files, I have to look for the places in other programs that load these files, and change the file name they refer to, and manually delete the older version of these libraries. That is inconvenient to me, so I rather rename the file to exclude the version number, and keep the file name referred to to not include the version number. I suspect that these numbers are for some kind of version control, but am not clear when and how they are used.   * What are the pros and cons for including version numbers in the file name?   * Is there de facto consensus on which areas of software or languages use version number in the file name, and which areas/languages do not? If so, is there any rationare for that?
