I have a domain where an `Organization` has `People`. **Organization Entity**               public class Organization {         private readonly List<Person> _people = new List<Person>();              public Person CreatePerson(string name) {             var person = new Person(organization, name);             _people.Add(person);             return person;         }              public IEnumerable<Person> People {             get { return _people; }         }     }      **Person Entity**               public class Person     {         public Person(Organization organization, string name) {             if (organization == null) {                 throw new ArgumentNullException("organization");             }                  Organization = organization;             Name = name;         }              public Organization { get; private set; }            public Name { get; private set; }     }      The rule for this relationship is that a `Person` must belong to exactly one `Organization`. The invariants I want to guarantee are:   1. A person must have an organization     * this is enforced via the Person's constuctor   2. An organization must know of its people     * this is why the Organization has a `CreatePerson` method   3. A person must belong to only one organization     * this is why the organization's people list is not publicly mutable (ignoring the casting to List, maybe `ToEnumerable` can enforce that, not too concerned about it though) What I want out of this is that if a person is created, that the organization knows about its creation. However, the problem with the model currently is that you are able to create a person without ever adding it to the organizations collection. Here's a failing unit-test to describe my problem               [Test]     public void AnOrganizationMustKnowOfItsPeople()     {         var organization = new Organization();         var person = new Person(organization, "Steve McQueen");              CollectionAssert.Contains(organization.People, person);     }      What is the most idiomatic way to enforce the invariants and the circular relationship?
