When starting a new software project that will be used on several platforms, how do you determine the best way to start development? Do you develop for one platform and then port to the next? Do you try to develop all platforms simultaneously? For example, I'm going to start developing a Windows Phone app in C#. Much of my code could theoretically be reused with the .NET Framework and Silverlight. However I find that as I try to develop on all platforms simultaneously, refactoring and redesign tends to be 3 times as difficult and slow. I could try writing my app for Windows Phone and then port to other platforms, but I have no ideas what hairballs await me there, and it seems like there would be a lot of potential for design decisions to bite me in the bum only after I start porting. So which is better: develop the code for all platforms at once, or refactor and port to new platforms one at a time? What traps await me on either road?
