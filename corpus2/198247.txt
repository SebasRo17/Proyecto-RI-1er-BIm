I am pretty new to Web Application programming and so to **OOP** Javascript and the new **Client-Server** interactions. I am encountering some trouble wondering about how much **AJAX** I should use or how much data I have to save "locally" . Explainig it better: at the moment , to manage the data that I obtain from AJAX request , I push them in **Data Structure** like **Array's** and then I handle them helping myself rendering html through template. Now, was I wondering : is all this necessary? Do I really need to store all this data in Data Structures or I can make AJAX call for every action users do on my application? I apologize for the explanation but it's a difficult concept for me to explain in English. Thanks in advance
