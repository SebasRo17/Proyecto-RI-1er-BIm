I have a table with 3 columns - x position, y-position and colour. I'd like to plot these points and join them with line segments, where the colour of the line segment is determined by 3rd variable. e.g.               T=Table[{n,n,n},{n,0,100}];      I can plot just the points like this               Graphics[{Hue[#3/Length[T]], Point[{#1, #2}]} & @@@ T, Frame -> True, AspectRatio -> 1]      How can I plot line segments instead? Thanks!
