A few months ago I discovered a cool course called Rails for Zombies. This is a great site that allows us to write code and see the results. It takes us through the paces to get us up to speed with Rails. You have to pass each level (including code challenges) before being taken to the next level, and it gets you grounded in the fundamentals of Rails. I'm wondering if an interactive tutorial site exists for Javascript? One that will walk me through the paces of writing better Javascript, and challenge me along the way.
