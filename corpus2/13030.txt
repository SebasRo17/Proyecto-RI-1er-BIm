At work, we were discussing when is it the best time to change to winter tires for bikes and/or cars. Using `WeatherData[]` and `DateListPlot[]`, it was fairly straightforward for me to create the diagram below: ![Mean temperature per day in Stockholm](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5wNT.png) _Fig 1 Mean temperature per day in Stockholm, red is negative and a risk without winter tires._ The code for this is               cityTemp = WeatherData["Stockholm", "MeanTemperature", {{1977, 1, 1}, {2011, 12, 31}, "Day"}];     iceRiskDays = Select[cityTemp, Last[#] < 0 &];          yearStrip[ dataItem_] := {{0, Part[First[dataItem], 2], Last[First[dataItem]]}, Last[dataItem]}          DateListPlot[{yearStrip[#] & /@ cityTemp, yearStrip[#] & /@ iceRiskDays} ]      My question is: **How do I calculate for each day the proportion of values for that day that are below 0 Celsius?** (e.g. for a date at the end of November, the proportion is likely to be bigger than 0.5)? My attempts to do this ended with trying to create separate lists for each date, but I felt that this was a less elegant way and also creates less "fit" with DateListPlot.
