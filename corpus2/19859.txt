I need to save data that _Mathematica_ uses inside the `Plot` command. The format that I would like to have is:               x1 y1     x2 y2     .....      i.e. basically, two columns, _x_ and _y_ (sorted, if possible) so that I can use the data for other programs. I already played with `Export` and got the data enclosed in `{}` and tons of other information I don't need: color, axis, _etc._ What is the nicest way to do what I am trying to do?
