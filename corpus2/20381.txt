I am trying to use a `Module` having "local functions", i.e., those which I need to define only inside this module. So I tried this:               norm[p_] := Module[{       fun1[p_] := p^2 + p - 1;       fun2[p_] := p^3 - p^2 + p + 1      },      Max[fun1[p], fun2[p]]     ];      The function is compiling, but when I try to evaluate it--say, I try:               norm[2]      Its giving me an error telling: > `Module::lvsym`: Local variable specification > `{fun1[p_]:=p^2+p-1;fun2[p_]:=p^3-p^2+p+1}` contains > `fun1[p_]:=p^2+p-1;fun2[p_]:=p^3-p^2+p+1`, which is not a symbol or an > assignment to a symbol How do we avoid this error? I want to give functions in the space between { ... }.
