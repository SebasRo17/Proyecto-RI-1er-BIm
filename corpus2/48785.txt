I will reformulate my question in the hopes it will be more intelligible. First, I defined the functions:               f1[r_] = b*SphericalBesselJ[l, α*r];     f2[r_] = c*SphericalHankelH1[l, I*β*r];          g1[r_] := D[f1[r], r]/(f1[r]);     g2[r_] := D[f2[r], r]/(f2[r]);      And I want to set:               f1[a]==f2[a]      g1[a]==g2[a]      Is it possible to use these two equations to find another equation that relates Alpha, Beta and a?
