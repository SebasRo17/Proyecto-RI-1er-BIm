I use Interpolation on unstructured 3-D-Data to visualize different regions via RegionPlot. A problem I run into is that the interpolating function steeply drops to zero beyond my set of data. This is unfortunate, as I with to show the region up to their theoretical boundary (which lies only a little bit beyond the data region). Is there a way to get Interpolation to perform a proper extrapolation for just a little margin beyond my data? This image shows the problem pretty well I think. ![Example for the problem](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfzTz.png) The data that produced the image can be found here
