I have two level EventHandler. The inner one is made of vertex of Graph and the other outer one is of the Dynamic Graph. (1) If I select a arbitray place on the Graph except a vertex, then every thing is OK, but (2) if I select the vertex **after restart this code** , then dragging process is sttoped I don't know why it is doing like this. If I remove MouseDown of **vertex eventhandler** in this code, then the process is ok. but I want to make some action after vertex MouseDown. Is there something help! thank you.               DynamicModule[{vlist, elist, p, mousep, select},      vlist = EventHandler[#, {           "MouseDown" :> AppendTo[e, 1],           "MouseDragged" :> AppendTo[e, 2]}] & /@ Range[3];      elist = {1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 1 -> 3};      p = {{-.5, -.2}, {.5, -.2}, {0, .5}};e = {};      EventHandler[       Dynamic[        Graph[vlist, elist, VertexCoordinates -> p, VertexSize -> {.15, .15},          VertexLabels -> "Name", PlotRange -> 1]],       {"MouseDown" :> (AppendTo[e, 3];          mousep = MousePosition["Graphics"];          select = Position[p, Nearest[p, mousep][[1]]][[1, 1]]),        "MouseDragged" :> (AppendTo[e, 4];          p[[select]] = MousePosition["Graphics"]),        "MouseUp" :> (Print[Short[e, 1]]; e = {})}, PassEventsDown -> True]      ]
