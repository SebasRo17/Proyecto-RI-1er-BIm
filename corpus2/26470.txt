I am using Mathematica version 7. I have an expression named `fd` and I took the derivative of `fd` with respect to `t` which I will note the outcome as `Dexprdt`. Basically, I am trying to understand if `Dexprdt` is negative or positive (Comparative Statics) and in order to do this I have the following set-up which was proposed here by b.gatessucks and it works really well. `solPos` shows the logical expansion which makes `Dexprdt` positive. However, as seen in the below code there are 2576 possible combination of solutions and I only want to extract the solutions (inequalites) where `Y1`, `Y2`, `a`, `b`, `d`, `p` are **positive reals**. I tried to use `Pick` command and it was not really useful. I really need help with the methodology. Here is the code:               Remove["Global`*"]     q = 1 - p;     fd = (b d (p - q) Y1 Y2 (p Y1 - q Y2) + a p q t (Y1 + Y2)^2 (p (-1 + Y1^2) Y2 +      q Y1 (-1 + Y2^2)))/(a p q t (Y1 + Y2)^2 (p (-1 + Y1^2) Y2 + q Y1 (-1 + Y2^2)));     expr = FullSimplify[fd];     Dexprdt = Simplify[D[Numerator[expr], t] Denominator[expr] -      Numerator[expr] D[Denominator[expr], t]];     (*Normally in Dexprdt we should have D[Denominator[expr]^2 dividing \     but since it is always positive it is enough to check the Numerator \     of the derivative*)          solPos = LogicalExpand[Reduce[Dexprdt > 0, Reals]]     (*solPos is the possible solutions that makes Dexprdt positive*)          solPos // Dimensions;     (*{2576} - number of possible solutions*)          (*N[Dexprdt]/.First@FindInstance[solPos[[1]],{Y1,Y2,a,b,d,p}]*)     (*5.59992*10^11*)
