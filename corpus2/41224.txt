I am using this technique to find the PR of these 3 pages. It converges to something it shouldn't be. I tried the same iteration in Java and 2 pages come up with 1.333 and the other one as 0.666. Mathematica is calculating something differently. Here's my code:               g = {"Netscape" -> "Amazon", "Netscape" -> "Netscape",         "Amazon" -> "Netscape", "Amazon" -> "Microsoft",         "Microsoft" -> "Amazon"};     pr = PageRankVector[g]     GraphPlot[g,       VertexRenderingFunction -> (Text[          Framed[#2 <> "\n" <>             ToString[pr[[#3]]], {Background -> RGBColor[1, 1, 0.8],             FrameStyle -> RGBColor[0.94, 0.85, 0.36]}], #1] &),       DirectedEdges -> True]
