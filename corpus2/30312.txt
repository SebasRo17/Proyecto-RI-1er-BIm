It is well-known that for any positive integer $n$ the equality $\Gamma(n+\frac12)=\sqrt\pi\,(2n-1)!!/2^n$ holds, where $!!$ stands for the double factorial. I am using `FullSimplify[expr,Assumptions -> n \[Element] Integers]` on certain expression `expr`, and the output contains $\Gamma(-\frac12+n)/\sqrt\pi$. My question is: how can I instruct Mathematica to perform the simplification "$\Gamma(n+\frac12)=\sqrt\pi\,(2n-1)!!/2^n$ whenever $n$ is a positive integer" ? Of course, I want an answer no limited to this specific situation. **Edit:** What I want is to "add" the simplification rule above to the list of simplifications included in `FullSimplify`, not merely "replace" the "string" $\Gamma(\cdots)$ by $\cdots !!/\cdots$.
