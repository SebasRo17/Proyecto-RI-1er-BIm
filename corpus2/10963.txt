I'm new to _Mathematica_ and am unfamiliar with the notebook interface. I haven't been able to delete cells with error messages. For example, when I try to ask _Mathematica_ to compute something, it returns a message like > Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve when it fails. Once I see that, instead of proceeding to the next line, I would like to highlight that error message (along with the erroneous command) and delete it. But _Mathematica_ won't let me do it. How do I do this the right way?
