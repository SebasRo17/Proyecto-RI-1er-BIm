I have an issue with NDSolve for the case of a PDE with discontinuous initial/terminal condition. Consider the PDE solution               Z=z/.First[NDSolve[{       D[z[t,x],t] == z[t,x] D[z[t,x],x]-1/2 (1-t)^2 D[z[t,x],{x,2}],       z[1,x]==UnitStep[x],       z[t,-5000]==0,       z[t,5000]==1},       {z},{t,0,1},{x,-5000,5000}]]      The terminal condition is the discontinuous UnitStep function. When I plot the solution for t=1 now,               Plot[Z[1, x], {x, -10, 10}]      ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5d344.png) Mathematica has obviously smoothened the terminal condition (which was explicitly given by the UnitStep function). Is it possible to disable this smoothing? Or at least, I want to have a smooth function that does not exceed 1 and does not go below 0. Note: What I am not searching for is a solution like "increase the MaxSteps" or something similar. I am interested in options on how Mathematica processes the initial/terminal condition. Thanks a lot for your help!!
