Since the function `GeometricBrownianMotionProcess` is given by _Mathematica_ I have some technical questions. If we consider the following example:               ListLogPlot[Table[RandomFunction[     GeometricBrownianMotionProcess[0.5"(*" σ"*)",".4(*" μ"*)",10"(*" Startingvalue"*)"],     {0"(*" StartingTime"*)",14"(*" EndingTime"*)",".005(*" ΔTime"*)"}]["Path"],{1}],Joined→True]      whereas `S` constitutes the starting value. Does this given function consider the following dynamics: $dS(t+1)=μS(t)dt+ σS(t) dB(t)$ Whereas $S(t+1)$ is determined by $S(t+1)=S(t) e^{(r-1/2 σ^2 )t+σB(t)}$? If yes, is it possible to change the given `GeometricBrownianMotionProcess` which is represented by `Bt` and split it up into two processes such as, for example, $B_t= \sqrt{ ρ} W_{t0} + \sqrt{ (1-ρ)} W_{ti}$ Where $W_{t0}$ and $W_{ti}$ are independent standard Brownian motions Here $ρ$ is, for example, the mutual dependence among two variables created by the latent variable $W_{t0}$. So is it possible to change the `GeometricBrownianMotionProcess` function this way or do I have to generate two independent Brownian motions and merge them together into $B_t$?
