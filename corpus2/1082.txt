(I'm navigated from stackoverflow.com where I asked almost the same question) When I want to use additional windows, let's say for example "Basic Math Input", I feel reluctant to find visually where they are in the display. So I tend to "re-open" them by clicking "Palette" -> their name. However, when I do so, the window rearranges its position and goes up too high so that its bar (and often even some region of it that contains function panes) doesn't appear like this figure. !["Basic Math Input" windows lies left.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bh8ll.jpg) "Basic Math Input" windows lies left. With this, I have no way to move this window. Luckily all function panes are shown so it still provides all functionality but like I said earlier some panes hide often. Tedious workaround on Mac is to arrange the displays (I'm using multiple displays) whatever. Then window's bar appears like this: ![After arranging displays' position, the bar of the window appears.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CeWs1.jpg) Is there any easier way to resolve this? I've seen this happens to many other additional windows that are available in "Palette" section. ( **Environment** ) Mac OSX 10.7, Mathematica 8.0.4 Student Edition I've tested Ubuntu linux 11.10 with 2 displays, and it doesn't give the same issue.
