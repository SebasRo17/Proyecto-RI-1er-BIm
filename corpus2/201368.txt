This has happend to me more than once, thought someone can give some insight. I have worked on multiple projects where my project depends on external service. When I have to run the application locally, i would need that service to be up. But sometimes I would be coding to the next version of their service which may not be ready. So the question is, is there already a way that can have a mock service up and running that i could configure with some request and responses? For example, lets say that I have a local application that needs to make a rest call to some other service outside to obtain some data. E.g, say, for given a user, i need to find all pending shipments which would come from other service. But I dont have access to that service. In order to run my application, i need a working external service but I dont have access to it in my environment. Is there a better way rather than having to create a fake service?
