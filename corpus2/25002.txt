I have a list, e.g.:               list = {1, 2, 3, "Element 1", 4, 5, "Element 2", "Something else 1", "etcetera"}      Now, I want all elements starting with `"El"`. Using `Position`, I could find the position of e.g. `"Element 1"`:               Position[list, "Element 1"]      But, I would like to know the positions of `"Element 1"` and `"Element 2"`, as both start with `"El"`. So, I would like to have something like               Position[list, "El"_]      I just can't get something like this to work. Thanks for any help.
