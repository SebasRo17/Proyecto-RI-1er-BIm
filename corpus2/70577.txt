I maintain a LGPL library for rapid development of large scale .NET applications, It's a general purpose class library containing functionalities that are used at the DAL and BLL level. So, in practice, it's a library focused towards server-side/middle-tier developers - it doesn't have any shiny or trendy stuff and as such I don't expect it to ever become majorly popular. However, I would really like to expand the library and get more ideas for possibly useful functionalities to add. Larger, more user oriented libraries have a ton of users and a ton of ideas. How do I get more people to contribute ideas for my more _niche_ library?
