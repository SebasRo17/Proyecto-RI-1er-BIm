I need to trace the moving of an object and get the coordinates of such movement. The set of coordinates will be used for the subsequent evaluation and analysis. I can easy get the current real-time coordinates by use of the following expression:               Dynamic[ImageKeypoints[EdgeDetect[CurrentImage[], 30], "PixelPosition"]]      But I need to record all these coordinates in the list in the separate cell or in separate file. I need that this list contains an cumulative set of all coordinates, frame by frame. Please, suggest how to resolve this issue.
