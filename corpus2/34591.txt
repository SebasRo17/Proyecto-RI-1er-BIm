I am trying to plot a simple graph using `Plot3D`:               Plot3D[0.25*(1/(1 - 0.9* (1 - bn))) ((1 - bn)/(1 - 0.5* bn))^2, {bn, 0, 1}, {bu, 0, 1},        RegionFunction -> Function[{bn, bu}, bn > bu]]      Which gives the output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v7i1L.jpg) Why is there a triangle where `Plot3D` keeps the function flat while it is clearly increasing. Here is the graph without limit on the region: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/txYbz.jpg) I also tried different approaches. For instance:               Plot3D[0.25*(1/(1 - 0.9* (1 - bn))) ((1 - bn)/(1 - 0.5* bn))^2*If[bn > bu, 1, 0],        {bn, 0,1}, {bu, 0, 1}]      with even worst outcome: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RSrBR.jpg) Many thanks for your help.
