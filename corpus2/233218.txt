I am a junior dev, I am on a team with an internal ticketing system (more/less) I want to improve our monitoring so that I can tell when functionality on my app is broken. current alarms only alert if the web site is hard down. I want to alert if clicking on a link causes a 500. I am having a hard time finding other teams that are implementing what I am asking, and the only documentation I can find is the ASP.Net health monitoring overview from http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb398933.ASPX#Features and i was wondering if there are any examples you're aware of? The existing teams suggest making a timer that waits 2 minutes and does something to check health and reports up to another server if it's alive or not - how can I make a method that... more accurately checks health of my web app? is there a way to simulate a function and see if it breaks or not?
