I learned at the University some steps to model a database:   1. Model the problem using the _Extended Entity-Relationship Model_.   2. Extract the functional dependencies    3. Apply some algorithms to normalize the database ( _3NF_ or _Boyce-Codd_ )   4. Create the database I'm studying **Computer Science** and since I received that course I'm wondering if I always need to do those steps when creating a ~~complex~~ database for an specified problem. For example, do **PHP** / **.NET** / .. programmers always do that? or there are some tools to simplify that process, maybe using another way of represent the problem instead of the _EERM_?
