I want to perform a simple analysis of some Greek text: collect the different words used and count their frequency. It seems that some of the built-in commands do not work well with Greek letters. For instance, with               words = StringCases["α β1 rpr other", WordCharacter ..]      the output is               {"1", "rpr", "other"}      How do I get _Mathematica_ to recognize other kinds of words?
