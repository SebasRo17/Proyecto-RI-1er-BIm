Are short identifiers bad? How does identifier length correlate with code comprehension? What other factors (besides code comprehension) might be of consideration when it comes to naming identifiers? Just to try to keep the quality of the answers up, please note that there is some research on the subject already! **Edit** Curious that everyone either doesn't think length is relevant or tend to prefer larger identifiers, when both links I provided indicate large identifiers are harmful! **Broken Link** The link below pointed to a research on the subject, but it's now broken, I don't seem to have a copy of the paper with me, and I don't recall what it was. I'm leaving it here in case someone else figure it out.   * http://evergreen.loyola.edu/chm/www/Papers/SCP2009.pdf
