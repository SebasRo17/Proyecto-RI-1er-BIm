I want to compose a string that contains newlines, so I tried the following:               ToString@StringForm["SomeText='`1`'\[NewLine]as well as OtherText='`2`'.", "textA", "textB"]      I would expect this to produce a string that looked like:               SomeText='textA'     as well as OtherText='textB'      Instead, I get a string that looks like               SomeText='textA'                      textB'.                     as well as OtherText='           Directly entering the string `"SomeText='textA'\[NewLine]as well as OtherText='textB'"` gives me the correct result. What is going on here?
