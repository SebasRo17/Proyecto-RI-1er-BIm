Often, with a `Plot` or within `Manipulate` I want to display a graph and, in close proximity to it, a table showing the results of relevant computations. The quickest way to do this is with `GraphicsColumn`, but that always seems to create cells of identical height and width, which is usually not what I want. Here is a trivial example:               Manipulate[      GraphicsColumn[{Plot[Sin[x + c], {x, 0, 2*Pi}],         TableForm[{{c}}, TableHeadings -> {{"c"}, {"value"}}]}], {c, 0, 3}]      ![GraphicsColumn makes me sad](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tgeha.jpg) Is there some other convenient way to place the table below the graph without an ocean of whitespace, or a way to specify that GraphicsColumn can use cells of differing size?
