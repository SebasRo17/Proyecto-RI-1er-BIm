Since a year I am a graduated Computer Engineer, and am now working in named field since 2 years. However, I'd like to get a Masters in a "softer" field and was thinking over the following choices:   * **MBA** : Master of Business Administration, to bridge the business world with the world of computer science. Would give me an interesting job, travel potential, high salary etc.   * **Techno-MBA** : Sort of an MBA, but aimed at people who already have a degree in Computer Science.   * **HCI** : Human Computer Interaction degree, something I have been **very** interested in, but feel like it doesn't have the growth potential of MBA/Techno-MBA   * **Marketing** : My most recent brainchild is a degree in Marketing, is this at all a good idea given my background? Growth potential? Main priority: Gaining a skill, and gaining a job allowing me to use my social skills. Which path has the best "career potential"? (Controversial I know) Any thoughts? Any feedback welcome. Edit: DOH. Realized that the first sentence makes no sense. Was running my own semi-successful business during last year of school.
