I am hoping to find an easy tool or method, that allow's managing our code deployment. Here are the features I hope this solution has:   1. Either web-based or batch file, that given a list of files, will communicate to our production server, to backup those files in different folders, and zip them and put them in a backup code folder.   2. Then it records the name, date/time, and purpose of the deployment.   3. Then it sends the files to their proper spot on the production server. I don't want too complex an interface to doing the deployment's because then they might never use it. Or is what I am asking for too unrealistic? I just know that my self-discipline isn't perfect, and I'd rather have a tool I can rely on to do what needs to be done, then my own memory of what exact steps I have to take every time. How do you guys, make sure everything get's deployed correctly, and have easy rollback in case of any mistakes?
