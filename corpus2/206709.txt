In my everyday work and on my free time, I tend to discover/learn/find pieces of information that can be really useful if used at the right moment but also really easy to forget and/or to find again when it's required. To give you examples, I am thinking about things such as :   * nice algorithms or concepts from a book   * crazy options for a compiler   * neat online tools such as interpreters/compilers.   * snippet of codes   * documentation of different languages   * programming tips from a forum and/or SE.question   * page of an interesting github project As you can imagine, most of them could be saved as bookmarks but not all of them. Also, bookmarks wouldn't have any explanation/documentation/tagging/nice formatting around it. At the moment, I was thinking about creating a plain HTML page or a personal wiki to keep everything somehow organised. Thus, I was wondering which support/tool programmers were using to keep that kind of resources handy and easy to find when required and how they were organizing them?
