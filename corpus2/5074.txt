What are the preferred use cases for the following sets of terms:   1. Log in / Log out   2. Log on / Log off   3. Sign in / Sign out   4. Sign on / Sign off From what I can guess, "Logging in" should be used for a long-lived session (like a website), whereas "Sign in" should be for something that you will be attending to (like IM or a financial transaction). I'm a little fuzzy here...
