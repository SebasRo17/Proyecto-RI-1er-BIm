Are visual program control flow diagrams and languages which support that used for larger serious programs? Why not? They seem like a nice overview of the code. In the thread What software programming languages were used by the Soviet Union's space program? a visual language is mentioned (Drakon) and I wondered why such approaches aren't used more often? Is there nothing a visual control flow representation (I don't mean class diagrams etc.) which are 1-to-1 with code can help compared to typing in letters in an editor?
