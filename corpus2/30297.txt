Is it possible to run unit test while a debug session is already open in Wolfram Workbench 2.0? A typical use case follows: I have a debug in Workbench session open. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6GR8p.png) I evaluate some cells in a sample Notebook. Find some bugs, fix them and write the unit test. Now I would like to run the unit tests. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eApfH.png) But Workbench says ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bAQav.png) If I terminate the Mathematica session, than the kernel state is lost and I have to re-evaluate all the notebook cells.
