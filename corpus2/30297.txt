In legacy code I occasionally see classes that are nothing but wrappers for data. something like:               class Bottle {        int height;        int diameter;        Cap capType;             getters/setters, maybe a constructor     }      My understanding of OO is that classes are structures for data _and the methods of operating on that data._ This seems to preclude objects of this type. To me they are nothing more than `structs` and kind of defeat the purpose of OO. I don't think it's necessarily evil, though it may be a code smell. Is there a case where such objects would be necessary? If this is used often, does it make the design suspect?
