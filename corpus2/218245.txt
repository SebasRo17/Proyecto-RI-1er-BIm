My office has a suite of web reporting engines written in VB. All in all there's about 300 reports with varying displays depending on the data being input into them. I'm trying to establish an efficient way to deal with such a major diversity, but am struggling with creating a system that won't be a nightmare to code/maintain. What I've considered doing is:   1. On program launch, read the steps required for each test page. This may have multiple tests for the same page with varying inputs.   2. Write each iteration of the test in XML file under $env:temp/testname   3. Use the TestCaseSource attribute of Nunit to funnel every related xml file as a source. My major stumbling block has been how to get that data to the Nunit framework. Is Nunit really appropriate for what I'm trying to do, or is it too static?
