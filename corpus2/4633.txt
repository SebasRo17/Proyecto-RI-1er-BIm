How do I instruct Agglomerative clustering to stop/NOT merging two particular clusters if the distance between the two clusters is larger than a threshold value? I know that we can implement a custom distance measure and a custom linkage function. Distance measure says how to measure the distance between any two data points. So even if I implement a custom distance measure, it just says what is the distance between any two data points. Where in the code should/can I mention a threshold value, that if not met, should prevent thw clusters from being merged. Thus, at the end, if only two clusters are remaining, and if the threshold value is not met between these two clusters, then these two clusters should not be merged into one global cluster. Is this possible in Mathematica?
