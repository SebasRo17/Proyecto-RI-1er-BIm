I've built a flatfile db system that will work like mini-noSQL system and it split db to smaller files, and I did a SplFixedArray wrapper for it with a method for searching usage built on preg_grep. Everything working very good till now, but if the array became more than billions of indexes how to handle it? When searching it, it will iterate over the small files then get the matches and put it in a temporary fixedArray so, what if it found very large matches? How the noSQL dbms do that? NOTE: If you wonder why I do that without a real noSQL solution, I'll say because I want to know more.
