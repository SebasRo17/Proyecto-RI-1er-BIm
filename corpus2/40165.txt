If I have assigned values to `a`, `b` and `c`:               a=7;     b=5;     c=6;      and I select the expression:               (a+b)/c      and I press `cmd + enter` in the Mathematica frontend, the expression will be replaced by `2`. I would like to do something similar which would fill in the values of the symbols without evaluating the result. So `(a+b)/c` would be replaced by `(7+5)/6`. Is there a way of doing this? If so, can you also assign this to a keyboard shortcut that would replace the selected expression? **Note:** Assume you don't know the values or the names of the variables. Inputting `(a+b)/c` to a function, should be able to produce something like `(7+5)/6` without having to input `a`, `b` and `c` or `7`, `5` and `6`.
