I have a lot of calls to `NSLog(...)`. I need to change all of these calls to `CLSNSLog(...)`. So I added this to my precompiled header (.pch):               #import <CrashlyticsFramework/Crashlytics.h>     #define NSLog(...) CLSNSLog(__VA_ARGS__);      Everything works. I don't see any drawbacks to this -- the team can continue to use NSLog(...) and I can revert pretty easily. But am I missing anything, or are there any design issues this will create later on?
