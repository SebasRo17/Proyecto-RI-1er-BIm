I've solved some equations using `FindRoot` and then computed some values. Now when I print the output, I only get a certain precision > {{0.01, 496.983, 61.3147, 80., 0.047},   >  {0.02, 496.983, 61.3147, 80., 0.047},   >  {0.03, 496.983, 61.3147, 80., 0.047},   >  ...   >  {0.18, 496.97, 61.3142, 80., 0.047001},   >  {0.19, 496.969, 61.3141, 80., 0.0470011},   >  {0.2, 496.968, 61.3141, 80., 0.0470012}} But when I copy and past the individual numbers, say the 61.3147 in the first two rows, I get > 61.314699633952216`   >  61.31469210981553` What can I do to increase the precision of the visible output so I can eyeball it?
