I have a problem that I am trying to work on. My Folder structure is like this.   * Application(MainDirectory)   * AppData( Secondary directory where files are Design.m, Layout.m, and Evaluation.m)   * Data(Another directory where datafiles are excel cheets, csv sheets, etc) The design.m file calls for an `listTabValues = Import[FileNameJoin[{DirectoryName[NotebookDirectory[], 1], "data", "VariableNames.xlsx"}]]` to access data in the files of the Data folder. I have a notebook in the Application(Main Directory) where I do `Get[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[], "AppData", "Design.m"}]]` to get the contents of the Design.m file. The problem is when I evaluate in this manner, the `NotebookDirectory[]` is set to the Application(Main Directory) and the design takes the same value and not the AppData directory as the `NotebookDirectory` where the Design.m files resides and the data access fails. Any way to wok around this?
