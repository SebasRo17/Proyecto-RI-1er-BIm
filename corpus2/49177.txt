Suppose you have the following:               tt = Table[{i, j}, {i, 0, 10}, {j, 0, 10}]      The table `tt` is a matrix of pairs, `{i, j}`. Now you issue               ArrayPlot[tt]      you get a nice image with the top row and the rightmost column white. How does `ArrayPlot` work in this case? I tried to look into the `ColorFunction` documentation but I was not able to actually understand how the system is working. I am curious to find an explanation.
