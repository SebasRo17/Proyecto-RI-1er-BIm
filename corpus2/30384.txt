I want to test the value of a differential equation by replacing a solution and setting random values for r and z variables:               sol = ψ -> Function[{r, z}, Sinh[2 (r + z)^2] + Tan[4/3 + r] + 5 (-r + Tanh[1/r])];          de2 = 1/(4*r^2) - D[ψ[r, z], z]^2 + D[ψ[r, z], z, z] + D[ψ[r, z], r]/(2 r)+ D[ψ[r, z], r]^2 +  D[ψ[r, z], r, r];      If I set for example:               N[de2 /. sol /. r -> -9 /. z -> 4]==0      I get a false result. The value is a very large negative number (-3.16913*10^29). If I set:               N[de2 /. sol /. r -> -90 /. z -> 4]      I get 0.*10^12836 in red, and a message saying "No significant digits are available to display." If I compare this last command to zero:               N[de2 /. sol /. r -> -90 /. z -> 4]==0      I get True! What's happening? How could I prevent this from occurring? Not using PZQ because it is too slow for the number of tests I want to do.
