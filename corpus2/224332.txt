I have a business requirement for a javascript "write once run everywhere" App. I did research and discovered that there are a few options between: FireFox OS, ChromeOS, NodeOS, Tizen, and Dart. What I do not know - is if 1) this software is truly capable of allowing a single website to be written once and exported to Hosted or Packaged Native Apps. 2) Can a single JavaScript Website really traverse device-platform as a Native App via this breed of JavaScript Operating System or not? 3) Is it simple, or is it painful? Has anyone seen a full implementation first hand in at least a test environment or production? Also - are the upsides expected or unexpected - and what are the downsides? Overall: is JavaScript write once run everywhere - or not? To the point it isn't 'Native' - I found these. Apple iOS7 JS first-class citizenship. Last month. http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/detail/32624 It is called JavaScriptCore framework. I installed a FireFox OS Open WebApp with emulator. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Quickstart/Build/Your_first_app I don't know what these are, but it was easy and it looks cool. Like a website packaged into a Native App. Has any one reviewed this class of JavaScript Architecture?
