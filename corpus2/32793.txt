I'm basing this on the code found in the _Introduction to Dynamics_. I added one more slider which doesn't use the "round and snap" feature given in the link above:               DynamicModule[{x = 0},      Column@{Slider[         Dynamic[x,           If[Abs[# - Round[#]] < 0.3, x = Round[x], x = #] &], {0, 5}]        , Slider[Dynamic[x], {0, 5}]        , Dynamic[x]        }]      When sliding the second slider, I would have though the first one one stay snapped until `x > 0.3`, but that is not the case: the first slider moves together with the second one. Is the update function **only** evaluating when the first slider is moved?
