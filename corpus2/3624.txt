How to programmatically convert an operator such as `Equilibrium` into its displayed form as a string? The conversion should work like this:               FullForm[convert /@ {Equilibrium, LongRightArrow, LeftVector, Equal}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sY9L8.png) I've tried various methods with no avail:   * converting to strings and wrapping in `"\\[...]"`   * using different form wrappers (`DisplayForm`, `TraditionalForm`, etc.)   * using low level boxes, but since that is really not my alley, I was a bit clueless   * since operators with built-in meaning are used too, argument usage does not seem viable (e.g. `ToString[Equal["", ""]]` which returns `True`)
