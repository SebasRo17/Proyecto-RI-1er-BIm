* I notice that off all the `Method` options available for `NDSolve[...]`, `LSODA` is invoked quite automatically for stiff equations when `Method -> Automatic`. Is there a way to set the `Method -> LSODA`? I ask because as `LSODA` switches between Adams' and Gear's method, it should have sub-options to it that I could set (like order etc.)?   * Under `tutorial/NDSolveStiffnessSwitching` I encountered `Needs["DifferentialEquations`NDSolveProblems"]`. What other example problems are available and where can I find documentation on them? * * * Edit (03/24/2011): In light of comments made to this post, I'd also refer readers to page 409 of "The Mathematica Guidebook for Numerics". Springer has this book online and can be found here.
