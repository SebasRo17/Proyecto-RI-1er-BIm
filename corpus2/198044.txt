Suppose I have a web app where sellers add their products and set them as available for sale. Then I show a list of products in my mobile app, where I get products via my REST API. My problem: suppose two clients view the same product(and there's only 1 item available from the seller) and they make simultaneous order. How do I resolve such collision? My technology stack: RoR, PostgreSQL, heroku.
