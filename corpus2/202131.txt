I'm wondering how responsive design plays along with the Separations of Concern principle, in respect of how we're allowing a single implementation behave for multiple presentation devices (mobile, tablet, browser sizes etc.). Is it breaking the principle? If I make changes to a web page that I know is behaving responsively and should work on 5 devices for example, am I not making the development extremely difficult due to possible regression that can occur from a single place in the software? Sure it's making me write less code and work a lot faster on multiple devices, but now each one of my pages requires potentially much more thorough testing, which is the cost I could move to not using a responsive web framework and maintaining separate implementations of a page.
