I have a matrix in 2x2               a ={{x, y}, {z, u}}      I want to expand this matrix 3x3               b ={{x, y, y}, {z, u, x}, {z, x, u}}      4x4               c ={{x, y, y, y}, {z, u, x, x}, {z, x, u, x}, {z, x, x, u}}      5x5               d ={{x, y, y, y, y}, {z, u, x, x, x}, {z, x, u, x, x}, {z, x, x, u, x}, {z, x, x, x, u}}      and soon... Basically, I am adding a row and column each time. How to do this automatically, without writing each time? * * * **Edit:** Now consider x, y,z and u are also 2x2 matrices. Lets               x={{0,1},{1,0}}, y={{1,1},{1,0}}, z={{1,0},{1,1}}       and                u = {{p,q},{r,s}}.      How I can get a,b,c and d (defined above) in this case?
