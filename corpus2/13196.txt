Are there other fonts that can be used for mathematical symbols? I have noticed, that choosing another font (via Stylesheet) does not change the math font (e.g. for greek symbols). Symbols will just stay the same most of the time. I suspect that MMA is just substituting missing symbols in the new font with the ones from "Times" (or an internal one, surely it is "Mathematica1"). Choosing "Courier" will result in different greek symbols, this is the only one I found. Which fonts include the neccessary symbols?
