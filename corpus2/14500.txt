I am trying to evaluate a highly oscillatory integral using **NIntegrate**. I fear that due to limited resources (time and/or memory), I will not be able to evaluate the integral to the desired precision. Thus, I would like to **programmatically access the error estimates** that are e.g. reported by the messages **NIntegrate::maxp** , **NIntegrate::ncvb** , or **NIntegrate::eincr**. I could not find an option of NIntegrate that would directly make these error estimates available. However, given that I have to evaluate a multitude of integrals, it is impractical to obtain the errors from the warnings by hand. The following example generates the NIntegrate::maxp message (obviously this very integral has an analytical solution):               NIntegrate[Sin[x]/Sqrt[x], {x, 0, 100}, Method -> "MonteCarlo",PrecisionGoal -> 6]      > NIntegrate::maxp: The integral failed to converge after 50100 integrand > evaluations. NIntegrate obtained 1.1787733508261242`and 0.07678430788995934` > for the integral and error estimates. How to get (if necessary, extract) the error estimate (0.07678430788995934`)? Remark: The example from the help of NIntegrate::eincr, i.e. ref/message/NIntegrate/eincr, does not produce the expected message in version 8.0; unfortunate my integrals still do.
