A very long time ago I used _Mathematica_ for a few months and found it very intuitive. Now for my work I use _MatLab_. I was just trying some stuff out with _Mathematica_ again and there is something I cannot quite get the hang of. I import a stack of images. Then I want to know the dimensions of my stack, but when I use `Length` or `Dimensions`, it only lists the number of images. Also when I use `?` it not only shows me information, but it also plots every single "image" in it, which takes very long. My question here is how to get the image size(s) for the imported stack of images?
