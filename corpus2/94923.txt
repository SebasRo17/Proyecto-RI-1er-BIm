I recently began working with version control in my web-development using subversion. This works great for managing the files I develop but does nothing for the changes I sometimes need to make to the databases. To my knowledge the server I'm working on doesn't have any DB management systems in place and I likely wouldn't be able to get them to install anything. What options are there for managing DB's in this kind of environment?
