Every week, I have a 30 minutes meeting scheduled with my manager to talk about pretty much anything. So far, I haven't taken those one-on-one very seriously. As a new year resolution, I would like to take more seriously my one-on-ones with my manager. One way I though I could do that is to plan in advance (come up with a list of questions and/or agenda) my one-on-one. With the exception of the status report, what subject do you discuss with your manager during a one-on-one? Have you ever seen an agenda for one-on-one?
