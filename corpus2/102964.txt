I'm a Python programmer that prefers to develop on Windows but still end up deploying to a Linux server. I've just finished writing a little script: stuff that downloads files from a site, generates a sitemap, gzip it, pings the search engines and emails the response code. Nowadays most GNU tools are available and compiled also for Windows and I sure do use Wget and Grep whenever I need to. Until now I've always tried to implement the functionality I needed in Python (gzipping and opening urls require very few lines of code) but I found myself thinking if maybe I could write more resilient code if I didn't reinvent the wheel and just scripted everything in a bash script style where a big part of the functionality is delegated to an external process such as mail, wget, curl, etc and the other tools *nix makes generally available. What is your take on this? When you target *nix do you glue tools together or you tend to implement all the functionality in your scripting language of choice?
