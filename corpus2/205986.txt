What does "(say)" mean in this Java method? > Since `Mapper` and `Reducer` are separate classes, the type parameters have > different scopes, and the actual type argument of `KEYIN` (say) in the > `Mapper` may be different from the type of the type parameter of the same > name (`KEYIN`) in the `Reducer`. For instance, in the maximum temperature > example from earlier chapters, `KEYIN` in replaced by `longWritaeble` for > the `Mapper` and by `Text` for the `Reducer`.
