The downsides of Mainframes is well trodden ground; expensive, legacy, dwindling community, etc. I'm not particularly interested in the downsides, but I am curious if there are any benefits to mainframe hardware/software over the current Intel/AMD & Linux/Windows environment. I've been told that MFs are particularly good (and better than current servers) at heavy I/O loads. Is this still true?
