I am trying to start a freelancing career on oDesk. One of the potential employers offered me somewhat of a dream job: it's game development for an established company. The pay seems to be right (although it's too early for precise estimates). The company's website seems rather cool, and the game I would be working on appears to live and prosper. I also made a point to ask and was told that they are using an incomplete, custom-made VCS; that sounds both awesome and horrifying to me. My main objection is that I am a little bothered by the employer's writing style. Their vocabulary seems to be fine, but in some cases their grammar is poor, and typos are abundant. This _appears_ to be carelessness rather than a lack of linguistic ability. Don't get me wrong: when the job is right, I would communicate in l33t sp34k if that was the only way to get information across. I'm not a native English speaker myself, and when speaking casually, I don't really care about others' linguistic ability. What I am worried about is if I should take this as a red flag that things will go wrong in other areas of our relationship as well. On the other hand - they're game developers, and they are probably making a great game. A large part of me wants to go there - fast, so I'm inclined to ignore my objections and accept the job. What do you think?
