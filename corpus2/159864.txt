I think this is best described using an image.   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/d48nw.png) So it dawned on me that perhaps this isn't the best or most logical way to organise files.   The way it is currently, as you can see is just a dumping ground. The only reason `complexify` has it's own folder is that it's a submodule in Git. So should I be using a `/lib` folder with `jquery` & `jqueryui` and perhaps a `/plugins` with all the plugins in? Where would my files live? Are there any accepted practises for file structure in this situation where you have a core library, a number of plugins and then some of your own code? _PS, I realised just now I have two copies of jQueryUI._
