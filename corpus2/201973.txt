I have been messing with code in The Unix Archive and have found that most of the code references a (non existent) license, however, this is in the root of the mirrors and apparently covers all of the code (typed from a PDF, so excuse the typos): (source pdf is here > The following copyright notice applies to the source code files for which > the license is granted. > > Copyright(c) Caldera International Inc. 2001-20012.

Is this an open source license? It kind of seems to be very BSD-ish, with the exclusion of the clause "all advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgement: this product includes software developed or owned by Caldera International, Inc" Does that clause prevent this from being an open source license?
