Have an Excel spreadsheet that summarizes various key metrics for the business. The source data for these metrics comes from various sources including other spreadsheets, and web/ERP systems. A suggestion was made to completely automate the whole data retrieval/population into the spreadsheet. For this type of tool (only a few users) I prefer a copy-paste approach so that the users are actually looking at the data and making sure it is correct. What reasons can I give that a full automation is not a good idea?   * linking Excel spreadsheets requires that the source spreadsheet doesn't change   * Excel can export CSV files from the ERP system but this would require a macro -> can the users maintain the macro   * ? **UPDATE1:** Forget to mention that this process is a stop-gap until a data warehouse is built later this year. Following the suggestion of the accepted answerer it appears that the full automated answer would take weeks more effort then the few hours per month that the copy-paste method would take.
