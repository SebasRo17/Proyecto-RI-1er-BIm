I was reading a paper from Mathematica Journal.It mentions a code for calculating subsets.                   subSets[s_List] := Variables /@ (Expand[Times @@ (1 + s)] /. Plus -> List) // Sort      Then it mentions the following code as optimized code,               subSetsV[s_List] :=  Distribute[{{}, {#}} & /@ s, List, List, List, Union] // Sort      My problem is I could not get both of these.Can someone please help me with bit of explanation of these snippets.
