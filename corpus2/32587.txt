I have a list of variables (`c1`,`c2`,`c3`,`c4`), each with its own range of possible values and each being a possible control. I need to pick two of them and make the remaining ones controls in a `DynamicModule`. I tried to use suggestions from here but I didn't mange to make the last step work.               DynamicModule[{allC, lC, fC, sC},       allC = {{{c1, 1, "c1"}, {1, 2}}, {{c2, 10, "c2"}, {10, 20}},                {{c3, 100, "c3"}, {100, 200}}, {{c4, 1000, "c4"}, {1000, 2000}}};       lC = Range[Length[allC]];       With[{controlGenerate = Function[{var, initialValue, str, range},                                          Control[{{var, initialValue, str}, range}], HoldAll]},         Column[{controlGenerate[fC, 1, "First", lC],                 controlGenerate[sC, 2, "Second", DeleteCases[lC, _?(MemberQ[{fC}, #] &)]],                 (* The line below works as I expected *)                 Dynamic@allC[[DeleteCases[lC,_?(MemberQ[{fC,sC},#] &)]]],                 (* The line below doesn't work as I intended *)                 (controlGenerate[#[[1, 1]], #[[1, 2]], #[[1, 3]], #[[2]]] & /@                                      (allC[[DeleteCases[lC, _?(MemberQ[{fC, sC}, #] &)]]]))                 }                ]       ]     ]
