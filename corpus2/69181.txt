My cousin has got his offer letter from a software company (he got placed while in his final year of engineering), but the company has said that he'll have to wait for an unknown number of months before he can start working. In the meantime, he's decided to work at some other company because he does not want to while away his time. If he works in some other software company (thru one of his Dad's contacts), will his experience count? Will it be worth it for him?
