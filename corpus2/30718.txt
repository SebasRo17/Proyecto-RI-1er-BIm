The function `Nest[]` must store the temporary values in the memory somewhere (those values that would form the entries of the list which is returned by the equivalent `NestList` function). Does anyone know if there is a way to access said values in an interrupted evaluation (using a kernel subsession)? Alternatively, is there a way to know all temporary variables currently in use and to print out their values?
