It seems that frequently in large projects the software is still released with the bug tracker full of bugs. Now I can understand feature requests, but several times I've seen large numbers of bugs still unresolved, not reviewed, or not finished but a release is still pushed out. Why? Why would an open source project or a project in general be released with **known** bugs? Why wouldn't they wait until the bug tracker had 0 opened bugs?
