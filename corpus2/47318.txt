I am new to _Mathematica_ and now I could use some help. Trying to plot any of these functions generates a `$RecursionLimit` exception and I am wondering why.               G[y_] := 0.7 G[y - 1]     G[0] = 100;          J[y_] := 0.1*G[y - 1] + 0.6 J[y - 1]          H[y_] := 0.2*J[y] + 0.8*H[y - 1]     H[0] = 0          Plot[ G[x], {x, 0, 10}]      > $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded. >> Evaluating any of `G[2]`, `H[4]`, `J[3]` works fine. Any ideas would be much appreciated :)
