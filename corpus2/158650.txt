Consider a UML Action contained in a UML Activity defining the behavior of a classifier. Such Action has three input pins connected to other output pins of different action by means of object flow edges. It also has an incoming control flow. My question is: does the action start when all the tokens _ those coming from all the input pins and that coming from the control flow _ are available? What if I have more than one control flows?
