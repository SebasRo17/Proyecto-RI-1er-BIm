In recreational mathematics, polytans are polygons formed by edge-connecting isosceles right triangles. Order- _n_ polytans are those constructed from _n_ such triangles. My question is this: Given a set of _n_ angles and an N x N grid, how do I draw a graph using a set of angles? I am trying to find if the angles form the perimeter of a polytan (i.e., given a starting point on the plane, does progressively iterating through the angles get me back to the point of origin?). For example, given these three sets: {{270, 315, 315}, {315, 270, 315}, {315, 315, 270}}, the output would show two isosceles right triangles: {270, 315, 315} and {315, 315, 270}, and one non-polygon: {315, 270, 315}, as seen in the image below. In the image, the initial reference line is {{0,0}->{0,1} (on the y-axis), and the point of origin is {0,1}. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UWuss.png) I need the constructions to be graphs so that I can check whether two polytans of the same order are identical, but just in different orientations (like the two triangles in the image). Vertex count, vertex degree, edge-connectedness, etc., would also be useful.
