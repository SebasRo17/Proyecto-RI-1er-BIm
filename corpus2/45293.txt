I am using halirutan's code in this thread to unflatten a list. It works very well but the problem is that the Module's local function `f` is not deleted when the function returns the output and I consequently end up with hundreds of thousands of copies of the symbol of the form `f$xxxx`, which eventually crashes Mathematica. I tried other solutions from the same thread, but they don't seem to work. Is there any workaround?
