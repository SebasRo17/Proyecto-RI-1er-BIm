I want to define two subscripted functions `Subscript[f,1]` and `Subscript[f,2]`. To keep the assignments local, I would like to associate the definitions with `f` if possible. My current solution is to write the following.               f/:Subscript[f,1]:=Function[x,g[x]]     f/:Subscript[f,2]:=Function[x,h[x]]      The resulting definition is stored as an UpValue for `f`, which is acceptable for me. Is it possible to construct a similar definition using pattern matching? I am looking for an analog to the following pair of definitions.               f[x_]:=g[x] (*definition 1*)     f:=Function[x,g[x]] (*definition 2*)      In other words, I am currently using a definition akin to definition 2 above for my subscripted functions. Is it possible to write a definition analogous to definition 1 above?
