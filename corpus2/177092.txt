I mean, say you were writing professional grade software that would involve sensitive client information. (Take this in the context of me being an amateur programmer.) Would you use hlib and hmac? Are they good enough to secure data? Or would you write something fancier by hand? Edit: In context of those libraries containing more or less the best hashing algorithms in the world, I guess it's silly to ask if you'd "write something fancier." What I'm really asking here is whether it's enough on its own.
