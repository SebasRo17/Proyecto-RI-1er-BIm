In the past usually I have only had to estimate web applications based on browser support. But for more recent projects device and platform support are also very important as well (screen resolution). I am having a hard time providing an estimate to account for "responsive design". How much additional time (estimate only) is needed to account for this over the entire implementation of a web based project?
