I am nowhere near good at coming up with what type of license to use and I don't want to be sued or have my work stolen so I am going to ask. Here is my situation: I am creating a software for my boss and the YMCA which helps keep track of our employees, their students, and the amount of lessons they have remaining (In a nutshell but the program is much more extensive then that), I am spent almost 100 hours creating it and its not completely done. Some of the hours spent were at work while being paid (Not sure if that plays a factor). Here is a list of conditions that I desire:   1. My software to not be redistributed in any way without my knowledge and written consent.   2. To not be liable for any damage it causes, for maintaining the software, or for its success.   3. I do not want the software to be sold without my knowledge and consent either.   4. I want the software to be closed sourced. If there is a way I can have all of these in my software licensed I would be grateful, also if someone could explain to me where I need the license displayed and if it needs to be in the source code (since I am having it closed sourced).
