I have a typical Spring/Hibernate Tomcat webapp that has a user_info table. Iâ€™m trying to create another webapp that will do CRUD actions on the user_info table. I'm considering sharing the same database between the two apps. The apps will use C3P0 for database pooling. What is the best way to test the performance and any issues (e.g. locking) that could arise from sharing the db with another app?
