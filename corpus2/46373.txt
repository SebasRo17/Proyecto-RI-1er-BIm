I'm making on a demo working with differential equations as functions of two variables (x and y). The demo will have to Fold the differential equation with an initial y-value and a series of x-values. Here's a simple code for the demo. The output should be a list on new y-values.               DynamicModule[{dydx = Null},      Deploy@     Panel@     Grid@     Transpose@     {{"Differential equation: (dy/dx)=",         "List of Slopes:"},       {InputField[Dynamic[dydx]],         InputField[Dynamic[FoldList[dydx, 1, {0, 1, 2, 3}]]]}}]      The code doesn't work because dydx cannot be applied as a function in FoldList. "dydx" needs to be defined as a function f[y_,x_]. However, I'm not sure how to dynamically change a function using InputField.               f[y_,x_]= dydx     FoldList[f,1,{0,1,2,3}]      I'd like to have this as part of the Dynamic Module. Users would be able to input a function then receive a list of new y values.   Any advice?
