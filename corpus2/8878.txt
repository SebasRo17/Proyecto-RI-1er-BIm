We can restrict the **movement** of locators in a `LocatorPane` as follows: ![locator movement](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Is904.png) In the following example, the first locator's movement is confined to the x-axis and the second locator's movement is confined to the y-axis.               Manipulate[LocatorPane[Dynamic[pts],       Graphics[{}, PlotRange -> max, Axes -> True, ImageSize -> 350],      {{{-max, 0}, {max, 0}},      {{0, -max}, {0, max}}}],     {{pts, {{9, 0}, {0, 11}}}, ControlType -> None}, Initialization :> {max = 25}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NvUL8.png) However, a locator can be dragged without necessarily being selected. You can begin dragging a locator by clicking down on just about any point in the four quadrants and dragging from there. I would like to have the locator respond only to drags that are initiated by "mousedown"ing on the locator itself. Any ideas as to how I might achieve this? * * * **Addendum** In my the more complicated example I've been working with, I've made use of jump parameters to confine locators to integer values:               {{{-maxX, 0}, {maxX, 0}, {1, 0}},     {{0, -maxY}, {0, maxY}, {0, 1}}}      I'm not sure whether such constraints (to integers) can be imposed on locators outside of `LocatorPane`s.
