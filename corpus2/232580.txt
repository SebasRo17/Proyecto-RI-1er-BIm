You can read the following article to understand the difference between QA and testing (quality control): http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alanpa/archive/2006/02/26/539527.aspx What I'd like to understand is whether there is a place for QA engineer who is not a tester in Agile/Scrum. Agile is deliberately short on processes and documentation (its even in the manifesto), and that's what QA specialize in. So should there even be a QA engineer in Agile? I myself am not a QA engineer (I am a test lead), but I have a friend who is, so that's why I am asking.
