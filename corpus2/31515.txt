I have a large text file. I read data from text file one at a time and check whether data agree with my condition. If not I want to delete that data in text file and update it. For example say my data text file is: 100 201 302 455 Suppose I want to delete second one. After deletion I want new text file to be look like 100 302 455 (without any gap between 100 and 302). Since my text file is large around 100MB, I want to read data one by one rather than loading all at once. Thanks
