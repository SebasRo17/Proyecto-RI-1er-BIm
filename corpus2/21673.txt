I have a `DateString` calculated in English. Now I would like to change the output according to localization. I have read that localization is possible for Menu, Messages and Cells. A simple `$Language = "French"` before calling `DateString` is ignored. Since this should be a basic feature for localization, I am wondering if my keywords for Google and SX are just plain wrong? Or is this feature not present?
