Let be given the complex number $z$ satisfying the condition $|z-2+2i|=2\sqrt{2}$. I want to find the complex numbers $z$ so that their modul obtain least and greatest value. I tried. Put $z = x + y i$. From $|z-2+2i|=2\sqrt{2}$, we have $$|(x-2) + (y+2)i|=2\sqrt{2}.$$ Therefore, $$(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2=8.$$ And then, I used               Maximize[{x^2 + y^2, (x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 == 8}, {x, y}]      > {32, {x -> 4, y -> -4}} and               Minimize[{x^2 + y^2, (x - 2)^2 + (y + 2)^2 == 8}, {x, y}]      > {0, {x -> 0, y -> 0}} I dont know why I can not use the command               Abs[(x - 2) + (y + 2) I]      to find the modul of `(x - 2) + (y + 2) I` and how to tell _Mathematica_ to get the result $$(x-2)^2 + (y+2)^2=8$$ when I have $$|(x-2) + (y+2)i|=2\sqrt{2}.$$
