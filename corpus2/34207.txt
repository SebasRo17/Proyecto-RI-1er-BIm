I have an array which is defined as a table, e.g.               g = Table[ cos[l1*3.]*sqrt[l2*1.]*l3 + l1*1 , {l1, 0, 3}, {l2, 0, 3}, {l3, 0, 3}];      then, I need to save it in the following format               1 1 1 g[1,1,1]          ...          i1 i2 i3 g[i1,i2,i3]      If I do something like               Do[ Export[ file, {i, g[[i, 2, 3]]}], {i, 1, 4}];      then it saves only the last line for `i == 4`: > >     4 >     3 + 2*cos[9.]*sqrt[1.] >   Another "subquestion" - is there a way to convert the `Table` to float? `N` doesn't help.
