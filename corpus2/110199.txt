I have a class with one public method `Send()` and a few private methods. It calls a couple of webservices and processes the reponse. The processing is done in private methods. I want to unit test the code. My understanding is that unit tests should test my code in isolation (ie mock up supplier responses). I also believe that private methods should not need to be unit tested But if I just test the Send() method my code isnt being tested in isolation and is dependent on the supplier resonse. Should I then make my private methods public so I can test them with mock responses? It seems bad practice since I only the class should need to call them. Apologies if its a basic question, im fairly new to unit testing. Im using c# and VS2010
