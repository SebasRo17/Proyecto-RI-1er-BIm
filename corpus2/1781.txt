A planar graph is a graph that can be drawn in the plane such that no two edges cross. For example, the graph `Graph[{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}, {2, 4}}]` is planar, and can be shown in both of these ways: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wQa6X.gif) The layout in the left doesn't have crossing edges and it's immediately obvious that the graph is planar. The layout on the right is what Mathematica gives me by default. **Question:** How can a planar graph be shown without any crossing edges in Mathematica? * * * I expect `Combinatorica`` might have this feature as it has a `PlanarQ` function, but unfortunately the documentation is not included with Mathematica and I have not been able to find out how to do this. Testing whether a `Graph` is planar is possible like this:               << GraphUtilities`     PlanarQ@ToCombinatoricaGraph[someGraph]      Note: The above way of testing planarity is for version 8 or earlier. The `PlanarGraphQ` built-in function was introduced in version 9. * * * Here's a random set of planar graph of different sizes to test on:               << ComputationalGeometry`     graphs = DeleteDuplicates[        Flatten@Table[          Graph@           Union[Sort /@              Join @@ (Thread /@                 DelaunayTriangulation@RandomReal[1, {j, 2}])],          {10}, {j, 4, 10}          ], IsomorphicGraphQ];      * * * To avoid confusion, I'd like to note that the `ComputationalGeometry`PlanarGraphPlot[]` function does not do what I need. It does not lay out a graph. One needs to provide an explicit list of vertex coordinates to it. I have a graph as the input, I know that it's planar, and need a layout algorithm that will draw the graph without intersecting edges.
