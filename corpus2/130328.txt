I'm building a grants management system where we're trying to find a list of lost users using a number of different means. The first attempt is email but if we do not have an email address, we will try SMS. Just wondering, before we get our business guys to start thinking up SMS messages, is there a maximum length or something which I should stay within to reach every phone with SMS capability? Taking also in account that whilst we won't be sending an SMS to international numbers, a lot of the users will be from foreign countries and may have a foreign cell phone. Also, messages will only ever be in English.
