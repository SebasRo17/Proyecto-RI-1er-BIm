I'm in discussion with a company for a full-time web development position. Since the position would require telecommuting or a relocation of my family, we've agreed on doing 2-4 weeks of contract work as a sort of evaluation period. Now they're asking what I would like my contract rate to be. I know generally what I'd like my salary to be, should this progress to the full time job, but I have no idea how that translates to the contract work. Taxes are different (I'm in the U.S.) and there are no benefits since I'm not yet an employee. Should I aim about on par with the salary I'm eventually hoping for, or do I need to adjust upwards to make up for taxes, etc.? (Or would I be expected to adjust down, since this is a sort of extended interview process?)
