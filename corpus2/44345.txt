Given the following connection to an SQL query works but the data comes out wrong:               data = Table[SQLSelect[conn, "All", {"col1", "col2"},         SQLColumn["col1"] == n && SQLColumn["col2"] ==  o], {n, 1, 8}, {o, 21,         30}];      If I do not use the 'Table' function, I get the expected results by inserting the actual numbers after == when running the query. I need to create a 54 x 289 table from my data and obviously for this large data set this will be impractical to key in and export piece by piece. Any suggestions?
