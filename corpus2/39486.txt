I'd need to write an interactive plot. I have some function I defined and some point lists I get from external data file. I'd need to see those data along with my functions, and I know how to do that. However I would also like to have a checklist, and by clicking over each button I should be able to show/hide a function or a data point set. I don't need the full code, just a hint about how to get a checklist, and how to make it dynamically affect the function I'm plotting would be great!
