**Probably unnecessary detail:** So here's what I'm envisioning. I have several outputs from different calculations (perhaps several ListAnimated tables of GraphicsGrids of plots). In one, I did all the calculations with x=0.13 and everything is a function of y. In a second output, I set y=0.36 and everything is a function of x. Now I want to produce a single box with perhaps tabs at the top that lets me switch between the different outputs. In the limited case above, I could accomplish the whole thing with another nesting of ListAnimate, but what I'm really going for here is something more general. What I would like to be able to do is something like "OutputTabbedPane[{%487, %488, %496}]" and have it produce a single box or whatever that combined the (already computed, possibly long-time computations) outputs and let me click and cycle through them. Pipe dream? Anyone know how to move in this direction?
