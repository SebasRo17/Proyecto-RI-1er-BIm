I am working with a function in Mathematica and I am getting some inconsistencies when I plot it. As I really need to understand were this comes from I would appreciate any help. I am working with a function of the following form: `f2b[b_] = Exp[-1000 - 2 Sqrt[1000*b] - b]*(Erfi[Sqrt[1000]] - Erfi[Sqrt[1000] + Sqrt[b]])` From my understanding this function should go to zero for very small b because both parts, the Exp function as well as the difference between the imaginary error functions, should vanish. Mathematica calculates: `f2b[E^-30] // N = -3.4517046881*10^-7` as expected. BUT if I plot this function: `Plot[{f2b[E^b], 0}, {b, -50, 0}, PlotStyle -> {{Blue, Thick}, {Red, Thick}}]` ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TH6M2.png) Mathematica shows me a plot which is approaching a value of about -0.0175 for small b and has therefore an absolute value much larger the the value at E^-30 calculated above. If I tabulate, interpolate and plot the function: `t = Table[{b, f2b[E^b] // N}, {b, -50, 0}]; f = Interpolation[t]; Plot[{f[b], 0}, {b, -50, 0}, PlotStyle -> {{Blue, Thick}, {Red, Thick}}]` ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w86Nb.png) The plot is looking much different and is approaching zero as expected. I am wondering whether this has to do something with overflow problems in graphics but I am not sure.
