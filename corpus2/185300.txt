Having simple code like this:               int A=5;     object X=Console.ReadLine()     if(Condition)        DoSomething();     else        DoStuff();     DoSomethingElse();      Some sources say there are actually 4 branches: First unconditional, two for the IF and another unconditional after the IF statement. Some say there are only two branches. What would be correct? E.g. here: http://www.ruleworks.co.uk/testguide/BS7925-2-Annex-B7.asp
