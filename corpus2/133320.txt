Our front-end developers have requested that the RESTful Java web services to support delta queries. The use case for this is to handle periodic ajax refresh of the screen to bring in new data (deltas). I can see a few advantages of this:   * Makes front-end logic simple (i.e. no complicated deduping logic)   * Reduce network traffic (i.e. response size is smaller) However, there are some concern as well:   * supporting delta will require the service to be stateful, which impact scalability   * heavy use of caching (results cached per user per query, to determine the delta)   * heavy processing on the server My questions are:   1. Are there additional advantages of the delta queries?   2. What's a good implementation to for delta queries that would eliminate some of the disadvantages (you can assume we are welling to drastically refactor our code)
