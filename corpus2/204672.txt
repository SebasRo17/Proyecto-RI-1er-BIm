In my team, we are about to start the reimplement of a service. One of the important steps to do to accomplish this is how do we ensure that we are doing it in the right way and we are not introducing new bugs. So, what we have in mind is create a bunch of test to verify the following:   * The behavior. Both services should behave the same way (store data in the same places, send same, notificacions, etc...)   * Results. Object returned by the service's calls should be exactly the same. So, the things that we have thought is to do the following:   * Create a set of test that verifies the behavior and results of old service.   * Create the new service adding unit test, and whitebox integration test for the new service   * Create some kind of "Mirror test" that checks if the new service is working as the old one. Is there a way to do this? Thanks for any help. Note: None of the code of the previous version is reusable. There is no test for the older version of the service [Edited]replaced original word "migrate" with "reimplement"
