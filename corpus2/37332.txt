Is it possible for _Mathematica_ to compare a number of lists of different sizes, and delete duplicates in a hierarchical manner? For example, given the following lists:               list1 = {2, 5, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18};     list2 = {5, 8, 11, 16, 19, 21};     list3 = {5, 8, 9, 11, 16, 19, 21, 23};      I would like to output:               list1 = {2, 5, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18}     list2 = {8, 16, 19, 21}     list3 = {9, 23}      where `list1` keeps all its original elements, `list2` keeps only elements belonging to `list2` and not `list1`, and `list3` keeps only those elements not contained in `lists 1 & 2`. If this will take an inordinately long time, I am happy with just comparing the list with the previous list and deleting the duplicates from the second list.
