I am a Java (Web) Developer. Having knowledge about c#, PHP and Ruby. I am getting confused how to keep myself updated with very fast changing the programming language and their implementation. Like, in the mobile, you can see around 7-8 OS. There are very much finer example of event-driven programming to make scalable application like node.js, Ember, Require etc.. Then WebSockets, Socket.io, HTML5. Python and C once again climbing on the top. Scala and clojure are becoming very popular languages. Haskell and Erlang are also a great language too.. With so many programming language and platform, it is sometimes i feel very bad that i am missing some good things in my career. I am just confused what to learn and how to co-op with this fast-changing world. Please suggest.
