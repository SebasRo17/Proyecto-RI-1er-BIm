This code produces two identical images, despite the difference in the rectangles:               r1 = Rectangle[{-1, -1}, {1, 1}];     r2 = Rectangle[{-1, -1}, {0, 1}];     f[img_] :=       Show[ParametricPlot3D[{{t, 0, 0}, {0, t, 0}, {0, 0, t}}, {t, -1, 1}],        Graphics3D[{Inset[          Show[Graphics[img], ImageSize -> Large], {0.25, 0, 0}, Automatic,           ImageScaled[0.25]]}]]     f[r1]     f[r2]      If I do `{Automatic,ImageScaled[0.25]}`, I am told that it should be a pair of numbers, or a scaled or offset form. I want the height of the inset to be 25% of the overall graphic, and the width to be scaled accordingly. I want it to work for any `img`, not just the two rectangles I gave; my actual use case involves .gif files. How do I make it so that `f[r1]` and `f[r2]` show different insets, i.e., inset the rectangles shown by `Show[r1]` and `Show[r2]`, with the height scaled to 25% of the total height of the image?
