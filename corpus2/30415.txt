I currently have a nested `Table` command running (in Mathematica 9), with two progress bars to track the variables. I have to shut down or hibernate the computer in a couple of minutes, and the calculation is only halfway done. What can I do in such a situation. I'm pretty sure simply hibernating won't work, as I recall it not working in Mathematica 8. Will entering a subsession and _then_ hibernating work? Or entering a subsession and dumping the kernel? While I don't have any preference towards shutting down or hibernating in my current situation, a solution that allows me to close Mathematica and resume evaluation at some later time (after shutting down, etc) would be ideal. Note: This question is about a cell which is already running (so I can't modify it), however if it's not possible to do this here, an answer that shows how to run `Table` in an interrupt-and-saveable manner would be OK1 1\. I have a pretty good idea of how to do this (dynamically append data to a list with `For` instead f using `Table`), but there may be better ways of doing this.
