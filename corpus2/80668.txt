How to spot that someone copied open source code licensed with GPL to their closed source commercial application, when you don't have access to their closed source code? Edit: Great answers! Part 2. What if it is a webapp where you don't even have access to the executables? Scenario: They copy the source, make some minor changes to the gui so the front end is nearly identical; add a new feature to the otherwise totally identical back-end; and fail to release it back to open source.
