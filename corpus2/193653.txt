I'm building a REST api where clients are authenticated using client certificates. A client in this case is not an individual user, but some sort of a presentation layer. Users are authenticated using a custom approach and it's the responsibility of the presentation layer to see that this is properly done (note: I know this is not the proper approach, but the api is not public). I would like to pass the user name for each request (not the password), but I'm not sure where to do this. Would it be a good idea to use the Authorization header?
