I have realized that its possible to create algorithms that operate physically to solve problems much more efficiently than in a computer itself. Consider the following: Finding the shortest path between 2 points in a connected graph. If one were to physically create the graph with the edge weights correspond to length of physical connectors and the nodes something corresponding ex: wooden balls and yarn both labeled, then it is possible to generate the graph from data in O(N) time and then determining the shortest path between 2 nodes would simply involve grabbing both those nodes and pulling them so a straight line forms between them (or multiple straight lines!) and the rest hanging. That straight line(s) would be the shortest path for obvious reasons. How exactly does one take this physical method of solving the problem and implement it in a computer?
