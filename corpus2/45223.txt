If I do               sol=Solve[{2x+2==y,3x+9==y},{x,y}]      then Mathematica will tell me               {{x -> -7, y -> -12}}      But I would like to store values to x and y even if I don't write the following thing explicitly.               x = -7     y = -12      At least I know this is possible, because I found how to do it by myself. But now I forgot. But I am sure it is possible.
