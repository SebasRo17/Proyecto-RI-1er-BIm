I have been using _Mathematica_ for quite some time but I have never seen anything like this. It started without warning and I am not sure how to fix this. Please have a look at the following example https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23383252/bugs_editor.nb The notebook exemplifies my problem. Before you run it to check it, please read through it as I have explained every step of the problem. I am using a dropbox link to my notebook, since I have no idea how to attach a file (or if it is possible at all!) to this message. In short, the problem is as follows: there is an issue with `FindMaximum` (could be other built in functions as well, but so far this is where it started) where, the editor changes the output from `{maximum, {xx -> maximum position}}` to `{maximum(extra invisible characters), {(xx -> maximum position)(some more invisible characters)}}`. This has a huge impact on the rest of the variable types that are calculated with either element of the `FindMaximum` output (see the notebook for an example with `ListPlot`). Has anyone seen this and how did they fix it. P.S.: I tried to google this problem but I had no success since I don't really know what generates it. Update: As discussed below, I have modified the shared notebook to make it simpler. Got rid of all the unnecessary parameters and replicated the problem on my computer. Now, as rasher said, the issue could arise due to the excessive use of comments. This seems to be the case, because I copy and pasted the first cell where function nx is defined, into a new notebook and same thing happened. Again the problem was fixed if I wrote the function in a new cell. I will try to add the code to this message together with the output for `Va=2`:               nx[Va_] := Block[     {WmaxL},     WmaxL = FindMaximum[{rr^2 - 10 rr + Va - 1/rr, rr > 0}, {rr, 1}];     WmaxL     ] ;      This is the original function. Please note the extra spaces between the last `]` and `;` (this was a surprise for me too as is not evident in my notebook!). The output for this function is as not what you would expect from `FindMaximum`:               Out[15]= {-5.221174649 TextCell[""], {(rr -> 0.3271088) TextCell[""]}}      More surprises! This is what I get when I copy from the _Mathematica_ notebook and paste it here! What is this `TextCell` in the output? It is obvious for me why the rest of the notebook is not working as it should, but I have no idea why are these invisible characters inserted in my expressions. I hope this clarifies the issue a bit more, and allows you to check it on your machines too. P.P.S.: the modified notebook can be found at the same link.
