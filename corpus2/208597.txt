I am just a high-school student but for a while now I have been coding for weeks (from early in the morning to late at night). I really enjoy it, however it can be really monotone. I usually listen to some webradios but they take my attention from coding sometimes. How do you cope with long hours of coding? How often do you take breaks how do you spend them? Do you have any kind of further advice?
