I might be missing something obvious here. I am building a palette for constructing code to make certain graphics. The idea is that my colleagues can click buttons instead of having to know the right commands. So `PasteButton[]` is an obvious help. Where I have gotten stuck is in color definition. What I want is for the user to be able to select a color on a `ColorSlider`, and then click a button to paste the `RGBColor[]` value selected in that `ColorSlider` at the notebook insertion point. I do _not_ want the code pasted in this way to update subsequently when the user chooses a different color in the `ColorSlider` This is what I have so far, but the resulting pasted code does not pick up when the user has selected a different color in the slider. Pasting `Dynamic[col]` instead of `Setting[col]` results in a piece of code that changes when a different color is selected in the slider, which as I mentioned is not the desired behaviour.               Grid[{{PasteButton[         Graphics[{Dynamic[col], Rectangle[]}, ImageSize -> 26],          Setting@col, ImageSize -> 26, ImageMargins -> 0, FrameMargins -> 0],         ColorSlider[Dynamic[col], ImageSize -> {75, 25},         AppearanceElements -> "Spectrum"]}}, Spacings -> 0, Alignment -> Bottom]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9ARi3.png) The idea is that the user clicks on a color in the spectrum zone, and then clicks the button on the left that looks like a swatch. How do I modify / rewrite this code to achieve the desired behaviour?
