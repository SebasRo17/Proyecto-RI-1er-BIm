**Background** I'm currently toying with Principles of Design by Charlotte Jirousek in order to learn some basics of image processing. As main principals she suggests Balance, Proportion, Rhythm, Emphasis and Unity. I'm particularly interested in **Balance**. According to her definition: Balance is the concept of visual equilibrium, and relates to our physical sense of balance. It is a reconciliation of opposing forces in a composition that results in visual stability. Most successful compositions achieve balance in one of two ways: symmetrically or asymmetrically. Balance in a three dimensional object is easy to understand; if balance isn't achieved, the object tips over. To understand balance in a two dimensional composition, we must use our imaginations to carry this three dimensional analogy forward to the flat surface. ![Sample 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hw3vM.gif) Symmetrical balance can be described as having equal "weight" on equal sides of a centrally placed fulcrum. It may also be referred to as formal balance. When the elements are arranged equally on either side of a central axis, the result is Bilateral symmetry. This axis may be horizontal or vertical. It is also possible to build formal balance by arranging elements equally around a central point , resulting in radial symmetry. ![Sample 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lSEfx.gif) There is a variant of symmetrical balance called approximate symmetry in which equivalent but not identical forms are arranged around the fulcrum line. ![Sample 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ImbiH.gif) **Question** How can I find Orientation and Position of Symmetry Axes of the given figures? **Solution Directions** In fact this question meant to be a toy example for image processing. However, after some investigation this turns out to be a challenging subject in it self.See the link for related papers submitted and published in both computer vision and computer graphics as well as changing test images.   * Jens has a quite inspiring approach explained in his post.   * An alternative approach is suggested by Changming Sun, Deyi Si Fast Reflectional Symmetry Detection Using Orientation Histograms. In this approach Gradient Orientation Histogram is used.               o = Flatten@ImageData@GradientOrientationFilter[imag, 3];     w = Flatten@ImageData@GradientFilter[imag, 3];     \[ScriptCapitalA] = WeightedData[o, w];     \[ScriptCapitalD] = HistogramDistribution[\[ScriptCapitalA]];     t = Table[{x, PDF[\[ScriptCapitalD], x]}, {x, -\[Pi]/2, \[Pi]/2, 0.05}];     Max[t\[Transpose][[2]]]      As explained in the paper this gives the axes. Also available in Mathematica GradientOrientationFilter examples.   * Another approach could be based on component in Mathematica which may require additional image processing.
