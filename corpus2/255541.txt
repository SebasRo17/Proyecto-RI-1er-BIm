I'm doing a project on speech to text with omap processor in utlp kit. There is an API to record my voice and it converts my voice to pcm and is stored in a buffer. I have a few English words which I've recorded and converted into an array now I wanted to know how to compare the spoken word in the form of pcm with the array I have created. Or is there any header file or is it possible to `cprint` the pcm as a text.
