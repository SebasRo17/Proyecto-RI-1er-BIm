There are other questions on the site that are similar to this one, but the answers provided didn't help me. I want to draw disks of different radii. Each radius is the absolute value of a variable, which takes positive and negative values. I want my disks to be red when the variable is negative, and blue when it is positive. I am wondering how I would do that, since I haven't found pertinent information in Mathematica's documentation. **EDIT** : To be clear, I have a set of eigenvectors, and for each one, I would like to plot a disk for each component of the vector. So, if the $i^{th}$ eigenvector, $\mathbf{\Psi}_i$, has the form $$\mathbf{\Psi}_i = \sum_j c_j \mathbf{e}_j$$ where the $c_j$ are the coefficients and the $\mathbf e_j$ are the unit vectors in my basis, I'd like to plot for each $c_i$ a disk with radius $\vert c_i \vert^2$ and colored by the sign of $\arg c_j$.
