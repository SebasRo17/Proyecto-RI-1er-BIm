When using a `Quantity` with the unit of `"DegreesCelsius"` multiplication doesn't work as expected. If you have 10 degrees and multiply it by 2 you get 20 degrees instead of the expected 293,15 degrees. This becomes a real problem if you use the temperature directly in a formula, eg. the ideal gas law. Example code:               t = Quantity[10, "DegreesCelsius"];     T = UnitConvert@t;     UnitConvert[2 * t] // N (* => 293.15 K *)     2 * T // N (* => 566.3 K *)      Is there a way to fix this behaviour to work as I expect it to?
