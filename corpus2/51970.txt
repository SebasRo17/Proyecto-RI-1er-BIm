I'm having trouble to do the following numerical integrations:               iEAs[Q_?NumericQ, m1_?NumericQ, m2_?NumericQ, mh_?NumericQ, V_?NumericQ, Vc_?NumericQ, A_?NumericQ, Ac_?NumericQ] := m1 Q NIntegrate[ x (A Ac (m2 + m1 (-1 + x)) + V Vc (m1 + m2 -          m1 x))/(8 \[Pi]^2 (-mh^2 (-1 + x) + (m2^2 + m1^2 (-1 + x)) x)), {x, 0, 1}, MaxRecursion -> 100, WorkingPrecision -> 13];          iEAf[Q_?NumericQ, m1_?NumericQ, m2_?NumericQ, mh_?NumericQ, V_?NumericQ, Vc_?NumericQ, A_?NumericQ, Ac_?NumericQ] := m1 Q NIntegrate[-(  (A Ac (12 m2 (1 + x) + m1 (1 - 9 x - 12 x^2)) + V Vc (12 m2 (1 + x) + m1 (-1 + 9 x + 12 x^2))))/(96 \[Pi]^2 (-m2^2 (-1 +x) + (mh^2 + m1^2 (-1 + x)) x)), {x, 0, 1}, MaxRecursion -> 100, WorkingPrecision -> 13];          iVAv[G_?NumericQ, m1_?NumericQ, m2_?NumericQ, M_?NumericQ, V_?NumericQ, Vc_?NumericQ, A_?NumericQ, Ac_?NumericQ] := G m1 NIntegrate[- (A Ac (-3 m2 (1 + x) + m1 (-3 + x + 2 x^2)) +      V Vc (3 m2 (1 + x) + m1 (-3 + x + 2 x^2)))/(8 \[Pi]^2 (M^2 (-1 + x) - (m2^2 + m1^2 (-1 + x)) x)), {x, 0, 1}, MaxRecursion -> 100, WorkingPrecision -> 13];          iVAf[Q_?NumericQ, m1_?NumericQ, m2_?NumericQ, M_?NumericQ, V_?NumericQ, Vc_?NumericQ, A_?NumericQ, Ac_?NumericQ] := m1 Q NIntegrate[ -( (V Vc (m1 - 2 m2 + m1 x) + A Ac (m1 + 2 m2 +      m1 x))/(4 \[Pi]^2 (M^2 + (m1^2 + m2^2) (-1 + x)))), {x, 0, 1}, MaxRecursion -> 100, WorkingPrecision -> 13];      Then when I try to calculate my other function, that is just a sum of several of those integrals taken with diferent arguments, I get the following errror: > During evaluation of In[1]:= NIntegrate::zeroregion: Integration region > {{1.000000000000,0.999999999999999999999999999972752437499605743914855469900697130}} > cannot be further subdivided at the specified working precision.

For most of them I get the kind of error above, for local adaptive methods I don't get any error, but I left Mathematica running for a whole afternoon and it didn't finish the calculation (it just kept running). I need the WorkingPrecision->13 because I'm going to compare this result with the electron anomalous magnetic moment (which has got 12 significant digits for it's experimental value). My final goal is to use thse integrals for several values of it's parameters, and then make RegionPlots comparing my calculations with the experimental value. EDIT: If I get divergences it is fine for me to discard the parameter values (m2, mh and M) where they happen. So, if anyone can find a way to solve my problem, I would be very grateful.
