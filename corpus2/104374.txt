So far I've touched on various aspects of computational geometry including constructive planar geometry (locus intersections), algorithms for planar graph topologies, 3D DDA, and most recently a 2D convex hull implementation using Graham's Scan and k-means clustering represented as Voronoi diagrams. It's a fascinating field. I'm interested to know more. I would like to know which algorithms are most common in this field, and what they do.
