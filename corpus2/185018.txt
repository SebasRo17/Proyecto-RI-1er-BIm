I'm going through a MVC tutorial, and I notice that convention seems to be to expose a tables primary key on detail pages/urls (ie. /Movies/Details/5 as an example from the tutorial). It's obviously not a problem for things like a movie record or a SO post, but it might be a bit different for an invoice or transaction with confidential information on it if the key was sequential or guessable. So, is it just this tutorial or do MVC apps typically expose a tables primary key? Is there a common library or pattern for hiding the key if you don't want to expose it?
