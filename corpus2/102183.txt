I am looking for best practices that big organizations follow for code check- in and validations. Currently we follow these steps, \- Developer writes code \- Developer do some initial tests \- Code is awaiting validation now \- Technical lead reviews the code (possible bugs, see if coding convention is followed etc) \- Once approved by technical lead, the code goes in QA state \- Once QA approves the code is checked in into the trunk. We are now moving to a new project and I was looking for some best practices that would ease the process. We have custom made software that maintains the code status. Thanks, Ali
