I have a wording / precision question. Sometimes I write _"object instance"_ sometimes _"class instance"_. Isn't it that an _object_ is always an _instance_ of a _class_? Therefore _"object instance"_ is not the correct wording, right? Is it common to say so anyway, or just a "mistake" of mine? I have the feeling _"object instance"_ is superfluous (doubled) because an _object_ is always an _instance_ and would like to know more for clarification of the terms.
