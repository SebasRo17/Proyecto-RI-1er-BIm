I am developing a web application based on a proprietary (but free) JavaScript API. My company is considering releasing our application as "Open Source", but we are unsure of the different licensing options and how they will work considering we are using a third-party proprietary API. Can anyone help me with the following questions?   1. If we cannot release the third-party API as open source, can we release the code that we have written as open source?   2. Are we, as the original developers, held to the same license that we release our code with? For instance, if we release our code under a "copy-left" license like GPL, would that restrict us from building on the original code base and releasing it in another product that is not open source?   3. What is the best resource for learning the difference among all the different license types? I looked at opensource.org, which listed all the licenses, but I have trouble understanding all the legalese of the licenses themselves.
