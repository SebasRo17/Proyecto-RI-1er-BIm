I am currently working on ms build to publish my winform application based on the environment selected (Dev or Prod). I am using Ms Build Community Task and referencing this article to achieve this purpose. I had a few theoretical doubts based on publishing application. 1) Is there any difference in publishing through the visual studio ide and msbuild? 2) What do most developers prefer to use and why? 3) What are the advantages of using MsBuild to publish an application as compared to publishing through the visual studio IDE? 4) What is faster? I am using a .net 3.5 winform application developed in Csharp and my question is pertaining to clickonce windows applications only. Please help me clear these doubts
