I'm looking into building a new PHP commercial app for a client that will be hosted as a paid service and possibly resold to third parties with a non- compete clause. I've tested a few frameworks and chose Laravel which is licensed under the MIT License. The framework itself will not be modified but the app will be heavily dependent on Laravel functions and architecture. How does the original license affects code produced with the software it's covering? MIT being a non-viral license, my humble guess is that my code can be distributed under a more commercial-friendly license that prevent third- parties to do anything else than using the app as a final product as long as the original licensed is kept for the framework part. Am I wrong? How should I do this?
