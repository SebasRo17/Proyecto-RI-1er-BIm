**I made multiple tools for extracting file formats that are found in (commercial) games. Where should I host the code? (e.g. Google Code, Sourceforge,....)** Normally it would be considered 'illegal' everywhere, but most of the time they are ignored. Where should I host it and what license should I choose for the project to be 'on the safe side'. _[I asked this question on SO and it got closed, meta suggested that it would fit here a bit more, if it doesn't even fit here please help me at least rephrase it]_ Edit: An example: A game has glued together GZip compressed files with binary metadata slaped on them. (let's call them .archive files) I KNOW that I'm not allowed to use that data for anything else then playing the game, but I'm interested in modding said files so I wrote a packer/unpacker for that .archive . Now I want to make it public on a project page, which one should I choose? All the modding tools I saw till now have that 'ONLY FOR NON-PROFIT EDUCATIONAL USE' and they normally don't get taken down. But I want to be sure to choose an actual license for the sourcecode.
