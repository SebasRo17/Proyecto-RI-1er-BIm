I am fascinated to Lisp as it is `simple yet powerful`. I am just a beginner and I know there have been lots of discussions on removing parentheses from Lisp and its dialects. Yet I request Lisp ninja's to take few minutes answering this. Will there be any side effects in Lisp/Clojure if they had followed 2 conventions below:               ;; function declaration     defn function-name param-1 .... param-n       ...       function-body ;; not (function-body)       ...          ;; function call     function-name param-1 ... param-n ;; not (function-name param-1 ... param-n)      While still using `()` or `[]` for inline and nested expressions.               (println "hello, ") (println "world !!!") ;; inline         = a (- 2 3) ;; nested
