How could we go about creating a function that behaves like those? After a while thinking, my best try is with `CellPrint` printing an `Output` cell with the famous `CellLabel` of Out[blah]//myForm. This solution is good enough for me for now, but I'm using it as an excuse to understand all these issues better... This mimics the behaviour, its not the same... For example, you have to manually get the `$Line`, you get the `GeneratedCell` option to `True`, and I don't know what else I'm missing. In fact, the kernel actually doesn't seem to do anything in the real form functions. So this solution would behave wrongly, for example, if I wrapped it other things... `FullForm[myForm[stuff]]` should return `myForm[stuff]` in a FullForm-tagged cell..
