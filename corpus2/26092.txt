Consider this example(taken from Thomas's question here)               rv = RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[2], 10^6];     t = AbsoluteTime[]; ListLinePlot[rv, PlotRange -> All]     AbsoluteTime[] - t (*Put this line into the NEXT cell,and evaluate \     both cells together*)          t = AbsoluteTime[];     Style[ListLinePlot[rv, PlotRange -> All], Antialiasing -> False]     AbsoluteTime[] - t (*This line in separate cell!*)      and this example (taken from a related question here)               ls = Table[Sinc[x*y], {x, -10, 10, 0.1}, {y, -10, 10, 0.1}];     ListPlot3D[ls, PlotRange -> All,        InterpolationOrder -> 2] // AbsoluteTiming      I get different performance in version 8 and version 9. Version 8 seems to be about twice as fast as version 9. Why this happens and how to make version 9 as fast as version 8? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eLrV8.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AwdOC.png)
