This is related to this question but not quite the same. BTW, I'm not a native English speaker. I keep having a hard time choosing a proper name for collections - Lets say that we have a collection of _item_ s and that each _item_ has a _name_. How will we call the collection of names such that the collection's name will be the most understandable under standard naming conventions?               var itemNames = GetItemNames(); // Might be interpreted as a single item with many names     var itemsNames = GetItemsNames(); // No ambiguity but doesn't look like proper English     var itemsName = GetItemsName(); // Also sounds strange, and doesn't seem to fit in e.g. a loop:     foreach( itemName in itemsName){...}      As native English speakers, how would you name your collections, and how would you expect them to be named?
