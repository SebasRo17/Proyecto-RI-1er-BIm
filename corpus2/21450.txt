I am evaluating which purchase level of Mathematica 9 will suit my needs. I am finding some of the information provided on Mathematica's How to Buy Chart a bit vague and unclear. I need to be able to create interactive visualizations and then be able to deploy them in a webpage for others to use. I am assuming CDFs are the best choice for this (although webMathematica seems like it can do this as well). Do I need the _standard_ or _enterprise_ purchase level to be able to create and deploy these CDFs? It would also be a bonus for those accessing and interacting with the CDFs to be able to save and/or print them. Which of the packages provide this? Any light that can be shed on what each of the industry packages (standard and enterprise) provides is much appreciated.
