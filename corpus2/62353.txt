I am a Java Web Application Developer. I have an idea for a web application project that I am working on. I personally believe that the app has potential to become a popular website. Currently I am working on it as a developer with two others in the project. The development costs has been almost null uptil now since we are doing in- house development with open source technologies. But the costs are now going to appear as we'll have to host our application online on the servers. Right now I see this as the major expense as we go live. Are there any ways by which we can smartly deal with this hurdle ?   We want to minimize the costs as much as possible, or even better, if we can make this null, perhaps, through some partnership agreement with the hosting solutions provider!? Your opinions are highly solicited!! Please enlighten with your experiences and knowledge. Thanks so much, for your time !
