I am creating a simple blackjack game backed by database In my Card is               public class Card{      private Face face;      private Suit suit;           //setters.. getters     }      where `face` and `suit` are enums I have an entity `Bet` with the following               @Entity     public class Bet{        private Player player;        private String cards;        //...     }      Currently when I'm dealing cards I parse the suit and face to string and concatenate them in the cards field and then parse the cards if I want to calculate the score. I find this cumbersome so I want to change my field "cards" to List in the Bet Entity. Now, if that's the case I would have to make the Card class an entity as well. But my `cardService`, which is where I get my cards, does not rely on the database, it just creates random cards so it does not make sense to make card an entity - am I right?
