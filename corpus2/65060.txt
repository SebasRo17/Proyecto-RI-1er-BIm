I have been involved in a project and now it is coming to an end. The good news is the company will start to commercialize the software which is specific software to ISPs. As a programmer / developer of the project, I intend to still support the project, attend to new custommer customizations, basically the software will still alive and be sold in the market. How much should I charge to stay ON the project? Should I charge per hour? per month? or even by percent over each customer? What is the default for this kind of situation? or How do most programmers/developers deal with that? Thanks in advance, It is a very important question to me.
