I'm getting close to graduation and am strongly considering continuing to a Master's Program. My long-term goal for the future is to stay in industry rather than pursuing a Ph.D/Academic career. While communicating these thoughts with some of my peers, I've been told that staying in the same University for both a Bachelor's and Master's degree is ill-advisable. The reasons seem to be based along the lines of lack of exposure to other opportunities, programs, and faculty. My question is, if I intend to pursue a career outside of the Ph.D/Academic spectrum, will staying at the same university for my master's really decrease my value in software related positions? If so (or if not), why?
