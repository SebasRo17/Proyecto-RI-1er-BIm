Im currently evaluating a front-end architecture for a big app that will be developed by a team of about 6 developers + 1 web designer so that said, having a robust SVN friendly architecture is a must. So far I'm evaluating this two options:   * A mixture of JQuery/UI/Mobile + Backbone/Underscore + Require JS + Twitter-Bootstrap   * ExtJS 4 This are the requirements the architecture needs to meet:   * SVN Fiendly (or Friendly depending on you previous experiences)   * Active community and extensive documentation   * Extensible   * Easy to learn and to maintain (nice to have)   * Cross-browser support (most of the time at least)   * Support for Mobile devices   * Easy to maintain (MVC, MVVM)   * OpenSource (nice to have) The previously mentioned ones meet most of the requirements in different levels and so far they are the only ones I've found about, am I missing any others?
