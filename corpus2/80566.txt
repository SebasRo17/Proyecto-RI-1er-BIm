I have one Linux VPS server for my company and we develop PHP sites. What i normally do is just make the subdomain of main site like test1.mainsite.com and work on that till it finishes. and then chnage the domain name. I have heard that big companies have the staging server and production server. I just want to know how that system works and when site is complete how do they transfer the site via FTP , SSH , RSYNC , what they do with old staging server. I jsut want to implement the enterprise strategies in my company and want to know how to proceed Thanks
