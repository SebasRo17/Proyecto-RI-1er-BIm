An exponential decay curve has been plotted asymptoting at approximately x=30 (correct for what I am looking at) How can I find the exact value from the curve? I was hoping to be able to use something similar to the `FindMinimum` function, or draw a line along the asymptote and find the intersection with the x-axis. This is the function used to plot the curve:                   Plot[((5/Log[2])*Log[(80046.8 - ((0.79) (101325 + (1030*9.81*d))))/((313545. + 2.17341d) - ((0.79) (101325 + (1030*9.81*d))))]), {d, 0, 60}, AxesLabel -> {Depth - m, Time - mins}]
