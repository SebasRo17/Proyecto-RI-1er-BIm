1. Is UTF-16 fixed-width or variable-width? I got different results from different sources: From http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/26/UTF: > UTF-16 stores Unicode characters in sixteen-bit chunks. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16/UCS-2: > UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a character encoding for > Unicode capable of encoding 1,112,064[1] numbers (called code points) in the > Unicode code space from 0 to 0x10FFFF. It produces a variable-length result > of either one or two 16-bit code units per code point.   2. From the first source > UTF-8 also has the advantage that the unit of encoding is the byte, so there > are no byte-ordering issues. Why doesn't UTF-8 have byte-order problem? It is variable-width, and one character may contain more than one byte, so I think byte-order can still be a problem? Thanks and regards!
