I was testing PHP rand function to write on a image. Of course the output shows that it's not so random. The code I used:               <?php      header('Content-Type: image/png');     $lenght = 512;     $im = imagecreatetruecolor($lenght, $lenght);     $blue = imagecolorallocate($im, 0, 255, 255);     for ($y = 0; $y < $lenght; $y++) {         for ($x = 0; $x < $lenght; $x++) {             if (rand(0,1) == 0) {                 imagesetpixel($im, $x, $y, $blue);             }         }     }            imagepng($im);     imagedestroy($im);     ?>      My question is, if I use image width/lenght (variable $lenght in this example) number like 512, 256 or 1024, it is very clear that it's not so random. When I change the variable to 513 for an example, it is so much harder for human eye to detect it. Why is that? What is so special about these numbers? 512: ![512 pixels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T0qjD.png) 513: ![513 pixels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vDzXS.png) **Edit: I'm running xampp on Windows to test it.**
