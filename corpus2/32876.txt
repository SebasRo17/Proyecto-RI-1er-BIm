When evaluating the following               (Factorial[n + 1]/Factorial[(n + 1) - (k + 1)])      with Mathematica 9, the result is sent to output as               (1 + n)!/((n + 1) - (k + 1))!      I would like to show the expanded (if that's the correct term) form of the result , if possible, to show for example               (n + 1)n(n - 1)...(n+1-k)      Is there a function like `Expand` to accomplish this?
