Style[      DisplayForm@RowBox[{"(", SubsuperscriptBox[2, 6, 7], ")"}],      18, Bold, ScriptSizeMultipliers -> 1, ScriptBaselineShifts -> {1, 3}]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sr5tg.png) or for `ScriptBaselineShifts -> {4, 1}` > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vKTSM.png) This is at least undesired effect. I'd like to cut those parentheses just below `6`. Why `ScriptBaselineShifts` affects both limits equally? Is there a walkaround?
