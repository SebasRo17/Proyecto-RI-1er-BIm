For the purposes of communicating coding styles to my co-workers, what would I formally call the following variants of camel case? > camelCase and > CamelCase Notice that the former version starts with a lower-case alphabetic character, and the latter version starts with an upper-case alphabetic character. I assume these have some sort of "official name". Also if there are any other forms I have not listed here, bonus points to those that mention them as well as well as their names.
