Velocity Template Language's set directive requires a variable on the left hand side. This doesn't work.               #set ( $entries.add("d") )      Even though I have no use for the return value of `add("d")`, I have to assign it to a variable.               #set ( $x = $entries.add("d") )       I want to communicate that the variable is necessary, but I have no intention of using it later. Is there a convention for naming variables that only exist to appease the compiler?
