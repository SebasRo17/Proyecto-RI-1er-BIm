I have a $3\times3$ matrix `A`, and a function `sTrans` that outputs two $3\times3$ matrices in a list when given a $3\times3$ matrix. So the input               A = {{1,2,3} , {4,5,6} , {7,8,9}}      And the output > sTrans[A] > > { {{3, 1, 2}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}} , {{1, 2, 3}, {6, 4, 5}, {7, 8, 9} }} And now I want to append the two matrices in a queue. The enQueue operation               enQueue[q_, elem_] := If[FreeQ[q,elem],qt++; q[[qt]]= elem]      How should I write the code without using loop? (P.S. I've heard multiple times that the whole concept of MMA is against `For` and `While` loops)
