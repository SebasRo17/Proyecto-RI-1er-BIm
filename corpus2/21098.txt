If I know two integers $n$ and $m$ and $m < n$, how can I find two different integers $x$ and $y$ that are nearest to $m$, and satisfy `Mod[n,x]==Mod[n,y]==0` ? For example,               f[720,8] ==> {8,9}     f[720,20] ==> {18,20}      If $n$ is small, we can brute force to test whether an integer is a factor of $n$, and find the nearest two of the factors:               twoNear[n_Integer, m_Integer] := Module[{ls, sortls},       ls = Select[Range[1, n], Mod[n, #] == 0 &];       sortls = Sort[Transpose[{ls - m, ls}], Abs[#1[[1]]] < Abs[#2[[1]]] &];       Sort@sortls[[1 ;; 2, 2]]      ]          twoNear[720,8]     twoNear[720,20]     (*{8, 9}*)     (*{18, 20}*)      but how to deal with problems such as `n=20!, m=1*^9` , `n=40!,m=1*^20` ?
