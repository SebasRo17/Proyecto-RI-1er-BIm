I am teaching an introduction to computer science lab session this semester. We are using Java. I am looking for some hard bonus questions for students to solve. They should be able to solve them in a relatively minimal amount of code (say 50-300 lines). So Far they know:   * input using Scanner   * Basic Math (including %)   * boolean logic   * Strings   * if statements   * while/for loops Later in the term they will know how to make methods and classes although this is getting towards the end of the class. I want to offer some short but challenging bonus questions. Does anyone have any good suggestions?
