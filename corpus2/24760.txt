Is it possible to put the `webMathematica` folder outside the usual Tomcat `webapps` folder and still have webMathematica work? _webMathematica_ does work OK if its whole folder is placed inside `webapps`. (This is with Tomcat 7 under OS X 10.8.3.) Configuration details would be greatly appreciated! In asking this I have two aims:   1. Granularize things so that I can just back up the webMathematica folder, along with other documents of mine, separately from backing up Tomcat's own files such as those in its distributed `webapps` folder.   2. Be able to access webMathematica (and, eventually, some specific apps using it) on localhost by means of a simple URL "alias", such as `webmathematica`, rather than the usual complete URL `localhost:8080/webmathematica` \-- just as I can now access Tomcat's webapps by entering the URL `tomcat.local`.
