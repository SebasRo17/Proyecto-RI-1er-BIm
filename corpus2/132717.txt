I've been working for a client for over a year and a half at an hourly rate. He's been pretty happy with the work thus far, and he has paid all invoices without objection, but his business has started to decline recently, causing him a lot of stress, expense resentment, and strained relations between us. I quit the project a few days ago (for a host of reasons) and he was not happy about it. He basically said that I need to continue working or he would sue me for some amount of money he has paid me as he doesn't feel the work is "what he paid for" (that is completely not the case, but irrelevant here). We do not have a signed agreement. The only "agreement" we have is a verbal / email one, stating that I will provide services to him at the rate of X an hour. I have copies of all the invoices I've sent him that have been paid, and they are broken down by hourly charges. His business also sends me a 1099 every year. Also, I did not leave anything "broken" or even in an un-finished state (for what it's worth). I don't think he has a leg to stand on, but I've never been sued before, and so I'm really worried. I know now that I should have insisted on getting something in writing before starting. Does anyone have any advice? **Does he have a legitimate case?** DISCLAIMER: I realize that any legal advise given is pretty much worthless here and I should consult a lawyer :).
