Well, let me explain : This has really been an issue for me, for such a long time. And what is worse - since coding is something I simply _ADORE_ (I would definitely do it, even if there was no payment involved whatsoever..) - is that I always end up feeling somewhat awkward... Anyway... **So, here's the deal :** You start working on a project, you may have something in your mind, and even if you're lucky enough and the client needs no " **cost estimates** " beforehand, sooner or later you'll face the ultimate dilemma of pricing your own work. * * * **So, how do YOU do it?**   * By estimating the **time** you put into it? _(obviously, this is not exact, 'coz perhaps a more capable coder will need much less time for the very same thing than a not-so-competent coder + even the very same coder may not "perform" equally at all times)_   * By the **Lines of code** you've written? _(obviously, this is not a measure either : a 10-line script that does exactly the same with a 1000-line script is, at least for me, "better")_   * By taking into account the level of **complexity** of the project and, perhaps, how specialised the subject is?   * By taking into account other factors? _(e.g. the **value** of the project for your customer)_
