There's a (possibly abandoned) library I'm using in my project. Its Google Code project page mentions it's MIT licensed. Nowhere in the code itself, nor any of the included files, is there a copyright notice or license specified. The closest thing is the author's name in one of the headers. Since the sole requirement of the MIT license is its inclusion of the copyright notice, which is non-existant in this libary, what's the best manner to proceed?
