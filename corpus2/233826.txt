**Goal** : I'm currently doing an MVC project and I have this method to update the ViewBag (based on previous actions of the user). I would like to call this function whenever a certain list of MVC Actions are called (most of them). **Questions** :   1. Would an observer pattern fit my problem? (I'm reading about them at the moment, starting to sound like it would).   2. If so, would it be overkill for something so simple or would it be in good practice?   3. Am I looking in the right direction or is their a better way to reach my goal? The user has an "ActiveEntity" in the session once they select one and I need to display the entity's name, date, etc. when most pages are loaded (as part of the header information). The catch is that I'm using other data for the model as I have a large hierarchy of data to display (parts/levels at a time) and the ViewBag is an acceptable location to store the data that acts similar to header-information(I think?). Is my approach correct? Might someone be able to point me in a good direction?
