I am trying to build the initial model for an electro-mechanical system that I will be running in a for-loop for various inputs and parameters. Currently, the code is as follows:               Clear[sol, k, n, θ1, θ3, T, J2, J1, c, c2, em, τ, α];     sol = NDSolve[{       J1*θ1''[t] + n^2*k*θ1[t] == k*n*θ3[t] + T[t],        J2*θ3''[t] + c*θ3'[t] + k*θ3[t] == k*n*θ1[t] - μ*(θ3'[t])^2*Sign[θ3'[t]] - c2*(θ3'[t])^3,        τ*T'[t] + T[t] == α*em[t],        θ1[t] == θ3[t] == T[0] == 0, θ1'[t] == θ3'[t] == 0},        {θ1, θ3, em, T}, {t, 0, 100}];      When I run the code it is returning an overdetermined system. I believe it is a simple syntax error, but as of right now I'm at a loss for ideas. Any pointers would be great!
