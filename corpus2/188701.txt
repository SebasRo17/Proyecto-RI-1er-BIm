I've joined as a fresher (trainee) a software company developing for Windows Store. I don't know much about C#. My company has started Windows Store development recently. They didn't do .Net development before, that's why my company got an Senior .Net employee to complete the project. Whenever he completes the project he will leave the company. I will have to maintain the project after him. So I need to study the project flow and analyze the project to be able to maintain errors in future. Can you suggest how to start to analyze the project and what to pay attention on?
