There are various kinds of professions like : doctors - various degrees are required for this and you become a doctor or a surgeon after you complete it. engineers - electrical engineer, civil engineer, electronics engineer and many more. now when I see programmers working in companies, they have different degrees like a civil eng. degree, biotechnology degree, Mcom degree, mechanical eng degree.... and many more. It seems rather pointless that those people got those degrees but anyway but does your degree matters when you are a good programming. say somebody is good at C++ and is a civil engineer .... **what about stackoverflow or any other companies, would you consider such people for an interview or you would strictly mention that computer science is a must for applying.**
