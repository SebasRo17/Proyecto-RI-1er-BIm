A project I'm working on was hosted on a svn repository at bettercodes.org. This was under another user's name and **that repository is now unavailable**. The person responsible for the project was sent an export from Eclipse and I had a more or less up-to-date project on my machine. I could see no other option than to commit my copy of the project to another repository. **It is now possible that some of the most recent changes by another programmer are missing**. Now, what options do I have to bring this project together? Is some of the necessary metadata saved on Eclipse or are all the changes on the original repository? What tools could I use to check what is missing in terms of classes, config files and code?
