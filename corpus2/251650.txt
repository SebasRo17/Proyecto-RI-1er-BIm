I am currently following along a youtube tutorial here and from what I understand we are starting out by creating an engine to run the game. Should I be able to implement all of this by myself without outside help in the future or should I just make sure to have an understanding of everything that is going on? Would a professional game developer know how to implement everything that it takes to make a game or would he/she just copy and paste certain parts (like creating a buffer, or fps cap) and edit it to their taste?
