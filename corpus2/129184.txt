In the process of adapting a "put on clipboard"-solution to new behavior I have found that I need a good _programmers_ clipboard monitor for Windows. I do not need to have a history of items on the clipboard, but I need to see the details of what is currently placed there, including - this is important - the various flavors (RTF/HTML/plain text/etc) to be sure that all those I place there are correct. Free is preferred, but cheap will do. We are a Java shop, but I can install a Visual Studio Express edition if that makes things easier. (EDIT: The development box is Windows 7 64-bit) Any suggestions?
