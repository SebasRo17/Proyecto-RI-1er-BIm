I've been trying to restart an animation after variables change from `Manipulate` `PopUpMenus`. My animation takes the form:               Animate[expr, {u, umin, umax, du}].       I can change `u`, after variations to `Manipulate`, back to an initial value momentarily, but from there `u` jumps back to its previous position (or farther forward) as if its continued running. I would be content with simply restarting the entire animation after changing the `Manipulate` variables. My code for `Animate[]` is in the following simplified form (I hope to make the `i` slider bar return back to the left and the red dot to begin being plotted at `x=-10` each time the function is changed):               gPrev[x_] := Sin[x];     Manipulate[      Switch[functionNumb,         0, g[x_] := Sin[x],         1, g[x_] := Cos[x],         2, g[x_] := ArcTan[x]],       {functionNumb, 0, 2, 1}]          Animate[      Plot[{g[x]}, {x, -10, 10},         Epilog -> {Red, PointSize[0.015], Point@{i, g[i]}}], {i, -10, 10, 1},         DisplayAllSteps -> True, AnimationRunning -> False]
