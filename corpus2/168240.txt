I am trying to build a business around an iPhone app. The app will be our main sales channel, and being able to adapt the sales channel faster than the 9-10 days delay cause by the app review times is crucial. Therefore, I was wondering whether there is anything I can do to improve the speed of reviews. I am thinking that the publishers of Angry Birds, surely would not have to wait in line for reviews on the same terms as some obscure free app. So what can I do? Some things I am considering:   * Would Apple prioritize apps that they earn money on?   * Could I in some way pay Apple directly? I already know of the possibility of requesting an expedite review, but it seems like one can get punished for supplying a non-technical reason.
