this is a conceptual question, but if i initialize a variable in c# as public will it be able to be used in the class as I want a variable "`player1`" and a variable "`player2`" where either could be one of the two (or more)   1. Player   2. Computer  Here is what i would like to know how I would do:               public class Game       {            //equivalent of initializing it here         public bool islogging;           public string[] log;           public int draws, round;                public Game(player p1, computer p2)           {               public player player1 = p1;               public computer player2 = p2;                                                                    }         //other overloads here...         ...     }      trying this it doesn't work as the public keyword is rejected               public Game(player p1, player p2 )     {            public  player player1, player2;          player player3 = p1;          player player4 = p2;           }
