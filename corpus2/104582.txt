I need to determine the ranking of values in an array without altering their position, so that I can print the position of each split time next to the actual value of the split time in a table like so.               <table>     <tr>       <th>Split 1</th>       <th>Split 2</th>       <th>Split 3</th>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>4.66 (1)</td>       <td>5.12 (3)</td>       <td>4.75 (2)</td>     </tr>     </table>      My array = [4.66, 5.12, 4.75] and I need to iterate through it and print the rank rank as seen in parenthesis above. I can't sort, because I need to do this for several decimals in the html table. Any suggestions for implementing this algorithm?
