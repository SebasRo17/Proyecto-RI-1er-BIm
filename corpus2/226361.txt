Two questions:   1. I assume that when Scrum coaches say "the team should decide" they mean there has to be a consensus decision process usually facilitated by the Scrum Master?    2. What if there is a disagreement between members of the Scrum team on the way to develop/design some feature and a consensus cannot be reached, who decides? The Scrum Master? The system architect? The funcional manager? Thanks.
