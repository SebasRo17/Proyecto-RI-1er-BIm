I'm using the MVC pattern in my web application built with PHP. I'm always struggling to determine whether I need a new dedicated controller for a set of actions or if I should place them inside an already existing controller. Are there any good rules of thumb to follow when creating controllers? For example I can have: `AuthenticationController` with actions:   * `index()` to display login form.   * `submit()` to handle form submission.   * `logout()`, self-explanatory. **OR** `LoginController` with actions:   * `index()` to display login form.   * `submit()` to handle form submission. `LogoutController` with action:   * `index()` to handle logging out. **OR** `AccountController` with actions:   * `loginGet()` to display login form.   * `loginPost()` to handle login form submission.   * `logoutGet()` to handle logging out.   * `registerGet()` to display registration form.   * `registerPost()` to handle form submission. And any other actions that are are involved with an account...
