If you press `Enter` in the example below it should become clear that test is being adding to the textbox instead of the current `Notebook`.               EventHandler[      InputField["", String]      , {"ReturnKeyDown" :> (         SetSelectedNotebook[EvaluationNotebook[]];         SelectionMove[EvaluationNotebook[], Notebook, All];         NotebookWrite[EvaluationNotebook[], "test"]         )}]      How might I force the text to be added to the `Notebook` instead of the other `InputField`? **EDIT:** Ideally I am looking for a solution that doesn't involve removing focus from the `InputField`.
