> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Licensing for hosted open source and 3rd party libraries I am newbie in the open source community world. I am planning to develop a open source project, hosted on github. The project would be using other open source components like- NHibernate, FNH, Log4net, CommonLibrary, Autofac, Quartz.Net Scheduler etc etc My questions are:   1. Would there be any restrictions on using above OSS components? for   example: I plan to use MIT license, but Quartz.Net Scheduler uses   Apache license, would there be any restrictions?   2. How do I get a license for my own project? Do I need to register my project somewhere?   3. What is the best practice to mention credits to the OSS compoenents used? Many thanks,
