I am aware that all the DevOps definitions are fairly vague, and this question is subjective, but it's still something I couldn't find an answer to. Is there any difference, prestige-wise, between DevOps and Software Engineers? Is the experience interchangeable? Are N years of DevOps experience interchangeable for N years of software engineering experience? Or do I even view the question in the wrong light?
