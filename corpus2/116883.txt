SO has quite a few questions using the word "truthiness" to mean the truth value of an expression, when evaluated as a boolean, regardless of its original type. It's very useful in dynamic languages. So my question is, is this a real term, and if so were we using it before Stephen Colbert made it popular? Or did we just adopt it afterward? In that case, what is the correct term with the definition I gave above?
