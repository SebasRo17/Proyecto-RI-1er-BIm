I heard some static analysis tools are priced depending on how much code they are licensed for. I can think that it's usual segmentation - the more code the customer has the more care he needs and the more useful the tool is for him, so he should pay more, so basically it's the way for the tool supplier to get more money. Are there any other objective reasons why a source code analysis tool would be priced depending on how much code the customer is planning to analyse?
