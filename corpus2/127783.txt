In this video, the speaker says: > "Some people get confused about how commas work. They think they should be > delimiters rather than separators. Now you can think about them either way." I don't understand the difference between a delimiter and a separator (if there is one). The implication in the video is that now (that trailing commas are valid), one can think of them as delimiters, rather than separators... Btw the language in question is JavaScript. From my understanding, the comma token has two meanings:   * as an operator (rarely used)   * as a separator (in argument and parameter lists, array and object literals, etc.) I'm not sure how a comma delimiter fits into this...
