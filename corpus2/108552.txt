My research group is developing some software for research purposes. The project leader wants the software to be open source and likes the GPL, but wants to ensure that they software cannot be sold. Are we reading the GPL correctly? The software can be freely modified, (re)distributed, and sold? If so, I see why it would be difficult to effectively sell the software; however, the GPL isn't quite strict enough for our needs. Any suggestions?
