Is it a bad practice to give two very different files with the same general purpose the same name, separating them into different directories?               <script src="client_scripts/app/player_stats/generator.js"></script>     <script src="client_scripts/app/coach_settings/generator.js"></script>      I'd like to keep my file names short, and both of the files have the same general purpose without being identical. I'm not sure whether or not this would be considered a bad practice in a professional programming environment. **I'd like to know what the best practice is in this situation.** Alternatively, at the expense of the name's short length, I could use:               <script src="client_scripts/app/player_stats/player_stats_generator.js"></script>     <script src="client_scripts/app/coach_settings/coach_settings_generator.js"></script>
