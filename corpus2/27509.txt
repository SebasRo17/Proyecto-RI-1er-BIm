I have a set of data of the kind {{$x_i$, $y_i$, $z_i$}, ...} at randomly chosen points $x_i, y_i$. The $z_i$ are supposed to be a smooth function of the $x_i$ and $y_i$. Unfortunately they turn out not to be. A few points stick out. These are local extrema - I want to find them and remove them from the data set. The problem is that the $x_i$ and $y_i$ are chosen randomly, so I cannot choose nearest neighbors for comparison easily. Are there any methods to find the nearest neighbors in a given list, or even directly to find the local maxima in a random grid?
