I have written a Perl module by starting with an existing Perl module of related functionality and modifying heavily. In fact, acccording to git blame I have changed (or created) every line of non-biolerplate code in the module. Of course, I have also changed the name of the module, so if I uploaded it to CPAN, it would not directly conflict with the original module. Anyway, despite my heavy modifications, the module is still conceptually based on its predecessor, and I would like to give credit to its authors. However, I can see how they might not appreciate having their names and emails slapped on what appears to be a new module without their knowing. So should I just put myself as the sole author and put the original module's authors in an "Acknowledgements" section? What is the best way to credit the original authors in my module?
