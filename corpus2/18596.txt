Quite a simple question, I reckon, however, even quite an extensive search hasn't helped me. I want to define a recursively defined sequence that starts with defined `f[1]` and `f[2]` and distinguishes the input like so: `f[3k]`, `f[3k+1]`, `f[3k+2]`. Each of these would have its own expression. For further clarification, an example: $$ f(3n) = f(n)+1 $$ $$ f(3n+1) = f(n)+2 $$ $$ f(3n+2) = f(n)+3 $$ How does one go about that? I do know how to write simple recursion formulas on the level of Fibonacci or a factorial, it's only the distinguishing the input part. Also, this should be possible without any `if` statements, etc. Thanks for any help!
