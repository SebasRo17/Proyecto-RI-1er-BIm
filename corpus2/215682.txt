I know the basics but do not how to model this (it is an exercise with no solution provided): > An order can contain 1 or more cartons of beer. Each carton contains 6 beers > of the same kind but there are some consisting of 3 different beer types > (still 6 in total) Also having a "Carton" class, how can I make it the way it either 6 beers (same ones) OR 6 beers of 3 various types?
