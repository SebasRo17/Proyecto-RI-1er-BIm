I was trying to create a Matrix falling code image with Mathematica. Here is my code:               mcolors=Blend[{{0.00,Darker[Green,0.7]},{0.90,Darker@Green},{0.90,Lighter[Green]},{1.00,Lighter[Green,0.9]}},#]&;     (*DensityPlot[x,{x,0,1},{y,0,1},ColorFunction\[Rule]mcolors,ColorFunctionScaling\[Rule]False,AspectRatio\[Rule]0.2]*)          stringColum[n_,opacity_]:=Module[{letters,fallingCode},            letters=MapIndexed[Text@Style[#1,mcolors[#2[[1]]/n],Opacity[opacity],Bold,14,FontFamily->"Courier"]&,FromCharacterCode/@RandomInteger[{48,90},n]];              fallingCode=Column[         letters         ,Background->None         ,Spacings->-0.4         ,Alignment->Center       ]     ]          layer1=Graphics[Table[Inset[stringColum[RandomInteger[{1,30}],1.0],Scaled[{i,RandomReal[{0.7,1}]}],Top],{i,0.000,1,0.05}],PlotRange->All];     layer2=Graphics[Table[Inset[stringColum[RandomInteger[{1,30}],0.4],Scaled[{i,RandomReal[{0.7,1}]}],Top],{i,0.025,1,0.05}],PlotRange->All];          Show[layer1,layer2,AspectRatio->1,Background-> Black,ImageSize-> {600,500}]      Where I get as result images like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEiGw.png) Not very exciting when compared to this one: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g4Jvw.png) **How can I improve that?** Some itens that I see.   1. I see a blur that I don't know as to reproduce using `Blur`, for different layers.   2. The letter are not just A to Z letters.   3. The columns space are not linear.   4. I don't like the way I handler all the code. It's sound to complex in Graphics part.
