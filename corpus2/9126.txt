Here's the code:               yan = FunctionInterpolation[x^2, {x, -1, 1}];     FullSimplify[yan[x] > -1, -1 < x < 1]      Needless to say, what I expect to see in the output is "True", but `FullSimplify` doesn't seem to work. What function should I turn to? * * * @J.M. @belisarius @acl 囧…A very simple solution suddenly struck me, it is:               yan = FunctionInterpolation[x^2, {x, -1, 1}];     MinValue[{yan[x], -1 < x < 1},x]>-1
