I'm about to start a "Bachelors of Science (Computer Science)" degree (in Australia, semester starts in march) and I'm presented with the option to learn c# or C++. First of all, I already know C#, and I love C#. It is just so easy to use. Not having to worry about memory management or garbage collecting makes my brain tingle. I've made plenty of apps / games in C# and I find the syntax easy to follow, I love intellisense (which I think C++ doesn't have), and it seems just to be a nice language in general. I've been trying to wrap my head around C++. First thing I can say... IT'S HARD. Half the time I'm thinking to myself: "Do I need to include a ^ symbol after String?", etc. The syntax just seems hard to follow and I get really aggravated over it. This is simply with me trying to teach myself, however, without a teacher. My goal after my degree is to join a game firm, and assist in making games, so that has to be a top factor in my decision making. Can you guys give me some advice? Thanks.
