I have lists like               list1={1, 1, 2, 3}; list2={3, 1, 4}; list3={};      I want to find the intersection of all list. I tried the following way, but it's not working.               Intersection[Cases[{list1, list2,list3}, Except[{}]]]      I want output like this               {1, 3}       Fell free, if you want to edit my question.
