I'd like to save `Manipulate[]` output so that I can embed an mp4 in my pdf document (using the media9 latex package). I've done this successfully in the past by manually constructing a table of Graphics objects, and then saving that to .avi format. That .avi can then be converted to .mp4 by ffmpeg. A cleaner way to do this is pointed out in this answer but the .avi file that is generated causes ffmpeg to choke:               Output #0, mp4, to 'MyAutorun.mp4':         Stream #0:0: Video: h264, yuv420p, 412x345, q=-1--1, 90k tbn, 15 tbc     Stream mapping:       Stream #0:0 -> #0:0 (rawvideo -> libx264)     Error while opening encoder for output stream #0:0 - maybe incorrect parameters such as     bit_rate, rate, width or height      I'm not really sure what this tool is complaining about, but wondered if there was a way to avoid using external tools to do this conversion and just export the animation data in mp4 format directly from Mathematica?
