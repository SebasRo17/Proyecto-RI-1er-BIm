I am currently using the Google-Gson library to convert Java objects into JSON inside a web service. Once the object has been converted to JSON, it is returned to the client to be converted into a JSON object using the JavaScript eval() function. Is the character escaping provided by the Gson library enough to ensure that nothing nasty will happen when I run the eval() function on the JSON payload? Do I need to HTML Encode the Strings in the Java Objects before passing them to the Gson library? Are there any other security concerns that I should be aware of?
