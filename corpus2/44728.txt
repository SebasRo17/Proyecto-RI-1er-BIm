I'm trying to make a control item in a `Manipulate` that is a simple dial. I'm trying to mimic `Manipulate[theta, {theta, 0, 360}]`, but with a `dial` instead of a `Slider`. I've sort of done this (see code below), but my variable pt doesn't reset to its original value when I hit the `ResetButton`. Any help would be appreciated.               DynamicModule[      {pt = {0.5, 0.5}},      Manipulate[       ArcTan @@ pt,       DynamicModule[        {},        LocatorPane[         Dynamic[pt],         Graphics[          {           Line[{{1.1, 0}, {0, 0}}],           EdgeForm[Thin],           {LightGray, Disk[]},           {Lighter@Lighter@LightGray, Disk[{0, 0}, 0.9]},           Dynamic[Disk[0.7 Normalize[pt], 0.08]]           },          PlotRange -> 1.3,          ImageSize -> 60],         Appearance -> None         ]        ],       AppearanceElements -> "ResetButton"       ]      ]
