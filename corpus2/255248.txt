We are two developers that have no previous experience in sharing one PHP project. In particular, cakePHP. We both use NetBeans and we have set the project up as a "PHP application from a remote server". For the project we also use git + bitbucket for version control as well. Now the problem is that whenever one of us makes any changes to the code and saves it, it gets updated on the server, but not in the other developer's environment. Is this the right path we are taking for sharing the project? How to make the code updates and how to avoid overriding other code?
