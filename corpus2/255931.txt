I want to understand the logic of how the Publisher Code range provided by ISBN Authority gets mapped to an ISBN. From the below links, http://xml.coverpages.org/costello-isbn-xsd.txt http://www.booklore.co.uk/Articles/Nigel/ISBNAtricle.htm                            Country     Publisher ID  If number ranges   Insert hyphen  Block Size                                              are between:     after the:                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       0           00.......19         00-19        3rd digit      1,000,000                    0           200......699        20-69        4th digit      100,000                    0           7000.....8499       70-84        5th digit      10,000                    0           85000....89999      85-89        6th digit      1,000                    0           900000...949999     90-94        7th digit      100                    0           9500000..9999999    95-99        8th digit      10                    1           55000....86979      5500-8697    6th digit      1,000                    1           869800...998999     8698-9989    7th digit      100                    1           9990000..9999999    9990-9999    8th digit      10       From the above table, what I understand is:   1. Any ISBN if broken for English Speaking areas should have a Publisher Code that falls in the above ranges specified.   2. Sample ISBN Number 978-0-00-000000-2, following forms the division, 978 as Prefix, 0 as English Speaking area, 00 as Publisher Code, Title digit - 6 digits (starts from 000000 to ending at 999999) and last the check digit calculated based on the number formed before. Questions:   1. Is my above assumptions and understanding correct ? Let me know if you need more information, please provide me the explanation for the table displayed above.
