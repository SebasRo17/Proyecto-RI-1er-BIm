Starting with a new dev team on a new project and we have to define our Branching strategy for our source repository ( _e.g. Microsoft Team Foundation Server 2010_ ). We've run into a sticky discussion over whether or not to... **A**. Have one **Release** branch from which we do production builds and then **Label** when something is actually released OR **B**. Have a new **Release** branch for each new Release into production ( _Ex. Version 1, 2, 3, etc..._ ) Option **A** seems pretty straight-forward but we're not sure if this will lead to problems in the long run. Option **B** seems like it just creates lots of one-time long-lived branches that just pile up over time. Does anyone have any experience either way that could help us decide? Specifically, I'm looking to hear where the pain-points are for any one choice. Feel free to provide specific experience relative to TFS and/or Release-Management implications.
