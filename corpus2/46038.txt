Can someone please answer these two parts of my homework assignment? Adding an explanation would be appreciated! > a. Test the Erdos square free conjecture for $n <= 30000$. You should use > `SquareFreeQ`. Give the time it takes to perform this test. For this part, I said,               {#, SquareFreeQ[#]} & /@ {Binomial[5, 30000]}      > b. Now test using your `squareFreeQ` and give the time it takes to perform > this test. For this part, my `squareFreeQ` is:               squareFreeQ[n_Integer] := Select[FactorInteger[n][[All, 2]], # > 1 &] == {}      For part b, my answer is:               {#, squareFreeQ[#]} & /@ {Binomial[5, 30000]}      But none of the answers seem to be correct.
