I am trying to plot the points (i,j,k) as they are generated in the loop but in the same plot. The next draws the points in different windows.               list = {};     Do[list = Append[list, {i, j, k}];       Print[ListPointPlot3D[list]], {i, 3}, {j, 3}, {k, 3}]      Is there any function in Mathematica that allows us to draw plots dynamically, i.e., keeping the plots that were already generated as new ones are being generated from a loop (all in the same window)?
