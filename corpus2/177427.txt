I have been doing some investigation regarding ASP.NET Web API. I have enjoyed using the WCF REST template to create new RESTful web services, and Web API seems to be a cleaner iteration on that. However, I like the flexibility of WCF in allowing http, TCP, MSMQ. This aspect seems to facilitate a distributed and scalable architecture. Is it correct for me to conclude that WCF would continue to be my best bet when it comes to fire-and-forget durable message queueing?
