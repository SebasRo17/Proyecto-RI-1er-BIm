C# (and the .net platform in general) is looking like it's becoming a good option form multi-targeting apps :   * official MS .net framework : full blow windows development, asp.net dev, Windows phone Dev, etc.   * mono and all its derivated : monotouch, monodroid : the rest of the world. This tools are today RTM.   * Does it means that C# is becoming a good language for targeting the most popular platforms : desktop, web and mobile ?   * Is it still better to use the "native" language of target platforms (objective C, Java, etc.)   * Is it only a screen of smoke and only marketing language ? Please note that I'm actually conscious I won't able to copy/paste the code between platforms. But I'm sure the lower layers of applications (models, business, etc.) can be reused, but I know I'll have to adapt the higher layers (Gui, etc.) to the platform. My goal is more focused on required skills than technical code sharing. [edit] I **am** a c# developer in a company that massively use c#. That's why I talked about c# in a plan to expand the range of target platforms in my company.
