Unsure if I'm asking this in the right place but here goes: **Security by Obscurity** is the process of making data so _obscure_ it therefore becomes _secure_ as no one can read/understand it. My question is what is the "term" for deleting data in order to make sure it is secure (i.e. deleting old e-mails)? I understand deleting could be argued as obscuring the data, but is this the correct term?
