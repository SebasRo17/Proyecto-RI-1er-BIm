I have a large table (7000 rows Ã— 17 columns) of terse textual data. In many of the columns, empty entries have been replaced with "." as a marker. Working from the top of the columns downward, I want to replace each successive "." with the data value (non-".") from above until the next data value is found; at which time I want to replace the next sequence of "." with the new data value etc. E.g.               x     -->  x       "."   -->  x       y     -->  y       "."   -->  y       "."   -->  y       z     -->  z       "."   -->  z        I need to do this for all rows of data. Any help would be greatly appreciated. -k-
