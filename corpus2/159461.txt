Seems like OO is everywhere. What if someone just doesn't grok it beyond a simple level, no matter how many books, workshops, kindly mentors etc they've had? Like some people are tone-deaf and can't carry a tune in a bucket, there seem to be some who just aren't going to carry on within a project based on deep and sophisticated object designs. Yet these are smart people who surely would be of great benefit in some role in some organization. What types of projects in what industries are largely free from OO, and can be expected to stay that way for the next several years?
