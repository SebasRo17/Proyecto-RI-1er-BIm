Currently I am in process of writing large batches of Unit-Tests in the Project I am working on. Additionally we recently Introduced GUI-Testing. This project is a relatively simple webapp, on basis of Java EE 6. Now my colleage did write quite some GuiTests, and I did write quite some Unit-Tests. For both tests we need data to run them. Now we both took different approaches on how we "store" the data we use. **Solution 1:**               public class UnitTestData {          public static final String DATA_PIECE = "some data";          public static final String MORE_DATA = "and more data";          //... and so on     }      **Solution 2:**               public class GuiTestData {         public String getDataPiece() {             return "some data";         }              public String getMoreData() {             return "and more data";         }         //... and so on.     }      My question now is: Which of these approaches is the _objectively_ better one?
