I am using Mathematica to evaluate an integral within a given time constraint. Note that I have read in values of 'BigList' or `BL` from a file. If the file has a value for `(l,m)` of zero, then I evaluate the integral, otherwise, I read in the value of the integral from the file. The idea is to continually allow more and more time and 'knock out' the easiest integrals each time, instead of having the script run for hours before stopping when it would get to 'easier' integrals later. My problem is that, for the integrals which evaluate to zero, the output happens far too quickly. The integrals will ONLY evaluate to zero if the time constraint is met, these integrals will _never_ be zero on their own, so I know that if I get an output of zero, that it did not evaluate the integral in the time constraint allowed. The output, however, prints `(l) (m) 0` (where `(l)` and `(m)` are actual numerical values of l and m) almost within less than a second of each other. This tells me that it is not spending the full time (15 seconds in the example below) on the integral. Does Mathematica somehow know that it will take longer and give up or is something else going on? Shouldn't it work for 15 seconds before stopping and resulting in zero?               29 (* total time for each integral allowed *)     30 tt = 15;     31 (* loop through NeedList and assign values *)     32 (* Print["BLsize = ", BLsize]; *)     33 For[i=1, i<=BLsize, i++,     34   If[BL[[i]][[3]]==0,     35     l=BL[[i]][[1]];     36     m=BL[[i]][[2]];     37     (* Assign Jm to be Integrate[Abs[Sin[m*theta],{theta,0,2*pi}]] *)     38     If[m==0,Jm=2*Pi,Jm=4];     39     Ilm=TimeConstrained[Integrate[Abs[LegendreP[l,Abs[m],z]],{z,-1,1}],tt,0];     40     If[Ilm==0, BL[[i]]={l,m,0},     41       If[l==0, BL[[i]]={l,m,1/(Ilm*Jm)}, BL[[i]]={l,m,2/(Ilm*Jm)}];     42     ];     43     (*Print[FortranForm[N[BL[[i]][[3]]]]];*)     44     Print[BL[[i]][[1]], " ", BL[[i]][[2]], " ", FortranForm[N[BL[[i]][[3]]]]];     45   ]     46 ];      EDIT: here is a full working example ...               finp = OpenRead["dens_coefs"];     (* BigList *)     BL = ReadList[finp,{Number,Number,Number}]     Close[finp];     BLsize = Length[BL];          (* total time for each integral allowed *)     tt = 20;     (* loop through NeedList and assign values *)     For[i=1, i<=BLsize, i++,       If[BL[[i]][[3]]==0,         l=BL[[i]][[1]];         m=BL[[i]][[2]];         (* Assign Jm to be Integrate[Abs[Sin[m*theta],{theta,0,2*pi}]] *)         If[m==0,Jm=2*Pi,Jm=4];         Ilm=TimeConstrained[Integrate[Abs[LegendreP[l,Abs[m],z]],{z,-1,1}],tt,0];         If[Ilm==0, BL[[i]]={l,m,0},           If[l==0, BL[[i]]={l,m,1/(Ilm*Jm)}, BL[[i]]={l,m,2/(Ilm*Jm)}];         ];         Print[BL[[i]][[1]], " ", BL[[i]][[2]], " ", FortranForm[N[BL[[i]][[3]]]]];       ]     ];      an example of an input file might be:               3 -3 0.02829421210522584     3 -2 0.06666666666666667     3 -1 0.5706901657772195     3 0 0.     3 1 0.5706901657772195     3 2 0.06666666666666667     3 3 0.02829421210522584     4 -4 0.004464285714285714     4 -3 0.011904761904761904     4 -2 0.1361783763047951     4 -1 0.     4 0 0.     4 1 0.     4 2 0.1361783763047951     4 3 0.011904761904761904     4 4 0.004464285714285714      the program _should_ read these numbers in, figure out which ones are zero (in this case, {3,0}, {4,-1}, {4,0}, {4,1}) and attempt to produce the corresponding integrals. it should take no more than 20 seconds, but if it returns 'zero' then it should take AT LEAST 20 seconds (very close to 20 seconds, maybe a few clock cycles over). for what it is worth, i am running this from a command line script on a linux machine. i have tried `TimeConstrained` arguments in a Mathematica notebook (though not the _exact_ same thing) and it waits, as it should, in the notebook, but it is not waiting the full 20 seconds in the script. EDIT(2): for what it's worth, this seems to work as intended when running it from a notebook interface. it is only when running the script from command line that it gives me problems. any idea why that would happen?
