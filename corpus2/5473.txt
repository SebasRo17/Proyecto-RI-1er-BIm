I was reading the wikipedia article on programming style and noticed something in an argument against vertically aligned code: > Reliance on mono-spaced font; tabular formatting assumes that the editor > uses a fixed-width font. Most modern code editors support proportional > fonts, and the **programmer may prefer to use a proportional font for > readability**. To be honest, I don't think I've ever met a programmer who preferred a proportional font. Nor can I think of any really good reasons for using them. Why would someone prefer a proportional font?
