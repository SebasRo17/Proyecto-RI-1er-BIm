Although I suspect the answer to this question may be something along the lines of "popularity is irrelevant; each algorithm has its trade-offs", I'm interested in a list of popular sorting algorithms used in practice. I was browsing Wikipedia's page on sorting algorithms and while there are not that many algorithms listed there, I still don't see all of them being used. For example, surely selection sort wouldn't be used in practice since it has a `O(n^2)` right? So, which are used in practice a lot?
