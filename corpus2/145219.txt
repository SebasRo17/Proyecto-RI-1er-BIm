I'm thinking of how we do JVM memory monitor in a low overhead way in production environment even under busy hour. Suppose I have two tomcat app server in production, load balance set up behind them. If I can see the jvm memory statistics I can tell load balance to stop sending the request to the server which will encounter OOM issue. Do this make sense? Jconsole or VisualVM eats more performance resourse is not my choice.
