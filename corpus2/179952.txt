Is there a difference between               public class A extends AbstractB implements C     {...}      versus...               public class A extends AbstractB     {...}     AbstractB implements C     {...}      I understand that in both cases, class A will end up conforming to the interface. In the second case, `AbstractB` can provide implementation for interface methods in `C`. Is that the only difference? **If I do NOT want to provide an implementation for any of the interface methods in** `AbstractB`, **which style should I be using**? Does using one or the other have some hidden 'documentation' purpose?
