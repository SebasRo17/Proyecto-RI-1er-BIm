I have been programming in C# .Net for nearly three years, and only C# .Net. I'm filling in my CV/resume and it looks a bit rubbish because I don't know any other languages (that I'm confident enough to include anyway). As I can't put my age/DoB on it I'm a little worried that employers won't take a second glance. I'm very good at OO design, TDD, etc... And so a graduate level job is probably a little low but with only one language under my belt I'm not sure I'll be considered for 'regular' level developer. Is it a good idea to include years of experience? Or should I just big up the cross cutting concerns (TDD, OO...)? Or any other suggestions to get to interview?
