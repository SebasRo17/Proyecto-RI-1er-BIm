I use a ViewFlipper in a dialog. I want to fetch the data from the EditText in both of them and also add click listeners to both of them. I can write the whole code in one big file, but i want to separate the logic to different files. since i don't need UI and full life cycle I don't use Activities but plain managers. what should i pass these managers to use `findViewById()`? if i pass context how can i fetch its UI's root view?
