I just graduated from my College with a B.S. in Comp. Science. Although it was a good school, we're the only accredited CS department in our state. I feel like im a decent programmer, not amazing, but not terrible. I got my first job about 2 weeks ago, it's a pretty entry level job: firmware development/tester. There isn't a whole lot of coding to be had right now (mostly simple stuff) but soon I will have the option of helping out with development (which is what I want to do). Thing is I have never worked on a huge project. In school we had "group" projects but nothing really big. So I'm not familiar with huge classes and such (main language was C++). Is this something I'll just get used to with time? Some fellow students were used to that with internships and such.but I never got that chance. My job was mostly a "one man job" kinda thing. Mostly little things. Plus in class we never did huge projects anyways. How do you guys "plan" out these things? Do you use a whiteboard and plan out classes and such or what? Another worry of mine is that I have to use google a lot for examples of code, because sometimes I just don't get how something works. Is this normal? I mean "technically" I've had 4-5 years coding experience but it really only feels like I had 2 years of actual experience.
