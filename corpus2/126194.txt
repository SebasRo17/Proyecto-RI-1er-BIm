**This question was reopened on "English Language & Usage":** http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/53683/synonyms-for-multiplexing- and-demultiplexing/ This question is related to something written in C#, but it can be answered by programmers familiar with _any_ language, as the question pertains not to the code itself, but to _naming_ of what the code does. I posted a question on StackOverflow titled Multiplexing interface method calls into a single delegate and demultiplexing asking if anyone knows of any mechanism that will marshal interface method calls into invocations of a universal delegate (or single method interface) of the form `object AnyCall( int method_selector, object[] arguments )` and marshal back from such invocations into the original interface method calls. Since nothing suitable came up, I went ahead and I created such a mechanism. (If it is not clear to you what this mechanism does, please read the original question.) Then, I wrote a paper about this mechanism, which is almost ready, and I am about to publish it on CodeProject, but before I do that I need some help with my naming choices. Naming is quite important to me, and I consider dictionary.com and thesaurus.com as programming tools, but sometimes help from native speakers is indispensable, especially when an attempt is being made to introduce a new concept, or to take an existing technique which had no special name assigned to it thus far, and give it a special name, thus promoting it to a concept.
