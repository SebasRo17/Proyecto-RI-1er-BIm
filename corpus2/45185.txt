I am making a larger program, so I would prefer to give a short example of my problem:                   soba={2.45649, 4.04015, 4.92679, 4.03324, 0.761532, 2.41486, 1.96081,     4.37201, 4.26696, 2.99139}          While[NumberQ[Select[soba, Function[{a}, a > 2], 1][[1]]],       soba = (soba /. Select[soba, Function[{a}, a > 2], 1][[1]] -> 1)]               Wanted output:          {1, 1, 1, 1, 0.761532, 1, 1.96081, 1, 1, 1}      The reason why I want this to happen is: First I want to find the first value in the list that matches criteria, second I want a rule to be applied in this case it is just changing the value to 1. But in the real code it is changing several values based on some other rules, it could for example change `2.45649, 4.04015, 4.92679, 4.03324` with `1`. Then I want it to run over the list again, but since it now has changed all this values `2.45649, 4.04015, 4.92679, 4.03324`to 1 my next value it would pick is `2.41486`.Then change the list based on some rules and run the code all over again on the updated list. First off all you can see that the code does not work, second THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY!
