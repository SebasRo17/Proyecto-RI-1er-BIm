I am looking to solicit the community's opinion on whether or not it would be advisable to teach junior developers to code with implicit typing (using var) or should I encourage the use of explicit types. This is not really a question about the advantages or disadvantages of implicit typing. Junior developers (at least the ones that I deal with) tend to develop very long lasting coding habits in their first years as professional developers and I am trying to think through the potential downside of starting a developer off with the implicit typing approach. Are there specific scenarios that would warrant the advocacy of explicit typing? What about as part of the discipline of TDD? **And on the issue of ReSharper...** @Eben Geer mentioned ReSharper in his answer. Should we keep the default suggestion to use implicit typing in the inspection templates that our junior developers use?
