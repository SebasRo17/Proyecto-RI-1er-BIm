I read that there exists three main types of databases               * Transactional (Client-Server database// OLTP database)     * Decision support system (DSS) (Data warehouse database // Data mart // Reporting database)     * Hybrid      What is the type of database considered for a social network, like Facebook or Twitter? I guess the category is:               Transactional > Client -Server database.      From the book: **A transactional database is a database based on small changes to the database (that is, small transactions).The database is transaction-driven. In other words, the primary function of the database is to add new data, change existing data, delete existing data, all done in usually very small chunks, such as individual records.** But, as I said, I am not sure.
