I am solving a recursive expression with `ParallelTable`. Here is a MWE showing how I do it, and how I set the initial condition:               SetSharedVariable[vals]     t[n_] := t[n - 1]*i*NIntegrate[Exp[-i*x^2], {x, -Infinity, Infinity}];          t[0] = 1;          vals = ParallelTable[{i, t[3]}, {i, 1, 500}];      The expression `t` depends on `i` implicitly. Now I want to make this dependency explicit, as shown here (note, it is **not** a functioning example!):               SetSharedVariable[vals]     t[d_, n_] :=        t[n - 1]*d*NIntegrate[Exp[-d*x^2], {x, -Infinity, Infinity}];          (* WHAT TO DO WITH THIS, THE INITIAL CONDITION? *)     t[i, 0] = 1;          vals = ParallelTable[{i, t[i, 3]}, {i, 1, 500}];      My concern is regarding the initial condition. When I am dealing with `tables`, is there an easy way to implement initial conditions, or do I have to use a `For`-loop for that (where `i` is the variable)?
