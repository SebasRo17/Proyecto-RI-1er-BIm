Easiest way to keep my library nice, is to naively call some functions many times with same parameters. Doing so prevents from zoo of (library-)global variables and complicated initialisation functions. I would expect Mathematica to optimise somehow functions calls with same parameters, but it does not appear to do that. Fallowing example is ran on Mathematica 9:               rands = Array[Random[] &, {2500, 2500}];     Timing[Inverse[rands];]     Timing[Inverse[rands];]     Timing[Inverse[rands];]     Timing[Inverse[rands];]      Output:               {0.687500, Null}     {0.687500, Null}     {0.687500, Null}     {0.687500, Null}      Is there a way to make Mathematica optimise revaluation with same parameters? What kind of nice workaround would you recommend? **EDIT** As I learned, the keyword I needed was _memoization_. I found this post very useful. Thanks!
