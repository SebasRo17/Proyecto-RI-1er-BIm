For a project planning I have an initial period, lets call it `PPStart-PPEnd`.   The planning is associated with a project. This also has a period `PrjStart- PrjEnd`. PrjStart and PrjEnd are fixed, and can be unbound, i.e. the project start time or end time are not defined. `PPStart-PPEnd` should be adjusted so that people can only plan tasks in the valid project period. If that changes the duration, fine.   How do I efficiently limit `PPStart-PPEnd` to `PrjStart-PrjEnd` without having to go over all the possible combinations?   Maybe first detecting overlapping periods is a good start? 4 examples on a time axis ([-- = bound, <\-- = unbound):               Project planning period:                                   [---PPStart-PPEnd---]     Project periods relative to ppp:                                                                       [---PrjStart-PrjEnd---]   PPStart should be set to PrjStart, PPEnd unchanged                          [---PrjStart-PrjEnd---]                  PPEnd should be set to PrjEnd, PPStart unchanged                          [---PrjStart-PrjEnd------------------->  No adjustments         [---PrjStart-PrjEnd---]                                   PPStart should be set to PrjStart and PPEnd to PrjEnd.      Cases like that last one make it complex.
