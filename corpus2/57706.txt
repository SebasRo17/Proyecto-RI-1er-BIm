I usually create my course contracts in Mathematica and then save them in PDF format. The notebooks include hyperlinks and these have transferred to PDF without problem over the last several versions of Mathematica (at lease 7, 8 an 9). Is there something different that I need to do in version 10 in order to preserve hyperlinks? I tried `SetOptions[$FrontEndSession, PrintingStyleEnvironment -> "Working"]`. But this only changed font sizes.
