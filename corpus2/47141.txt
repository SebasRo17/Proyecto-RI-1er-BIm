I have no idea how to dynamically update a parameter inside `NDSolve`. For example consider following first-order DE:               Eq = x'[t] + (x[t] - λ) == 0;      where `λ` is a parameter. I want to solve this ODE but this parameter might change when `x'[t]` turns to zero:               WhenEvent[x'[t] == 0, λ -> x[t]].      I tried following code, but that doesn't work. Any idea?               λ = 1;     Eq = x'[t] + (x[t] - λ) == 0;     sol = NDSolve[{Eq, x[0] == 0,                    WhenEvent[x'[t] == 0., λ -> x[t]]                   }, x, {t, 0, 5}][[1]]
