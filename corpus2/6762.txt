I need to run a simple `ParallelTable`:               ParallelTable[       {tab1[[i1]], tab2[[i2]], tab3[[i3]], tab4[[i4]],        fun[tab1[[i1]],tab2[[i2]],tab3[[i3]],tab4[[i4]]]       },        {i1, 1, n1}, {i2, 1, n2}, {i3, 1,n3}, {i4, 1, n4}     ]      The computation, however, is parallelized only on the outermost index `i1` and not on all of them. The problem is that I have more cores than `n1` and so I'm not computing this table as fast as I had hoped. Is there a simple way to run on as many cores as possible without having to rewrite the table in a flattened version?
