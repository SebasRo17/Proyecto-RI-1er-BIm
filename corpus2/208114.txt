I have been coding for a while, but mostly scripts and simple applications. I've moved into a new role where it is all about developing Web Apps and using a proper MVC architecture, so I am desperately trying to learn about all that very quickly. I hope this question is not too similar to "Best Practices for MVC Architecture" but as I am going through a few different tutorials, I noticed that some have multiple controllers for different things. **How many controllers does a single web app need?** I realize this would be difficult to answer without an example so I'll provide one: Application:   1. User logs in.   2. User can do one of three things:   **a)** Upload a file (stored in a mongodb database with meta data).   **b)** Search for a file.   **c)** Log out. My question is a general one, but I gave the example to help out anyone trying to answer.
