So I'm a senior in college and a couple of weeks ago, I interviewed at Microsoft for an entry-level SDE position. While most of the interviews (out of the total 7) were on the general principles of data structures and algorithms, one of the interviewers asked me if I knew anything about distributed computing. I replied that, while I haven't had a course on 'distributed computing' per se, I'd like to take a stab at the question. He proceeded to ask a question on mutexes and semaphores that was covered in our operating systems course, and I thought was more about parallelism and concurrency than distributed computing. Having gone through this experience, I am led to wonder as to what exactly constitutes distributed computing? Do multiple parallel threads trying to synchronize for access to a resource constitute a problem in the domain of distributed computing?
