I started with ActionScript 2.0 and then went on with Java. I have learned, or at least used, a bunch of languages since then, including Python (probably my favorite). I'm afraid that my style of object oriented programming is very unpythonic though, and more like Java OOP with Python syntax. What makes Java like and Pythonic OOP differ from each other? What things do Java programmers often do "unpythonically" when writing object oriented code in Python?
