I'm currently studying engineering in Telecommunications and Electronics and we have migrated from assembler to C in microprocessor programming. I have doubts that this is a good idea. What are some advantages and disadvantages of C compared to assembly? The advantages/disadvantages I see are: **Advantages:**   * I can tell that C syntax is a lot easier to learn than Assembler syntax.   * C is easier to use for making more complex programs.   * Learning C is somehow more productive than learning assembler cause there is more developing stuff around C than Assembler. **Disadvantages:**   * Assembler is a lower level programming language than C,so this makes it a good for programming directly to hardware.   * Is a lot more flexible alluding you to work with memory,interrupts,micro-registers,etc.
