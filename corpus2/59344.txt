I'm choosing components to set up a pc aimed to run large symbolic computations in Mathematica 9.0 under Windows 7 64 Bit Pro. I have a limited budget therefore I'm considering this system:   * Mother Board Asrock Z97 Extreme 4   * cpu Intel Haswell Core i5-4690K (AVX2, BMI, TSX)   * ram HyperX Fury Memory Black Memorie RAM, 32 GB, 1866 MHz HX318C10FBK2/16 and I have no chance to buy a second machine if the first prove to be badly effective. At present moment, I have no money for a GPU video card. May be in future I can add one. Does Mathematica's standard licence allow the use of all features of this hardware ? Does the hardware lack some major features Mathematica could make use of ? Thanks !!
