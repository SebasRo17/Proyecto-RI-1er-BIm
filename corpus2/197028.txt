Most people say do not use JSPs. But what if I have a JSP that does not show anything, it only acts as a controller? Why would I do that? Because we do not need to redeploy complete webapp to make a small but significant change in a servlet -> instead can just put my new JSP in the JBoss _tmp_ folder till we do a full deploy. This controller JSP will of course include / redirect to other view JSPs for final rendering. Question what are the downsides of doing this? If we already have it in our application (it's been working for the last 8 years before I joined); should we keep it as it works or are there any compelling reasons to change it to a regular servlet? Note: the JSPs in question are not the only controller, rather they do some of the processing for certain use cases
