I'm a big fan of using open source software but I mostly use community binary releases for the job. I'm wondering about companies that go the extra degree and build everything they use in their production server application infrastructure entirely from source, in-house, in an effort to promote transparency and supportability (instead of relying on binaries). Is it practical and sustainable to do this? It seems that the sheer number of dependencies to maintain and build from source for some of the major open source projects would quickly complicate things.
