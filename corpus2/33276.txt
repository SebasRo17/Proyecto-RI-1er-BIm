I'm trying to find the roots of the equation as a variable of `k`:               a = 0.81; b = 1.94;     LegendreP[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, 1] == 0      The problem is that this function is almost divergent everywhere except only a few points, and FindRoot and Reduce seems to fail on this               FindRoot[LegendreP[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, 1] == 0, {k, 0}]      > FindRoot::nlnum: The function value {ComplexInfinity} is not a list of > numbers with dimensions {1} at {k} = {1.49012*10^-8}. >>               Reduce[LegendreP[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, 1] == 0, k]      > Reduce::inex: Reduce was unable to solve the system with inexact > coefficients or the system obtained by direct rationalization of inexact > numbers present in the system. Since many of the methods used by Reduce > require exact input, providing Reduce with an exact version of the system > may help. >>               With[{a = 81/100, b = 194/100},       Reduce[LegendreP[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, 1] == 0, k]]      > Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Reduce. >> How would I solve this equation? The roots are `k = n*a`, where n is integer. * * * **Edit** The motivation of this problem is to determine the bound states of a one- dimensional potential well $$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V(x)\psi=-\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}\psi $$ where $$ V(x)=-\frac{\hbar^2b}{m}sech^2(a x) $$ ,$k$ is a parameter. This equation has solution               ψ[x_]:=A*LegendreP[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, Tanh[a x]] +       B*LegendreQ[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, Tanh[a x]]          V[x_] := -((\[HBar]^2 b)/m) Sech[a x]^2     -(\[HBar]^2/(2 m)) ψ''[x] + V[x] ψ[x] == -((\[HBar]^2 k^2)/(2 m)) ψ[x] // FullSimplify     (*True*)      Quantum mechanics requires the wave function is finite, which gives a constrain on parameter `k` and thus the eigen-energies($\sim k^2$) are some discretized values. And I'm trying to find these eigen-energies. Mathematically, this is equivalent to finding the $k's$ that keep associate Legendre polynomials finite in region `0 <= x <= 1`               A*LegendreP[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, x]+B*LegendreQ[(-a + Sqrt[8 b + a^2])/(2 a),  k/a, x]      . **Edit2** For the wave function must be normalizable and square-integratable, here is the explanation in the Griffiths's Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: > For some solutions to the Schrodinger equation the integral is infinite; in > that case no multiplicative factor is going to make it 1. The same goes for > the trivial solution $\Psi = 0$. Such non-normalizable solutions cannot > represent particles, and must be rejected.

For the case of free particle, he also explained why it's not normalizable: > In the case of the free particle, then, the separable solutions do not > represent physically realizable states.
