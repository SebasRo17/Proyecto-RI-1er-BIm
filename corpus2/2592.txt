Suppose I have a list of positive integers:               data={1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 12, 16, 23}      I want to count the number of subsets up to length _t_ (including an empty set) whose total doesn't exceed the value _t_. The naive approach would be:               sumZaehl[t_, data_] :=       Length@Select[Total /@ Subsets[data, t], # <= t &]      But this would not work for larger list, because of the rapidly increasing number of subsets. I have an iterative method which works for larger list too:               sumZaehlIter[t_, data_] :=     Module[{n = Length[data], v, d, i, j},       For[i = 0, i <= t, i++, v[i] = 1];       For[i = 1, i <= n, i++,         d = data[[i]];         For[j = t, j >= d, j--,             v[j] = v[j] + v[j - d];       ]];     v[t]]      Is there a functional way to realize this?
