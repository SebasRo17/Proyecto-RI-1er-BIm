A common problem in the derivative section of calculus texts is "find the equation of the line that is tangent to the curve $y = \ldots$ at the point $P$." To find the line that is tangent to $y = 2 x \sin x$ at $(\pi/2,\pi)$, I'd do something like this in Mathematica:               y[x_] := 2 x Sin[x]     y[x] == y'[x] x + b /. x -> Pi/2;     bRule = Solve[%, b][[1]];     y == y'[a] x + b /. bRule /. a -> Pi/2      which outputs `y == 2 x`. Is this more or less idiomatic Mathematica code? Is there a better way?
