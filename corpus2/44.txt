If I do               ClearAll[a, d]     lsts = {{a, d}, {a, d}};     Union[lsts]      I get the expected answer               {{a, d}}      but if I do               lsts = {{a, d}, {d, a}};     Union[lsts]      I get               {{a, d}, {d, a}}      Since I am using `Union`, I thought the order of the lists would not matter. Hence to get around this, now I always add `Sort` first, like this               lsts = {{a, d}, {d, a}};     Union[Sort /@ lsts]      and now I get expected answer               {{a, d}}      **Question** : Is this the right way to approach this? or do you recommend a better way?
