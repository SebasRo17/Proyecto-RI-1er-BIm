I am having trouble with adding a legend to a plot. The example I discuss here is simpler than my real problem, but describes it well. I have a vector, called X with dimensions (100 x 6). I use the command `ListPlot` to plot one row of X at a time:               plotX={};     Do[     p1=ListPlot[X[[i]]];     AppendTo[plotX,p1],     {i,1,Length[X]}];      Therefore, the list `plotX` contains six list plots with 100 points each. To show all the plots, I use the command `Show`               Show[plotX]      Now I want to create a legend for this graph, for example `{"x1","x2","x3","x4","x5","x6"}`. How can I do this? Thanks
