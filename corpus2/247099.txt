I have some shortest path data for a graph. Can I reconstruct the graph itself from this data? More precisely, I have a boolean (0/1) matrix for each vertex _v_ in graph _(V, E)_. Matrix element _[s,d]_ is equal to 1 iff _v_ is in the shortest path from source vertex _s_ to destination vertex _d_. All edges in the graph have the same length. For example, for the graph               (V1) -- (V2) -- (V3)      the three matrices would be: V1:               1 1 1     1 0 0     1 0 0      V2:               0 1 1     1 1 1     1 1 0      V3:               0 0 1     0 0 1     1 1 1      My questions: 1) is there an algorithm to reconstruct the set of edges E from these matrices? 2) is solution always unique? (this is more of a personal curiosity than a real requirement) 3) can the algorithm be generalized to nonuniform edge lengths?
