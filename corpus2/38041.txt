I want to hide my input, but not with "close cell". i also want to have fast access to the input cell. i found Mr.Wizard's AutoCollapse function, but it doesn't work with two or more Print-functions in the input. Also double-clicking the output cell is not the solution, because i have more output cells. merging them is just a temporary solution because i get new output cells with the next calculation of the input. here's a code example:               Print["Rechung:"]     l01 = -350;     Print[l01, "€"]     Print["---> bezahlt"]     Print["Trinkgeld:"]     l02 = -150;     Print[l02, "€"]     Print["---> bezahlt"]     Print["Total:"]     total = 0;     Print[total, "€"]      is there no easy way?
