Consider the following:               if(a == b or c)      In most languages, this would need to be written as:               if(a == b or a == c)      which is slightly cumbersome and repeats information. I know my above sample syntax is slightly clunky, but I am sure there are better ways to convey the idea. Why don't more languages offer it? Is there performance or syntax issues?
