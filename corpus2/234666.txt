Does the variable used for iteration in a `foreach` loop have a more specific term than simply 'the foreach variable?' Especially to differentiate it from the collection variable? E.g. `item` in `foreach (item in collection)` Edit: Loop variant was suggested (wiki): > In computer science, a loop variant is a mathematical function defined on > the state space of a computer program whose value is monotonically decreased > with respect to a (strict) well-founded relation by the iteration of a while > loop under some invariant conditions, thereby ensuring its termination. To me this sounds similar to 'iteration variable.' Is this strictly speaking correct? I would have assumed that 'loop variant' refers to the internal integer (or similar) that the `collection` enumerator uses for its internal state- not the variable that is set to the `Current` value on each iteration. Also, an enumerator of a linked list or a dummy enumerator that never terminates do not have monotonically decreasing variables, while at the same time the `foreach` loop does have its `item` variable. Edit 2: The motivation of this question is to find a descriptive name for a parameter in a bytecode emitting API. This parameter is a number that refers to the local that will be set on each generated foreach iteration. It's not an `iterationLocal`, that would be misleading. `currentLocal` may be the most helpful name.
