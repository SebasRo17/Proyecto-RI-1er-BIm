Per this question, I have created a custom graphical control object which evaluates to a list of values. I would like to be able to create such an object quickly, rather than typing some command, pressing shift+enter, then copying the resulting object into wherever I want to use it. For example, something like typing `\[Theta]` which turns into `Î¸`... is it possible to create such a custom shorthand notation? (Even better, is it possible that when I start to type in a function which takes such a list as arguments, it pops up this control object for me to type the values in?)
