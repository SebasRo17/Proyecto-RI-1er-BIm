With little or none previous experience of testing, I'm looking into adding automated testing to a continuous integration process of SharePoint applications. I've learned how this can be achieved using coded UI tests that are run before deployment and during the build and I've used Selenium with Java before, where we didn't record any scenarios but instead wrote tests by hand, identifying elements in the GUI and asserting results. With this little experience, I have a few questions about UI testing.   1. Is it possible to write test methods that can be applied on several different applications, such as testing buttons etc. or is this something that has to be written for each project, since the results of button click may vary? I assume that this would require following a specific standard .   2. Are there any UI testing methods that can be generalized and applied to all projects that go through a certain build, or is the same here that all UI tests must be written specifically for that application?
