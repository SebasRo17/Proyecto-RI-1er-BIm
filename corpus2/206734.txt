I've done a spot of Googling, and all I can find is information on using code under the MPL in a larger GPL licensed project. What I really want to know is: can I included GPL(v3) licensed code(/binaries) in a larger MPL(2.0) licensed project? My understanding so far is that I can't, and that any project which uses GPL software must also be released under the GPL. Is this correct? If this is correct, can I write software and release it under the MPL, even if it depends on a GPL library, as long as I don't distribute the GPL licensed parts with my MPL licensed parts? And, if I then want to distribute both parts as a "larger work", how would the overarching GPL affect my MPL code?
