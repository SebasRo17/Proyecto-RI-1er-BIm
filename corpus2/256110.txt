I have been tossing the idea around in the old noggin of creating a simple p2p chat application that would run in a linux environment and possibly be written in C. It's been awhile since I have written an application that wasn't a web app and I have been wanting to do more with C. I have always been curious just how p2p applications function so I figure this would be a nice way to further my understanding of both the C programming language and the architecture of p2p apps. The only problem is I'm not quite sure where to start. I have done a bit of initial research and found the following C library for p2p applications here. Right now my questions would be:   1. What else should I research before starting the project?   2. Does anyone know of any other C libraries for p2p applications?   3. Does anyone have any good links or know of good books on p2p protocols? My final goal for this would be to have an executable that two people could open on their system and communicate back and forth...simple I know, but education is my primary goal here. Any other information on the topic is also greatly appreciated! Thanks :)
