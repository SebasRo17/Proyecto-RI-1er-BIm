I am just wondering. I've never licensed any code before and there is so many separate information about that I am a little bit confused; I watched the codes which are published in the Internet and some of them contain their author name and license info so that makes the code some kind of personalized; So my question is... what author should do to be able to : A) License his code B) Say he is the code author C) Place the code in Internet (apache web site or something in this direction) D) Say it is under apache/GNU license or something? I am talking about open-source and non-commercial licenses; And the most important thing is... should I patent the code before to prove I am the code owner to license it? And what organization(s) I should join? In music it is something like ASCAP ( but in my case I don't mean commercial purposes); but what about programming? Are there some societies which I can join to be sure I can prove the code I published (on their official site etc) is really mine? Thanks
