I am developing a small application which I want to make open source. Currently only my work is on the application, and so in all the files I have put up a copyright notice in my name. Now when I make the project open source and say a developer Sam does some enhancements to some existing files. Then should he be allowed to put up a copyright notice in his name as well? And what if a new file is added by Sam which is entirely his work. So should he add his copyright or mine? I feel that all files should have only my name as copyright irrespective of the work done by anybody. This is because say I have added some code which depends on Sam's copyrighted code and the application is running on it. Now in future if Sam is approached by some organization then he can sell the code under his copyright. If this happens then my application will stop working because I will have to remove Sam's code and all the depending code of mine. This is just what I feel. What is the common practice in the Open Source Community? Note I want to use GNU LGPL as my license. I am maintaining a list of contributors which can be viewed by clicking a button in the About Dialog.
