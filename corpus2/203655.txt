If I abandon creating model objects which I only use to pass information and use NSDictionaries instead and have constant for keys in the same place where I am using the model, then does it have any impact on performance ? **For example:** If I start passing NSDictionaries to custom cell's instead of creating Model classes for the cell, will it be fine if I am not providing any methods in the class of that model. I have seen this a lot in iOS APIs like NSNotifications. I have rarely seen this in Java where collections are being used as an integral part of an API.
