I'll be the first to say that this question is a bit... out there. But here are a couple questions I bear in mind : **Is abstraction continuous or discrete?** **Is there a single unit of abstraction?** But I'm not sure those questions are truly answerable or even really makes sence. My naive answer would be something along the lines of _abitrarily discrete_ but not necescarily having a single unit measure. Here's what I mean... Take a Black Labrador; an abstraction that could be made is that a Black Lab is a type of animal. `[Animal]<--[Black Lab]` A Black Lab is also a type of Dog. `[Dog]<--[Black Lab]` One way to establish a degree of abstraction is by comparing the two the abstractions. We could say that `[Animal]` is more abstract than `[Dog]` in respect to a Black Lab. It just so happens `[Animal]` can also be used as an abstraction of `[Dog]` So, we might end up with something like `[Animal]<--[Dog]<--[Black Lab]` With the model above, one might be inclined to say that there's two hops of abstraction to get from `[Black Lab]` to `[Animal]`. But you can't exactly tell somebody they need one level abstraction and reasonalby expect they will come up with `[Dog]` given they aren't explicity given the options above. **If I needed to tell someobody in a single email that they needed an abstract class with out knowing what that abstract class is, is there a way to communaticate a degree of abstraction such that they _might_ end up on Dog instead of Animal?** As a side note, what area of study might this type of analysis fall under?
