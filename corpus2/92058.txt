For the independent developers, or the weeknight/weekend developers, when you are about to begin a large/enterprise project, what are you first steps to take when hashing out the pre-coding details and designs?

Do you use UML? What my question is, is what's the first step you take when designing a large application? What medium do you use to record your notes? And when are you typically content to start writing code?
