For example, a bit or a boolean can be either 0 or 1 so the number 2 is associated with it. Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8. Is there a name for this number? When we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or `<missing>`. I think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value `boolean locked` could become `null` and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to `false` somewhere if the real value was `null` and similar problems. So why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types? There is a mathematical term named "arity" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of "event space" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set `{0,1}` which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).
