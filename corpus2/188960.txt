This is my usecase: Traverse a filesystem, gauge its entire size and then upload it to Dropbox. Looks quite easy and is quite easy. Now if I do it using celery and spawn a thread for each folder(With sub files), then it becomes an easier process to gather all the data and gauge the size and then upload it to dropbox. But I feel I'm doing something wrong here. If I implement this on a server, I'm surely overloading it by spawning a thread for each folder that is out there. Hence, what algorithms should I use to make this a faster process? Both as a data retrieval and data uploading. Links/References would help.
