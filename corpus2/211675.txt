First of all I have gone through this question Why is #include <iostream.h> bad? and there the reason was simply that it is outdated but I personally think that as a header iostream was better cos you don't have to declare objects like cout and endl in global scope cos they were already in global scope and moreover since # is not used anymore that means it does not comes under a pre-processor directive. I just need to know that why was this done? I still use turbo sometimes and am comfortable in using it in c++ programs even though gcc and g++ provide better debuggers and everything.
