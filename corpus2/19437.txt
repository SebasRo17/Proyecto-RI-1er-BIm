I've been looking at the Ms-PL license that ASP.NET MVC and DotNetOpenAuth are published under and 3A says this:               3 Conditions and Limitations          (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.      Does this mean that I cannot name my project ASP.NET MVC DotNetOpenAuth Sample Project and publish it if I use these two technologies or does it just mean that I cannot use the author's name to promote this project?
