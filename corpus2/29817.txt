The documentation on `String` states: ![Strings preserve internal formatting](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f0DA7.png) But if I try to perform some manipulations on this string, for example, take 2 words from the left, I get some shards of internal representation instead (which is understandable):               (* In[2]:= *) StringTake[%1, 8]     (* Out[2]= "\!\(\*\nStyl" *)      _Question:_ Is it possible to write a function which strips all formatting (colors, fonts, style, size, etc) from a string and returns just a plain text?
