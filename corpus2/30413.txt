I am plotting a few curves inside a frame with labels on three of its sides; left, right and bottom. I want legends to be places at the top. The problem which I am facing is that the top label occupies white space and I want it not to do so. In the code it is labeled as "I want this removed". Please guide me how can I remove the top label completely leaving no gap between frame and legends.               Plot[{Sin[h],Cos[h],Tan[h]},{h,5,10},     PlotStyle->{{GrayLevel[0],Dashing[None],Thickness[0.005]},        {GrayLevel[0],Dashing[Tiny],Thickness[0.005]},        {GrayLevel[0],Dashing[Small],Thickness[0.005]},        {GrayLevel[0], Dashing[Medium],Thickness[0.005]}},      Axes -> False,      Frame -> True,       FrameLabel->{{"Left", Rotate["Right",180 Degree]},{"Bottom","I want this removed"}},      PlotLegends -> Placed[LineLegend[Automatic, {"sin", "cos", "tan"},      LegendMarkerSize->{{45, 15}}],Top]]
