I would like to calculate the convolution of a function with itself for $n$ times. Let $n$ be $10$. For $n=1$, I wont make any calculation and $f0$ is my function, when $n=2$, I will convolve $f0$ with itself and get $g=f0*f0$ when $n=3$ I will get $gg=g*f0$ etc.. As it can be seen the total number of convolutions that I need to make is $9$. At each iteration I will compute some other functions. In Matlab I do it as follows               h=f0;     for n=1:9     some computations related to "f0"     h=conv(h,f0);     some computations related to "h"     end      I would like to do the same in Mathematica and below is the code that I typed:               f0[x_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[-2, 2], x]     f1[x_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[2, 2], x]               q[1, B_, A_, f_] := f          q[n_ /; n > 1, B_, A_, f_] :=Block[{\[Omega]},q[n, B, A, f] =Function[x,Evaluate[Integrate[q[n - 1, B, A, f][\[Omega]] f[x - \[Omega]],{\[Omega], B, A}]]]]          p[n_, B_, A_, f_] :=Integrate[q[n, B, A, f][x], {x, -\[Infinity], B}] +Integrate[q[n, B, A, f][x], {x, A, \[Infinity]}]      In short $q$ is calculating the convolution and $p$ some integrals over a given $q$. If I want to calculate for example               Sum[p[n, B, A, f0]*(k3*n + k2*p[n, B, A, f1]), {n, 1, 10}]      where $k2$ and $k3$ are some constants. Then Mathematica will make 108 convolutions and the following calculations. Instead I can make the same thing in Matlab with 9 convolutions and the following calculations. As a result of this I decided to change my code parts as follows               q0[1] := PDF[NormalDistribution[-2, 2], x]     For[n = 2, n < 10, n++,q0[n][B_, A_] :=Convolve[q0[n - 1][B, A], f0(UnitStep[x - B] - UnitStep[x - A]), x,y]]      this code shows what I want to do but It is incorrect. I want to calculate q0[1][x], q0[2][x], q0[3][x],.. which are simply the one time, 2 times, and 3 times convolutions of $f0$ with itself (in the range from $B$ to $A$ ). $$q_n(x)=\int_{B}^A q_{n-1} (\omega)f(x-\omega)\mathrm{d} \omega,\quad q_1=f,\quad n\geq 1.$$ I would like to do some other operations for example               Sum[p[n, B, A, f0]*(k3*n + k2*p[n, B, A, f1]), {n, 1, 10}]      Thank you very much. Please let me know if something is unclear in the same for loop. How I can manage it?
