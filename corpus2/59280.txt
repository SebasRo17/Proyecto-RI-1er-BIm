I'm not sure if this is the right place where to put this question. Sorry if it isn't. Is there anyone having experience with Mathematica and Linux Gentoo? I have a friend trying to install Mathematica 9 on a Linux Gentoo server machine and he has many troubles. First a missing graphics library (now apparently solved), then libasound.so.2 library error message. Any suggestion is welcome. Thanks in advance.
