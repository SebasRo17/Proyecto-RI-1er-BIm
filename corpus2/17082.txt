I would like to compare two arrays a=: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BR6jR.png) and b= ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DehGc.png) and get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9S737.png) using:               (b/.(b_?Positive->a+b))//MatrixForm       but this doesn't seem to work? Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong? Basically the conditional only updates b to be sum of a and b only when a non zero is detected in b or else it should do nothing, but can't work out why it is not summing. Or must I first flatten it?
