So I am trying to find the connection between Forcing Amplitude and Velocity in a differential equation (Which is the part of system of differential equations). Those system differential equations are $$y''(t)+500y'(t)+100y(t)=-A(\cos(500t)+2\cos(1000t))$$ $$300x'(t)=1000y(t)+500y'(t)-35\tanh(50x'(t))$$ Practically, I am trying to graph the change in parameter $A$ which is Forcing Amplitude, and its effect on $x'(t)$. I am not looking for instantaneous velocity, so for example calculating $x(t)/t$ when $t$ is big enough I think is sufficient. I succeed to use Manipulate to graph $x(t)$ versus $t$ on various $A$ as below.               Manipulate[{xy = NDSolve[{      y''[t] + 500 y'[t] + 250 y[t] == -a*(Cos[500 t] + 2*Cos[1000 t]),y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 0,      333 x'[t] == 250 y[t] + 500*y'[t] - 35*Tanh[50 x'[t]], x[0] == 0},      {x, y}, {t, 0, 0.1}], Plot[{x[t] /. xy}, {t, 0, 0.1}],      MaxSteps -> Infinity}, {a, 0, 100}]      EDIT: I might be a bit unclear in writing my question. So my question is : Is it possible to take A as x axis and average velocity x'(t) as y axis?
