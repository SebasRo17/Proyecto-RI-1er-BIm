I am trying to solve a system of nested differential equations, and have attached my code below. The first section is some variable declarations, then I solve my first diffeq and store the solution to s. Then I make another function evaluated with that solution, and try to use it in another diffeq, but I get the error > "Computed derivatives do not have dimensionally consistent with the initial > conditions".               ClearAll["Global`*"];     falltime = 5*^-12;     Rd[t_] := 200000000000*E^(-t/falltime) + 1300;          Vc = 5; Va = -200; Rl = 220; Rs = 1000000; Ccs = 2*^-12; Cas = 2*^-12; Cac = 2*^-12;          eq1 = (Vc-V1[t])/Rl == (V1[t]-V2[t])/Rd[t] + Ccs*(V1'[t] - V2'[t]);     eq2 = Cac*(V1'[t]-V2'[t]) + (V1[t]-V2[t])/Rd[t] == (V2[t]-Va)/Rs + V2'[t];     eq3 = V2[0] == (Va*(Rd[0] + Rl) + Rs*Vc)/(Rd[0] + Rl + Rs);     eq4 = V1[0] == (Va*Rl + Vc (Rd[0] + Rs))/(Rd[0] + Rl + Rs);          s = NDSolve[{eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4}, {V1[t], V2[t]}, {t, 0, 100*^-9}];               IdRd[t_] := Evaluate[{(V1[t] - V2[t])/Rd[t]} /. s];  (* Current through Rd *)          qt = 10*^-9; \[Tau]q = .2*^-9; Lifetime1 = 50;          IdQuenched[t_] := IdRd[t]*(UnitStep[t] - (UnitStep[t - qt]*(1 - E^-((t - qt)/\[Tau]q))));          s1 = NDSolve[{n'[t] == (IdQuenched[t]/(1.602*^-19)) - (n[t]/(Lifetime1*1*^-9)),                    n[0] == 0.0000000000001},n[t], {t, 0, 1*^-6}]      I'm really not sure where to go from here and would appreciate any help.
