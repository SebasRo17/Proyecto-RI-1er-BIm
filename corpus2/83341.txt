I have been noticing certain trends about writing research papers in India. They are written either by students or by academics. Do people working in day jobs (like me) in the software industry write research papers? I ask this question because, we are more likely to get interview calls from companies like Google and Facebook if the paper is worthwhile. Even if I decide to write one, how/where do I present it? Are there any places online where I can submit it and get reviewed?
