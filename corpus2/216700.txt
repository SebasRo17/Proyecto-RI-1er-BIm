Would like to hear from those working in a PCI compliance environment and is practicing agile development and devops methodology, how you maintain compliance with PCI requirements. Specifically, what do you do to address:   * separation of duties between development/test and production   * alignment of continuous integration / deployment and change control   * alignment of agile stories to requirement documentation
