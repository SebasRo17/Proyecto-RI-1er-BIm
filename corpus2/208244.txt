In my C++ intro class last semester, all of our tests were paper/pencil and we had to write out code with a pen or pencil in order to answer questions. It seemed counterintuitive at the time, but also made sure students knew the answer down to the last semi-colon. Given that handwriting notes is an essential practice in learning other topics both in the class room and at home, how productive is handwriting code examples and documentation?
