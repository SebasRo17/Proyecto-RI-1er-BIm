I've always been a solo programmer and I would like to gain experience working with a team. Where are some places I can go to gain experience with a team assuming that I am willing to work for free in an open source project simply for gaining experience. (SIDENOTE) I think this question can be enhanced as I don't think in it's present form it is clear and concise. Basically I'm asking for resources on how to find a team to develop for to learn how to work with others. Please edit this question as you see fit. I apologize, at the moment I don't have enough points to make this into a wiki
