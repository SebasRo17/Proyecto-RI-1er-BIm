I work for a company that has bought a licence for a windows client software that allows only 20 running clients per company. I am trying to find a way around this 20 user restriction by programming a PHP web front end that connects to the existing database. This will allow unlimited users to access the database. The problem I have is that the licence states that no CRM type interface is allowed to be used with the package. Since I will not be using the windows binary in any way, what is to stop me from studying the database schema and developing my own front end? I would have thought that a schema that uses common tables, for example, customer addresses, materials, parts, orders etc could not be copyrighted by law otherwise a single company could have a monopoly over it. What makes a database general or distinct enough to warrant copyright? Any thoughts on this?
