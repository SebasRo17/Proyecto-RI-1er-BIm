While tinkering with a notebook that loads a large chunk of data in memory, I noticed that if I run it multiple times, the past chunks reside in memory. I understand that the reason (or one of) for which this happens is that the past output mechanism (`%`) keeps a reference to them, so they cannot be garbage collected. Is there a way to explicitly make _Mathematica_ forget some data?
