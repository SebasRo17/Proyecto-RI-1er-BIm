Suppose I'm writing a program in C in which several parameters are asked at the beginning of the execution to the user and then remain costant until the end. Now, I need to pass these parameters to some function. Since they are unchanged through the program, my temptation would be to declare them as global variables, to have them visible to all functions. However, I see that this is not a good practice if the dimension of the program gets big (this has been asked and answered here). However, I neither see the point of creating functions with, say, 6 arguments, when the variable ones are only 2. Is there a more elegant way to do this without compromising too much the manipulability of the code?
