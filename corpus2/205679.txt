ASN.1 is a data format used on HTTPS certificates, and various other critical pieces of infrastructure. I need to analyze some potentially hostile ASN.1 data, and want to ensure my code is safe from any programmer error. I think the best way to do this is to use a managed language that does not use unsafe code. Are there any managed implementations (C#) of an ASN.1 parser that is well tested and safe from buffer overflows. Even better if there was a way to detect such an overflow to begin with.
