For example, say I have the following data.               {{100, 1.5157*10^-3}, {200, 1.4556*10^-4}, {300, 2.8538*10^-5},       {400, 7.5323*10^-6}, {500, 2.3853*10^-6}, {600, 8.3798*10^-7}}      When I attempt to use the `Fit` command (to any order of x) the result always allows for the y value to be negative at some x. Is there anyway I can add a constraint that will prevent this from happening?
