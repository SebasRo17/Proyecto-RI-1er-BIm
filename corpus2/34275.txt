I am considering the following case. Say that `T={p1,p2,p3}` represents a triangle. In addition, I want to parameterize the edges of the triangle `T`. What I currently do is:               edgesT = {        t T[[1]] + (1 - t) T[[2]],        t T[[2]] + (1 - t) T[[3]],        t T[[3]] + (1 - t) T[[1]]};      This seems to be very naive, and I would like to learn how can I improve this. One, somehow obvious, way would be to have a cyclic list. Thus the question's title. **Is there a (smart) way to treat a list as cyclic?** Obviously, `T[[i]] = pi` for `i={1,2,3}`. It could be useful, for example in the example above, to enter `T[[4]]` and expect to have `p1` as an output. Is there some way to do it? **If not, how can I improve the definition above?**
