I've never built a RESTful API before and I am wondering how discrete should it be? For example lets say I have a customer which has a name, address, phone number, email address, language, etc. Does it make sense that there is a way to update each individual field (update address, update email address, etc), or should there just be a single update for the entire customer and each field is optional?
