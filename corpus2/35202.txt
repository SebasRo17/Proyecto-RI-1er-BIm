I want to understand the following effect better (In Mathematica 9) .. Or, maybe, is it a bug? Running the following line               FullForm[Subscript[α,β_]]      gives as output,               (*Output*)     Subscript[\[Alpha], Pattern[\[Beta], Blank[]]]      But then, when I try to _edit_ the above output, I get some unexpected stuff: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mryVM.png) There is some strange spacing at the end, and the front end disagrees with the syntax (as evidenced by the red carat). How do I understand what's going here?
