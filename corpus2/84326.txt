I have developed some PHP and HTML code for a freelance project, I want to make my contractor able to use my code commercially, since they will sell my project to their own client (an enterprise), but I want to disallow them from recycling my code for further projects, could this be achieved by some GNU license? Also I want to be able to use my code for another clients I could have (since I'm freelance), and sell them projects with some snippets of my today's created code, 'cause I could use some of this libraries.
