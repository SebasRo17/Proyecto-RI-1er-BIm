I'm new to web development and I'm a bit confused about the different languages and technologies in the web. I understand the basic is Html, Javascript, and Css. Then there's jQuery, ASP.net, Html5. I'm confused where I should use each technology and which should I use. For example, here is a video of a WPF application that I built: WPF app demo The app is essentially for students, teaching some lessons. The student can choose a lesson, and listen and see images. The student can also test himself. As you can see, the app has some animation and stlying If I were to attempt at building this application for the web- where should I start from and what should I use? HTML5 (Canvas?), jQuery (jQueryUI?), ASP.net? I would really appreciate it if you can help me. Thanks!
