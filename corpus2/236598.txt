I'm building websites in ASP.NET MVC and I quickly figured out that my models are getting harder to organise as they grow. What I normally do is create one model to add and edit data. But in my add view I have 2 extra properties. So I'm re-using the same model with 2 extra properties but I don't use these my edit view. Now I have a few questions regarding this. How do you organise it?   * Do you create one file class with multiple models in it or is it better to create a new file for each model?   * Is it better to create a new model if you need a few more properties?
