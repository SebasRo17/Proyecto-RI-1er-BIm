I am a C# developer and had developed simple websites in regular asp.net(with asp.net controls) and a wpf application. Nowadays, I am trying to learn Asp.net MVC3 and I have been exposed to HTML with the Razor view Engine. To be honest, my knowledge of HTML and CSS is limited. Therefore, I keep posting questions now and then on SO for very simple tasks. This has made me very tired of the this Q&A development process. So, now i am thinking of learning the basics of HTML, CSS and maybe some Javascript. Therefore i would request you to guide me to become an efficient enough developer for these technologies. Something that won't take much time and get me up and running fast.
