I am working on formatting a cell for a slideshow presentation format such that a graphics object occupies the left half of the cell and bullets or other items occupy the right. The ancient `AuthorTools` functions are not sufficiently documented for me to determine if this is possible with bilateral cells, but the first attempt below is my stripped down version of `ToBilateral`               CellPrint@Cell[BoxData@GridBox[         {{           Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}]]], "Output"],           GridBox[{             {Cell["section", "Section"]},             {Cell["subsection", "Subsection"]},             {Cell["item", "Item"]}             }, ColumnAlignments -> Left]           }}, ColumnSpacings -> 3, RowAlignments -> Top]]      gives the following output with the default stylesheet ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YFXDI.png) Boxing in Mathematica can leave you punch drunk very quickly, so I reverted to `Row` and `Column` to get this               Row[      {Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, ImageSize -> 300],       Column[{         Style["section", "Section"],         Style["subsection", "Subsection"],         Style["item", "Item"]         }, Left, 2]       }, "\t"]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGYmW.png) In both cases the dingbat for the item style gets eaten and there is no style indenting. I attempted to edit the stylesheet and navigate to the options inspector; however changes made there have no effect on the output of either of these code snippets unless the formatting change is related to font color, size, weight, etc. Oddly enough, the framestyle for a section does appear in the Cell snippet but not in the Row/Column snippet. To be clear, I'm looking for something like this: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dbqUa.png) which I've only been able to obtain with the following code:               LoadMicrosoftPowerPoint[]     CutandPaste[]      so I'm looking for a better solution.
