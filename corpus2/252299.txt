Which one of the ways has better performance, or is a good programming practice, making the holder activity extend `OnClickListener` and make a `Switch()` clause for `getItemId()` or making one `OnClickListener` for each one of the buttons or widgets that need it or making separated classes in the same (or another) package that implements `OnClickListener` and instance them in the activity?
