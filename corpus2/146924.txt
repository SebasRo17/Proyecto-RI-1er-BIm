Often I see a class where a value is injected into a method or even a constructor. That value is then used by several methods within that class and a reference is simply passed through to each method that requires it. To me this seems like a code smell, although I could very well just be a pedant. Unless a variable is only required once within the scope of a single method, I would usually have a class level field that is initialised by the method that receives the value. Any other methods would then reference this field if needed. This seems to be a lot cleaner to me. Thoughts?
