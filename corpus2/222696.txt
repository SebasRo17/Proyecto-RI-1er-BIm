Kind of a _best practices_ question: is it better to merge directly from the source to other branches or is it OK to merge from a merge? Using Subversion for source control. **Scenario** :   * Branch A has changes made and committed.   * Branch B and the Trunk both need updates. **Case 1**   Merge from A to B and again from A to Trunk. or **Case 2**   Merge from A to B and then merge from B to Trunk. I may also be missing a Case 3 where you merge to B and Trunk Simultaneously (not sure if that is dependent on the source control being used?). Note that there could be any number of branches that need merging to, such that you could "cascade" the merge (A to B to C to D...).
