I recently got a requirement to develop a chat-like application, or rather, a foundation of classes and methods that would allow certain applications to have chat-like features. The framework must be usable in at least two languages: Visual Basic 6 and C#. If `VB6-Application A` were to transmit string data to `CSharp-Application B`, when the data is received by `CSharp-Application B` and placed into a `string`, can I assume the string will contain the same information it contained when `VB6-Application A` sent it? (i.e. it will contain the same sequence of bytes that was sent from the original string instance in the VB6 app.)
