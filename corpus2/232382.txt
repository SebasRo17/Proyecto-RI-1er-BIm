Scrum's great for new development and proactive tasks. But I've never been sure how to use it when the department's obligations also include analyzing/answering/fixing customer support questions, which come in unpredictably, typically have high enough priority to interrupt what we planned on doing, and whose complexity ranges from trivial to major. The books I've seen so far don't seem to cover that situation. So how are other folks handling it?
