How can I compute the following derivative, $$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda_j} \prod_{i=1}^k (1+\lambda_i)e^{\lambda_i} \quad \text{for }\; 1\le j \le k $$ for some positive integer $k$ which is not known? Note that it is simple to compute the derivative by hand, but I just wonder how such equations can be input in _Mathematica_. **Edit:** After halirutan's answer, I decided to update the question. What I understand from his answer is that: there is no simple straight forward way to express such an example. Now, my question is that: is it possible to add some rewriting rules to _Mathematica_ 's built-in `D` and `Simplify` functions such that, running               Assuming[1<=j<=k&&j\[Element]Integers,        Simplify[D[Product[(1 + l[i]) Exp[l[i]], {i, k}], l[j]]]     ]      Returns the desired output: $$ \frac{2+\lambda_i}{1+\lambda_i}\prod_{i=1}^k (1+\lambda_i)e^{\lambda_i} $$
