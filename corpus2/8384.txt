In the example code below we have a list of triples that produce one or more sublists with at least one zero value. How can the positions of the lowest non zero value in each sublist be returned where that condition applies, and identify those sublists whose lowest value is zero so that the overall positions of the non-zero values can be obtained, and not lose their positions in the overall list?                In[1]= myList=Partition[RandomSample[Range[0, 8], 9], 3]      Out[1]= {{3, 1, 8}, {5, 0, 2}, {7, 6, 4}}      What I would like to get returned is something like this: {2,z,3} for the above list. Thanks for the help!
