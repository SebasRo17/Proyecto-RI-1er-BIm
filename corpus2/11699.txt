I'm trying to implement a version of the _hive plot_ advocated in [Kryzywinski, _et al._ , 2012]. There are many examples of such graphs on the author's webpage. It would be good enough for me to have three axes. I'm now able to project the coordinates onto three axes and style my graph like this via `VertexCoordinates`: ![basic hive](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TbdEK.png) First of all, is there any way to make edges be arcs and not straight lines?   1.
