This is a question about function naming. I am writing some code that updates the structure of a database according to a specification. Somewhere in this code I have something like this:               void createIndices(Table tbl){         for(Index idx : table.getIndices()){             if(notExists(idx)){                 createIndex(idx);             }         }     }          void createIndex(Index idx){         ...     }      As you can see, the function `createIndices` is not well named because it doesn't quite create the indices. It creates only those indices _that do not already exist_. I can come up with a variety of names for the function:   * `createIndicesIfNotExist`   * `createIndicesThatDoNotExist`   * etc. However, because "if not exists" is such a recurring idiom in programming, I was wondering if there is some kind of standard for its plural form. Just like `createIndexIfNotExists` could be considered the standard singular form, even if it's not grammatically correct.
