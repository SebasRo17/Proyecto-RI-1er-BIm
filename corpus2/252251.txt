We take for granted syntax highlighting in IDEs and text-editors, and it is the one thing I ask for in any editor. Is there any evidence that syntax highlighting actually is useful--i..e, do people program better (with fewer typos) when using it than without? In particular, I am trying to find some research that shows new programming students make fewer mistakes when using an editor with highlighting versus new students who use a plaintext editor without highlighting.
