Yes, similar questions have been asked but always with the aim of finding out 'which one is better.' I'm asking because I came up as a dev primarily in JavaScript and don't really have any extensive experience writing in statically typed languages. In spite of this I definitely see value in learning C for handling demanding operations at lower levels of code (which I assume has a lot to do with static vs dynamic at the compiler level), but what I'm trying to wrap my head around is whether there are specific project contexts (maybe certain types of dynamic data-intensive operations?) involving things other than performance where it makes a lot more sense to go with Java or C# vs. something like Python.
