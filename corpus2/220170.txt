We have a public RESTful web service which exposes functionality to third parties. We are writing automated tests against it. In order to set up all scenarios on it we need to change the data behind it. We also have a private RESTful web service which exposes functionality to other systems owned by us. However, this web service does not expose endpoints required to set up all the scenarios for the public web service. In this circumstance is it best to create extra endpoints, not needed in normal operational behaviour, on the private web service in order to support the testing of the public one? Or should we set up our data using other means such as sending SQL commands?
