The automated bell system of Stateless University should ring every hour during Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. It should ring every 90 minutes during Tuesdays and Thursdays, and does not ring at all during weekends So the equivalence classes for these are: Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays Tuesdays and Thursdays Saturdays and Sundays 90 minutes 60 minutes Am i right?? or am i missing something?
