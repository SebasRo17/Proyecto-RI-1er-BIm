Time to time, I have to work on a website that involves a huge background in size and resolution (1920 x 1080 in resolution, over 2mb in size). I've been using preloaders and it worked very well, except that users have to wait a little bit. I noticed that google map splits a big image into many pieces. I researched about it and found out that it actually increases perceived performance. Is this true?
