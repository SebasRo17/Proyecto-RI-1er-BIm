the problem related to this question What I want to do is to `Export` definition of several symbol into a single file. The reason I choose `Export` is that `Export` supports the `GZIP` function. So here is the example: I have               ff[1, 1] = 1;     ff[1, 2] = 2;     gg[1, 1] = 3;     gg[1, 2] = 4;      if I use `Save`, then it is simply               Save["ffgg.m", {ff, gg}]      the content of `ffgg.m` file               ff[1, 1] = 1     ff[1, 2] = 2     gg[1, 1] = 3     gg[1, 2] = 4      But if I want to `Export`, since the syntax of `Export` is `Export["file", expr]`. It seems that I can only `Export` one `expr` each time. I tried the following code:               Export["ffgg2.m", {FullDefinition @ ff, FullDefinition @ gg}];      the content of `ffgg2.m` will be               (* Created by Wolfram Mathematica 8.0 : www.wolfram.com *)     {ff[1, 1] = 1     ff[1, 2] = 2, gg[1, 1] = 3     gg[1, 2] = 4}      And if I Import `ffgg2.m` back, I only get `ff[1,1]` and `gg[1,1]`. The other two lost. **So how can I`Export` several definitions into a single file at a single time?**
