I'm starting to check in the SQL files for creating/maintaining our database. Previously SQL files were kept totally separate from our codebase's version control. I'd like to pragmatically store my database construction/manipulation files with my other code. Do they make the most sense in a subdirectory of my Models or as a separate directory somewhere? For the most part the SQL statements _are_ the data my Models access, but some other stuff is maintenance scripts ect; stuff that doesn't pragmatically fit into my MVC folder structure.
