I want to solve a nonlinear second order ODE as an initial value problem (IVP). Unfortunately, for certain values of first derivative at starting point I get a stiff-problem. I tried to overtake this issue looking at _Mathematica_ help, but those advices don't work in my case. My equation is the following: $$ \gamma(\lambda) \lambda_{zz} + \beta(\lambda) \lambda_z^2 + \tau(\lambda) = T_M $$ where $$ \varphi(\lambda) = a_0 + a_1 \lambda^2 + a_2 \lambda^2 + a_3 \lambda^3 + a_4 \lambda^4 \\\ \tau(\lambda) = \varphi'(\lambda) \\\ \gamma(\lambda) = - \frac{h_0^2}{12} \frac{\tau(\lambda)}{\lambda^5} \\\ \beta(\lambda)=\frac{1}{2} \gamma'(\lambda) $$               H0 = 1;     par = {            a0 -> 2.0377638272727268,            a1 ->  -7.105521894545453,            a2 -> 9.234000147272726,            a3 -> -5.302489919999999,            a4 -> 1.136247839999999           };          φ[λ_] := a0 + a1 λ + a2 λ^2 + a3 λ^3 + a4 λ^4 /. par;     τ[λ_] := φ'[λ];     γ[λ_] := -(H0^2/12) τ[λ]/λ^5;     β[λ_] := 1/2 γ'[λ];          TM = 0.0059225557575715015;          Eq = γ[λ[x]] D[λ[x], {x,2}] + β[λ[x]] D[λ[x],x]^2 + τ[λ[x]];          xL = 0;     xR = 1;          ym = 1.1666666666666892;     yp = 1;          SYSf = Flatten[NDSolve[{                     Eq == TM,                     λ[0] == ym,                     λ'[0] == yp                    }, λ[x], {x, xL, xR}]                   ]      $ym$ is the value of function in $x = 0$, and $yp$ the first derivative. If I set $yp = 2$ I get the following error: > NDSolve::ndsz: At x == -0.311892, step size is effectively zero; singularity > or stiff system suspected. >> NDSolve::ndsz: At x == 0.37944200653091864`, > step size is effectively zero; singularity or stiff system suspected. >> So I tried some advices written in the help:               Needs["DifferentialEquations`NDSolveProblems`"];     Needs["DifferentialEquations`NDSolveUtilities`"];          SYSf2 = Flatten[NDSolve[            {Eq == TM,             λ[0] == ym,             λ'[0] == yp},             λ[x], {x, xL, xR}, Method -> "StiffnessSwitching"]            ]      or               SYSf3 = Flatten[NDSolve[          {Eq == TM,           λ[0] == ym,           λ'[0] == yp},           λ[x], {x, xL, xR},            Method -> {"StiffnessSwitching", Method -> {"ExplicitRungeKutta", Automatic}}]          ]      but with no success. What can I do in order to set $yp \ge 2$? Petrus **\--- EDIT ---** I changed function definitions using SetDelay operator (:=).
