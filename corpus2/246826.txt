The place I work at does the following:   1. They manage a dev version of an app    2. They manage another replicate version of that app, they call this the rep version   3. The live version of the app that is running   4. They believe branches are evil We are asked to manually copy paste the code from one version to another. What are the circumstances under which git branches are considered harmful?(we all add code to master)
