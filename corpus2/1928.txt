I study human vision and more specifically eye-movements. _"If we display 2 symmetrical patterns (20 min one after the other), will our gaze distribution be symmetric is my research question."_ The 2 figures at the bottom row below is what is displayed to subjects for 3 seconds. One pattern, then, later in the experiment, its symmetrical transform. Above are their respective **Gaze Density histograms**. That is the distribution of where their eyes were while observing the stimuli. The Blue square is the Center Of Gravity of the stimuli. How can I measure their similarity ? If I have some ideas, I think Mathematica offers great means of image analysis that could be used here. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aLd1c.png) You could find here the data : `allSymFix` : 93 sublist for the 93 stimuli pairs I present, along with a manipulate to see all the histograms `allSymFix[[1,1]]` are all the gaze observed on stimuli 1 original version.   `allSymFix[[1,2]]` on its symmetrical transform ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OJlNY.png) How can I measure the similarity within each `allSymFix[[original stimuli]]`. I will then compare it with the similarity computed on random pairs assembled
