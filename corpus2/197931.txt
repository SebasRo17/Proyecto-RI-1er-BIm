When Enum is used as below, say if we have               enum Designation     {         Manager = 0,         TeamLead = 1,         Associate = 2     }      then write the below code               if (designation == Designation.TeamLead) //somecode      Now if we decide to change the enum element from "`TeamLead`" to "`Lead`" then we have to modify the above line of code as well i.e. `designation == Designation.TeamLead` to `designation == Designation.Lead`. So what is the best practice.
