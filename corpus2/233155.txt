With localization come various UI issues such as untranslated or badly translated strings, clipped strings, incorrectly formatted dates or numbers, wrong sorting order and more. However are there any non display related issues that cause major loss of functionality? One such example might be storing in a DB a floating number in a comma separated format, and then parsing it in a culture invariant dot separated format. This is likely to crash the application or produce wrong calculations. Being a Test Manager in my organization, I am wondering what other non display issues have you encountered and are likely to happen in a localized environment. Specific examples are very welcomed.
