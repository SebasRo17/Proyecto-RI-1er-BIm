I know nothing about code. We've had our old iOS developer drop out and we're looking for a new developer or a team to pick up where he has left off. I'm aware there can be issues with developers inheriting code etc. What are some questions that I can ask my old developer to better help the new developer understand what stage the code is at, what needs working on etc etc. Just general type questions? So that when I meet with potential new developers I can hand them a 'fact sheet' of where the code is at form the old developer.
