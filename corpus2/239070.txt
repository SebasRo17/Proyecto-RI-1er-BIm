In a centralized web service we break down the components into various small Git repos by software modules, e.g. authentication module, authorization module, data access module etc. (around 15 repos at the moment) The good thing is it is easy to manage the smaller code base, however, our productivity has decreased a lot since quite a lot of changes need to be update several repos at once. Also, deployment is more difficult as there are multiple versions of module involved, we always need to think about the dependency. I am considering to merge all the modules back to a single repo, because   * our services must require all the modules to exists, they are not optional for our service   * we are not a big team (3 people actually) and the overhead in maintaining too many repos does not worth it, they all need to have knowledge on all the code bases What do you think? Any pros and cons if we merge into a giant repo?
