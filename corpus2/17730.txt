> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Movable text on a curve This is a common feature among vector-based graphics suites (e.g. Illustrator), so I was wondering how it could be done in Mathematica. Here's an example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vcg4z.png) I'm pretty sure one has to "vectorize the font" first, as demonstrated here under "neat examples," but beyond that, I'm stuck. In Illustrator, one can choose to align the text to the path using the baseline, ascenders, descenders, and also choose various methods of fitting the path to the curve ("rainbow," "skew," "3D ribbon," "stair step," "gravity"), but I would be satisfied with a solution that uses the lowest point in a string of text (i.e. the descender), and uses the "rainbow" style of Illustrator, as is shown in the above example. For simplicity, let's just align the above string ("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog") with the Sin function.
