I think I'm struggled in some situation! We are a new start-up with 5 employees (2 Programmers). I'm the Technical Manager and that was so fine! Now I can see the fingers point to me to take the control of everything, as I've the big vision of what our organization do and play the role of CEO or General Manager! I want to, but I've no idea if it would be risky to our organization to make such a decision? How would managerial interrupts affect the technical productivity? Any tips or previous experience about such situation would help :) Thanks in advance!
