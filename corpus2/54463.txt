I just installed the mathematica 10 trial on OS X Mavericks. Everything seems to be working fine, except that I cannot use `Export` or any kind of functions involving an export process. The error message I get is:               Export["test.txt", "this is a test"]      > General::unavail: Export is not available in this version of the Wolfram > Language. Is this a limitation of the trial? Are there other limitations?
