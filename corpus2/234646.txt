I am currently working with an "interesting" code-base and see the following type of thing alot in the code.               public Object doSomething()     {         Object obj = new Object();              // Do some stuff to the object              obj = doSomthingElse(obj);                  return obj;     }      I always feel when looking at this kind of code that it is somewhat incorrect to have an object be passed into a method as a parameter but also set the object returned by the method to the same variable that was referencing the passed object. I would usually do something like the following, where I create a new variable to avoid any confusion.               public Object doSomething()     {         Object obj = new Object();              // Do some stuff to the object              Object anotherObj = doSomthingElse(obj);                   return anotherObj;     }      Am I wrong in thinking the second code snippet is more readable/correct?
