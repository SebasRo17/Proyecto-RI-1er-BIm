How are exception messages commonly stored? for any domain. I'm thinking about this from a maintenance standpoint.               if(!Condition1)         throw new Exception("Some exception");          if(!Condition2)         throw new Exception("Some exception");      If it was decided that the exception message in that snippet needed to be changed, it would have to be changed in two places; leaving it wide open for inconsistent messages and such. How better to store exception messages then? Perhaps as a static class with constants?               public static Exceptions     {         public const string CONDITION_NOT_MET = "Some exception";     }     ...     if(!Condition1)         throw new Exception(Exceptions.CONDITION_NOT_MET);          if(!Condition2)         throw new Exception(Exceptions.CONDITION_NOT_MET);      Are they often (in production) hardcoded?
