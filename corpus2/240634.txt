I'm looking for insight from someone who has used at least AWS (if not also Parse.com). My iOS app currently uses Parse.com for these purposes: 1) to store user data (by translating between JSON and core data) 2) to run javascript functions to update my database with data from the web 3) for easy Facebook authentication, which is the basis for user accounts I am now eligible for a massive hosting credit from AWS, so I am trying to assess the difficulty of switching (not to mention new concerns about Parse.com's quality). From what I've read, it seems AWS offers a variety of hosting options. However, in reference to (1), I have not seen any specific mention of JSON tables, and that's the only kind of database I'm familiar with. So I'm looking for better understanding of which AWS database options would most closely approximate Parse.com's JSON-based database. And I'm also interested in any comments about (2) and (3)---what AWS features would provide the nearest substitutes. Thank you
