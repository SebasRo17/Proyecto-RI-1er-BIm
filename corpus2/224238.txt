My question might sound stupid and not suitable for this site, but i dont have any better place to ask then here, so please bear with me. Im a college student that love playing with android. Around last year, i changed my main OS to Ubuntu, and i found its amazing. So, i decided that i want to help developing open-source project. However, ubuntu uses C++ & QML, not java so i cant code for them. Do you know where i can find a good or widely use android open-source project? I know i can find some projects in code.google, but theres too many project. I dont know which one is suitable/good for me. Any help/suggestion is appreciated (im still a college student after all). And if you wondering "why dont i learn c++?", well i think i dont have enough time to learn now because i also have a part-time job as a android developer. Thats why i prever android, or at least java. Thanks for your time
