I've already been programming for quite some time and have a firm grasp on programming itself, OOP, and a few other programming related things. However, **I'm interested in learning the same things that would be taught to a computer science graduate, and was wondering what I need to cover?** In case it's relevant, I've programmed with PHP, Java, Python, C & C++ and I'm looking into Lisp/Scheme.
