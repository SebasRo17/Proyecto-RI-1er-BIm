Is it possible to create such GIF illustration amination by Mathematica? and the rendering effects of each trigonometric function curve. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IG9Es.gif) **UPDATE** I have mainly two puzzles: 1) how to obtain the rendered trigonometric curves (unnecessarily animated);- So I want to know what kind of mathematica commands can create `3D rendered tube` like curves per the parametric equations? -- I mean curves look like below the picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KOQ8F.png)![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jGMx4.png) 2) how to make sure these curves are **smoothly** continuous even after being refracted; I also need some clues in representing the equations of the curves (in parametric form or other forms), before and after being refracted; In order to handle the refraction smoothly and continuously, I think parametric equation forms of the curves are necessary since some of the curves may have only implicit form. For example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ilYo3.png) This photo was found from internet; I need such clues to create similar GIF animations by Mathematica; Before creating similar GIF animation, I need to solve the two puzzles; I think there is no other obstacle for me to create it; **Update$^{(2)}$** I am not simply requesting code, answers resolve the two questions mentioned and illustrated with photos above will be accepted. I hope this can be made clearer. However, there is no reason that I refuse answers with codes which can create similar GIF photos. Now there is already acceptable answer. I will try to work on it.
