Recently a conversation came up during a meeting regarding the rollback of a third-party SDK from the latest version and it was noted that the fact it shouldn't be used was already in the commit history. Other developers argued that this was a bad practice and there should have been something either in the source file (i.e. `// Don't upgrade SDK Version x.y.z, see ticket 1234`) or in a project level `README` file. The others argued that since the commit history is part of the project documentation that it is an acceptable location for such information since we should all be reading it anyway. As such, should the commit history be used to convey critical information to other developers or should such information be duplicated to another location such as a project `README` or comments in the relevant source file?
