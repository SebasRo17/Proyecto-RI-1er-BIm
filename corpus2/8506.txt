I have mathematica with many additional kernels besides Local ( e.g., core1, core2, core3, core4 ... ) added through Kernel Configuration Options. I have been running multiple copies of a simulation (mycalculation.nb) in these different cores. The kernel for each notebook was set using this function:               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], Evaluator -> "corei"];      where corei is core1, core 2, .. etc. So all kernels run in parallel without interfering with each other. Now I am trying to automate this and use Mathematica Scripts to run each kernel with my code converted into Input Form (mycalculation.m). When I do that, the above line gives this error message since the "Evaluator" seems to be defined for front end and notebook interface only:               FrontEndObject::notavail: A front end is not available; certain operations require a front end.      Note that my code in "mathematica scripts" form works fine when I skip the "Evaluator" definition. Is there a corresponding option that I can put in the file (mycalculation.m) or in the command line, which is;                MathKernel -noprompt -run "<<mycalculation.m"      so that I can tell MathKernel to execute the rest of the code not in the local kernel but in some other kernel. I could not find it myself.
