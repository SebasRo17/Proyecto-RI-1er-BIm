I've been having some difficulty with the aforementioned use of these three functions/options and would greatly appreciate some help. I know that they're is probably an easy way of making a disk move across a square, but, as you may be able to guess, this is an abstraction of my real problem and thus I have to work with an object-oriented system (i.e., currying). Let's say I wanted to make a disk move from the bottom left of a square to the top right, with enter as my play/pause control: My code:               makeobject[name_String] := object[name]          (* Default values for position and velocity *)       object[name_]["pos"] = {0, 0};       object[name_]["vel"] = {.05, .05};          (* Return a graphic method *)       (this : object[name_])["pic"] := {EdgeForm[Pink], Blue,       Disk[this["pos"], .2]}          (* update *)       tick[obj_] := ((obj["pos"] = obj["pos"] + obj["vel"] (.1)); obj)          (* Dynamic pictures *)     DynamicModule[{play = False, myobj = makeobject["myobj"]},         EventHandler[             Dynamic[                 EventHandler[                     If[play,                         myobj = tick[myobj];                         Graphics[{Black, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {50, 50}], myobj["pic"]},                              PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}],                         Graphics[{Black, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {50, 50}], myobj["pic"]},                              PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}]                       ],                     {"ReturnKeyDown" :> (play = False)}],                UpdateInterval -> .01],            {"ReturnKeyDown" :> (play = True)}        ],        Initialization :> ( myobj["pos"] = {0, 0})     ]        The site's not letting me put up any pictures of what's happening, but when I evaluate, you get an image of black rectangle with the quarter circle at the bottom. Pressing enter makes the disk move up and right. But, while it's updating, if I press enter, nothing happens, and the disk keeps moving. This means that it's still calling `tick[myobj]` and therefore the `"ReturnKeyDown":>(play=False)` never worked. Thanks in advance for any help. Sorry if I am missing any kind of information, this is my first question. Please let me know if so. MMA 8.0.1.0 for students   OS Windows 7 64-bit
