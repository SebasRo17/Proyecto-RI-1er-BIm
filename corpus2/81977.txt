This answer[link] to another question here talks about OpenID and data espionage. I quote: > [Data espionage] Why let them gather the detailed statistics from many > consumer site and help them build personal profiles of people? Who knows > what they'll do with it? Sell it, use it to adjust their marketing tactics, > submit it to CIA? This has been also a concern of mine. If you use Yahoo, Yahoo now has a track of all the sites you went to (and signed with your OpenID). I'm wondering if this issue has been addressed more thoroughly. I think we here are the best people to have this discussion, because we're unbiased developers who don't get paid by OpenID or any provider (Yahoo, Google, etc.). What do you think about this?
