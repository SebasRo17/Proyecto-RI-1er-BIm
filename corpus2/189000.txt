I need a nudge in the right direction from someone more experienced in windows game development. I want to write simple C# 2D windows game for fun (think something like old Sim City or Civilization). I used to write simple windows games before, but I was out of the loop from game development for a long time. What would be good technology to start quickly these days? Quick google search, shows DirectX, Managed DirectX, XNA, but I do not know enough about those to make a choice. To make this question more constructive, can someone explain what options are available, and what would be their strong and weak points?
