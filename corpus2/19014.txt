I was playing around with Manipulate to demonstrate simple geometric idea of conic sections and put this little sample together. When i move the slider it moves my plane, which is what I expect. However, when I let go of the slider, the graphics are rescaled. So how I stop that? I have set the `PlotRange` and `AspectRatio`, so I don't understand why the scale is changing.               Manipulate[       plot = Plot3D[n, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},         AspectRatio->1, PlotRange->{{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, Mesh->False];       cone = Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.3], Cone[{{0, 0, -1}, {0, 0, 1}}, 1]},         PlotRange->{{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, AspectRatio->1];       Show[{plot, cone}, AspectRatio->1],       {{n, 0}, -1, 1}]
