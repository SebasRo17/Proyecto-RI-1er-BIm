I am working on a website (C#, ASP.Net MVC 3) which reads some RSS feeds from multiple sources and put feed title and summary in a database table(Sql Server). What I want to do is: Put an algorithm in place which can relate multiple feeds. For example if each feed is a news item, I would like to relate all news which says in different grammar of English "Some has won some election". Is there any standard algorithm for such kind of content matching logic? If not, what kind of custom algorithm should be used? If this logic can be written on Database side(e.g. Stored Procedure) it will be better.
