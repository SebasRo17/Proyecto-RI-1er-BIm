I have heard/read mixed things on whether to start with an object model or a data model. And more people say to starting with an object model as it will ease your data modelling. My question is, Shouldn't an object model always drive the design of data model? Why and When would a data model design be different than an object model? If we have a good object model, shouldn't the classes we come up with translate into tables? And class associations as table relationships?
