I have read earlier discussions of changing Locator appearance in Manipulate. I would like to change the rendered size of the locator object based on one of the manipulate variables. I can't get anything to work. Here is an attempt. source is an image, with dimensions {3716,3449}               isize = 240;     dim = ImageDimensions[source]     height = dim[[2]];     Manipulate[(       locator =         Graphics[{Red, FaceForm[Opacity[.1]],           EdgeForm[Directive[Thin, Red]], Rectangle[]},          ImageSize -> (isize size/height)];       sub = ImageTake[source, height - (pt[[2]] - {0, size - 1}),          pt[[1]] + {0, size - 1}];       Row[{Image[source, ImageSize -> isize],          Image[sub, ImageSize -> isize]}])      , {{pt, {820, 1810}}, Locator, Appearance -> locator}      , {{size, 100}, 10, 1000}]
