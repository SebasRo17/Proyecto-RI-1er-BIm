Is it possible to conveniently direct the output of consecutive **Print** statements to the same output **without actually accumulating the output in a temporary string/variable**. This would be useful in cases where there are a lot of small outputs say like in the example below:               For[i=1,i<=1000,i++,     Print[i," "];     ]      By default each of the Print statement produces a new output cell, which is not desirable. I would prefer a C-style dump-to-terminal output, where one just prints i with a space
