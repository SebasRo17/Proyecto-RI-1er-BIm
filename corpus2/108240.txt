I have been studying and coding in C# for some time now. But still, I can't figure the usefulness of Interfaces. They bring too little to the table. Other than providing the signatures of function, they do nothing. If I can remember the names and signature of the functions which are needed to be implemented, there is no need for them. They are there just to make sure that the said functions(in the interface) are implemented in the inheriting class. C# is a great language, but sometimes it gives you the feeling that first Microsoft creates the problem (not allowing multiple inheritance) and then provides the solution, which is rather a tedious one. That's my understanding which is based on limited coding experience. What's your take on interfaces? How often you make uses of them and what makes you do so?
