We are going to be building a new project using Mercurial as our version control system. I'm still trying to fully understand what my workflow should look like, so I've listed below a case that I need some help undertanding. A single application with multiple modules (Each module being hosted in its own repository) Multiple developers need to make changes to the same module. How should this be managed?   * Should a hg pull be done and all changes be made on the local developers machine. Once those changes have been made the changes are pushed to dev.   * Should each feature/bug fix get a new repository or branch on the server and the developer pushes his changes from his local hg to the remote hg. Once the feature is completed that repo/branch is merged back into dev.   * Or a combinatiom of both. Small changes go straight into dev, and a feature that could take some time gets its own branch/repo.   * Or any other strategies that you think are better suited.
