After you have done a good normalization, do you still need to index the table? How is this going to affect the performance? Will it even affect the performance in some way after a good normalization? Which columns are usually indexed if you already have the primary key and the foreign key? It's seems like it's already effective to normalize a database. But, I might have skipped how indexing affects the database. Is this only effective when queries are used? How does this work/perform and make a database better?
