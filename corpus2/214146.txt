There are two types of documentation. One type, the **Implementation Documentation** , contains information about specific implementation of a construct (eg. Class, Method, etc.). It is targeted to the future me, maintainer, debugger and so on. And there is **Usage Documentation** , containing information how to use a provided api. It does not contain information about specific implementation and is targeted to users of the api. How do I include both of them in one file? (Or do I include both of them in one file? And if not, what type belongs into the source file?) Are there special techniques, using java-doc and/or best practices?
