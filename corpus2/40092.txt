Where can I find examples devoted to extracting information from functions that returns nested structures with DefineDLLFunction in Mathematica? The only example I found and understood, was given by Todd Gayley in “calling a dll- function that returns a structure ”, but this concern a function with only one structure. How to pass a nested structure in DefineDLLFunction and how to extract the information concerning the nested records from it?
