Say, I have a list `list` and I don't want to assign different names to all its elements. What I want to do it to be able to interactively manipulate any of the elements of `list`. And if my selection of an element changes, then the slider of its value has to reset to its current value. This is what I have tried (in fact, all this happens inside a massive `DynamicModule` inside a `Manipulate`):               list=Table[0,{i,1,100}];     Manipulate[     Refresh[x=list[[elementChoice]], TrackedSymbols:>{elementChoice}];     Refresh[list[[elementChoice]]=x, TrackedSymbols:>{x}];     ,     {{elementChoice,1,"Element's number"},1,Length[list],1},{{x,0,"element's value"},0,1}]      but it just resets `x` to zero if I try to change it.
