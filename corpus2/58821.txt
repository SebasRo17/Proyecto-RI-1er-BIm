I would like _Mathematica_ to cancel out a specific term as much as possible. One of my computations simplify to               ((Pi*((l^2 + m^2 + 1)           * ((l^2 + m^2 + 1) * Derivative[0, 1][w][l, m]^2               + Derivative[1, 0][w][l, m] * ((l^2 + m^2 + 1) * Derivative[1, 0][w][l, m] - 4*m)              + 4*l*Derivative[0, 1][w][l, m])           + 4*(l^2 + m^2)))       / (l^2 + m^2 + 1))      I would like it to eliminate the `l^2 + m^2 + 1` term as much as possible. `Distrubute` goes part of the way:                (4 * (l^2 + m^2) * Pi / (1 + l^2 + m^2)^2        + ((Pi*(4*l*Derivative[0, 1][w][l, m]               + (1 + l^2 + m^2) * Derivative[0, 1][w][l, m]^2               + Derivative[1, 0][w][l, m]                 *(-4*m + (1 + l^2 + m^2)*Derivative[1, 0][w][l, m])))          / (1 + l^2 + m^2)))      Now I would like to cancel out the two occurences in the numerateor of the second term. I have tried various combinations of `Cancel`, `Apart`, `Expand`, `Factor` and `Simplify`, but none of those went in the right direction.
