In attempt to build a function that would work like `MatrixForm` but would wrap a matrix with brackets, I tried the following function:               matrixform[mat_] := TraditionalForm[DisplayForm[RowBox[{     StyleBox["[", SpanMaxSize -> \[Infinity]],      GridBox[mat],       StyleBox["]", SpanMaxSize -> \[Infinity]]}]]]       This does what I want on an ordinary matrix, say `a={{1,2},{3,4}}`, as well as on `2a` and `a+a`. But if I pass in a product such as `a.a` it does not work properly. I have tried wrapping the product in `Evaluate`, and tried executing `a.a` separately and then passing in `%` and this has made no difference. Note that a better function `Composition[bracketF,Grid]` suggested here lacks these issues. So the question is why can we not pass in a product of matrices into `matrixform`? This is my first time working with functions such as `StyleBox, GridBox, RowBox`, etc.
