Just wondering if there is a tournament scheduling algorithm already out there that I could use or even adapt slightly. Here are my requirements:   * A variable number of opponents belonging to a variable number of teams/clubs each must be paired with an opponent   * Two opponents cannot be from the same club   * If there are an odd number of players, 1 of them randomly is selected to get a bye Any algorithms related to this sort of requirement set would be appreciated. **EDIT:** I only need to run this a maximum of one time, creating matchups for the first 'round' of the tournament.
