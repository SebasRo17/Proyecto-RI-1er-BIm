In my company I am faced with assertion that graphic interfaces for VCSs like SVN or (especially) Git tend to mess repositories - especially regarding branching. Being a passionate Windows and GUI user, I have a hard time believing this is true. For Git especially, I accept that some moves are too complex for conduction via a GUI. But what is the real background of this accusation?
