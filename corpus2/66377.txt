I am looking for a good release notes template. Possibly in a plain text or HTML form. What do you guy use? **EDIT:** I forgot to mention that these notes will be used internally in our company for other developers using our libraries. I am interested in what you believe a release note should and should not contain. E.g. do you list all open issues or just issues closed in this release? Do you maintain all previous release notes in the same file (possibly in reversed chronological order), or have separate documents for each release? A couple of examples that I have found on Apache web site:   * TXT: Apache Commons Net   * HTML: Maven
