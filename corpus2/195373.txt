I have a long time running project. Its been running for about 6 months. The project is very big. The lead developer/team leader designed the project and the whole project is in his brain. He knows all ins and outs. I also know almost everything. But I am not confident like him. Problem is recently he is charging quite high for simple bug fix and small change request. I am worried if I end the contract what will be the future of the project. I had 2-3 public demos. I must launch soon. The project is still in development alpha.   1. What happens to the project if I end the contract?   2. Are the high charges is because he knows I can not end the contract now?
