I would like to try to recreate something similar to Paolo Čerić's torus animation: ![](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/3.gif) I have isolated the moving surface torus section form this Wolfram Demonstration by Kevin Sonnanburg:               t = s; s = .001; θ = 0; Manipulate[     Show[{ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[u] (3 + Cos[t]), Sin[u] (3 + Cos[t]),      Sin[t]}, {u, Cos[θ] s - .5 + a,      Cos[θ] s + .5 + a}, {t, Sin[θ] s - .5 + b,      Sin[θ] s + .5 + b}, PlotPoints -> 4, PlotStyle -> Red,      PerformanceGoal -> "Quality", PlotPoints -> 6, Axes -> None,      Boxed -> False, Mesh -> None, PlotRange -> 4],      ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[     a + v Cos[θ]] (3 + Cos[b + v Sin[θ]]),      Sin[a + v Cos[θ]] (3 + Cos[b + v Sin[θ]]),      Sin[b + v Sin[θ]]}, {v, 0, s}, PlotPoints -> 20]},      PlotRange -> 4, ImageSize -> {200, 200}, ViewAngle -> π/10],     {{a, π, "shift X"}, 0, 6 π},     {{b, π, "shift Y"}, 0, 6 π},     AutorunSequencing -> {2, 3, 4}, SaveDefinitions -> True]      and have tried to apply a texture to the section, and extend it over the whole torus, but haven't made as much progress as I'd hoped.
