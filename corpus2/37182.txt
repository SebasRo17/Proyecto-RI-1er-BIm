I have been having some trouble with `NMinimize`. I am trying               NMinimize[f[x], x]      where `f` is a complicated function. The whole reason I am using `NMinimize` is because `f` is too complicated to be able to compute for an arbitrary `x`, but for a fixed value of `x` it is fine. Well `NMinimize` seemed to be taking up an outrageous amount of time and memory, so I added a print statement inside `f`               f[x_]:= Module[{},     Print[x];     ...     ]      and ran the `NMinimize` code again. To my surprise, Mathematica prints `x$4770`, the name of a local variable. Why is `NMinimize` calling my function with non-numeric values? How can I stop it from doing so?
