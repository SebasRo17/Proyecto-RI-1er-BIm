I'm trying to solve an ODE with two independent variables (a cannon firing from a cliff incorporating wind resistance dependent on velocity). I've tried the following for the x-component:               NDSolve[{x''[t, θ] == -0.2*x'[t, θ]/2.30, x'[0, θ] == 10.8*Cos[θ], x[0, θ] == 0},       x[t, θ], t]      Assuming my algebra is correct, how do I properly phrase this input to give me `x[t, θ]`?
