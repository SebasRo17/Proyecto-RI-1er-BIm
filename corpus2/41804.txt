Negative numbers are not taken into consideration by mathematica's built-in functions.               FromDigits["-2"]      Gives me this message:               FromDigits::nlst: The expression -2 is not a list of digits or a string of valid digits. >>      Also:               In[2]:=IntegerString[-2]      Gives:               Out[2]:="2"      I was wondering if someone had some code to do this. I'm currently making a small program in mma which will help me enter matrices manually because it's cumbersome to type in every single ,{} for each row/column. Here's what I had in mind:               enterMat[x_, y_] := MatrixForm[ReleaseHold[         Table[Hold[FromDigits[InputString[]]], {x}, {y}]]]      Gives me a series of popups in which I enter the value 1 by 1 pressing enter after each to pass to the next value. It's faster and more comfortable to do it this way since I can use the numpad instead. My only problem is that it just doesn't work with negative numbers! If you have a solution or you know a great way to enter/scan/manipulate matrices, I would like to hear it. Thanks!
