Currently I'm working on a diagram showing the merit order of power plants in the Netherlands. On the horizontal axes you see the cumulative power and on the vertical axes you see the costs per MWh. The cheapest units on the left and the more expensive to the right. The function `RectangleChart` looks just fine to make this diagram. The width is the maximum power of each power plant and the hight is the cost/MWh. There are a lot of units and that's why I would like to use the Tooltip wrapper to display the power plants name when I hover the mouse cursor over the rectangle. When i use:               RectangleChart[Tooltip[{{1, 1}, {2, 2}}, "test"]]      I get two rectangle bars and, when I hover over them, I get the Tooltip "test". But when i use:               RectangleChart[{{1, 1}, Tooltip[{2, 2}, "twee"]}]      the second rectangle bar does not show. When I wrap also the `{1, 1}` with `Tooltip`, I get the error message: > RectangleChart::ldata : {{1, 1}, {{2, 2}} is not a valid dataset or list of > datasets.>> When I add a third rectangle bar and wrap it with `Tooltip`, all seems to be OK again.               RectangleChart[{Tooltip[{1, 1}, "een"], Tooltip[{2, 2}, "twee"], Tooltip[{3, 3}, "drie"]}]      I'm using _Mathematica_ version 9, on a MAC OSX 10.8.3. Do you see the same behavior when using only two rectangle bars in `RectangleChart`?
