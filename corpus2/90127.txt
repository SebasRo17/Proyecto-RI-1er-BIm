Have you ever seen, met, or worked with a smart/intellectual search library/framework/algorithm during your career? I need a very nice mechanism to search among text, I don't need a "Personal Google", just thought that programmers' community have met with such problem and know/can provide a good solution. Is it possible to search by "meaning" and could you advice a way/technique/thoughts according this? Thank you.
