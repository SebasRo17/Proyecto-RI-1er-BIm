I have a problem concerning the connection to a remote kernel via ssh on a vpn. I found a working configuration in this question: Connection to remote kernel can not be established - No specific error shown However, I use Windows 7 as my client and therefore cannot run the same command as the kind sir there provided in his answer: `ssh -R 31415:10.8.0.6:31415 -R 31416:10.8.0.6:31416 user@10.8.0.1 "dbus- launch --exit-with-session /usr/local/bin/math -mathlink -LinkMode Connect ..."` because Windows does not have openssh built in but instead adapted that command to use the installed openSSH version of cygwin: `C:\Users\<username>\bin\bash --login -i -c "ssh -v -i /cygdrive/c/Users/<username>/Path/to/private/key user@10.8.0.1 /usr/local/bin/math -mathlink -LinkMode Connect ..."` This command DOES work if I run it directly in the windows console, the connection with the private key gets established, but when I try this same command in the remote kernel configuration the error in the title occurs without more specific troubleshooting help. Also the other question dealing with that error I could find had passphrase/private key problems and couldn't even connect via the console. Upon inspecting the differences of the openssh version I noticed my client in cygwin uses 6.1p1 while the server uses 5.5p1. I tried installing a current openssh version on the Debian 6.0 server but the last officially supported and maintained one for that OS version is 5.5p1 and it doesn't seem such a good idea to me to upgrade to a not officially supported version. When trying to install an older version in cygwin, I cannot even select an older openssh version when running the cygwin setup again and selecting a cygwin packages mirror. So I searched for ~10 alternative mirrors that provide older openssh packages, but they all seem to lack a "setup.ini" file so no connection could be established. I ask for help here because this seems to be a Mathematica specific problem, not a ssh related one..other clients with Mac OS X 10.8 can connect to the server using the same private key fine.. Does anyone have a similar setup and could give me a hint what might cause the error? Is there something I did not see in the remote kernel configuration? I use Mathematica 8.0.4, Windows 7 64bit client with openssh-6.1p1, Debian 6.0 server with openssh-5.5p1, cygwin 1.7.17. Thank you! Update: In the meantime I found someone with nearly the same problem, however 3 years ago and with no answer (i hope you don't mind links to other platforms: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.soft- sys.math.mathematica/K-Z3xbQNzbY
