Dear mathematica users, In my present research I am faced with a real dense $n\times n$ matrix $A$ where $n \geq 3000$ (hopefully even more). The coefficients of this matrix are fixed, but I will have to repeatedly multiply it by a variable vector: $Ax$. I am not complaining about Mathematica's speed to do the job, which seems quite nice, but since I will need to do this repeatedly for very many times, I was wondering if there was a way to optimise the process. Perhaps, declaring it in a With will help, but besides that I am out of ideas. Another alternative would be a low-rank approximation using SVD. My thoughts were: with the SVD I can write \begin{equation} A = \sigma_1 u_1 v_1^\text{T} + \sigma_2 u_2 v_2^\text{T} + \ldots \end{equation} so \begin{equation} Ax = (\sigma_1 v_1^\text{T}x) u_1 + (\sigma_2 v_2^\text{T})u_2 + \ldots \end{equation} As an example, using a rank 100 approximation to a $3000\times 3000$ matrix (which yields a Frobenius error of $\sim5-10\;\%$) I was able to reduce the computation time by a factor of roughly 3 or 4. I thank in advance for any positive feedback. Best regards, Gabriel Landi **Edit:** Forgot to say that $A$ is symmetric and has zero diagonal.
