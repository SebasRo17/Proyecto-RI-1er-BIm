I'm pretty new to the web development scene, and I just want to be absolutely clear on this because I've read a few conflicting statements. I was under the impression that "html5" is a particular way of constructing xml to represent data for a webpage and "javascript" is a programming language that runs as client-side code in the browser. But left and right I see APIs for javascript (workers, geolocation, local storage, etc.) being referred to as an "html5 technology". Wikipedia says that html5 doesn't have a standard yet, so I can't look it up to see if it somehow mandates stuff about javascript. So will APIs for javascript somehow be apart of the html5 standard? Or has it become a common bad practice to label javascript APIs "html5 technology"?
