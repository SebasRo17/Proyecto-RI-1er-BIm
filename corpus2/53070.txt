I have a MVC2 project, my question is: should I migrate to MVC3? Why? I'd like the opinion of some who already migrated, or at least used MVC3 and MVC2. Already read http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2011/01/13/announcing- release-of-asp-net-mvc-3-iis-express-sql-ce-4-web-farm-framework-orchard- webmatrix.aspx and I already know about the described tool for migrating: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/marcinon/archive/2011/01/13/mvc-3-project-upgrade- tool.aspx What I'd really appreciate is your valuable insight. Best regards.
