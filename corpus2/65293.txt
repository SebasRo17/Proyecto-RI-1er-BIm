Please don't direct me to this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1551/how-to-think-in-oo. I have read it and still have no answer. I have programmed c++ for years and was taught that everything should be oop in design. i have recently started java and find it to very restricting in the way it makes everything a member or method of a class. Though I agree reusable classed improve code but does everything need to be a class. as an example in a simple space invader game there would be classes for the aliens, the ships and the bullets but there are things like the score and timer that are single instants. I feel these work better as globals rather than a class that will only be used once. I am starting to question whether I am an oop programmer and if I want to be one for that matter. I am not really looking for an clear answer as this in not really a question, I am just wondering if I am doing it all wrong or just differently. Thanks EDIT: Showing my ignorance here but what the hell ... what difference does it make putting all the global stuff into a global class apart from access and duplicity(multiplayer)? Is there an efficiency or memory angle I am not seeing?
