Currently I'm developing a project that basically is built with ASP.NET Web API. The membership system I'm using is ASP.NET Identity. The only problem I'm seeing with this is that the membership system is being highly coupled with the API I'm bulding. In that case I've thought on bulding interfaces to expose the membership system functionalities the app needs and then use dependency injection to inject the current Identity system. The only thing is that on all the time I've been looking on the internet about authentication and authorization in ASP.NET I've never seem this done. So I've started to wonder whether this is or not a good practice. Is this a good practice or no? If not, why?
