I am trying to solve two equations that take the form: > $W_0 \sqrt{1+\left(\dfrac{z}{\lambda\,\pi\, W_{0}^2}\right)}=W_1\;\,\quad > \ldots(1)$ > > $W_0\sqrt{1+\left( \dfrac{z+0.1}{\lambda\, \pi\, > W_{0}^2}\right)}=W_2\quad\;\, \ldots(2)$ The quantities $\lambda, W_1, \text{ and } W_2$ are known parameters. I am trying to solve for the unknowns $W_0\text{ and } z$. How would I go about doing this. The result is to be in the $\mathbb{R}$. My attempts are below: Attempt 1:               Solve[{W Sqrt[1+(z/(\[Lambda] \[Pi] W^2))^2]==A,W Sqrt[1+((z+0.1)/(\[Lambda] \[Pi]     W^2))^2]==B},{W,z}]      Attempt 2:               FindInstance[W Sqrt[1+(z/(\[Lambda] \[Pi] W^2))^2]==A&&W Sqrt[1+((z+0.1)/(\[Lambda]      \[Pi] W^2))^2]==B,{W,z},Complexes]      Attempt 3:               FindRoot[W Sqrt[1+(z/(\[Lambda] \[Pi] W^2))^2]==A,W Sqrt[1+((z+0.1)/(\[Lambda] \[Pi]      W^2))^2]==B,{{W,1.03 10^-3},{z,4.0 10^-1}}]      My question is what is the best method to solve equations such as these and what will yield the best numerical or analytical result.
