I sit with a project that I need to quote, and until the job is awarded, I can only use "View source" to check, and ask a few questions about the system. That makes quoting outright impossible for me to do. My question is: how do one go about quoting for such a project? What kind of questions should I ask? Do I decline to quote? Due to uncertainty, do I pad my quote?
