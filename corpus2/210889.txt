What techniques are there for debugging remote client side errors in a web application, especially when they only affect a small subset of users? In my case we have an app that is working well for hundreds of users, internally and externally, but a handful (12) have a specific problem with a JavaScript that prevents them from using the site. We have screenshots of the error, have confirmed they have no server side errors, confirmed that everything is getting rendered to the browser correctly, have seen the specific error in the IE console, but still have no idea why it isn't working for these specific users. The issue is exhibiting on different versions of IE. We have never been able to replicate the problem here. I'm not looking for a solution to my problem here, but rather what are the steps you would take to solve this kind of problem, and what tools there may be that might help?
