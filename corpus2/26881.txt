I have a quick question. Is there anyway of expressing a large number as a power of another number in _Mathematica_? By this, I mean for example, $1237940039285380274899124224 = 512^{10}$. Is there a function that enables me to go from the LHS to the RHS of the above calculation? Given $1237940039285380274899124224$, how can I obtain $512^{10}$? `Divisors` is close but not quite what I need. Thanks for any useful hints.
