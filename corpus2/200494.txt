Just like NVR (Network Video Recorder) and DVR (Digital Video Recorder), I was wondering if there's a term / acronym for Desktop Monitoring Recorder? Perhaps DMR? I can't find any standard terms for this type of system. I'm writing a system which is just like an NVR but records / monitors computer desktops instead. It's not a "screen thief" or "desktop spy" or any type of malware - it's a surveillance system, only for computers rather than cameras. In the end, it will do things such as primarily monitoring/recording screens, watching for mouse movement when the computer user shouldn't be there, and more. There are also other commands such as taking control of the screen, executing remote shutdown / restart, posting messages to the user's screen, and more. Is there a particular standard term or acronym for the recording software side of this?
