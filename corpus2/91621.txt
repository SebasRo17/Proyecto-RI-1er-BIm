Currently we have a Development server on which we write the HTML/CSS/JS code. We do not optimize our code using compressors/minifiers. So our deployment process from Development to Production is simply to copy the files on the Development server to the Production server. But now we are planning to use compressors/minifiers. We are confused about the process we should follow. Currently we use a single JS file called common.js and a single CSS file called common.css. Also now we are planning to use multiple CSS files in Dev like reset.css, common.css, etc. and when deploying them to production we will be combining them to a single CSS file. The simplest process I can think of is:   1. Make an exact copy of the development files on the Development server. Use the copy in the further steps.   2. Combine all CSS files to a single CSS file say common.css. Same with JS files. Delete the other files for example reset.css.   3. Compress/minify common.css and common.js to common.min.css and common.min.js. Delete common.css and common.js.   4. In all the HTML files remove all link tags and script tags except for common.css and common.js   5. In all the HTML files modify the script src and link href from common.js to common.min.js and common.css to common.min.css.   6. Copy all the files to Production server.   7. Delete the copy This looks too tedious for us. What can be a better process? Is there any tool which can do the optimization (above steps) automatically. It looks like it would not be very difficult to write a script which performs all of the above steps. But I would like to use an existing tool rather than developing one myself. I would like to put the efforts only if such a tool does not exist. Also when is the testing generally performed? I think it should be performed on the optimized files (just in case the compressors have some bug). But then the process would become more tedious as the above process would have to be repeated after every Test-Bugfix cycle.
