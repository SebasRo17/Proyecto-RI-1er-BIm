Im building small web-service which will provide my users with data through API. Also, some data will be available right on my website. The question is about how to use my own API? Should my website make a query to, for example, `http://website.com/api/users/?format=json` and then render data? Because I can use standard Django ORM features, but this is not corresponding with using of own API. For more explanation please look this gist: https://gist.github.com/xelblch/bde4c8f107f1ed398a7e update: Imagine that I have a database full of games with release date, game name, game platform etc. And on my own website I will show this games as a list or a grid. Also, this data can be reached through API in JSON format, this data can be updated through API and even deleted. And on my own website I have html forms that allow me to do this actions in a user-friendly way. So how should I access my own API? Via POST request to my API or via django ORM directly to database?
