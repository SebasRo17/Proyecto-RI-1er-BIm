given the following data organized by year               y2011 = {121.68, 70.82, 82.62, 111.03, 76.9, 76.51, 86.07, 70.03,        72.14, 114.14, 135.51, 104.51}     y2012 = {97.19, 72.03, 116.25, 78.66, 89.94, 152.21, 70.03, 85.07,        129.75, 87.94, 125.58, 157.15}     y2013 = {154.21, 106.78, 116.62, 70.03, 121.69, 110.52, 159.96, 71.66,        70.03, 89.14, 0, 0}      I want to draw the following diagram, grouping the data of the same months together:               BarChart[Transpose[{y2011, y2012, y2013}],       ChartLabels -> {"Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul",         "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"}]      ![BarChart of yearly data grouped by month](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fXNN2.png) How can I show just one `ChartLabel` per month/category?
