1. If I look at a database table for editing - is it made up of rows or records?   2. If I write some sql and then look at the result is this made up of the same elements as the answer to 1.?   3. Is it the case that they are all rows but in very specific circumstances they are also records? * * * **EDIT**   A recent article by Itzik Ben-Gan prompted my question and I see quite a **_discussion on dba.stackexchange_**. In that article Aaron Bertrand brought up the same Itzik quote from his "Training Kit (Exam 70-461): Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2012" > As an example of incorrect terms in T-SQL, people often use the terms > “field” and “record” to refer to what T-SQL calls “column” and “row,” > respectively. Fields and records are physical. Fields are what you have in > user interfaces in client applications, and records are what you have in > files and cursors. Tables are logical, and they have logical rows and > columns.
