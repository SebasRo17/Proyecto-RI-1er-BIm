I am a Junior at workplace and i have been to a number of our retrospectives over the last year. I have been asked to facilitate a retrospective of my own. So far, we have done "hats (red, green, white etc)", "mad, sad, glad", "imagining going forward to end of next sprint, and discussing how it might have gone". I would like to try something new. If you practice agile in your workplace, what do you use and would you recommend trying it for a retrospective? Thanks, Kohan
