How does the built-in debugger decide which definition to highlight in the notebook when Break on messages" is enabled? Here's an example to illustrate what I mean. First, enable the debugger (Evaluation -> Debugger), then define a function that issues a message:               f::boo:="Boo!!!";     f[]:=Module[{a,b,c,d},       a=1;       b=a;       Message[f::boo];       c=b;       d=c;       a+b+c+d     ]      When running `f[]`, evaluation will pause on the message and the point where the break occurred will be highlighted: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wq2L0.png) Now let's re-assign its own DownValues to `f`, and re-run it. Now this second definition will be highlighted, but not the original one. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/55y9R.png) **The question:** How does the debugger know what to highlight and can we influence this somehow? I would like the definition printed by this spelunking tool to be highlighted, if possible.
