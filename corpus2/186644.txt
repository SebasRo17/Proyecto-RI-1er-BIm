I'm developing a suite of software tools that I need help with which is why I want to release my software open-source. People should be able to use and modify my code as they please while contributing to my project. Ultimately, the tools that I develop will require a paid commercial license, but may be free to those for non-commercial purposes. This software suite will consist mostly of website plug-ins. Other tools I develop open source be used for consulting. What would you suggest as a license?
