Just read through the whole EULA from the game ("Minecraft") owned by ("Mojang AB"). And in there it was one sentence that got my attention:               We have the final say on what constitutes a tool / mod / plugin and what is not.      My questions are:   1. Is is legaly allowed to write this in a EULA?   2. Will this really hold up in court?      **EDIT:** As people apperently want more detail: I was initially thinking just generally but as more detail is required lets's take Sweden(Where's mojang is from) and USA(Just becase)..
