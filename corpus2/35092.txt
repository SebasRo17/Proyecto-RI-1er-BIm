My purpose is to demonstrate the _Central Limit theorem_ by assuming two custom distributions, taking some random samples, calculating their means and ploting the results. Ideally, the histograms should tend to a normal distribution. The code I am using is the following:               \[ScriptCapitalD]1 = ProbabilityDistribution[        1/5 Exp[-(1/5) Abs[2 x - 3]],        {x, -∞, +∞}];          \[ScriptCapitalD]2 = ProbabilityDistribution[         If[x >= -1/2 && x <= +1/2, 1, 0],         {x, -∞, +∞}];          f[n_] := ParallelTable[         Histogram[            Mean /@ Table[RandomVariate[n, 10], {k}], PlotLabel -> "n=" <> ToString@k],         {k, 10, 170, 40}]          cltHistPlots = GraphicsGrid[         {f[\[ScriptCapitalD]1], f[\[ScriptCapitalD]2]},         Spacings -> 0]      And the graph that is generated is this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nZPL9.png) My questions are:   1. How could I speed the process up ? The code is very slow! I think the bottleneck is in the part where `RandomVariate[]` calculates the samples.   2. A bit offtopic, but, could you think of any other addition I could make so that the audience would better understand the theorem ?
