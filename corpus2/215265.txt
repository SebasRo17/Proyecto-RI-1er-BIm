The standard line length of code is 80 characters per line. This is accepted and followed by the most of programmers. I working on a state machine of a character and is necessary for me follow this too. I have four classes who pass this limit. I can subclass each class in two more and then avoid the line length limit.               class Stand          class Walk          class Punch          class Crouch      The new classes would be _StandLeft_ , _StandRight_ and so on. _Stand_ , _Walk_ , _Punch_ and _Crouch_ would be then abstract classes. The question if there is a limit for the long of the hierarchies tree or this is depends of the case.
