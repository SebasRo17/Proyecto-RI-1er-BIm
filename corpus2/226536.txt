I want to write a refactoring tool for the Java programming language. For this reason I need to do structural queries against the abstract syntax tree. Given this AST how do I get answers to the following statements:   * Get superclasses of an object.   * Give me the expression where I call a method x() on type XClass   * Is method x() is called without arguments (check overloading)   * Is method x() called anywhere in the execution path of object of type XClass (eg. is close() called anywhere)
