I'm a retired software tool developer who worked in a Unix environment most of my career. I have a lot of games that I wrote in C that I'd like to get going again. Most use the curses library. These programs are quite old. Does Ubuntu support the compilers, link editors and libraries I would need to get this stuff running? I would prefer, of course, an env just like I had when I wrote these, ksh, vi, etc.
