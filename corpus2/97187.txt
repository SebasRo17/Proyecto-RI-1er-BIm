I have heard about programmers coding for two days without sleep and drinking coffee and Red Bull. Also in movies like The Social Network, in a scene they show that Mark Zuckerberg has been programming for 36 hours. Also it's said that in companies like Facebook, Google, foursquare, etc. they can code for more than 24 hours without sleep. Is this really true? Can you actually produce high-quality code if you are sleep deprived? _Can things like Red Bull make up for sleep?_
