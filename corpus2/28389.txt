Suppose I make a `BoundedDiagram` via the following code               Needs["ComputationalGeometry`"];     data2D = RandomReal[{0, 10}, {10, 2}];     b1 = {{0, 0}, {11, 0}, {11, 11}, {0, 11}};     convexhull = ConvexHull[data2D];     delval = DelaunayTriangulation[data2D];     {vorvert, vorval} = VoronoiDiagram[data2D];     {dvert1, dval1} = BoundedDiagram[b1, data2D, delval, convexhull];     DiagramPlot[data2D, dvert1, dval1]      How would I go about making each region clickable, i.e. open some link that I associated with the data? \-- Edit: I should note, all I really want is a to be able to click on regions of a Voronoi-Like diagram, it doesn't have to be done via BoundedDiagram, this is just my first attempt at doing that ... (and is basically straight from the documentation.)
