I would like to design a programming language by solving a specific set of problems. I am looking for a core set of programming problems that are language agnostic. It seems that there are a number of problems that are repeatedly solved by programmers. The implementation details vary from language to language, but, by and large, the problem they are solving remains the same. For example:   * Numerical libraries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numerical_libraries)   * Cryptography   * Certain networking libraries   * Plotting / graphs   * Unit testing Have there been any enumerations of these in literature?
