I have 3 web services that are providing me data for my hotel booking engine. It is taking too long if I run them sequentially. Therefore I wanted to run them using threads, but I am not sure if php threading will support this and if it is safe, since all 3 processes that will handle the web service will read and write into shared tables. Can anyone advise me on how should I proceed?
