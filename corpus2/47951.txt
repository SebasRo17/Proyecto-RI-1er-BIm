I have the following code for drawing two isotherms for a Carnot engine:               R = 8.3*(10^3); n = 1;      P[V_, T_] := n*R*T/V      Plot[{P[V, T = 355], P[V, T = 295], P[V = 0.0006, T = 295]}, {V, 0.0008, 0.0036},        AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},        AxesLabel -> {"Volume (cubic meters)", "Pressure (N/m^2)"}]      It's fine (though a word on how to exaggerate the vertical proportions _without_ the aspect ratio command would be great). But, what I want to do is plot the sides of this Carnot cycle problem -- I can get the isotherms, but when I add a third expression (like one where a different variable is held constant, i.e. volume) it seems to choke on it. Anyhow, any help for someone who knows almost nothing about _Mathematica_ :-) `Overlay` didn't seem to do it.
