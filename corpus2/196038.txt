I have started a project which will duplicate Dropbox or Google Drive behavior but using Amazon S3 az a backend. Idea is very simple, a Node.js server that watchs a directory for file changes and PUT them on the S3. Or it will look at S3 for changes and applies them to file system structure. I'be uploaded very early version of my app to Github. You can find it here. Because I am a web developer, I am using web technologies to solve the problem. I'm afraid of my limited mindset and picking wrong tools for the job. There are other solutions to this problem. One is S3FS which is a FUSE file system for Unix systems. In my opinion that is very hard to use and limited to platform. My solution uses Node.js to overcome cross-platform issues. I can pack my Node.js app with App.js and make it an easy to use software. To clarify, my questions are:   * Is HTTP/HTTPS good enough for file transfer?   * Is Node.js good enough for working with File System?   * Scalability: can this approach fail in large file sizes?
