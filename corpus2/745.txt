What methods do you use to stay awake and alert while working? Personally I drink coffee non stop throughout the day. But I've also heard of this thing called exercise that should help too. Does anyone else have tips and tricks to stay more awake and alert while working? Redbull? Maybe a magic pill that won't require me to sleep?
