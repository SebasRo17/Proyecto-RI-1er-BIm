Today at work I did an update to production. The update involved replacing old items from two tables with new data. I of course did a back up of the tables before that. Well, now 6 hours after getting home I realized at shower that there was a foreign key reference on cascade delete for many tables and when I replaced the older data it also removed lots of other data -- I'm not even sure I know all of the data that got removed... The thing is, there are about 270 tables and I've been to the company for 3 months. I was supposed to do this update today and the CTO was away doing remote work. I tried to contact via Skype and email, but he's away. I figured not to call him at this time of day (late evening here). What should I be doing here? It's the beginning of weekend and I feel bad leaving the system in such a condition for two days... and especially because I screwed up things. The client is doing billion dollar business and its the biggest client the company has so this was a major drawback. If the hosting provider does not have nightly backups I will probably get fired. Damn I hate automatic magic like FKs. :( What would you do in my position?
