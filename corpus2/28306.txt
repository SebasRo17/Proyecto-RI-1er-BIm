If I want to unit-test some of my javascript functions, would it be more efficient (and doable) to use the already installed PHP unit-testing framework, or should I use a javascript unit-testing framework? **EDIT:** It seems I have to clarify things a bit. I'm using javascript for form validation. It seems that some logic doesn't work as I want it to be, and I thought to myself that would be a good point to begin to use unit-testing (something that came to my scope only recently). I already began to use SimpleTest on a little project of mine, but never to test logic that is generated client-side. Now I know that SimpleTest have the possibility to emulate a browser for example. But I was wondering what other method would they be to unit-test my form validation. While I was searching for idea, I realized that there is also unit-testing framework for javascript, but after a bit of searching on some of the SE sites, I didn't find anything about use of PHP and Javascript Framework together, so I wondered how common such a situation it was, and how do other people manage in such an environment.
