I'm doing some coding in MM9, but my program is getting quite large. It's mostly a bunch of functions defined at the beginning of it, but it's getting to the point where I have to scroll for a few seconds to get to the bottom of the notebook and it's getting annoying to find things without using Ctrl + F. It may seem like nitpicking but it slows down my workflow so I figured I'd ask here. Is there some way to make my code nicer? I once investigated "minimizing" functions but it appears MM doesn't really support that. Could I put some functions and constants in a spare notebook and have my main one read that before executing, like I would in C++? MM is usually so elegant, I imagine there must be a solution for this!
