I have a ".gif" figure exported from the following codes. 6 separated figures (frames) constitute a ".gif" figure. But the default time interval between each frame is less than 1 second. I hope to increase the time interval to 3 seconds, so the speed can be lower. Any one can help me? Thank you all in advance!               g1[a_, b_] := Graphics[{Red, Disk[{a, 0}, 1], Green, Disk[{1, 1}, 1], Blue, Disk[{b, 2}, 1]}];     f1 = Table[Show[g1[a, b] , PlotRange -> {{-2, 12}, {-2, 4}}  ], {a, 1, 8, 4}, {b, 0, 10, 5}];     f1 = Flatten[f1]     Export["f1.gif", f1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bf8JZ.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qdinm.gif)
