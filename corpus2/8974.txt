I'm writing some code at the moment that schematically looks like: * * * ( _set initial conditions for some differential equation for given parameters (M,R,...)_ )               M=1;     R=1:       ( _NDSolve differential equation taking ~10mins or more to give solution dependent on some more paramaters (w,l,m); defining a memoized function_ )               Phi[w_?NumericQ,l_?IntegerQ,m_?IntegerQ]:=Phi[w,l,m]= "Interpolated Func result of  NDSolve taking 10mins to compute"      ( _For a given parameter set (w,l,m) compute a few things, such as coefficients and the (w,l,m) term in a sum, for which numerical differentiation ND[..] is needed, hence the necessity of memoizing this Phi to speed this step up_ )               A[w,l,m]:= "some calc dependent on the Phi";     B[w,l,m]:= "some calc dependent on the Phi"     termSum[w,l,m]:= "some calc dependent on the Phi and A,B"      ( _write termSum to file_ )               PutAppend[...]      ( _clear cache of the memoized Phi[w,l,m] interp func and the other variables like A[w,l,m]_ )               Phi[1,2,3]:=.   (*unset*)      . . . ( _after the rinse now repeat for a different (w,l,m)_ )               Implemented by some 'do' or 'for' loop.      * * * Some issues I'm considering: 1) Is there a way to use `Block`/`Module` say to allow me to better handle my caching of the variables (especially the huge memory hogs like the Phi that is a very large Interpolating Function)? 2) Also if I change my initial parameters M, R etc. I have to start all over again with setting initial conditions and so forth and functions that depend. Could I use `Block`/`Module` to incorporate this? 3) Is there a way to run some kind of initialization script in Mathematica that will set my constants, run my standard definitions etc. each time I load the notebook? 4) In a later calculation I will probably use the Phi,A,B for a given (w,l,m) all over again but for different values of 'r' along the range of the interpolating function. I've thought of saving to hard memory the actual interpolating functions of a given (w,l,m) but normal `Save` leads to 200MB files, and even `DumpSave` >20MB. Anything I could do about this or do I just have to recompute?
