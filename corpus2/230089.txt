Red zone is a fixed size area in memory beyond the stack pointer that has not been "allocated". Compilers do generate assembly to access that area in simple leaf functions. But I can't see any real advantages for red zone. Accessing memory beyond stack pointer is really dangerous and can easily lead to data corruption. Why even do this? Saving 2 processor instructions (push ebp; mov ebp esp) won't give real speed up. P.S. There was already question on SO that was closed as off-topic (awful injustice).
