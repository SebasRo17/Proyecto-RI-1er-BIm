I have the following problem: I used `GraphPlot` to plot my adjacency matrix. I divided my nodes in three groups: `A = {...}, B={...} and C={...}`. I would like to color the nodes conditioning on them belonging to group A (Blue), B (Red), C (Grey). How do I do that? Example: I have $12$ nodes distributed in three groups as follows: $ A=\\{1,4,5,8\\}, B=\\{2,3,6,7,9,10\\},C=\\{11,12\\}$. I want to color the nodes in $A$ blue, the ones in $B$ red and the ones in $C$ grey. I have of course a $12$x$12$ adjacency matrix $M$ and I use `GraphPlot[M]` to plot the graph. Thank you.
