I have a large file of functions. Each of these functions is responsible for drawing a particular part of the application. My app has x and y parameters that I use in the setup function to move the whole app around in order to try different placements. So, naturally, I need to use these x and y values to anchor each function's component rendering so that everything moves in unison if the global x,y values ever change. My question is, is it bad practice/architecture to have these x,y values in the global namespace and having the each function directly access them like so?               function renderFace() {        var x = App.x;        var y = App.y;             // drawing here     }      is there a better way i'm missing?
