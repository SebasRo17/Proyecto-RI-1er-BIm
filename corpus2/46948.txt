I am trying to visualizing the unit circle under different norm functions, here is the code:               ContourPlot[{     Abs[x]^(1/2)+Abs[y]^(1/2)==1,     Abs[x] + Abs[y] == 1,     x^2+y^2==1,     Abs[x]^3+Abs[y]^3==1,     Max[Abs[x], Abs[y]] == 1     },     {x, -1.1, 1.1}, {y, -1.1, 1.1}     ]      I want to add a legend show the expression for each circle, how can this be done?
