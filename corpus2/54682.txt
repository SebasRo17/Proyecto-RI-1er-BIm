As of _Mathematica_ version 10, `AstronomicalData` is obsolete, deprecated in favor of `PlanetData`, `CometData`, `MinorPlanetData`, `PlanetaryMoonData`, `ExoplanetData`, `StarData`, `GalaxyData`, `NebulaData`, `PulsarData`, and friends. (It still works, but who knows how long for?) There are also many other changes, such as units/quantities, and DateObjects, which I'm struggling with for the first time. How would I update code like this:               Table[AstronomicalData["Jupiter", {"Declination", x}],         {x, DayRange[{2014, 1, 1}, {2014, 1, 31}]}]      to produce a series of simple numbers, because in version 9, this code produced this:               {22.5875, 22.6058, 22.6241, 22.6423, 22.6603, 22.6782, 22.6960,       22.7136, 22.7310, 22.7483, 22.7653, 22.7822, 22.7988, 22.8152,       22.8314, 22.8474, 22.8631, 22.8785, 22.8937, 22.9086, 22.9233,       22.9377, 22.9518, 22.9656, 22.9791, 22.9924, 23.0053, 23.0179,       23.0302, 23.0422, 23.0539}      So far, using version 10 I've managed to get as far as this:               Table[PlanetData["Jupiter",         EntityProperty["Planet",             "Declination", {"Date" -> DateObject[x]}]],         {x, DayRange[{2014, 1, 1}, {2014, 1, 31}]}]      but it still produces a list of things which don't look or act like numbers: ![odd output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8pbS0.png)
