Many, many years ago, when I was young and naive and wrote everything from scratch unless it came with the language, I was working for a company with two sales people in two locations who were trying to share leads and contacts. I had just discovered a shiny new hammer, PHP, so of course I built them what I would today would describe as a primitive MySQL backed CRM system. They loved it--at this point most in history all their competitors were using local Access databases. I have since learned how much easier life is when you don't try to reinvent the wheel. I am again faced with a growing company that needs an online CRM system. I am roughly aware of what CRM systems do of course, but I am not very familiar with what exactly products like MS Dynamics or SAP offer. I am having a hard time sorting through marketing fluff trying to figure out just what exactly these companies spend tens of millions of dollars and euros developing. Most of them appear to be fairly straightforward enterprise applications with a few bells and whistles that I'm not really interested in, such as Outlook and Sharepoint integration or the ability to create workflows through a click-and-drag interface. So my question is, are you crazy to attempt to develop a custom CRM system from scratch?
