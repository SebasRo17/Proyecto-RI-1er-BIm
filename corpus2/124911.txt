I'm a recent college graduate (last May!). While I was still in school, I wanted to make sure that I had a job before I graduated, and very early (probably too early) in my job search I settled on one in a region I'd been hoping to move to after undergrad. However, I've been second guessing this decision for months now, for several reasons. One is that I'm not very challenged at work, and I feel like I haven't improved much at programming since starting here. I can always make time to work on open source (and have in the past) outside of my job, though, so I do have a venue to get around this disappointment. More importantly, I'm worried by the fact that my job is basically to work on a creaky old Perl web application (using Mason and a weird in-house ORM). Am I shooting myself in the foot here by working with a technology that's no longer popular, and won't really help me out getting a job in the future? I rarely see Perl jobs, and when I do, it's usually doing something I'm not interested in (front-end web development stuff). Systems programming, visualisation, network programming, or at least backend web development stuff are the sort of topics that I'd actually enjoy working in -- it doesn't seem like my current work experience is helping me towards positions doing any of these things.
