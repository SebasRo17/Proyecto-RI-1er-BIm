I'm designing/building a web application that will be available in two languages: French/English. I placed i18n mechanisms to extract every text from the application. But what about the user's input? I have some "system settings" that currently ask for both lang for their labels...   But I can't obviously ask a translation for every input (pure data, receipts, etc)... Where can you trace the line between what should be available in translations? N.B : An instance of the application (a same database) will be used by more than one person (~10 users).
