I read the following on the MSDN: > Use Pascal casing for all public member, type, and namespace names > consisting of multiple words. > > Note that this rule does not apply to instance fields. For reasons that are > detailed in the Member Design Guidelines, you should not use public instance > fields. > > Use camel casing for parameter names. * * * Well it says it does not apply to instance fields so what applies to instance fields? I know I should not use them, but if I do, what is the correct convention? I guess it would be Pascal, but I'm not sure about it...
