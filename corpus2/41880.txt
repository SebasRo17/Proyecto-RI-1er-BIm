I have been given task that has a case study developed by Extreme Programming (XP) and the Rational Unified Process (RUP). I was asked to apply regression models and take some dependent variables and some independent variables in order to compare both XP and RUP. Even though I have been searching, I have not been able to identify dependent and independent variables could be used in software quality testing?
