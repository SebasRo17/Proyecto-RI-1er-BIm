Consider a 2D plot in which dimension 1 and 2 represent quantity 1 and 2 respectively ranging over 0 to 100. Each point in the space corresponding to (x,y) represent cost of choosing quantity 1 as x and quantity 2 as y. Assume cost increases monotonically with increase in quantities. I want to find iso- cost lines(contours) in the space. Say all those points whose cost is equal to some K. How do I find it efficiently without checking cost of all the points in the space which is 100 cross 100.?
