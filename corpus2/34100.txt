As the title says, I want to find a way to increase the size of the dot produced by `OverDot[]`. Here is a simple code               f = (x^2*px^2 - px^2*(px^2 - 1)) + (x^2 + px^2)/2 - 2*x^4;     cnt = {0.002, 0.015, 0.0312, 0.05, 0.15, 0.3, 0.45, 0.5612, 0.64, 0.73, 0.778};     xmin = 1.5;     C0 = ContourPlot[f, {x, -xmin, xmin}, {px, -xmin, xmin},      Contours -> cnt, ContourStyle -> {Black}, ContourShading -> False,      FrameLabel -> {"x", OverDot["x"]}, RotateLabel -> False,      Axes -> False, FrameStyle -> Directive[FontSize -> 22, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],      PlotRange -> xmin, ImageSize -> 550]      which gives this output ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dePLk.png) We see, that even if I used a relative large fonts size (22), the dot above $x$ (`OverDot["x"]`) at the vertical axes is tiny and hardly visible if I print out this plot. So, my question: is there a way to increase the size of that dot? Many thanks in advance. **EDIT** Following @Hector suggestions I used `Overscript["x", Style["\[FilledSmallCircle]", FontSize -> 12]]` which gives ![plot2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4rFKt.png)
