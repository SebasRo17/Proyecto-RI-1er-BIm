I need some audio-feedback when a locator is moved on a surface. I have the following code that produces a beep every time the dynamic controller is interacted with such that the pitch of the sound correlates with the _z_ -value of the underlying surface of the `LocatorPane`. The problem is that when the locator is moved, it does not provide a continuous soundstream, rather jerky, disconnected notes. If I increase the length of each sound primitive then they overlap, and cause severe lags.               pt = {0, 0}; (* initialize locator *)          func = Sin[\[Pi]*2*#1*#2] &; (* arbitrary surface *)          sound[{x_, y_}] :=       Sound[SampledSoundFunction[        Sin[0.15/(Rescale[func[x, y], {-1, 1}, {1, 0}] + 1) #] &, 4000,         20000], .1];          LocatorPane[      Dynamic[pt, (pt = Clip@#; EmitSound@sound@pt) &],      ContourPlot[func[x, y], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, ImageSize -> 200]      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/clLMW.png)
