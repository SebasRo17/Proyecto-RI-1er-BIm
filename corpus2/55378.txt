Okay, I have a list of angles, call it A. How would I arrange them in a 2D m-by-n grid G such that the distances between each adjacent angle-element (row- and column-wise) is minimized? G has as many elements as A, or more. I get to pick m and n. Duplicating elements from A is allowed, but every element from A must be used at least once. Toy Example 1:               A = {0, 10, 10, 20, 20, 20, 20, 30, 30}      Put them in a 3x3 array:               G = {      {0,  10,  20},      {10. 20,  30},      {20, 30,  20}     }      Toy Example 2 (list of 5 angles, put them in a 3x2 grid, so have to duplicate 1 element):               A = {0, 350, 10, 20, 30}          G = {      {0,   10, 20},      {350,  0, 30}     }      Hopefully that was clear enough? Let me know if it wasn't....
