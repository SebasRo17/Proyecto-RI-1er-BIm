Do the following scenarios count as "reinventing the wheel" in your book?   * A solution exists, but not in the language you want to use, and existing solutions can't be interfaced with the language you want to use in a clean, idiomatic way.   * In principle you could get an existing library to do what you wanted with heavy modification, but you think it would probably be easier to just start from scratch.   * What you're writing has the same one-line description as stuff that's already been done, but you're targeting a different niche. For example, maybe your problem has been solved a zillion times before, but in a way that's inefficient for large datasets and your code works well for large datasets.
