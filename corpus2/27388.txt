Is there a way to show maybe a slightly different color, or change the cell bracketing color of a Mathematica cell when it has been modified? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WuZtS.png) Ideally it would be nice to follow the standard of using asterisks but cells don't really have names. Just to clarify a cell is modified when it has been edited but hasn't been run. **Code In Progress:** This code basically is supposed to check to see if `CellChangeTime` changes on a set interval. It doesn't work currently but it is getting there.
