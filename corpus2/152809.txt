## Setup We have a situation where developers connect to their development boxes via Citrix terminals (that are installed on their laptops), which brings them into a Gnome session (e.g. Linux), where they do all the coding. ## Problem Until now developers had Internet Access from those Citrix environments + installed Firefox browser. Starting right now the Internet Access [from that environment] is taken away. Developers still however have the access via their IE9 browser (strictly IE9) from their laptops. This of course makes the whole development process a lot less productive. At the same time, it is _extremely_ difficult to come up with a solid explanation, reasons on why the productivity suffers from switching environments (on the same laptop) in order to use the Internet. ## Question I'm turning to SO community to help us find those reasons that can convince decision makers to give Internet Access back to developers [from the system they develop on].
