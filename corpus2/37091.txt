The place I'm working for is a service provider. We have a lot of services, which are written to deal with deadline, so their code are really terrible:   * No coding convention, everyone codes in his own style   * No unit testing (which is really bad)   * No refactoring (which is truly worse)   * No automation build/deployment  etc and these code are used again and again, so bad code continue to spread all over my department. I really want to set up a standard quality for our code, by requiring everyone to follow "rules": every line of code which does not follow convention will be rejected, and every function of code which does not pass unit testing will not be committed,...But I don't know how to convince my boss to allow me to do this. I'm relatively new comer, so inspiring people from my works is really hard, and I think it's easier if my boss support me to this. Thank you very much for your advices
