Despite what it _might_ look like this is a serious question. After that story with Android OS and Chrome browser submitting to Google the details of the WiFi access points they see in the neighborhood which has nothing even remotely to do with their main function I'm inclined to expect everything. But the specific question I have today concerns the following matter. The situation. I'm developing a web application running on a locally installed web server. Naturally I'm testing and debugging it on the same development machine in various browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome. The development machine has a permanent connection to the Internet. Now. Is there any situation or circumstance when any of those browsers would take it upon itself to send the opened web pages from `http://localhost:port/*` to its company or any other third party? For now I seriously suspect if there is a browser crash or an OS crash the browser would submit a report perhaps with the content of my HTML, CSS and JavaScript. What if a browser would submit pages used actively and opened over a prolonged period of time just out of the company's curiosity - what is this nasty programmer working on? Can you confirm that hypothesis? Are you aware of any other situations when a browser would sent out a local resource details? How safe is it to develop on a machine with a permanent Internet connection?
