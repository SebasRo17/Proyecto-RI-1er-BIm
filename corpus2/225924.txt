Fail-fast seems like a right way since it simplifies bug detection. But it's a harm for performance cause of multiple checking the same thing at several levels of the system. Simple example. There is a function that input parameters must be not null. And there is function wrapping it, that also await the same parameters also not null. After some activities function-wrapper passes input parameters into first one. So that the same items checked two times: at the beginning of function wrapper and inside wrapped function. So I would like to know how much widespread this style is. Should I write fail-fast code or check everything just once?
