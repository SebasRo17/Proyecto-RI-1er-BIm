I want to learn about null values or null references. For example I have a class called Apple and I created an instance of it.               Apple myApple = new Apple("yummy"); // The data is stored in memory      Then I ate that apple and now it needs to be null, so I set it as null.               myApple = null;      After this call, I forgot that I ate it and now want to check.               bool isEaten = (myApple == null);      With this call, where is myApple referencing? Is null a special pointer value? If so, if I have 1000 null objects, do they occupy 1000 object memory space or 1000 int memory space if we think a pointer type as int?
