Instagram:               instagram = ServiceConnect["Instagram"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uz38Z.png) ServiceExecute[conn,"request",params] sends a request to the connection identified by conn, in my example it is Instagram. This seemed like it would be cool functionality in v10. But almost all queries that I form return missing, incomplete, or just wrong data. Note: I have elided the data for privacy, but rest assured the UserID's are correct. Bugs with this functionality are quite simple indeed to reproduce: Search for a user:               In[3]:= instagram["UserData", "UserID" -> 10206720]          Out[3]= <|"Website" -> "http://barackobama.com", "Username" -> "barackobama",       "FullName" -> "Barack Obama", "Media" -> 179, "FollowedBy" -> 3347187,       "Follows" -> 11, "ID" -> "10206720"|>          Import recent media from a user:          In[5]:= instagram["FollowerCount", "UserID" -> 10206720]          Out[5]= 50
