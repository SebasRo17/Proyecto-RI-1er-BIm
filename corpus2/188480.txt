I want to fork on Github the TestNG java testing framework (Apache 2 license) so I can add/change some minor things to suit my needs. It's unlikely that all of my changes would be approved in the main project or that other people would use my fork. This would in no way be a competition to the main project. Now, in terms of naming, I want to change the artifact name (testng-mycompany) or the version (6.8.mycompany) so there's no confusion with the official version in my maven repository. Would this be considered poor etiquette? If yes, what is the best approach to distinguish your fork?
