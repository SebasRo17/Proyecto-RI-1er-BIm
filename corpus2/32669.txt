If I create a simple grid with `Ctrl`+`,` and paste a long piece of text outside the boxes (I'm sure you can find some yourself), then that text does not break at the width of the window in _Mathematica_. Instead, you have to scroll through it with a newly appeared scroll bar at the bottom. How can this be fixed? As an example, you can see bellow here how the word 'also' is getting cut off. I am typing this in, it is not the output of a cell: ![try1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5IiPO.png) Really, my goal is to put text besides a picture. So thanks to Kuba, here is an attempt to first create a Row which should WordWrap, and then turn that output cell into a text and TraditionalForm cell, and fill it in with my content: ![try2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i21rw.png) However, you can see that this breaks the text indeed, but on a new line bellow the picture, I would like to get it alongside the picture.
