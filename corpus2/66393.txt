I'm a newcomer to StackExchange and this seems a very good place to ask my question, that's been wandering in my head for a few months. Currently I'm 22, I'm studying a BS of Computer Science in the UNED (Spanish Distance University) and I'm doing well. I have a job as well, doing web programming (PHP, SQL, CSS, HTML, Apache, that kind of stuff) in a company, but working from my home. I've tried those last few years to accomplish success in other programming languages. I started with C++, Java, Perl & Python and although I can say I have a decent level on it, it's difficult for me to find some projects where I can use them. And I mean **real projects** where you can drive the language level to its cap. I think the lack of motivation is one of the reasons behind this. Its like after a full day repetitive programming, my brain is exhausted and it is hard to achieve something. Also, I have problems with my learning methods. I read a lot of forums (like this one), a lot of books and websites talking about programming, but I don't know how to apply the knowledge acquired. It's like I need a different approach to learning, a more practical one. So, the question is: How do you find the motivation to keep programming after a full day at the job? How do you find a more practical learning method? (It's easy to keep _reading about_ programming after all, but it's another to actually code **something big** ). Thank you in advance. PS: I'm not a native speaker, so don't mind me for lexical and grammatical errors.
