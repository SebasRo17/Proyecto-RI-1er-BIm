My aim is to extract the contents of an Input cells as plain text. Ideally I would like to be able to select one or more Input cells and press a button which would then extract the text from these cells as a string and assign it to a variable. However, this turns out to be harder than it seems (to me at least). One way which was suggested in a chat conversation was to copy the cell as plain text by doing something like this               Button["Set x to selection",       FrontEndTokenExecute[SelectedNotebook[], "CopySpecial", "PlainText"];       x = (NotebookGet@ClipboardNotebook[])[[1, 1, 1]]       ]      This seems to work; for example, if I type this into an input cell, select the cell, and press the button               a + b == c;     d = "x";      then `x` is set to the string `"a+b==c;\nd=\"x\";"` which is what I want. The only downside of this method as far as I can tell is that it destroys the clipboard. To preserve the clipboard I tried using `NotebookRead` instead to copy the contents but I only got that to work if I changed the display form of the selected cell to `"TextForm"` first, e.g.               Button["Set x to selection 2",      Module[{tmpnb, nb},       nb = SelectedNotebook[];       tmpnb = CreateDocument[WindowSelected -> False];       NotebookWrite[tmpnb, NotebookRead[nb], All];        FrontEndTokenExecute[tmpnb, "SelectionDisplayAs", "TextForm"];       SelectionMove[tmpnb, All, CellContents];       x = ToString[NotebookRead[tmpnb]];       NotebookClose[tmpnb]]]       Of course the downside of this approach is that it creates a temporary notebook every time I press the button. **Question** Both methods seem to do their job, but they both rely on the FrontEnd manipulating the contents of the selected cell before being able to extract the string. This made me wonder if there is an easier way to get the same result.
