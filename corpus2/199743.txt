Basically, the objective is to create a visual representation of the software specification document. This visual representation would capture various scenarios involved in the software. Benefits:   * Picture speaks louder than words   * Catch scenarios so that they need to be handled by the developer   * Becomes a knowledge map for others   * Can be used as a reference   * Can be used for knowledge transfer as well. Ideas:   * If possible, we can dynamically modify the visual representation to add scenarios when site issues are found and they were not identified initially. I do not know how to do this. But I would like to invest time to find out how to do this. But is it worth the effort?
