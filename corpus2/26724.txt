On May 21, 2008, an xkcd comic proposed a method for creating a random, local meeting place that can't be determined until the day of the meeting. ![Geohashing comic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PYW6d.png) This method is usually used for xkcd fan events, but can also be a fun way to create a random adventure (kinda like Geocaching without the cache.) More info about the specifics can be found on the Geohashing Wiki. Since the random part of the hash is created from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, I thought it would be a fun algorithm to implement in _Mathematica_. I also wanted to create an excuse to learn about the Google Maps API and processing JSON data in general. Given only a user's "home" coordinates, how would one compute the Geohash location in _Mathematica_?
