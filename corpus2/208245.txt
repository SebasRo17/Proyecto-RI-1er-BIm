I've got a nice, fairly popular JavaScript library that is following Semantic Versioning. The current library has a few dependency libraries, which are available either as separate downloads or as part of a single bundled download. I see a need to head down this path further. I want to extract additional, smaller libraries out of the one larger library. Each of these extracted libraries would be available as separate files, or inside of the one bundled build, again. If I go down this path of extracting the libraries, and providing a bundled version of the final code, does this require a full version change in semantic versioning? Would I have to bump from 1.x to 2.x? My first thought it no: I will not change any public API, so I don't have to change the major version number. But then I wonder... well, I am restructuring a lot of things, even though the final API for the bundled version would be the same. Is there a clear answer from semver on something like this? Do I need to bump first, second or third dot? Or something else?
