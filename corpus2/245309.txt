Is there an easy way to determine which programming languages were used in a project assuming you have access to the source code? I have been programming for quite some time, so I can recognize most of the major programming language by syntax or file extension, but I realized that I could not answer this fairly simple question (A problem I often ask myself when dealing with unfamiliar open source codebases). I understand that you could examine each file extension and Google it to determine whether it belongs to a particular programming language. However, this seems tedious (examining every file extension for a large project) and I am guessing there might be a better way.
