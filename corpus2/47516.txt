I have defined a function which takes a coefficient for a differential equation as an argument, solves the differential equation with NDSolve, and returns the value of the solution at time t=10. I can plot this, but I can't seem to find the minimum value. This code demonstrates the problem i'm having:               f[k_] := y[10] /. NDSolve[         {y''[t] == -k*y[t], y[1] == 2 , y'[2] == 1},         y,         {t, 0, 10}     ];     Plot[f[k], {k, 0, 2}] (* works great *)     NMinimize[{f[k], k > 0, k < .75}, k] (* fails *)      > The NMinimize fails with the error NDSolve::ndnum: Encountered non-numerical > value for a derivative at t == 1.'. So how do I find the minimum of my function f?
