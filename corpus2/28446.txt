Imagine I'm trying to add some value $r$ to each element in a very large array $L$. Take for example:               L = Table[RandomReal[{0,1}],{q,1,10^7}];     r = 0.0032;      I can effectively add $r$ to each element in $L$ by writing:               L = Table[L[[q]]+r,{q,1,Length[L]}];      This operation takes about $\approx 322$ milliseconds. However, is there a better / faster way to proceed?
