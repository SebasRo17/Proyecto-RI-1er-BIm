I think everyone will agree that the following boolean variable/property names are standard:   * UserIsAdmin   * OrdersAreClosed The important thing to note about boolean expressions is that they are stated and then evaluated as true or false. User is admin. False. You get the point. However, lately I have seen an increase in booleans being formed this way:   * IsUserAdmin   * AreOrdersClosed Am I the only one who doesn't think this sounds absolutely ridiculous? You're not asking "Is user admin?" and then waiting for a yes or no. You're making a statement of "User is admin" and waiting for a true or false evaluation. Microsoft has been doing this a lot lately, as well as the programming behind our Telerik web controls. The thing is that I don't understand where this is coming from. It never used to be popular, leaving me to wonder if it's just me who is noticing this or if this is a trend that is actually on the rise and, if so, what's the point?
