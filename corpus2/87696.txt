With plain Google as well as Google Code search tools it is easy to find how to program using some resource or solve certain problems (such as create a Java class, or an FTP block in Perl, etc.). So developers are tempted to just purely copy & paste the code (in a way re-use). Is this an incompetency? I have done this myself, though I think I am a better programmer than many others I have seen. Who has the time to RTFM? In this age of information abundance, I do not think that copy & paste programming is bad. Isn't that what sites like Stack Overflow do anyway? People ask - OK, here is my problem - how to solve it? Now someone will post complete code and the person who asked the question would simply copy & paste the most voted answer. No matter how small the problem is. I am working with a bunch of young coders who heavily rely on the Internet to get their job done. I see convenience in copy/pasting and modifying code to get the job done. For example, you may be quite good with algorithms and such, but you may not know how to use a `BufferedReader` in Java - would you read complete the Javadoc for `BufferedReader` or look up some example of using it somewhere? What are the real dangers of copy & paste coding that can impact their competency?
