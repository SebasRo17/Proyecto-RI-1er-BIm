How could you find the smallest constant $c$ that satisfies $$\frac{3^{3k}e\sqrt{3}}{\pi\sqrt{k}\;2^{3/2+2k}} \leq 2^{\;c\;k}$$ assuming $k\geq 1$ is an integer. You can of course take logs of both sides and divide by $k$.   Can _Mathematica_ then somehow minimize for $c$? The code for the main term above is               (E/Sqrt[2Pi])/(x^(n x) (1 - x)^(n (1 - x)) Sqrt[ 2Pi n x (1 - x)])/. x -> 1/3 /. n->3k
