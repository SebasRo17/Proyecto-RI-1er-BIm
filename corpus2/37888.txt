At my university, I have a yearly essay. I'm allowed to use any technology for implementing it. I've been coding it in C++ with Qt. I thought of about Wolfram _Mathematica_ because I have some experience in it. I need such functionality:   * Timers â€” for calling functions by timer    * Threads (or Processes are good too)    * User-friendly GUI (buttons, input forms)   * Be able to catch when user clicked left/right mouse buttons or key on keyboard    * Dynamic graphics (with changing graphics in time)    * Launching applications as a standalone executable file  I'm ready to put more effort into it. But I wonder whether I'm burying myself alive trying to implement things which _Mathematica_ isn't devoted to do. I would appreciate links to topics marked with questions signs. How bad is this idea? What are your opinions? Should I do it in C++? (Doing it in _Mathematica_ would be challenging for me.) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nUl5a.png)
