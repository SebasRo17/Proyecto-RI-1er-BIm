I've been wanting to increment a nested list element of which I know the "coordinates". I thought of the following procedure, using Apply with Part.               test = Table[10 h + 5 i + j, {h, 0, 3}, {i, 0, 1}, {j, 0, 4}];     pos = {4, 2, 3};     Increment[test[[##]] & @@ pos];      Yet it seems that `test[[##]] & @@ pos` is treated like a different variable. When I print               test[[##]] & @@ pos     test      I can see that `test[[##]] & @@ pos` gives an incremented result, but `test` itself is not changed. What would be a nice and efficient way of incrementing a nested list element, saving the new value of the whole list ? ## Edit So in the light of the first comments, let me say more about what I would like to achieve : I have a nested list `test` which can be of any depth. I have a list `pos` whose length is equal to               Depth[test]-1      The goal is to increment the element at the position `pos` in `test` (I guess by using `Apply`) and return the incremented nested list. My method below increments well but then does not store the new value in the list.
