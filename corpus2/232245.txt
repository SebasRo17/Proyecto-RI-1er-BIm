I'm working on a library which I'm releasing under the MIT License, but I plan to copy a few useful classes from another open source project which is released under the Apache license. Obviously, I'm going to leave the original license intact, and credit the original project but how does the licensing work? EDIT: What I need to know is - 1\. Is it okay for me to do this, since there will be two different licenses? 2\. Will it happen that most of my project will be under the MIT License(the code that I wrote), but those files that I copied from the other project will remain under Apache? EDIT 2: I got my answer here - How to include an apache library with my opensource code? Please vote to close this question.
