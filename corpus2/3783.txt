Is it possible for the Piecewise function to process a vector comparison? For example, my input vector is               x={0,1,2,3,4}      I would like to define a function that gives me x^2 if x<3.5, and x+3 otherwise. i.e. I would like my output to be {0,1,4,9,7}. Here I define a function:               myfunc[x_] := Piecewise[{{x^2,x<3.5},{x+3,x>=3.5}}]      which obviously does not work. Is there a way to let Mathematica know that I want to compare x with 3.5 elementwise and apply that particular value to the segment as appropriate? I'm used to R programming where I can use the ifelse function for this job, but I'm relatively new to Mathematica and don't know if this is possible. Thanks!
