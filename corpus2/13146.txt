So I'm the situation of needing analytical solutions to a family of equations of the form Ax=b, where A is an nxn matrix. I've written a function that does what I want, but I'm currently using a bit of a hack to generate arbitrary (dummy) variable names for the n-vector 'x' :               Map[Clear, Table["x" <> ToString[j], {j, n}]];     x = ToExpression[Table["x" <> ToString[j], {j, n}]];      Can anyone suggest a more elegant way of accomplishing this task?
