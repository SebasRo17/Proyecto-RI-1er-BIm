I don't know where to post this, so sorry if this is the wrong place. I bought the book Learn to Program by Chris Pine on my iPad, I will be travelling for about two days so want to read this book and learn to program obviously but won't have access to a computer so is it worth reading this book while travelling? I flicked through it and has some exercises so was wondering what I should do. thanks
