I have been trying to model crater formation on a given planetary surface - $500\,\textrm{km}^2$. The locations of impacts are random, however, if an impact is within $30\,\textrm{km}$ of another, the previous crater is considered eliminated. So far I have used `RandomReal[0,500]` for both the $x$ any $y$ coordinate values on the $500\,\textrm{km}^2$ plot. My problem is that the arrangement of craters changes for every evaluation I do. What I'm looking to achieve is a cumulation of craters, one by one."Drawn on" so to speak. This way, appropriate crater destruction can also ensue. I am also still trying to figure out a way to model crater destruction. As I mentioned, if an impact location is within $30\,\textrm{km}$ of another, the previous crater is eliminated. I tried using `If[EuclideanDistance[],...]` but no luck. The code I used for crater location (points) is:                   craterlocations = Table[{RandomReal[{0, 500}], RandomReal[{0, 500}]}, {n}]         p1 = ListPlot[craterlocations]      I need to produce a similar plot, but the craters should continually form. As of now I will always wind up with a different random arrangement for each number of impacts (`n`).
