I am involved in the development of a software product that I'd like to see becoming open source. My bosses will ponder this request benevolently I assume, yet they still want to see some evidence that this is a good idea, at least that it is not a bad idea. They have little experience with open source themselves. We work in an academic public service environment, so financial interests are little to non- existing. I think their primary concerns are bad reputation by publishing a project and nobody is interested, and maybe the potential loss of control of the development process. I wonder whether there is (possibly peer-reviewed) material out there that advocates for going open source. But I'm also interested in documents describing a critical perspective towards such a step. Moreover, case studies would be helpful I think. The documents may be behind a journal paywall.
