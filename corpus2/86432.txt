I'd like to do a course about web security. I've seen some certifications that could be interesting:   * CIW Web Security Professional   * CISSPÂ® - Certified Information Systems Security Professional   * Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional What do you know about these certifications? are they recognized? I'm not trying to become a hacker, I just want to ensure I have enough knowledge about web security to cope with today internet. From my inexpert point of view, "Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional" looks exactly as I want, the problem is that it cost more than 500 bucks! Why certification? well, I want to learn but I would like also have a way to demonstrate to a future employer/customer that I had to study and pass exams, not only attend to a course. Regards.
