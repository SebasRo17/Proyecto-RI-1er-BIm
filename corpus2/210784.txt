I was in a conversation with someone who codes for me. He was frustrated with my approach to a particular problem. I am entirely self taught and very pragmatic - I am not a professional developer instead I sometimes write code to get something done and then pass it on to him to clean it up - make it robust etc. We are reading in large txt files that use sgml tags to mark boundaries between individual documents that are related to one another.               <opentagfor txt file>     <document>     <maybe some attribute tags of the document>     the     document     could be a uuencoded     could be html     or something else     can tell what type by the attribute tags     </document>     <anotherdocument>     <maybe some attribute tags of the another document>     the     document itself     could be a uuencoded     could be html     or something else     can tell what type by the attribute tags     </anotherdocument>      .      .      .           <closetagfor txt file>      The individual documents get consumed downstream. Sometimes they get written out to a file structure for indexing, other times some of their content is extracted and saved as 'data'. So my approach was to create a dictionary of dictionaries.                document_dictionary = {document_position_index:{attribute-tag-1:value1,attribute-tag-2:value2,document:the\n    document itself\n    could be a uuencoded\n    could be html\n   or something else \n  can tell what type by the attribute tags}, . . .}      document_position_index is the index position of the document in the original txt source file - has no relevant meaning at all. now if I want to do something with the documents I can do things like               for document in document_dictionary         if document['some-attribute-tag'] == someValue:             do something      The problem is this bad coding (specifically using an integer (document_position_index)) was frustrating to my developer. He said that it is bad form. I still after Googling for a while do not understand. So I would appreciate either a better explanation then I got from him or some pointer to the right direction. Is this the type of question that should be asked here?
