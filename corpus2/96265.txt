I don't even know if this question makes sense ... but let me let you grok it... > _**imagine ..._** _You're totally absorbed into some programming > thought/idea/concept, your brain is in it's most active state thinking up a > solution to a problem, or asJoel Spolsky puts it -- you're deep into your > "zone" -- AND, suddenly someone or some event breaks your engrossment -- > something that you just can't avoid, something you have to attend to._ > **_... imagination complete .. back to reality_** Something that can break your concentration can be...   * you're summoned for an urgent meeting   * your code broke the daily build and your colleague is calling you   * you just recalled something you had to do but forgot doing it   * your teammate has some exciting news to break and insists you to listen   * your girlfriend (or boyfriend) has just come over Now assume you've got only 5-10 minutes before you **_have to_** leave what you were deeply into, and entertain the interruption. My question is -- how do you, quickly "save" the state of mind you were in, when the diversion came. Do you write it in "some form" on a paper or computer, or do you just "remember" it somehow. How do you salvage those exact thoughts within 5-10 minutes so that later on when you come back you can catch up right from the "point" you left. It often so happens to me that i just can't recollect those exact thoughts i was thinking before the blow -- and i feel like i've lost a good idea or solutions to a problem. i try to think retroactively trying hard to get to that SAME cognitive state that had me excited about an idea -- but i get frustrated not being able to "get there". does something like this happen to you. how do you "recover" from this? _**\-- UPDATE --_** My main concern is not code -- it's those "abstract ideas" that haven't been yet converted into code that i need to "save" somehow
