I'm getting started with SVN and so many sources say that merging is very difficult in SVN as compared to DVCS tools. The most recent questions I could find here on SE are from 2012. Sometimes there's a mention that the reason is that SVN prior to v1.5 didn't have metadata, but SVN is at version 1.8.9 now. Given that SVN is now much more mature than v1.5, and especially the fact that we didn't use SVN 1.5 so we don't suffer from the mentioned lack of metadata -- **is there still much validity in those arguments against SVN?** I understand that DVCS has a completely different approach which is often more desirable, but for those who "must" ues SVN for whatever reason, merging isn't really "hell" anymore, is it?
