I'm new to Android and while going through a tutorial on saving `Activity` state to a Bundle, I noticed that instead of accepting the more generic `List` interface, `Bundle`'s put methods are expecting `ArrayLists`. Example:               Bundle.putCharSequenceArrayList(key, value)     Bundle.putIntegerArrayList(key, value)     Bundle.putParcelableArrayList(key, value)     Bundle.putStringArrayList(key, value)      Most of us are familiar with item 52 of Effective Java suggesting that objects must be refered to by their interface, so I am wondering what was the reason behind this API decision. Is `ArrayList` perhaps the preferred list implementation in Android?
