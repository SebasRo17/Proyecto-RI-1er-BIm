In some ruby on rails projects, I have seen instances where strings are used instead of a foreign key reference to a lookup table. I usually code in C#/SQL Server and use lookup tables, but am not particularly experienced in ruby on rails. So my **question** is, should I be using strings instead of lookup tables in my ruby on rails web project (mysql and active record)? Is this something specific to ruby on rails, or to dynamically typed languages? Or for some particular circumstances? Or is it just bad database design? By lookup tables I mean, like the following **UserStatus**               Id    Name     1     Active     2     Disabled      **User**               Id    Username               UserStatusId     1     john.smith@gmail.com   1     1     jane.smith@gmail.com   2      Whereas with just strings **User**               Id    Username               UserStatus     1     john.smith@gmail.com   active     1     jane.smith@gmail.com   disabled
