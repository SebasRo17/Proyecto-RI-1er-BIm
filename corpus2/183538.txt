In our company, we need to build a web interface onto an embedded Linux platform. I kind of see 2 options: You use a technology where the HTML and JavaScript is generated on the server side (Think JSP, Grails, but is is something that is using C++ and generates HTML/JavaScript) or you create a HTML5 'client' application that talks to a JSON or XML generating backend. I have the feeling that web applications currently tend to go with the latter, but what are the advantages of doing so (The developers on the project choose the former, mainly based on the fact that they know C++ much better then HTML and Javascript)
