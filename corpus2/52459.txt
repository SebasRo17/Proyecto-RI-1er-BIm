I have been trying to figure out ways to effectively do performance reviews before an install happens for all releases done by our team. Do you usually make this a part of code review process or do you handle it as a separate review task? FYI - we do not have a dedicated performance testing team. It is up to the developers to make sure the app performs well. The apps I am referring to are web applications.
