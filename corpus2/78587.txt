I might be missing something with the Facebook and Twitter logins APIs. Something that is blocking me from understanding how they would be used in mobile applications. Both APIs seem like they need to redirect you to and then back to a website. How would that work from a mobile app? Or is there another way to use these APIs? I have to write a website that has native login, Facebook login and Twitter login. Then I am expected to turn around and open up a set of web services to an Android and iPhone mobile apps. Thought this was to "loose" of a question to ask on StackOverflow. What is the best approach? Any links on calling the API without UI interaction?
