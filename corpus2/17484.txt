Using `PlotLegends` with a `PlotStyle` containing (for instance) `PointSize[0.02]` creates a legend that does not match the plot.               ListPlot[Table[RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {20, 2}], {2}],      PlotLegends -> {"a", "b"}, PlotStyle -> PointSize[0.02]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JVtXy.png) How can I get a sensible legend when using a number with `PointSize`? Solutions involving named sizes (like `PointSize[Medium]`) are inadmissible unless they somehow create points that have a constant size relative to the plot size.
