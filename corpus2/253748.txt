We have a multithreaded application in C++ which uses SmartHeap-10 on Linux. new, new[], delete and delete [] are overloaded. there is _inconsistent_ occurrence of SIGSEGV, only in delete[]. the backtrace shows -               #0  0x08b068bc in _shi_removeFromFreeList ()     #1  0x08b070d7 in _shi_freeVar ()     #2  0x08b086a7 in MemFreePtr ()     #3  0x081e91ea in operator delete(void*) ()      where MemFreePtr () is library function by SmartHeap. Any pointers to think of ?
