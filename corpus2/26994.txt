From the great answer of Mr. Wizard, I would like to learn how to implement the associated PlotLegends scaled too. Here is the simplest example with PlotLegends, which does not look to be scaled:               data = {{{2, 4, 5, 4}, {3, 3, 7, 2}, {7, 2, 6, 5}, {7, 4, 8, 2}},              {{2, 1, 7, 9}, {3, 2, 1, 8}, {3, 3, 9, 7}, {0, 9, 7, 9}},              {{2, 2, 9, 0}, {5, 7, 0, 9}, {6, 9, 1, 9}, {5, 3, 8, 8}}};          Table[ListDensityPlot[Rescale[data[[i]], {0, 9}],      ColorFunctionScaling -> False, Mesh -> All,      ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap", PlotLegends -> Automatic], {i, 1, 4}]      The first legend shows a different scale from the other three.
