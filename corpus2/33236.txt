As the title says, I want to add some text in a three-dimensional plot, thus labeling specific parts of it. Here is the corresponding Mathematica code               V = 1/2*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2*y^2 + x^2*z^2 + y^2*z^2 - x^2*y^2*z^2);          E0 = 8.5;          S0 = ContourPlot3D[V == E0, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, {z, -5, 5},      PlotPoints -> 100, PerformanceGoal -> "Speed", Mesh -> None,      ContourStyle -> Directive[Green, Opacity[0.3], Specularity[White, 30]],      ImageSize -> 550, RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z},      Sqrt[x^2*y^2 + x^2*z^2 + y^2*z^2] <= 4]]      which gives this output ![plot3D](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UNJhm.jpg) This surface contains eight symmetrical openings (holes) which I want to label using numbers 1, 2, ...., 8. Any suggestions how to do that? Would it be possible to "reduce" and project this surface into a two-dimensional plot in order to insert the labels? I suppose this would be interpreted more easily.
