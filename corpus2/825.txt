The canonical formatting for date labels in a `DateListPlot` is for the year or other date label to be centered over the tick at the start of the relevant period.               aapl = FinancialData["AAPL", {2000}];     DateListPlot[aapl, Joined -> True]      ![canoncial DateListPlot of Apple share price](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qWxK5.png) I would like the label to instead be centered on that year, like this. ![annual date labels, centered](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ig28Y.png) Relevant facts:   * I know the font family and size I am using, so specifying offsets for `AdjustmentBox`es can be fixed explicitly.   * Custom functions for the plot are ok, especially if that is necessary to work out how many years there are in the data and therefore how far to offset an `AdjustmentBox`.   * I am assuming that the solution is a custom auxiliary function that can be passed to the `FrameTicks` option. I would be interested to know if that can be specified using `SetOptions` for `DateListPlot` instead of doing a custom plotting function.   * If there are a lot of years in the data, it is ok to specify explicitly that only every $x$th year label is shown. (We have explicit rules for the mapping from number of years to $x$).   * The partial last year can be specified explicitly by the user. The default would be to show the full year even if there is only a little bit of data for it. I already have something that works but would be interested in how other people approach it, to see if I can make my solution faster/ more elegant/ more concise. Currently it is a big mess because year labels are not the only option I have implemented.   As a bonus, please consider how one would implement labels like this: ![two-row date labels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h2TBH.png)
