My dataset is pretty simple so far:               Questions = Dataset[{     <|"Statement" -> "What is the capital of Switzerland?", "Answer" -> "Bern",      "Incorrect Answers" -> {"Zurich", "Berlin", "Vienna"}|>,     <|"Statement" -> "Who is the king of the jungle?", "Answer" -> "Lion",      "Incorrect Answers" -> {"Giraffe", "Mouse", "Monkey"}|>,     <|"Statement" -> "2+2?" , "Answer" -> "4", "Incorrect Answers" -> {"15", "13", "1e15"}|>}]      ![Questions](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bdcvk.jpg) If I try the following, everything goes right:               NewQuestion1 = <|"Statement" -> "To be...", "Answer" -> "or not to be",      "Incorrect Answers" -> {"or to eat", "continued", "dummy"}|>;     Append[Questions, NewQuestion1]      ![NewQuestions1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pfT24.jpg) Nevertheless, if I delete the dummy answer of the NewQuestion, it will not work:               NewQuestion2 = <|"Statement" -> "To be...", "Answer" -> "or not to be",      "Incorrect Answers" -> {"or to eat", "continued"}|>;     Append[Questions, NewQuestion2]      ![NewQuestion2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8drOc.jpg) This issue seems weird since you can declare a data set with uneven lists from the beginning:               Questions = Dataset[{        <|"Statement" -> "What is the capital of Switzerland?",          "Answer" -> "Bern",          "Incorrect Answers" -> {"Zurich", "Berlin", "Vienna"}|>,        <|"Statement" -> "Who is the king of the jungle?",          "Answer" -> "Lion",          "Incorrect Answers" -> {"Giraffe", "Mouse", "Monkey"}|>,        <|"Statement" -> "2+2?" , "Answer" -> "4",          "Incorrect Answers" -> {"15", "13", "1e15"}|>,        <|"Statement" -> "To be...", "Answer" -> "or not to be",          "Incorrect Answers" -> {"or to eat", "continued"}|>        }]      ![QuestionsUneven](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yEzX.jpg) Any suggestions on how to append NewQuestion2 and/or explanations of why this error is happening?
