In the process of editing my scripts' variable names with a haphazard "replace in all open files" in my text editor, I accidentally replaced portions of graphics data in a notebook (and I believe this is the only issue with the notebook). Here's a sample of my notebook in my text editor:               Cell[BoxData[       Graphics3DBox[GraphicsComplex3DBox[$Failed, {{        {Opacity[0.4], EdgeForm[None],           GraphicsGroup3DBox[{Polygon3DBox[CompressedData["     1:eJxNnXeYFcXz9e/esIiiIFGUKNw7d0Ewo0y4CIKKAdDdvYqKAQOKOWfFnHPO     OWdRMSsgmHPOIKhgzgnR93z29Pf5vX/M0zU93T09Mz3d1VWnqvpP3m+rffO5     ...     SIz7Av/VL5TBhqJPyesWaxZ5/ULdD6rGk39asT0GPMtTShc12+f3763GSrJP     eEPn42ueVxM9322Z2wHfOz3zHo292vZgj0rBN2yz/cX+qXbWVt46Op7\[CapitalOmega]2S8X     PkPQO5K3ZsifUHP+JrF9m+Lj9FXWmcR2+a8n3i/jAwIM6OiS8aPgNuKQzz76     4cx7TXSVD2Teu+MDFhwgfljAOT2aud6Wsf2U0A54IVLaBUP0ZtX22vhBf67Z      The `\[CapitalOmega]` doesn't belong. Unfortunately, "undo" is no longer available, and there's no obvious way for me to sift through and re-replace some of the symbols that I changed (for instance, they aren't all obvious like `\[CapitalOmega]`). Mathematica can no longer open the notebook (I wait while it grinds and heats-up, then have to force-quit). Is there some way to delete the graphics (or even all output cells) from the text file? I was considering just trying this (deleting the cells that seem like graphics), but it seems like there might be a lot of ways this could go wrong. Help!
