I have a series of lists in the form below:               list={ {1,1} , {2,2}, {3,{3,1},{3,2},{31,{31,1},{32,2}}} }      Its a nested list which the dimension is changing case to case. I want to manipulate the list to have an output like this:               LIST={{1,1},{2,2},{3,3,1},{3,3,2},{3,31,31,1},{3,31,32,2}}      I am trying to use this ReplaceList rule               list //. {a_, {b___}} :> {a, b}      But it is not working at all!! How should I make a list out of this nested list?
