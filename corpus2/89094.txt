My RSI has gotten pretty bad now. I'm still in school and thought about applying for a grant based on disability. Is this a bad idea in terms of it being seen as incapable of doing a job after I graduate? Will people see "oh, you have RSI.. and a permanent disability app.. I don't want to hire that poo-poo head." students with permanent disabilities I know it is possible to recover, but the fact is if you're a programmer, you're going to fight it your whole life.
