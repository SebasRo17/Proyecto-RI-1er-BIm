One OutputStream and one InputStream are opened on the same file:               atmp = OpenAppend["tmp"];       Write[atmp, "a"];       Write[atmp, "b"];       Write[atmp, "cde"];       rtmp = OpenRead["tmp"];       Read[rtmp];       Write[atmp, "ABC"];       ReadList[rtmp]        > >     {"b", "cde"}   >   What happend to ABC?               Read[rtmp]       EndOfFile       FilePrint["tmp"]        > >     "a" >     "b" >     "cde" >     "ABC" >   * * * OK.   One after the other, close one, open the other.   But still skeptical.   Shouldn't I be able to set the StreamPosition now?               atmp = OpenAppend["tmp"];       Write[atmp, "a"];       Write[atmp, "bc"];       Write[atmp, "def"];       StreamPosition[atmp];       Close[atmp];       rtmp = OpenRead["tmp"];       Read[rtmp];       ReadList[rtmp];       StreamPosition[rtmp];       SetStreamPosition[rtmp, 1];       Read[rtmp];       FilePrint["tmp"];       Close[rtmp];       DeleteFile["tmp"];       Streams[];
