I'm creating a website that is going to aggregate women shoes from across the web into one website. Kinda like polyvore.com does with all their products but mine is only going to be shoes. Which makes my job a lot easier but I'm still lost as to how I go about getting all the data. I have access to 3 APIs so far. Which provide over 15000 line items so far but there are 1000's of sites out there and millions of products. What is the best method to aggregate all this data? Is it even possible? Or should I rely on a social aspect as well, like polyvore where users can upload any products that aren't on the website? Also, do I have to resort to screen scraping? And is this possible as a one man show? Polyvore has a team of 30 programmers, do I need a team to do this properly?
