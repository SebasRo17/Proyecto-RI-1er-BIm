This is my first post so apologies if any obvious mistakes. I'm trying to work on a data containing names (in quotes) in _Mathematica_. The data is already saved on my system under `names.txt`. I would like to be able to sort these names in alphabetical order but I can't seem to do anything with it in _Mathematica_. None of the commands seem to be working and the file itself is not recognized as a string. I'm sure I'm making an obvious mistake in my code but would greatly appreciate any help. Here's my code below: Original file (reduced version-original file has more than 1000 names): "MARY","PATRICIA","LINDA","BARBARA","ELIZABETH","JENNIFER","MARIA","SUSAN","MARGARET","DOROTHY","LISA","NANCY","KAREN","BETTY","HELEN","SANDRA","DONNA","CAROL","RUTH","SHARON"               data1 = {Import["/Users/Joeblogs/Documents/mathematica/names.txt","string"]}      the output looks like:               {"JOHN", "DAVID", "VIVIAN", "ROBERT"}      How do I sort these in alphabetical order? Thanks for your help.
