There is a debate in between my team members about declaration of Constants class. We are moving the constant variables into separate class as like below               public class Contants     {           public const string StateId = "ST";           public const string CountryId = "CI";     }      few of my team members are suggested to declare the class as sealed to avoid overriding option, and few are suggested to mark it as static to avoid instance creation of constant class.   However I preferred to have it as Sealed with static constructor, since it will help us to initialize the read-only variables in future need. Please advice this..
