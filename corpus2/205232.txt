I'm slowly learning `node.js` and have a small project I want to start. The project will have a lot of background processes (downloading data from external sites, parsing CSV files, etc.). A big "win" for me and node is the fact it uses JavaScript for both client and server. I code in Java and JavaScript in my day job but am also pretty good at Ruby. But, like I said, it seems attractive to use one language everywhere and JS seems to fit that bill. However, I haven't had much experience in using JS for running background jobs. Ruby seems to excel at this. And I'm not opposed to using it. So what are your thoughts on going 100% JS for this? I realize very large projects require custom solutions. I'm just wondering if it's worth the effort. Or, should I just stick with Ruby on those kind of chores? Opinions appreciated. Thanks
