I have the large number of files in which the file's names follow certain pattern. for example here are names of two files               name1="event_No. 2_20140311_910_914.jpg"     name2="event_No. 403_20140311_230727_230731.jpg"      I need to extract the last two numbers of the names to get something like this (String or Expression, it does not matter):               {"910","914"}     {"230727","230731"}      I tried StringTake but it is not supporting Rules and patterns. can any one suggest some way to do this? Thanks
