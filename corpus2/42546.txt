I have been using mathematica for a while, but I have problem wrapping my head around list manipulation functions. I would appreciate any suggestions. Here is what I want to do. ListV is a list of vectors:               ListV= {{x1,y1,z1},{x2,y2,z2},...}= {V1,V2,...}      ListU is also a list of vectors :               ListU={{a1,b1,c1},{a2,b2,c2},...}= {U1,U2,...}      ListU and ListV may have unequal lengths. I want to make a new list (ListUV) which would contain all the new positions generated by the sum of all vectors in ListU and ListV. Mathematically, that would be > ListUV= {V1+U1, V2+U1, ..., V2+U1, V2+U2, ... }. Thanks for any suggestions.
