I dug around a bit and did not find a simple and clear implementation of countdown stopwatch in _Mathematica_. I am looking for a function that takes as an input a certain integer and then counts down by 1 every second till 0 is reached. I think it could be an important part for some examples. Kernel or Front End implementations are both acceptable. Here is my take on it:               timer[s_] := Module[{x = AbsoluteTime[], y = AbsoluteTime[]},                    RunScheduledTask[y = AbsoluteTime[], {1, s}];                   Dynamic[s - Floor[y - x]]]      It's a bit hacky but works ;-) I have seen the following questions already:   * How to make a dynamic stopwatch?   * How can Time be made to go backwards?   * Stopwatch in Mathematica? but I do not think they do what I was looking for. They either run time forward, are too complex, or something else. Did I miss anything? Does anyone have better ideas?
