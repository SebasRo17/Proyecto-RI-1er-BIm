I work in a team with wide range of expertise and experience. I have been trying to introduce weekly knowledge sharing sessions. Sessions of 30-60 min length where everybody gets a chance to present something and talk about it. This will contribute in improving presentational and language skills. However, the team is not motivated towards this, either the attendance is too low or none. How to get a team work towards such an idea?
