I just listened to Software engineering Radio podcast on components. Their description of components were very vague, they made them sound like lower level versions of functions. I am trying to figure out what components mean in the context of the composite pattern.   1. What is the difference in purpose between a function and a component?   2. What does a component have to do with the composite pattern?   3. Can you describe what a component is by using a funny metaphor? For example, explain how creating a component like baking an apple pie.
