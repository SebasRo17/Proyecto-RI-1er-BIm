This is a very naive question about input validation in general. I'm a MATLAB user (1.5 years old) and I learned about input validation techniques such as "parse" and "validatestring". In fact, MATLAB built-in functions are full of those validations and parsers. So, I naturally thought this is the professional way of code development. With these techniques, you can be sure of data format of input variables. Otherwise your codes will reject the inputs and return an error. However, some people argue that if there is a problem in input variable, codes will cause errors and stop. You'll notice the problem anyway, and then what's the point of those complicated validations? Given that codes for validation itself take some efforts and time, often with quite complicated flow controls, I had to admit this opinion has got a point. With massive input validations, readability of codes may be compromised.
