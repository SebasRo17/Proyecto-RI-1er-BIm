Need some direction on 3d point cloud display using OpenGL in c++ (vs2008). I am brand new to OpenGL and trying to do a 3d point cloud display with a texture. I have 3 2D arrays (each same size 1024x512) representing x,y,z of each point. I think I am on the right track with               glBegin(GL_POLYGON);      for(int i=0; i<1024; i++)      {           for(int j=0; j<512; j++)           {                 glVertex3f(x[i][j], y[i][j], z[i][j]);           }      }      glEnd();      Now this loads all the vertices in the buffer (I think) but from here I am not sure how to proceed. Or I am completely wrong here. Then I have another 2D array (same size) that contains color data (values from 0-255) that I want to use as texture on the 3D point cloud and display. I understand that this maybe a very basic OpenGL implementation for some but for me this is a huge learning curve. So any pointers, nudge or kick in the right direction will be appreciated.
