How to get from the following intermediate result to the final one with just one pure function?               data = {"2894;Hot Pink;53:09:44;1449714",         "17456;Dark Cyan;19:06:42;6929227", "5147;Lime;54:11:55;5247632"};         from = 2; to = 3; delim = ";"; nr = to - from + 1;            inter = StringSplit[#, delim][[from ;; to]] & /@ data       {{"Hot Pink", "53:09:44"}, {"Dark Cyan", "19:06:42"}, {"Lime", "54:11:55"}}            final = {{"Hot Pink;53:09:44"}, {"Dark Cyan;19:06:42"}, {"Lime;54:11:55"}}
