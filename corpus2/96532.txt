I have been [hobby] programming for years now and know several languages including Objective-C, Java, C#, Python, C, and C++ well. I understand many programming patterns and have used several different frameworks. However, I know almost nothing about web development. I'm looking for a resource that, instead of diving right into code, kind of gives me a bird's eye view of how all the technologies work together. Oftentimes, I'll see several things studied in depth like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ActionScript, AJAX, etc., but no explanation of where they all fit in the big picture. I'd also like to avoid all-encompassing IDE's starting out, as that tends to make it harder to actually understand whats going in the learning phase. Any links, resources, preferably free and online, advice, etc. much appreciated. Thanks!
