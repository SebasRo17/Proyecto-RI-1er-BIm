I'm due to meet with a developer/sales person from a new 3rd party resource we're about to start using. The main topic I'll be interested in, is their API as I will be the developer making use of it and explaining it to the rest of the team. What questions would you recommend asking? Things I'm already thinking about are:   * What happens and how will I be notified when they depreciate a method?    * Is there ever any downtime?   * Who will I deal with first when I have API issues?
