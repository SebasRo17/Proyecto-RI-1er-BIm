I have two big lists with 10,000 lines each, with product names from different databases. They have a lot of common products (50%), but they are not typed in the same way. For example there is one sample of 20 items that match: List One               Refresco em Pó TANG de Pêssego 30g     Refresco em Pó CLIGHT de Maracujá 9g     Refrigerante ANTARCTICA Soda Limão Garrafa 600ml     Refresco em Pó CLIGHT de Abacaxi com Hortelã 8g     Refrigerante ANTARCTICA Guaraná Lata 350ml     Refresco em Pó CLIGHT de Lima Limão 9g     Refrigerante ANTARCTICA Zero Guaraná Garrafa 600ml     Ração para Gatos Sabor Peixe e Frutos do Mar WHISKAS 500g     Refresco em pó TANG de Tangerina 30g     Refresco em Pó CLIGHT de Uva 9g      List Two               SUCO PO PESSEGO TANG 30G     SUCO PO DIET MARACUJA CLIGHT 8G     REFRIGERANTE SODA LIMONADA ANT 600ML     SUCO PO DIET ABACAXI C/HORTELA CLIGHT 8G     REFRIGERANTE GUARANA ANT LT 350ML     SUCO PO DIET LIMAO LIMAO CLIGHT 8G     REFRIGERANTE GUARANA ZERO ANT PET 600ML     RACAO PEIXE E FRUTOS DO MAR WHISKAS 500G     SUCO PO TANGERINA TANG 30G     SUCO PO DIET UVA CLIGHT 8G      In the original list they are out of order. In SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) they have Fuzzy Lookup Transformations to do things like that. Question: What is the best way to make the match as automatically as possible in Mathematica? I tried something very incipient with `EditDistance`, but it's not enough. I know that some human intervention will be needed in the end, but currently the whole process is done manually. You can import a bigger list version with 400 lines each, direct in Mathematica using:               list1=StringSplit[Import["http://arquivo.rodrigomurta.com/Fuzzy_list1.txt"],"\n"]     list2=StringSplit[Import["http://arquivo.rodrigomurta.com/Fuzzy_list2.txt"],"\n"]      The lines 001 to 200 have the elements that are not equivalent, and don't match. The lines 201 to 400 have the elements that are equivalent, and are in the same order. So 201 in list 1 is equivalent in 201 in list 2. Thanks in advance
