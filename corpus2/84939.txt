An intern will be starting with us soon for a couple months before going off to university. The intern is straight-out of high school and has some programming experience, but has never taken a university level computer science course or held a programming job. In addition, the intern has never used 99 percent of the technologies at our shop. As team lead/manager, I know there are a hundred different programming tasks that the team needs to get done. I don't want to overload the intern, but I still want the intern to be useful. From someone that has had a similar experience how did you manage the intern in regard to:   1. Did you micro-manage the intern or were you easygoing?   2. Did you explain parts of the code-base or leave it up to the intern to figure out?   3. Did you give the intern access to source-control or did you manually commit their changes after checking them?   4. Did you enforce coding standards/rules? Please answer the questions and mention what you thought worked best for 1-4. Did I forget anything?
