I would like to define the function with Fourier series when I just have discrette data. (I don't have a specific function). I can draw the graph using the data, but I don't have a idea how can I get this function. The plot is a periodic. I want to obtain a function that will work like a Fourier series expansion. How can I define such a function? Graph ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KoApA.png) Horizontal-axis is Time. Vertical-axis is Space.
