I want to superpose an image with a graphics in order to evaluate their alignment. I am writting this exemple of code.               s1 = Graphics[{RGBColor[{1,0,0}],Circle[{0, 1}]}];     model = ContourPlot[x^2 + y^2 - 1 == 0, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]     imref = Rasterize[s1, ImageSize -> {200, 150}](*suppose that is given by camera*)     Show[imref,model];      (*second method*)     immodel=Rasterize[model, ImageSize -> {200, 150}];     ImageCompose[imref,immodel]      I have an other idea, I can binarize the two images and Multiply them or do ImageDifference to get the result alignement but I need also to show graphically the results! Is there any idea to add the opacity or transparency parameters in order to see both images superposed images? thanks
