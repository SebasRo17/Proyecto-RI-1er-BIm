Is there a best practice for how to document the source code you're releasing? Currently, we have a table of the versions of the software, what SVN tag it's labeled as, what SVN rev that tag was created at and the SVN URL. Then, our CM department wants us to include a file listing of all the source files we're including for the .zip that we provide them which is just a zip of the tag we're releasing. I'm more fishing for ideas to update our print template, hopefully with good arguments to remove the file listing.
