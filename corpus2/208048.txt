I have been going through interview questions and I saw one which made me stop and think for a while. It starts with a quote and asks about your interpretation and whether you agree or not. "For infrastructure technology, C will be hard to displace." Dennis Ritchie From a bit of background reading you can find that he was the mastermind behind C language as well as the UNIX OS. At the time it was a phenomenal improvement and at the forefront of cutting edge techniques. I feel that C++ and Java are becoming increasingly popular languages, but C will always be an important language. What do other languages offer when it comes to infrastructure technology that could indicate its advantage over C in the future. On a side note, does anybody know which year this quote was made? I just want the opinions of people who use these languages a lot, I myself use python language and would love to learn a bit more about the framework around C and it's importance firsthand.
