One of my internal users is having a problem with an application built by one of our long-retired developers. The application works fine on Windows XP, but in Windows 7 there is a problem with it. The application was originally developed as a ClickOnce application in .NET 2.0, something neither I nor any of our current devs know anything about. The question is, should we try to continue keeping this app as ClickOnce, or has it been deprecated in some way? Apparently ClickOnce applications can still be developed in VS2013, so it is do-able. But SHOULD we do it? I'd rather make this a web application, actually, and put it out on our intranet.
