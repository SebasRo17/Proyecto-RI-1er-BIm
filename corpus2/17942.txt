I want to create a `Graphics3D` polygon that has stripes on it. My code is                Graphics3D[{        LightBlue,         Polygon[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 2, 0}, {1, 2, 0}, {1, 0, 0}}]},         Boxed -> False,        Lighting -> {{"Ambient", LightBlue}},        ViewPoint -> {0.2, 0, 0.2},         RotationAction -> "Clip"]      I want horizontal equidistant stripes on it. Can anyone help?
