I am asked to provide performance statistics for a program, one of them being memory consumption. I noticed that in perfmon or in .NET API there is apparently many variable related to memory usage, such as private bit, working set, page file, etc. What are the difference, and which one should we use for measuring performance? If the vendor claims that the memory consumption of the program is improved in version X, what value can be used to validate this?
