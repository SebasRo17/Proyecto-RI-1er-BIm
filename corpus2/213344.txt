I now have **a Python project** that is in charge of generating the simulation data and visualizing the simulation and processed data. **A C++ console application** is already available in my Visual Studio. The **processing sequence** is as follows:   1. Python project generates the raw data into `data.txt`.   2. Visual Studio C++ console application takes in `data.txt` and processes the data, and finally outputs `results.txt`.   3. Python project takes in `results.txt` and visualizes it with `matplotlib`. I am now doing it manually, and it works perfectly ok for one run. However, it becomes extremely troublesome when I want to have multiple runs. **Questions:**   1. How may I integrate them together? Integrate Python project into Visual Studio or integrate C++ console application into Spyder (my Python IDE)?   2. Currently, I manually enter the debugging parameters in the C++ console application debugging property. How may I make it automatic? i.e. After Python project generates `data.txt`, the `data.txt` gets automatically taken in as parameters by the C++ console application?
