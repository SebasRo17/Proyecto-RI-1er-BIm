I want to make an animated `BarChart`. In this I want to plot different tables which range from $10^{-60}$ to $1$. For example:               {0.1,0.2,10^-3,10^-16,0.01,10^-20}      and the next data set goes to:               {0.11,0.19,10^-2,10^-12,0.0001,10^-10}      However, I can't set the `BarChart` with `ScalingFunctions->"Log"` to only start if a number for the chart is higher than $10^{-12}$. Does anyone know a way to fix this? P.S.: I already tried `PlotRange->{10^-12,1}`. Doesn't work though.
