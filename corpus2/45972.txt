It is very likely that it is my lack of math skills that is showing up here. However, I think `Transpose` is such an important function that I need to master it. So I am going to ask because I do not understand the information given in the documentation. > Transpose[list,{Subscript[n, 1], Subscript[n, 2], …}] transposes list so > that the k-th level in list is the Subscript[n, k]-th level in the result. Would anyone be able to provide a simple example and point out in a matrix what is going on? I am in particular struggling with the nth and k-th level. How does that work? I want to master `Transpose[list, {…}]`. Please explain the case where the k-th and n-th level are to be transposed, since this is where I am struggling. If this is considered mathematical question, and therefore not in the right place, I would appreciate a comment so that I could delete the post.
