I want to apologize in advance if my headline is not specific enough, but I think this is a general question, although I have a very concrete example: In my team we maintain a test specification which we use every time we release software. The specification is written in Word and, as a consequence, we occasionally have compatibility problems, wrong formatting in some parts of the document and sometimes people use the heading levels incorrectly. Nothing major, but annoyances none the less. But essentially our specification consists of test cases which can be described simply as a headline with some numbered instructions. I think we would be a lot happier with using a lightweight markup language (e.g. AsciiDoc or Markdown) since it would be sufficient to describe the content. We would have other concrete benefits (add it to git, use diff tools, easily convert to other formats, not needing Word). This made me think - are there any advantages, in general terms, to expressing information in the simplest possible format?
