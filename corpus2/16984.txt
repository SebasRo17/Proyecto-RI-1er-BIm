Consider the following code:               data1 = {{0.70, 0.05}, {0.71, 0.06}, {0.72, 0.07}};     data2 = {{0.72, 0.07}, {0.72, 0.08}, {0.72, 0.1}, {0.72, 0.2}, {0.72,0.4}, {0.73, 0.6},{0.73, 0.8}, {0.73, 1.0}, {0.73, 2.0}, {0.74, 4.0}, {0.74, 5.0}, {0.74, 6.0}, {0.75, 8.0},{0.78, 10.0}};     data3 = {{0.72, 0.07}, {0.74, 0.08}, {0.76, 0.1}, {0.84, 0.2}, {0.9, 0.4}, {0.96, 0.6}, {1.0, 0.8}, {1.02, 1.0}, {1.12, 2.0}, {1.22, 4.0}, {1.26, 5.0}};          sg = ListLogPlot[Tooltip[data1], Joined -> True, Mesh -> Automatic];     sl = ListLogPlot[Tooltip[data2], Joined -> True, Mesh -> Automatic];     lg = ListLogPlot[Tooltip[data3], Joined -> True, Mesh -> Automatic];     Show[sg, sl, lg, PlotRange -> All]      There is no problem with the individual plots but their scales mess up when I combine them using Show command.The scale label just simply disappear. Any idea on how to fix this?
