Let $f(x) = (x^2 + 1) / x$. I need to plot the function for the values of $x$ in which the square of the function is larger than 4, and its cube is smaller than 64. So I used `Reduce` like this:               Reduce[((x^2 + 1)/x)^2 > 4 && ((x^2 + 1)/x)^3 < 64, x, Reals]      Now I am having problems plotting this. I need to use `Plot` to display the function on the specific interval, but I do not know how to input the result from `Reduce` (which may be union of intervals) in `Plot` in order to draw the function only for those values of $x$. Could anyone assist?
