I want to set a zero offset for the frame origin. In other words, the horizontal axis should start at exactly the lower bound, instead of having a small offset. For example, in the figure below, even though I set the range of x to be [0, 6], the x axis starts at a small negative value. What do I need to do to make the x axis start at exactly 0?               Needs["PlotLegends`"]     Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 6}, Frame -> True, FrameLabel -> {x, y},       RotateLabel -> True, PlotLegend -> {"a=1"},       LegendPosition -> {0.3, 0.3}, LegendSize -> 0.5,       LegendShadow -> None, LegendBorder -> None]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/d430s.png)
