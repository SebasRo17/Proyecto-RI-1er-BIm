I am successfully able to scale all my old applications which were not using documented Design Patterns. Whatever pattern it is I don't know. To a large extent, I only felt a need to use simple OOP concepts. The Design Patterns concept is complex and hard to understand. When implemented, how to determine whether the implementation is correct and the application possess real loose coupling?
