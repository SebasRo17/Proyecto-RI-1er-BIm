I would like to program the `RiemannR` function using the `LogIntegral` command because I would like to later experiment with a double integral instead of the `LogIntegral` function. I have tried to program the `RiemannR` function starting with the `LogIntegral` command as defined in the Stein-Mazur paper called "Primes": ![RiemannR function as in Stein Mazur paper on primes](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uHKVF.png) That agrees almost completely with the definition given in the _Mathematica_ help page about the `RiemannR` command: $$R(x)=\sum_n^\infty \mu(n)\mathrm{li}(x^{1/n})/n$$ The only differences I see are that the summation limit $n=1$ is given in the Stein-Mazur paper while in the _Mathematica_ help page it is not. Also the Stein-Mazur paper uses $\mathrm{Li}$ for the logarithmic integral while the _Mathematica_ help page uses $\mathrm{li}$. However in the _Mathematica_ help page for the `LogIntegral` command the lower case $\mathrm{li}$ is used. My problem is that when I enter the following lines:               N[RiemannR[1000]]     N[Sum[MoebiusMu[n]*LogIntegral[1000^(1/n)]/n, {n, 1, Infinity}]]      in _Mathematica_ , I get different numerical values:               168.359     168.341      What am I doing wrong?
