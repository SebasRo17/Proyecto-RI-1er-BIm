I'm doing some calculations on complex numbers in Mathematica. I can use Export to generate a file (*.CSV or *.dat, or anything else) of complex numbers. If I want to use excel, origin or Matlab to process the data, they cann't be treated properly. The easiest way to show these problem is like this:                  Export["dtList.dat", dtList = E^(-I*#) & /@ Range[10] // N]      When the file,dtList.dat, is imported to Matlab, the data are treated as string, not complex numbers, (Look at the figure attached). I know this problem can be addressed if I export the Real part and Imaginary part of the complex numbers seperately, and combine them together in Matlab after import, but this is inconvenient and not elegant. Is there any clever solution? Thank you. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9M7gZ.png)
