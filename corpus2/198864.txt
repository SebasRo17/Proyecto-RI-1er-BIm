I am working on developing range of web based software solutions. But the problem is that for some clients we need to deploy the applications in their local intranet. In such a situation I have to stick with Java as development language as I cannot give away the source code of the project. Now in order to tap on more consumers we put these solutions online. Now considering the fact that Java hosting is more expensive than PHP we are left with no choice but to again re develop the entire solution in PHP. Thus we end up having two version of same solution for maintenance and upgrading in different platforms. So can any point us to some good solution in which we can have the online solution and also have a deployable version of the application in which we can ship the application without its source code and at the same time we also need the application to be cost effective from hosting point of view?
