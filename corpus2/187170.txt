I'm currently designing a search algorithm for a document, and just got curious about this while designing the algorithm: how do web browsers search a webpage? For example, in Google Chrome, you can press the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-F to activate the "Find" bar, which will let you search a particular webpage for text. How does it do that, given that it only has the raw HTML as reference?
