I have been working on my hobby project in C++ for more than 2 years. Whenever I write a module/function, I code it with lot of thinking. Now see the problem,               do {       --> write the code in module 'X' and test it       --> ... forget for sometime ...       --> revisit the same piece of code (due to some requirement)       --> feel that "This isn't written nicely; could have been better"     } while(true);      Here `'X'` is any module (be it small/large/medium). I am observing that, this happens no matter how much effort I put while coding. So mostly, I refrain myself from seeing a working code. :) Is this a common feeling for many people ? Is this language specific phenomena ? (Because in C++ one can write the same thing in different ways). What should I do, if I get this **re-factoring** feeling for a real world production code, where changing the working code will not earn me much accolades but rather it may invite troubles if it fails.
