I have been using Mathematica for a while and thought of using Worbench to structure my project better. However, moving my code from .nb-files to .m-files in a Workbench project does not really work, since unlike the Mathematica frontend Workbench does no line breaks. Is there a way to enable auto line breaks in Wolfram Workbench? If not, how is one supposed to work with long expressions in Workbench?
