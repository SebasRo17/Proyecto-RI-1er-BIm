The input               Residue[1/DirichletL[19,10,s],{s,s0}]      gives `0` even when `s0` is a root. For example, from LMFDB, I found `s0 = 0.5 + 1.51608375316006 I` is an approximate root of `DirichletL(19,10,s)`. (In LMFDB this character is actually indexed 18, though.) For the Riemann zeta function, we can get around this by using `ZetaZero[1]` to represent `s0`. What can be done for other $L$-functions?
