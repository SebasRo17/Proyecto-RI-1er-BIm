I'm new just about everything 'Apple' with the exception of owning an iPhone and iPad for over a year. I have 15+ years on Wintel platforms w/ C/C++/C# experience, so Obj-C doesn't scare me. I recently purchased a Mac Book Pro and have XCode 4, but I've noticed most online tutorials (at least that I can find) are still geared for XCode 3.x. My question, does anyone know of any online tutorials (text or video) geared around XCode 4? The only ones I'm aware of are on developer.apple.com. While good, those seem to assume you're transitioning from XCode 3.x. Thanks [Edit] - Adding a link, and will try to keep this current for other readers.   * Standford's
