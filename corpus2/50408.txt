I have a question regarding this Q&A. Let's call a vertex that is not the tail of any directed edge an _output_ of the graph. The graph below has only one output (at the far right). If I want the distance from each vertex to the output of the graph, what should I do? This one is on my graph:               matOP = {{0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0},               {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0}};          pos = Position[matOP, 1];     edge = Subsets[Range@Length@pos, {2}];     dedge = DeleteDuplicates[        DirectedEdge @@@ (Extract[edge, #] & /@            With[{dist =               N@(EuclideanDistance[pos[[#]], pos[[#2]]] & @@@ edge)},             Flatten[Position[dist, #] & /@               DeleteDuplicates@N@Select[dist, # <= 1.5 &]]])];          Graph[dedge,        VertexCoordinates -> Rule @@@ Thread[{Range@Length@pos, pos}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tOxbt.png)
