I have some packages/scripts that I schedule the execution using Jobs in SQL server. For example, in some of then, I use to create reports and delivery by mail using Mathematica. All done using command line execution, without front end. Some times I have an unexpected problem in the middle of the code, and I would like abort the execution, maybe create some log file if it happens in a txt (all before send the mail, to abort the delivery, or delivery just to me a error msg). I would like to know what is the best practice to do that in Mathematica. I'm used to break my code in blocks, so I can handle that. Today I use Check in each block, with some message in the second argument followed by Quit[].               someCodeBock//Check[#, Print["error msg"];Quit[]]&      Is this the best way? There is some difference between Exit and Quit? In VB I use on error goto X.
