I'm using Mathematica 9 and want to delete a single vertex and all associated edges on a graph but can't seem to get the function VertexDelete function to work. My code is below. I declare a graph "newgraph" and GraphPlot works fine but when I call VertexDelete I get the following error: > VertexDelete::graph: A graph object is expected at position 1 in > VertexDelete[{0->1,0->3,0->6,0->11,0->12,0->14,0->30,0->56,0->75,0->76,0->78,0->86,0->94,0->112,0->120,0->222,0->232,0->248,0->504,0->960,1->7,1->12,1->14,1->15,1->31,1->57,1->62,1->75,1->76,1->78,1->79,1->86,1->94,1->95,1->112,1->116,1->120,1->121,1->124},79]. > >> My code is:               newgraph = {0 -> 1, 0 -> 3, 0 -> 6, 0 -> 11, 0 -> 12, 0 -> 14,        0 -> 30, 0 -> 56, 0 -> 75, 0 -> 76, 0 -> 78, 0 -> 86, 0 -> 94,        0 -> 112, 0 -> 120, 0 -> 222, 0 -> 232, 0 -> 248, 0 -> 504,        0 -> 960, 1 -> 7, 1 -> 12, 1 -> 14, 1 -> 15, 1 -> 31, 1 -> 57,        1 -> 62, 1 -> 75, 1 -> 76, 1 -> 78, 1 -> 79, 1 -> 86, 1 -> 94,        1 -> 95, 1 -> 112, 1 -> 116, 1 -> 120, 1 -> 121, 1 -> 124}          GraphPlot[newgraph, VertexLabeling -> True]          VertexDelete[newgraph, 79]      As far as I am aware, I am indeed passing a graph as an argument! Someone please help me! Many thanks.
