I have two functions;               f[x_] = (1/k) Exp[-x/k] ;     g[x_] = (1/p) Exp[-x/p] ;      How I can convolve them? In Mathematica for convolving two functions we have this function:               Convolve[f, g, x, ??]      But I don't know how to do the convolution with the above function for my case. before I ask this question I searched in detail but I didn't find what I need. Note: the solution of the above functions is:               (1/k) Exp[-x/k]  *  (1/p) Exp[-x/p]  =  (1/(k-p)) ( Exp[-x/k]  - Exp[-x/p] )      where * is the convolution. So, how to do this convolution in Mathematica?
