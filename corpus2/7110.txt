I'd like to create a tournament bracket using Mathematica. I've looked around online, but haven't found any examples yet. Can someone show me how to do this? Specifically, I'd like to have a (somewhat) arbitrary number of participants in a double-elimination bracket. **Edit** by belisarius An example of a double elimination bracket follows ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lfFRj.png) Each team has to be beaten twice to be eliminated. There are a winners and a losers circuit, and when a team loses a match in the winner's side, it enters the losers circuit in an appropriate place, so not to be confronted with past competitors.
