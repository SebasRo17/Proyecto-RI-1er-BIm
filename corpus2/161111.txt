I am a professional iOS, Java and C# programmer. Now I want to build a website. The problem is I have already started building it and I am finding IE is not rendering it correctly. It is rendering much better in FF however. Where is the best resource for someone in my position? I am a professional programmer but I need something to get me up to speed quickly with the 'quirkiness' if you will, of css and html.
