I was going through "Object Oriented Modelling and Design" by James Rumbaugh et al and it said that in languages where multiple inheritance is not supported like Java three mechanisms can be used as workarounds   1. Delegation using aggregation of roles    2. Inherit the most important   3. class and delegate the rest Nested Generalization I couldnt understand the examples given in the text. Could any one please explain this with an example. I know that "diamond problem" is a problem within multiple inheritance and java supports multiple inheritance of interfaces.
