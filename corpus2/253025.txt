I've noticed that the string library doesn't require one to allocate space before writing the input/output. How does the string library allocate that memory dynamically, i know of the 'new' keyword in c++ and 'malloc' in c but when i try something like this, my program stops working.               char* str = new char[strlen(str) + 1];     cin>>str;      i can't get it to work that way, how does the string library work? I also know of vectors in C++ but not a big fan of using them, i would like to know if there's a way to dynamically allocate memory without having to allocate a size before, something close but not as sophisticated as the string.h library. How does the string library get unlimited input from user without the programmer specifying buffer size?
