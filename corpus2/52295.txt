First time posting here, although an experienced user of WM. I have a problem regarding graphics which I cannot seem to fix, so I am asking for your help.   1. I start with a set of points $(x,y)$ in the range of $[0,1]\times[0,1]$, so a 2D rectangle. With these points I generate a triangle mesh which I later use with Finite Element Method for solving the eigenmodes of this rectangle OR a coat of cylinder, torus, or moebius, depending on what kind of boundary conditions I use in FEM.   2. If the membrane is a coat of a 3D object, like in this case for a moebius strip, I want to draw the surface of a Moebius strip as a set of points $(x',y',z')$ in 3D. Normally I do this using parametrisation equations. I have found the equations for a moebius strip and they work perfectly. Here are the transformations     * x' = (R+S*Cos[0.5*t])*Cos[t]      * y' = (R+S*Cos[0.5*t])*Sin[t]      * z' = S*Sin[0.5*t] where `t`$\in$ `[0,2Pi] = 2Pi * x` and `S`$\in$`[-0.5,0.5] = y - 0.5`.   3. With these new 3D points I can now do a surface plot in 3D, which shoud look something like this for the case of a cylinder: ![Cylinder](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DcTbu.png) But if I draw these points as a moebius strip, I get weird anomalies. Here are the two cases I tried:     * `ListSurfacePlot3D` -> I get weird anomalies. I tried tweaking `MaxPlotPoints` but it didn't do the trick. ![First case](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XpruE.png)     * `ListPlot3D` -> Works a bit better, but it also fills the hole in between and draws a weird joint. ![Second case](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v5kSQ.png) Here is the data sample of a 2D rectangle: Original Here is the same data sample, but transformed for the case of moebius: Transformed Plot codes for the data               p1=Graphics3D[Point[data3d], Boxed -> False, AspectRatio -> 1,        BoxRatios -> Automatic, SphericalRegion -> True, PlotRange -> All,        ImageSize -> 350]     p2=       ListPlot3D[data3d, Boxed -> False, Axes -> False,        SphericalRegion -> True, AspectRatio -> 1, BoxRatios -> Automatic,        MaxPlotPoints -> 30, PlotRange -> All, ImageSize -> 350,        Mesh -> Automatic, PlotStyle -> Magenta]               Show[{p1, p2}]      Where `ListPlot3D` can also be changed with `ListSurfacePlot3D`. I really appreciate your help.
