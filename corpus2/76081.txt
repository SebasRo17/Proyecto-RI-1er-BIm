I have been programming for 3-4 years now and feel I can no longer be called a beginner, but I read some questions on this site and think WTF are they talking about? I feel the same way when I pick up programming books nowadays. I have read several beginning programming books, some on C/C++ and others on gaming. I have written some more complex things such as very basic AI, serial and TCP/IP interface. I plan on becoming a game programmer, but I have recently become somewhat interested in embedded systems after having the chance to work on them (the serial interface). I have found it very difficult to find materials to continue my learning after completing the introduction and beginner books as the are no intermediate C++ books I can find. What advice would you give to grow and enhance my knowledge and skills? Specific resources would be greatly appreciated.
