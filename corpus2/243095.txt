I need to code a signal-like mechanism and I was thinking of using the same "slot" and "signal" terms to indicate the signal and the function that needs to be called. Since this is a commercial application I'd like to know if there might be any issue with using these names, e.g. if Qt has some sort of patent on them (I searched around but couldn't find it). I believe this is a stupid question since patenting a class name would be moronic, to say the least.. but anyway... To add some detail: my code is ENTIRELY different and has NOTHING TO DO with Qt except the above. I don't use moc or any Qt class.
