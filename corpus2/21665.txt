I have a set of Graphics3D primitives (here, spheres) which I would like to assign either: (1) One of a subset of colors, e.g. {Green, Red} (2) A random color over some RGB interval Writing something like:               Graphics3D[{RGBColor[RandomInteger[{0, 1}], RandomInteger[{0, 1}], RandomInteger[{0, 1}]],Sphere[{#[[1]], #[[2]], #[[3]]}, #[[4]]] & /@ SphereList...      Appears to only assign one random color to all of the spheres. I can force this to work by generating a string that explicitly specifies a random color for each sphere, but is there a simple way to make this work?
