I have a Windows Forms App which has two classes:               Public Class Account         Public Property Number as String         Public Property Invoices as List(Of Invoice)     End Class          Public Class AccountRepository         Public Sub Delete(account as Account)              ...db access code here...         End Sub     End Class      The business logic is that an `Account` can't be deleted while it still has `Invoices` associated with it. How and where should I do the validation? _Note I could also do it via table restrictions on db foreign keys._
