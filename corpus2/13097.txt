I am new to _Mathematica_ and trying to figure out whether it is a good tool for algorithmic exploration. So I had the idea of implementing a simple OCR with _Mathematica_ , just using standard algorithms. I have this picture: ![Block of text](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ta5wf.png) I'd like to apply the following steps:   1. Finding the cells of the picture: Could one use a voronoi algorithm to recognize the grid in the picture? After having the cells I'd like to apply these steps to each:   1. Use `Thinning` to find the skeleton of the character.   2. Use `EditDistance` to compare the character to a skeletized version of every possible character and then select the character which is closest. I have seen in the documentation that _Mathematica_ has all these algorithms I am just not sure whether it would actually be feasible to do what I want. (If it's impossible to do without knowing the name of the font I used: It's "Osaka, Regular-Mono, 144 pt".)
