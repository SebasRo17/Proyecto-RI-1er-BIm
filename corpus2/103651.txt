I am working on a team developing a client-side application. We work in a Linux environment, but the server we work with can only be run from a Windows environment. As such, each developer is being set up with a virtual machine, running on Oracle VM Virtual Box. Would it violate the terms of use or licensing for the developers to use the virtual hard drive from Windows XP Mode with Oracle VM Virtual Box?
