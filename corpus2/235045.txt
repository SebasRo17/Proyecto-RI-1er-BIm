I am very confused about white box testing. A simplified version of the example: the entire system consists of three methods - `methodA()`, `methodB()`, `methodC()`. The program starts from `methodA()`, and `methodB()` requires input from `methodA()` and `methodC()` requires input from methodB(). Do we create 3 white box tests, one for each method, or do we create one white box test for the entire system?
