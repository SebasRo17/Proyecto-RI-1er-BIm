When plotting in _Mathematica_ I just got some "dark artifacts". Here is my code:               Plot3D[Exp[-100 x^2], {x, -5, 5}, {p, -5, 5}, PlotRange -> All, PlotPoints -> {100, 100}]      and the result is![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gRQdL.png) (I know that the `3D` is useless here, but I minimized my actual code to the relevant problem). I have the feeling that it has something to do with the precision, when there is the transition from `10^-200` or so to `0` but increasing the `WorkingPrecision` didn't change anything.   I tried plotting in `2D` from `x = 2.3` and there is still an exponential function with value `10^-175` to see. When I plot from `3` to `4` (which is after the dark artifact line) then the `2D` `Plot` says just zero. I don't need to caluculate with super high precision, I just want to get rid of those dark strips.   I also tried to look for similar questions but couldnt find one, perhaps because I don't really know if artifacts is the right word.
