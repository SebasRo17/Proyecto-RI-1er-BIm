I have a file containing isosurface $\\{x,y,z,F\\}$ data (around 9000 points). My goal is to generate a **smooth** (NOT a discrete set of points!) colored surface using `ListContourPlot3D`, i.e., something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RWte5.png) More specifically, the surface I am trying to plot is closed. This what I am getting if I plot _x,y,z_ : ![surface](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tri2J.png) Now, I want to add color on top, i.e., I want different regions of the surface to be colored differently depending _F_. I am using `ListContourPlot3D`, because according to the description this what I need: > `ListContourPlot3D` linearly interpolates values to give smooth contours Any hints? So far all my attempts have been unsuccessful. This is what I am getting with `ListContourPlot3D[data]`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dBaUP.png) **EDIT:** attached the file. file I want to plot col. 1(x): col.2(y): col.3(z) col4(color)
