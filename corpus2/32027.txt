Sometimes I have very long and complicated equations, when I evaulate the equations for example taking derivative or integral there will be several conditions with the answer. My question is that; is there any way that I enter the conditions at the begining of the program so that so that it will not appear in the evaluation result? I will give a simple example:               pdf = x^(L-1)/( γ^L Gamma[L]) Exp[(-x)/γ];     Re[L] > 0;          Integrate[ pdf, {x, 0, γ}]      > >     ConditionalExpression[ (Gamma[L]-Gamma[L,1])/(Gamma[L]),  Re[L] > 0 ] >   in the above example even if I write the condition which is `Re[L] > 0`, it will appear again at the result of evaluation.
