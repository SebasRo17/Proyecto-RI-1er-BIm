I need to change property of window when button gets pressed. There are pretty enough examples on Wolfram's website, but all they bind predefined function "Print[]" and I have no problems with binding Print function. But I can't bind something different. I need call my own function and methods of Widgets.      This is a window whose property I want to change:               widget4 = Widget["TextPanel", {     "preferredSize" ->      Widget["Dimension", {"width" -> 800, "height" -> 660}],     "contentType" -> "text/html",     "editable" -> False, "path" -> html1path}, Name -> "MainOutput"]            functio[]:=(Print["fffff"]);      This is my button:               html2path="some text which I want to change";     butto = Widget["Button", {     "Text" -> "Update",     BindEvent["Action",     Script[    {SetPropertyValue[{"MainOutput", "path"}, html2path] ,        Print["fdfdf"], ref@InvokeMethod[{"Frame", "getX"}], functio[] } ]]     }]      I launch it all together so:               ref = GUIRun[ Widget["Frame", {widget4, butto}, Name -> "Frame" ]];      As result out of all my tries only function Print["fdfdf"] was called. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9psJb.png) I got stuck with it.   Thanks in advance.
