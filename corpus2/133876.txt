I have been taking Advanced Placement Computer Science for this past year in high school. It seems as though we are taught simply to **memorize** code and functions and **not** how to be resourceful and efficient in using documentation and the like. Practically, I imagine many (if not all) programming jobs would allow you to flip through documentation, review past code and the code of others, essentially doing what my teacher would consider "cheating." While I do agree core concepts are essential to memorize (in any subject matter), it seems superfluous and impractical to me to give a pen-and-paper exam for a CS class, especially when practically you would have a compiler, debugger, reference manuals, and the **entire internet** to refer to in any real-world work situation. **Why is CS taught focusing on the _memorization_ of code and functions as opposed to teaching useful skills including how to use and interpret documentation, sample code, the debugger and such?**
