I am asking this question to save some time and I am expecting answers only from people who have tried something like this before. (I realize that I could just try it and see if it works, but that takes a non-trivial amount of time.) Suppose you wrote a simulation in pure Mathematica. As the simulation progresses, a vector is being periodically updated changed. One could then have a `Dynamic@ListPlot[vector]` and watch the progress "live". Now the question is: is this possible when using LibraryLink? With LibraryLink it's possible to access a kernel variable (`vector`) directly. Is it possible to get the system to register the changes to that variable and to run the `Dynamic` when necessary? Or is there an alternative _simple_ (low effort) way to achieve the same, i.e. use Mathematica to visualize a simulation "live"? One way I see that certainly work is periodically calling back to the kernel through a MathLink connection and setting a variable through Mma code, which contains the information to be visualized. Is there a simpler/better way?
