I am trying to solve the following system of two equations for x and y. The solutions for x and y have to be positive and the parameters s and c are positive (to have a coherent interpretation of my problem). Could anyone please help me?               eq1 := (2 + 12*s)/(9*x^2) + (4*Sqrt[2*s])/(9*x^2*y) - (4*Sqrt[2*s])/( 9*x^3) - k          eq2 := (1 + 3*Sqrt[2*s] - 6*s)/(9*y^2) + (2*Sqrt[2*s])/(9*y^2*x) - (2*Sqrt[2*s])/(9*y^3) - k          Solve[{eq1 == 0, eq2 == 0}, {x, y}, Positive]
