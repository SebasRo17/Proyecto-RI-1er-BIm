I have the following problem in _Mathematica_ 9 on Linux. I let _Mathematica_ compute the `Series` expansion:               Block[{$Assumptions = {r, p}\[Element] Reals},            Series[Log[r^2 - Sqrt[r^4 + p^2]], {p, 0, 0}]     ]      But the output is a rather disappointing naked infinity:               Log[r^2 - Sqrt[r^4]] + O[p]^1      Similarly, for:               Block[{$Assumptions = {p, r} \[Element] Reals},            Series[1/(r^2 - Sqrt[r^4 + p^2]), {p, 0, 0}]     ]      I get:               1/(r^2 - Sqrt[r^4]) + O[p]^1      Why is _Mathematica_ handing me naked infinities like that, even though I specified that the computation is to be carried out in the real numbers? What do I do wrong? How can I avoid this? EDIT: To make my point more clear, I would expect the Series to give results like $$\log(c_1 p^2)+O(p^1)$$ and $$\frac{1}{c_2 p^2}+O(p^1)$$ as a regulated infinity, instead of $\log(0)$ and $\frac{1}{0}$.
