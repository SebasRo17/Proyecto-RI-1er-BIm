I currently have a large number of time-series datasets in the form where the name and time-series transposed data, so I have a list of lists of names for datasets and their time-dependant data. The _end goal_ is to graph a plot which **I already have as I want it by itself,** only with a **legend** that is, with other graphics, **finished as well.** Within this expression for `myPlot` I am able to generate the labels I need via inserting an `Epilog` expression, producing `SetAttributes[tt, Listable] tt[name_ -> data_] := Tooltip[data, name]` _(Just for manipulation)_ (1) `myPlot = ListLogLinearPlot[#, Epilog -> Table[Inset[Framed[DisplayForm[names[[i]]], RoundingRadius -> 5, Background -> White], {5.5, 25}], {i, len}]]` (2) `myPlot /@ tt[thirds@ruleData] // Column` which together yield a plot with unmovable labels for each dataset ((2) actually yields the plots with or without Epilog / labels, as specified by (1), whereas (1) alone unsquelched yields itself back in text-only output). But I am unable to combine these expressions with `DynamicModule` as another post on the Stack Forums suggests. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7221315/how-do-i-label-different-curves-in- mathematica However, on top of a dummy graphic (table "pos" rather than plot) **I can get`DynamicModule` to have movable labels:** `DynamicModule[{pos = Table[{names[[i]]}, {i, len}]}, LocatorPane[Dynamic[pos], Appearance -> Table[Framed[Text@TraditionalForm[names[[i]]], RoundingRadius -> 5,Background -> White], {i, len}]]]` So, I would think the only problem then is figuring out how to "insert" the `myPlot` function(s) into `DynamicModule`. I am almost certain the presence of the `#` in my `ListLogLinearPlot` function is the culprit. I need to combine these expressions labels are movable ON the graph just as they are on the dummy table. Thank you again, I deeply appreciate any resposnes.
