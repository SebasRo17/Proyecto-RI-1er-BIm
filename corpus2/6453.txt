On my hardware I have a CUDA enabled video card an ASUS GTX460, yet Mathematica does not seem to recognize this. I have:   * CUDA Toolkit 4.1   * CUDA SDK 4.0    * NVIDIA Driver 295.49 on Sabayon Linux 64 bit with Mathematica 8.0.0. For example, following the CUDALink Setup, I get               Needs["CUDALink`"]     CUDAQ[](* False *)     CUDADriverVersion[] (* CUDADriverVersion::nodriv message raised. *)      The NVIDIA command `/opt/cuda/sdk/C/bin/linux/release/deviceQuery` finds the card and reports "passed" as well as listing the card capabilities. Examples from /opt/cuda/sdk/C/bin/linux/release directory, such as `smokeParticles`, `scan`, `randomFog`, run well. The relevant shell variables are set as follows: `export CUDA_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/libcuda.so` `export NVIDIA_DRIVER_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/opengl/nvidia/lib/libnvidia- tls.so.*` **Additional Information** _Supported Hardware_ The Wolfram CUDA reference page CUDA Reference does not explicitly list the GTX 460 GPU. It does list the GTX 460M, the mobile version, and a mysterious GTS 460. The Wolfram linked NVIDIA CUDA GPUs lists the popular GTX 460 but has no entry at all for the GTS 460. Perhaps this is a typo in the Wolfram documentation, as it would seem unlikely that they wouldn't support a commonplace NVIDIA GPU whilst supporting a seemingly non-existent GPU. If this isn't the case - I'm clearly stuck. **Problems finding the NVIDIA driver** Some poking around suggests that one sticking point is that               GPUTools`Internal`$NVIDIADriverLibraryVersion      is set to `$Failed`. Would anyone know where this is set? From trying to `Trace` `CUDADriverVersion` it isn't obvious to me where things go wrong. How do I convince Mathematica that my card supports CUDA?
