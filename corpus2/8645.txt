Suppose that I have two plots, `plot1` and `plot2`. The plots have different ranges and different axes. Here is a fictitious example that makes no scientific sense, but demonstrates my issue with the size of framed plots:               imgSize = 475;          plot1 = Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 1}, Frame -> True,         FrameLabel -> {"x (nm)", "y (nm)"},         BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", 20}, ImageSize -> imgSize];          plot2 = Plot[x^2, {x, -10, 10}, PlotRange -> {-10, 1000},         Frame -> True,         FrameLabel -> {"\!\(\*SuperscriptBox[SubscriptBox[\"x\", \"a\"], \     \"2\"]\) (\!\(\*SuperscriptBox[\"nm\", \"2\"]\))",           "\!\(\*SuperscriptBox[SubscriptBox[\"y\", \"b\"], \"2\"]\) (\!\(\     \*SuperscriptBox[\"nm\", \"2\"]\))"},         BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", 20}, ImageSize -> imgSize];          Grid[{{plot1, plot2}}]      I get this output: ![plotsize](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZRD9n.gif) Notice that `plot1` and `plot2` are not really the same size -- in terms of the size of the outer frame of each. In particular, the outer frame of `plot1` has greater height than that of `plot2`. In addition, I think that the outer frame of `plot1` has greater width than that of `plot2`. I think this is because of the different ranges and different axis labels of the two plots. Observed separately, one probably could not discern a difference in size between `plot1` and `plot2`. But when they are next to each other, as in a `Grid`, `plot1` looks noticeably "larger" than `plot2`. This would look rather poor in a publication, like an article in a scientific journal. Is there any way that I can make the outer frames the same size, such that the plots look like they are the same size?
