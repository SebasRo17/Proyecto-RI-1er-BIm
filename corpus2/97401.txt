I am using Microsoft's free tool Visual Basic 2010 Express (downloaded from here ) to develop a desktop application with database features using Microsoft access as the database. Connectivity is being done by OleDbConnection. The software is now complete. I am planning to sell it for money. The software is going to cost 400$ to end customers. How much and where should I pay money to Microsoft?
