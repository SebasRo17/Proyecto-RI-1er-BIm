Most BST examples show a sample of a BST with unique values; mainly to demonstrate the order of values. e.g. values in the left subtree are smaller than the root, and values in the right subtree are larger. Is this because BSTs are normally just used to represents SETs ? If I insert an element say 4 which already exists in the BST, what should happen ? e.g. In my case, 4 is associated with a payload. Does it mean I override the existing node's payload.
