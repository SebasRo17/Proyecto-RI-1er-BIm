I have an array of lists and want to correlate every list with each other like this:               Table[Table[Correlation[list[[y]], list[[x]]], {x, 1, Length[list]}], {y,1, Length[list]}];      I take the first list and correlate it with all others asf. I pretty much assume, this is not a very elegant and efficient code, so I wanted to ask for some alternatives. How would you guys do it?
