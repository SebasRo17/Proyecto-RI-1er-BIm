I have a peculiar problem. My application has different levels of authentication. One specific level of user (super user) needs to be able to use the application as another user (subordinate user) that has lower privileges. We decided that when the super user selects to be a subordinate user then another tab in the browser will be opened and will load the subordinate user's privileges and their respective cookie. The problem we have is: **how can we get the reference for the new cookie in this new tab?** Also the super user will be able to open multiple tabs and each tab need to reference its own cookie.
