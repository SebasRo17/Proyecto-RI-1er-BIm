From the documentation of `Part`: > `Part[expr,i,j,...]` is equivalent to `expr[[i]][[j]]...` So I would expect that, if `t = Table[i + 3 j, {j, 0, 2}, {i, 1, 3}]`, i.e. t = $\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3\\\4&5&6\\\7&8&9\end{pmatrix}$,               t[[1;;2]][[1]]     (* {1, 2, 3} *)       would be equivalent to               Part[t, 1 ;; 2, 1]     (* {1, 4} *)      but it's not...
