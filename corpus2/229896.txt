For a while now I've been in the habit of differentiating different kinds of comments in my code.               //this is an explanatory comment          //!this line was commented out for debug purposes, DO NOT SHIP WITH THIS COMMENT IN PLACE          //?this code was tested, and executed properly in 2.3 uS      This has saved me a lot of trouble, as I can quickly differentiate between debug comments and explanatory comments. It's especially nice to be sure that all my debug comments are gone, and none were accidentally left in place before publishing my code. Is this a common practice? If so, is there a standard way of differentiating comments? Or are there perhaps better ways of achieving what I'm trying to achieve?
