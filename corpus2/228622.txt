I have to write software project documentation for an application which will support both iOS and Android. Each platform has its specific features and the mobile app design and requirements are almost the same. At first, I thought to include all the requirements in one document by separating the platforms side-by-side. However, why should android devs see the iOS dev part and vice-versa? Should I write the document separately for each platform or include it in one document? Which one is good for QAs and for the overall professionalism of the software requirement specification ?
