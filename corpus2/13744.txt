Following some of the questions here on _Mathematica_ Stack Exchange, I am trying to export an image that contains a rasterized object and vector- graphics axes. Here is an example:               myArray = Table[{x, y, RandomReal[]}, {x, 0, 100}, {y, 0, 100}];          size = 500;          myImage =       ListDensityPlot[Flatten[myArray, 1], Mesh -> 20,        ColorFunction -> "AvocadoColors", PerformanceGoal -> "Quality",        FrameLabel -> {"\[Mu]", "C"}, FrameStyle -> Directive[14],        ImageSize -> size];          img = Rasterize[Show[myImage, Frame -> None], ImageResolution -> 100,         ImageSize -> size];          g = Graphics[       Inset[img, Scaled[{0.5, 0.5}], {Center, Center}, size],        AbsoluteOptions[myImage]]      Here is the result:: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rV92A.png) You can notice, if you compare with the original image, that the scaling of the inserted object is not correct. Now two my questions:   1. How to figure out the size of the object that I insert automatically. Here, if I replace `size` with `0.21 size` I will get a correct image. Why is 0.21?   2. Why the size of ticks and numbering does not coincide with the original image and how to fix it?
