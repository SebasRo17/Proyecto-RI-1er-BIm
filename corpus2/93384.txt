I'm a top-notch programmer, but a notoriously bad interviewee. I've flunked 3 interviews consecutively because I get so nervous that my voice tightens at least 2 octaves higher and I start visibly shaking -- mind you, I can handle whatever technical questions the interviewer throws at me in that state, but I think it looks bad to come off as a quivering, squeaky-voiced young woman during a job interview. I've just got the personality type of a shy computer programmer. No matter how technical I am, I'm going to get passed up in favor of a smooth talker. I have another interview coming up shortly, and I want to really impress the company. Here are my trouble spots:   1. **What can I do to be less nervous during my interview?** I always get really excited when I hear I have a face-to-face interview, but get more and more anxious as the interview approaches.   2. **How long or short should I keep my answers?** Interviewers want me to explain what I used to do at my prior employment, but I'm a very chatty person and tend to talk/squeak for 10 minutes at a time.    3. **What exactly is my interviewer looking for when asking about prior jobs?**   4. During the interview, I'll be asked if I have any questions for the interviewer. I _should_ , but **what kinds of questions should I ask to show that I'm interested in being employed?**   5. **How can I sugarcoat "I want to make more money" into something that sounds nicer?** Interviewers always ask why I'm looking for a new job. The real reason is that my current salary isn't that great, and I want to make more money: otherwise the work environment is fine.   6. I have only one prior programmer job, and I've worked there for 18 months, but I have the skill of someone with 4 to 6 years of experience. **What can I say to compete against applicants with more work experience?**
