On software company websites I visit the first time, I often open the "Contact us" page and try to submit the contact form with all fields empty. I am just curios if they validate the user input. If it is just submitted or only validated poorly (e.g. only Javascript validation), I often hear myself thinking > Oh, look how sloppy they are! Can't even validate user input. That calls > itself a software company? No, I don't think I want to buy any software > services of them. A friend of mine has such a "sloppy" contact form. You can submit a completely empty form. I asked him why he does not validate user input, and he said: > Look, I want that customers can contact me. They should enter any > information they want. If they only want to enter a message and leave the > other fields empty, why should I care? They enter the relevant information > anyway. I do not want to add any barriers when contacting me. I did not ask him how many empty messages he gets, though. However, what is the better option now? Both arguments (check how company handles user input vs. not adding any barriers in contacting) seem to make sense for me. I want that the user can easily contact me, but still has the impression that I am precise when programming webpages.
