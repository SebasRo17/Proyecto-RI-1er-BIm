I have a `Panel` of size {850, 400} as `myPanel` with a `Pane` of size {450, 400} and four images assigned to `forwardPicture`, `backwardPicture`, `picture1` and `picture2`.               forwardPicture=      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HHkQ6.png)               backwardPicture=      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FtXrg.png)               picture1=      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KldtQ.jpg)               picture2=      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iPCyJ.jpg) Both `picture1` and `picture2` are of size {400, 400},               myPanel = Panel[Row[{picture1, picture2}], ImageSize -> {850, 400}];          Row[{       MouseAppearance[EventHandler[         Framed[backwardPicture,           FrameStyle -> None], {"MouseClicked" :> ""}], "LinkHand"],       Pane[myPanel, ImageSize -> {450, 400}, Scrollbars -> None],        MouseAppearance[EventHandler[         Framed[forwardPicture,           FrameStyle -> None], {"MouseClicked" :> ""}], "LinkHand"]       }]      After evaluation, I get this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FnBk1.png) I want to move the images from right to left within the `Pane` whenever `forwardPicture` is pressed, and move them from left to right whenever `backwardPicture` is pressed. I don't want any scrollbars in the `Pane`. I don't want to move the images at one click: I want to move them a little bit for every click, until the full image is displayed. Can anybody help me?
