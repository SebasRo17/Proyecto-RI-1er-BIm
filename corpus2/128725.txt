> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to improve the quality of app descriptions I've just finished writing an iPhone app, and I've completed everything on my app store submission checklist except the description. Has anyone got any advice on how to write a really catchy description that's likely to get users interested?   * What things are important to include in the description?   * What _not_ to include? I really have no experience with this, as this is the first app I'll ever release to the store.
