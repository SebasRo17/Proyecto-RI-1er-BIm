My company is a small twenty-man engineering firm. All the application programming here is done in VB6 by two people, who have taught themselves VB6 from an assembly background while working here for the past 25+ years, and myself. As a result, the VB6 code is riddled with horrendous code smells, like tons of stringly typed variables, terribly long functions, hundreds of public global variables (some of which are preferred over passing around arguments and returning values,) and not a single object class. Refactoring is nigh impossible, and any changes require too much digging through code, and once made, always seem to introduce more holes. My boss is realizing that VB6 is a dead technology, and is willing to listen to my pleas of moving to .NET for new development. We are moving forward to .NET, but he sees it as a way to keep up compatability with the newer Windows OS's, not as a way to write better code. How can I best explain the benefits of .NET language over VB6, beyond mere up- to-date-ness? What can I say to best emphasize that the move to .NET is a good move _but also_ that it means our current programming paradigm should also begin to change? As soon as my boss hears that Visual Basic .NET looks just like VB6, I know that his first instinct will be to simply convert our old code mess to .NET. I understand that it will be impossible to change anyone's mindset in a single afternoon, but how can I at least convince my assembly-toting boss that things like strongly-typed variables, custom classes, and private fields aren't a _total_ waste of time and energy?
