I'm looking to write a program that will generate valid sudoku puzzles. Essentially, a sudoku puzzle is just an 81 digit number. (The blanks are zeroes.) I would then like to use these puzzles in an Android app. Is there any risk to using randomly generated puzzles in an app? If another app has the same puzzle, am I infringing somehow? All computer data is numbers, so theoretically a random number generator could stumble upon a copyrighted work at some point.
