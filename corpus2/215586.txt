I am primarily a Java programmer. Because of its OO principles and the general paradigm of Java programming, like wrapping things in static variables, and having things return specific types, heavily aids me in "visualizing" a program. Instead of thinking of a big program, I can, instead, focus on smaller organized parts of my eventual program, and add functionality and build up from there. Thus, I have trouble programming in other languages. Or at least, I have not been able to program in the same ability as I do in Java compared to other languages. I know Javascript has OO principles, so I'd like to learn this language in a OO-based like I would program with Java. Is this possible?
