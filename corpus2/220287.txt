We have a bunch of data about our customers and we'd like to learn more about it. Writing queries to pull data out is not a problem, and we're doing that right now, but we'd like to take it to the next level. I keep hearing about BI, data analysis, regression, predictive analysis, etc. So, if we want to glean more information from our data, where should we start? Should we look into a BI tool? Should we just start learning about data analysis? Or maybe look into R? Any books you would recommend to start? Should I go back to school (college level math, but nothing fancy -- willing to learn)? Any online courses you recommend? Ultimately we would like to end up with more intelligent filters that would allow us to seep through our data more efficiently. Something like "only include people outside of cities in state X and Y because Z and Q". Thank you for any suggestions you may have. **EDIT** : Per JeffO's request. It's not necessarily about tools. More like: What should be the next step in learning more about our data, about the relationships within our data that we may not know about? Or where should we start exploring things like regression or predictive analysis?
