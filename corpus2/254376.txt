I want to make a solution to find the optimum route of school visit. For example, I want to visit 5 schools (A, B, C, D, E) in my city. Given the choice of five routes regarding what school I should visit first, then the second, then the third etc., how do I calculate the efficiency of each route with distance, time, and cost criteria? Once I've done this, how do I use my calculations (distance with time and cost fuel usage) in a genetic algorithm to find the optimum route?
