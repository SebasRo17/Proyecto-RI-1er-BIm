With following code I am trying to show the mean wind speed patterns for a few geographic locations.               cords = Select[                 Reverse[CityData[#, "Coordinates"]] & /@ {"Oslo", "Vadso","Hammerfest"},                 Head@# == List &             ];      ListContourPlot[       Join @@ {#,List@WeatherData[#,                                   "MeanWindSpeed",                                    {{2013, 1, 25}, {2013, 5, 1}, "Day"}                       ][[1,2]]} & /@ cords     ]      How can I improve the code to solve following problems:   1. Even if the requested date window is wider (a few days), it only takes one day data from `WeatherData` and when I am changing the partitioning part to `[[All,2]]` the plot doesn't work and says the format it wrong.   2. For even wider data range (a few years), there are some missing data for some days. How can I also filter that bad data in the code? Remember, I need them exactly on the geographic location no matter how wide my data range is.
