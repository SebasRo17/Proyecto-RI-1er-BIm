I am authoring a IDE for the Lua language. I find that many programmers do not like to use IDE and prefer VIM (which is in vogue at the moment), SCiTE, or . In trying to win some mind-share I am interested in what features an IDE could provide that would make it a compelling alternative to a general purpose editor. Is there a "killer-app" so to speak for an IDE that would make it a "must- have"? This could be thought of as the reverse of Most useful features of VIM that aren't standard in a IDE I won't link to my IDE unless someone asks - but you can pretty much just Google my name and find it. EDIT: My IDE is actually a language plugin for an existing IDE, so I do inherit many features from the host IDE - at some level though my language support is an IDE in and of itself - at least as far as the language specific aspects are concerned.
