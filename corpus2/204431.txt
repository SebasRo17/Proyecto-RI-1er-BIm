Mushroom cultivation requires fairly precise chemical composition of substrate (a.k.a. growing medium). Let's pretend we're growing shitakes and that this is the required composition of their substrate:               Nitrogen | Benzene | Toluene | Dioxygen Diflouride     5%       | 5%      | 10%     | 80%      We want to create an appropriate substrate from materials we have on hand which we know the chemical composition of.               Material | Nitrogen | Benzene | Toluene | Dioxygen Diflouride     apples   | 5%       | 0%      | 5%      | 90%     oranges  | 20%      | 20%     | 50%     | 10%     Etc...      How does one calculate this? It reminds me of solving matrices in high school. Is this something that can be done with matrices? What is this problem called? What do I need to know to solve it?
