I'm tidying up my company's Version Control Guidelines. One of my tasks is to determine how solutions should be organized in a very broad sense. I have somewhat come to my own conclusion that one broad requirement to document is that, for the most part, CSProj/VBProj projects should live on their own all at the same level in a branch. However, there are a measureable number of projects that aren't independent, and are tightly coupled to another. For instance, a Unit Testing project has no business by itself since it only exists in support of one other project. So it can (and should) be directly added to a solution with the project it supports. Same with an individual UI who's sole existence is to test one project. Or an implementation test project... and probably similar examples. So my goal is to mandate, in a way, that projects should not be added directly to a solution except in such examples. **Disclaimer** I'm not saying that one application cannot have a solution with multiple projects having been "Add Existing Project" to the solution. But in those cases, each of those projects should be addable/removable because they exist all at the same level of a namespace or folder organization. This would be easiest if there was some documentation I could find with a history of better wording. But any searches I do just end up with How-To tutorials to add projects to a solution. There are no Best Practies that get into this.
