In _Mathematica_ versions < 8, the FrontEnd has a very intelligent behavior:   * On evaluation, it by default automatically scrolls down the Notebook window to the last printed Output cell but also allows a user to scroll the Notebook window up by hand and then does not scroll down the window again automatically.   * If the user wishes to restore automatic scrolling it is sufficient to scroll down the window to the last currently printed Output cell and automatic scrolling will be restored. I feel such behavior very comfortable. But in _Mathematica_ 8 we have no such behavior by default. I found that it may be partially restored by setting               SetOptions[$FrontEnd,       EvaluationCompletionAction -> {"ScrollToOutput"}]      But then it is not possible to stop automatic scrolling by scrolling the window by hands. It is possible to restore the old scrolling behavion?
