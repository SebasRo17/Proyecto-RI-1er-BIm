I am new to Mathematica, and I'm not sure how to solve a system of equations that include differentiation. Given that f and g are differentiable functions:               f(x) < 0 for all x       g(5) = 2       h(x) = f(x) / g(x)       h'(x) = f'(x) / g(x)       Then g(x) = ?      (The answer is 2) I didn't expect it to work, but I tried this:               DSolve[{f[x] < 0, g[5] = 2, h[x] == f[x]/g[x], h'[x] = f'[x]/g[x]}, g[x], x]      And of course it didn't work. How would I do this?
