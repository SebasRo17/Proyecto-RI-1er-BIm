I'm working on a multi-player Android game (very simple it is that it doesn't have any game-engine used). The game is based on Java `Socket`. Four devices will connect the game server and a new thread will manage their session. The game server will server many such sessions (having 4 players each). What I'm worried about is the testing of this game. I know it is possible to run multiple android emulators, but my development laptop is very limited in capabilities (3 GB RAM, 2 Ghz Intel Core2Duo and on-board Graphics). And I'm already using Ubuntu to develop the game so that I have more user memory available than I'd have with Windows. Hence, the laptop will burn-to-death on running 4 emulator instances. I don't have access to any android device, neither I have another machine with higher configuration. And I still have to develop and test this game. **P.S. :** I'm a CS student, and currently don't work anywhere, and this game is college project, so if there are any paid solutions, I cannot afford it. What can I do to test the app seamlessly? ability to test even only 4 clients (i.e. only 1 session) would suffice, its alright if I can't simulate real environment with some 10-20 active game sessions (having 4 players each).
