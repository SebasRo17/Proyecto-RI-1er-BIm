Is there a pattern or standard way to handle Ajax race conditions? Take the following example. You have two tables. Clicking a row on table 1 removes the data from DB and then updates table 2 (which would now be showing all the rows of table 1 less the row that was clicked). If someone where to click a bunch of rows in fast succession you could get a scenario where table 2 doesn't update for all the clicks do to timing/lag issues. What might be a good way to approach this? I was thinking of using a possible queue but that kind of defeats the purpose of doing it asynchronously. However I would still have the benefit of the UI not locking.
