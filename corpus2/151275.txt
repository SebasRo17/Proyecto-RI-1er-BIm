As we all know a programmer just needs a computer and a network connection. When these things are available at your disposal you can program anywhere in the world.   Now this is causing me a bit of problems. Since its not necessary to work at your workplace only you are asked anytime of your vacation or week-off to help out the client on reported bug.   Also if you do enjoy doing it at your pass time, any one seeing you stare at the computer may treat you workaholic which I don't enjoy.   How do you make them realize that its not just about the work.It can be a hobby also.   In my understanding a workaholic is a person who _works to earn_ but an enthusiast is the one who _works to learn_.
