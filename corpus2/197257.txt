I use eclipse for coding, and the language which we use is Java. Once it was suggested by someone that to properly format the code, using the auto formatter(CTRL+SHIFT+F) While this command does format the code, but sometimes I feel that overall look becomes weird, and it is not actually very readable. So is this a recommended thing to do? If not what is the better of formatting our code in eclipse ?
