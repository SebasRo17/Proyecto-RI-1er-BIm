This page on W|A shows a nice substitution rule to draw kites and darts. I'd like to implement the rule in _Mathematica_ , so I've drawn the original kite and its replacement (separately). I've also drawn the original dart and its replacement. This seems like a job for `Replace[]`, but I'm not sure how. I know there are similar animations on Demonstrations, but I'd like to create my own (with help!). In my mind, this would be cool as a `Manipulate[]` environment, where the slider controls the number of times the replacement has occurred. Maybe even a rotation slider, too, so the kites and darts tile space in a particular direction. Thanks!
