I am currently handling a big list which has the following dimension: `{6, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 8}` where the last number `8` represent a number of equation that are in each sublist. If I apply solve to the 7 level               Ssols = Map[Flatten[Solve[#, vars]] &,SSEquations, {7}]      I get a list in which               Dimensions[Ssols]     Dimensions[Ssols[[1]]]      > {1}   >  {6, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1} so until now it seems fine, even if I don't understand this wrapping that comes out with another List containing the previous one. But then things get compplicated               SCSystem =        Outer[# && #2 && #3 && #4 && #5 &, Eq1, Eq4, Eq5, Eq6, Eq8, {2}]        /.SCEq1 /. SCEq4 /. SCEq5 /. SCEq6 /. SCEq8 // MatrixForm;     Dimensions[SCSystem[[1]]]      > {6, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1} where: `EqX = {IX,IIX, etc}` and `SCEqX ={IX->a+b<c,etc.}` or similar inequalities Now if I apply a `FullSimplify` to get which one of this set of inequalities is `True` and which one is not, and also geting a simplified form of the set of inequalities                SCsols = ParallelMap[FullSimplify[#] &, SCSystem, {7}] //MatrixForm      I get something really strange               Dimensions[SCsols[[1]]]     Dimensions[SCsols[[1, 1]]]      > {1}   >  {6, 3, 4, 2, 2, 1} How this is possible? Do you have any suggestions? And moreover I would like to go and substitute for each level 6 of `Ssols` the corresponding value in `SCsols` and I thought to do in the following way:               SCsolsSub =        Parallelize[Outer[#1 /. #2 &, SCsols, Ssols],{6}] // MatrixForm      but doesn't work probalby because the two list have not the same dimensions.
