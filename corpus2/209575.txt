If I talk about openERP its and source (AGPL-3), I have studied it, but can't find some question e.g 1: we have developed a School Management System using openERP Version 7.0, as according to my understanding, we cannot sale it to any customer as it appears to be free like other modules of openERP. So I should charge my client for my services? what should be the criteria for that? OR still there is a chance that I can sell my newly developed module?
