Version 9. When writing               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, -2 Pi, 2 Pi},       PlotLegends -> Placed[TraditionalForm /@ {Sin[x], Cos[x]}, Right]]      The result is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WBBuW.png) Now I'd like to put the legend below the plot, but at the same time keep them looking the same way. i.e. `sin(x)` on top and `cos(x)` below. I do not want them to flatten. But when I do               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, -2 Pi, 2 Pi},       PlotLegends -> Placed[TraditionalForm /@ {Sin[x], Cos[x]}, Bottom]]      The result is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wd2Jb.png) I can't use Grid or such to format these myself in the way I like them, since if I do, then `PlotLegend` will not see them any more. i.e. I can't just write something like               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, -2 Pi, 2 Pi},       PlotLegends -> Placed[ Column[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}], Bottom]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ilC2T.png) Any one knows of a trick to do this? I looked at options for PlotLegend but do not see anything right away.
