I manage to create a circle inside triangle with this code, but circle inside other polygons are not maximum size:               var p1 = board.create("point", [0.0, 2.0]);     var p2 = board.create("point", [2.0, 1.0]);          //var pol = board.create("regularpolygon", [p1, p2, 3]);     var pol = board.create("regularpolygon", [p1, p2, 4]);     //var pol = board.create("regularpolygon", [p1, p2, 5]);          board.create("incircle", pol.vertices);      What is the easiest way to draw a maximum circle inside square and pentagon? How about smallest circle around the polygon?
