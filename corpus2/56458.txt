I have the following equations and settings:               Clear[koff]; koff = 5.*10^-5;     Clear[kon]; kon = 1.*10^4;     Clear[koff2]; koff2 = 1.*10^-5;     Clear[kon2]; kon2 = 1.*10^4;     Clear[kcg]; kcg = 1.2*10^-5;     Clear[ndsolKRH];     ndsolKRH =       NDSolve[{           D[ag[t], t] == -kon2*ag[t]*b[t] + koff2*cg[t] - kcg ag[t],            D[a[t], t] == -kon*a[t]*b[t] + koff*c[t],            D[cg[t], t] == kon2*ag[t]*b[t] - koff2*cg[t],            D[c[t], t] == kon*a[t]*b[t] - koff*c[t],            D[b[t], t] == -kon2*ag[t]*b[t] - kon*a[t]*b[t] + koff2*cg[t] + koff*c[t],           ag[0] == 450. 10^-9, a[0] == 90.247 10^-9, cg[0] == 0,            c[0] == 473.75 10^-9, b[0] == 26.25 10^-9},         {ag, a, b, c, cg},         {t, 0, 1200000}][[1]];      I would like to get a table of individual numbers for cg and ag. I would also lime to be able to plot these variables vs time. At present I can do it one at a time but there must be a lot easier way. I am doing the following:               Clear[solKRHfix]; solKRHfix = ag /. ndsolKRH;      AND THEN:               solKRHfix[600000]
