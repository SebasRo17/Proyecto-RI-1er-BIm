Is an ID field is always needed in database tables? In my case I have a user with `firstName`, `lastName` and `email` fields. `email` is unique and not null, so it could be used as an ID, right? So in that case, could/should I try to remove the ID? Also I want to have another table which extends this one. Let's say its called patient and it has it's own field `additionalData` and I would like to link the relationship through the email of user I mentioned. So the relationship should be 1 to 1, right? and I wouldn't need the IDs? Somehow MySQL Workbench wants me to use the IDs. What do you guys think. Any suggestions on this topic?
