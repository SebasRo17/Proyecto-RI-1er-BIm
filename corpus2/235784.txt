I use child pop ups extensively in my browser based web application. Examples include using child to search for information which is passed back down to parent form that is updated or I use child to update recordset information which then updates and refreshes parent. Current code has been working great in IE for years and until latest Chrome update (version 34.0.1847.116) it was working in Chrome too. Now it doesn't. From what I have read, it appears Chrome is specifically disallowing the ability to pass focus back to the parent from child. I cannot understand why this is the case. Its simple, intuitve and easy. Can someone shed light on this please? And what are the thoughts regarding using parent child in this way as a method? Hope I have made myself clear :) Thanks in advance.
