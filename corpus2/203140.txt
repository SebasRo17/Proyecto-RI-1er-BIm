There is a remote csv file that gets updated every second or so. I need to download it(on a Windows machine) _ONCE_ and always sync local file with the remote one. Obviously, downloading the whole file every time is not an option. I need to download only the changes.(something like rsync, rdiff-backup) I searched quite a bit but could not find how I can do this. I am sort of new to nodejs and am using this app as an opportunity to expand my nodejs skills. Also, I am planning to use nodejs and to package it using node-webkit(https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)
