As from March 2013, Microsoft allows Adobe Flash content to play by default on its immersive Internet Explorer 10: http://redmondmag.com/articles/2013/03/11/new-ie-10-flash-policy.aspx When asked about Silverlight, Microsoft says > Silverlight will not be supported in immersive Internet Explorer 10 since > these capabilities are superseded by the new WinRT API. Does this mean that there are capabilities of Adobe Flash not present in the WinRT API that forced Microsoft to allow Flash? What are these capabilities?
