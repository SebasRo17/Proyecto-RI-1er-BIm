I've started working as a developer fairly recently, having worked as a systems administrator before. My understanding of how a software development team using Agile functions is that the "what we need to implement" communication happens mostly in one direction, from the product owner to the developers. Developers can express their concerns to the product owner about technical debt, but coming up with feature ideas should not be one of their main responsibilities. The company I'm working at has a different view. To them, developers should not only go to the product owners of their own team to suggest feature ideas, but also to the product owners of other teams if they think they have something to contribute to that team's product. The idea is that we're all one big Team <company name>, and all developers should use their expertise to push features they think will be useful. Is such an approach "normal", for lack of a better word? Am I being too passive, should I take the initiative and start pushing ideas to product owners? Conversely, has the company got it completely wrong and I should look for employment elsewhere?
