The famous Arnold's problems (see http://www.math.upenn.edu/Arnold/Arnold- Trivium-1991.pdf ) are aimed at the strong graduate and postgraduate students of the top universities. I find it remarkable that a big part of the Arnold's problems can be solved with CASes. However, I have not seen any satisfactory solution of his problem #8: "How many maxima, minima, and saddle points does the function $ x^4+y^4+z^4+u^4+t^4 $ have on the surface $$ \{x+y+z+u+t=0,x^2+y^2+z^2+u^2+t^2=1,x^3+y^3+z^3+u^3+t^3=c\} ,$$ where $c$ is a real parameter?" Can it be solved with Mathematica?
