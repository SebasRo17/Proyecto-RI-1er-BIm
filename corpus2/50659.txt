I want a function that takes expressions of the following form: `a$x` and converts them to `a[x]`. In particular, consider the following test cases               exp = a$x + b$x$y + a$x[d] + a$x[d$y]      Should become, with some `ToFunctionNotation`:               ToFunctionNotation[exp] == a[x] + b[x][y] + a[x][d] + a[x][d[y]]      Note: I want to keep this as an expression for further processing. I tried using matches with `SymbolName` and string patterns, but couldn't figure it out.
