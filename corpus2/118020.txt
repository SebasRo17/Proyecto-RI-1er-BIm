I am wondering if there are any benefits / risks of (not) putting a licence on test code which mostly consists of unit tests. What do you think? I am particularly interested in licensing under (L)GPL, Apache, MIT and BSD. **EDIT** : The assumption is that non-test code is already published under some licence, but test code is not, so the question is whether to publish it and if so whether to put the same licence on it.
