Here is the opportunity I've been given. I'm currently a freelance web developer and completely self-taught. I have but an NVQ in Business Administration. However, I am passionate and committed to programming and building websites and applications, of which I've been doing for a good 3-4 years. Instead of being offered an interview, I've been offered a day trial for what could turn into a 6 month contract. The pay is good, but I'm more thirsty for the commercial experience. Thing is, I know there are gaps in my knowledge. I lack fundamental programming concepts, I never studied computer science and I use google to find optimal solutions to problems I come across. I feel more experienced programmers in the team will see this almost instantly. But will they sympathize having hopefully been at my level once? I'm thirsty to grow and I've spent a good 15 hours a day working in web development and honing my skills - but they are very particular. I know html, css, javascript, jquery, ajax, php, git...I'm a good developer but I don't think I'm good enough for someone to pay me Â£100/day. The way the trial works is during the first half of the day I am introduced to the team and the different departments. During the second half, in the afternoon, I am given a 'live task', a duty I'd perform if I'd be working there. I already know in advance it has something to do with converting a word document into html using php..it seems like they are trying to bend the language to do something it isn't meant to do, and the first place I'd start is Google to research php libraries. Advice? Should I go even though I know I probably won't make it past the first day and probably embarrass myself, just for the experience? Will this help me grow as a programmer? I don't want to waste people's time. I will still give it my all. Appreciate input from people who have been in similar situations.
