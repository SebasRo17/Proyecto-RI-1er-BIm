I want to use SVG Edit for project. This software is distributed under the Apache 2 license. I've seen that:   * all copies, modified or unmodified, are accompanied by a copy of the licence   * all modifications are clearly marked as being the work of the modifier   * all notices of copyright, trademark and patent rights are reproduced accurately in distributed copies   * the licensee does not use any trademarks that belong to the licensor Do these pertain to the code or should I display the license somewhere in the GUI? The orignal software displays a "powered by SVG Edit", is it ok if I remove this? And most importantly: what is the correct etiquette for doing this? I don't want to be an asshole, but at the same time I want to simplify the UI as much as possible and removing the link will be part of it if it's not considered _rude_.
