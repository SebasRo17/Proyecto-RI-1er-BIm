I'm interested to hear what characters people permit in the various common fields of input forms (barring e-mail...) For example: **Textarea/Messages** : do you allow completely free text, or restrict to alphanumeric and punctuation? I've tried to go the second route, but you always find someone out there that likes using tilde's... **Full name** : do you allow anything, or do you use a regex? **Telephone numbers** : numbers only **Addresses** : alphanumeric, whitespace, hyphens **City/Town names** : alphabet, hyphens, whitespace [NB: edited as requested]
