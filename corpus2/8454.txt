In the `KnotData` package a simple command such as               points = Table[KnotData[{3, 1}, "SpaceCurve"][t], {t, 0, 2 Pi, 0.1}];      will generate a series of points that comprise a knot (here, a trefoil, if successive points are connected). However, the distance between points is not constant; is there a way to generate evenly spaced points? (I.e. evenly spaced arc lengths between points).
