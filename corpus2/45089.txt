A generalization of, for example:               Do[(* stuff *), {x, listx},{y, listy},{z, listz}]        I can almost do this with Table, but I need a way to flatten the outer brackets:               Table[{s, l[s]}, {s, {x, y, z}}]            (* out: {{x, l[x]},{y, l[y]},{z,l[z]}}        But to use this List, I need really to exchange the outerbrackets to simply a sequence. If I append to the end               /.List->Sequence        It will remove all of the brackets and not give the desired result. Similar issues plague               Flatten     FlattenAt[ ,1]        etc. solutions. Is there a good way to do this?
