I have a class derived from `SQLiteOpenHelper` which is all about working with a database, i.e. tables creation, insertions, data selections. All methods which deal with data selection return a `Cursor`. What I really want is to get a list of objects rather than a `cursor`, at the same time I don't want my class to do a lot of things. Is it a good idea to add another class who get selections from a database and construct objects from the selection? Thank you.
