I'm Trying to use Mathematica to symbolically integrate a function with respect to x, y, and z. For some reason, this computation either takes about, 60s and returns the input, or takes many hours and doesn't seem to finish. here is a screenshot of the problem. This is an attempt to integrate the gravitational potential equation over x, y, and z. The constants have been pulled out of the integration in order to try and reduce computation error or time. ![integration of gravitational force](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eJ9ll.png) as you can see, at this moment in time, mathematica has been working for over 20,000 seconds (running about 30% on i7 @ 2.8ghz. I feel like perhaps there is an error in my formatting, because i've run into many problems attempting to perform similar integration. I've used assumptions in past attempts, but they've haven't proved useful. any suggestions?
