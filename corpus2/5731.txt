By fiddling with Vitaliy's solution for a small GUI, I've come accross this particular behaviour of `InputField`:               y = Null;     {InputField[Dynamic[y], String, ContinuousAction -> True],      InputField[Dynamic[y], Boxes, ContinuousAction -> True],      InputField[Dynamic[y], Expression, ContinuousAction -> True],      Dynamic@y}      While the first two fields update correctly as the user interacts with them (updating withouth hitting `Enter` or clicking outside of the `InputField`), the third one does not. Furthermore:               y = Null; x = False;     Column@{       InputField[Dynamic[y, (y = #; x = (# === "123")) &], String, ContinuousAction -> True],       InputField[Dynamic[y, (y = #; x = (# === 123)) &], Boxes, ContinuousAction -> True],       Dynamic@x       }      Typing `123` into the first field immediately yields `True`, but the same action with the second field does not work. Is it a bug or am I missing something?
