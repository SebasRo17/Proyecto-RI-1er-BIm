I defined a compiled function               cf = Compile[{{x, _Integer}, {n, _Integer}},        z = (n^x);         Binomial[n, #]* StirlingS2[x, #] *(#!)/z & /@ Range[x]];      and I want to run this for               n = 300000.0;     x = 186200;     Timing[cf[x, n]]      But I have below warnings/errors:               Join::heads: Heads CurrentValue and List at positions 1 and 2 are expected to be the same.     Join::heads: Heads CurrentValue and List at positions 1 and 2 are expected to be the same.     Join::heads: Heads CurrentValue and List at positions 1 and 2 are expected to be the same.     general:stop : Futher output of Join::heads will be suppressed during this calculation.     CompileFunction::cfse : Compiled expression     949792642757151450284577945707701821742626866813<<1019743>>\     0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 should be a \     machine-size integer.     CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at instruction 2; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation      Can you help me understand what I am doing wrong? Because for this values of `n` and `x` this compile function should be evaluated fast, but it is working very slow.
