I am a PHP developer. I have 1 years of experience in PHP in a middle scale company. now I just realize that there is no top MNC use this technology. So for a better opportunity should I switch technologies and I should learn new technology?   Actually I am worried because I have already learned Zend and Magento... It will get totally wasted if I switch... But I have to think about my career too. :( please suggest Thanks! Richa
