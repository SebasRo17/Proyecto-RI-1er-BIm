I want do get the imaginary part of               Exp[I*t]/(1-Exp[I*t])      I've tried to do this               Im[ComplexExpand[Exp[I*t]/(1-Exp[I*t])]]       but the result still contains               Im[Cos[t]/((1 - Cos[t])^2 + Sin[t]^2) -         Cos[t]^2/((1 - Cos[t])^2 + Sin[t]^2) -         Sin[t]^2/((1 - Cos[t])^2 + Sin[t]^2)]       which in fact is 0 (t is a real variable). How can I convince _Mathematica_ to get rid of this part of the expression?
