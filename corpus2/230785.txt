Whenever I'm doing web development, and a page takes longer than half a second to be generated, I know that somewhere my code is hitting the DB too many times. The normal way to fix this situation is to ask the DB for all the information all at once instead, by doing JOINs and the like. My question is: Why do many database queries make a page slow? There must be considerable overhead to each query, but what is it? **EDIT** : Alright, let's take an example (it's a bit silly and small, but it'll do) `people` table:               | name | football_team_id |      +------+------------------+     | jim  | 1                |     | mike | 3                |     | carl | 2                |      `football_team` table:               | id | color |     +----+-------+     | 1  | red   |     | 2  | blue  |     | 3  | green |      We all know that this is slow:               SELECT name,football_team_id FROM people;     # start rendering the page, realise we need colors     SELECT color FROM football_team WHERE id=1     # oops, need mike's color     SELECT color FROM football_team WHERE id=3     # oh, and carl's     SELECT color FROM football_team WHERE id=2      This is a bit better:               SELECT name,football_team_id FROM people;     SELECT id,color FROM football_team WHERE id IN (1,3,2)      This is best:               SELECT name,football_team_id,color FROM people JOIN football_team ON people.football_team_id=football_team.id      In each example we're getting the same amount of data, but the latter is easily the fastest. You wouldn't expect the same behaviour if you were reading from a file descriptor, for example.
