I want to type in my variable next to its plot and I'm typing the text in using `Inset`. However my variable has superscripts to the left. Say it looks like this: $ \sideset{_a^b}{'}F $ How can I type this in _Mathematica_? Right now I just do `Ctrl``^` and `Ctrl``_` and fill in the super/subscript and then delete the place holder for the regular script. This works for a while but if I correct something else on the plot then it automatically vanishes. Is there a stable and standard way to do this?
