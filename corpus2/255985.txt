Please can someone explain to me how I should go about deciding whether to use expect or should syntax for my rspec examples. From my understanding we should no longer be using the 'should' syntax. The replacement is to use expect().to or is_expected.to Is this correct? On some really good references, it seems to be common practice to still use should. And these references are being updated consistently. Any help in the correct direction would be appreciated.
