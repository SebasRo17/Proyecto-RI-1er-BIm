I have _Mathematica_ 8 on my PC. I also have a new Mac with CDF-player, but not _Mathematica_. I want a `Tooltip` that shows one thing if running on a PC, and something different if running on a Mac. Both of the following show `"MS- Windows"` in the `Tooltip` even when using my Mac.               Tooltip["A String",     If[StringMatchQ[$Version,__~~"Windows"~~__],"MS-Windows",(* else Mac *)"Probably OS X"]     ]          Tooltip["A String",     If[SystemInformation["FrontEnd","MachineType"]==="PC","MS-Windows",(* else Mac *)"Probably OS X"]     ]      It will be even better if it can hande a third case where the OS is neither Windows or OS X. Can you show me how to do it?
