I've just started at a new job this past month and looks like they have NO source control for their code. They are relying on the backups their hosting provider takes for them. After talking a bit I convinced my boss that we should definitely be using source control and after I gave a short seminar on it, the entire team is on board; they loved Mercurial. So right now this is the way we work:               º----------BitBucket     º---------/     º--------/      Myself and the three other developers `hg pull` from BitBucket, make our changes, then `hg push` to BitBucket. Now for deployment, someone would need to FTP the latest files towards the production server. I was thinking of installing Mercurial on our server, and using `hg clone` (subsequently `hg pull`) to keep the versions up to date on production.               º---push->-----BitBucket----<-pull-----º (production server)     º---push->----/     º---push->---/      Is this a good idea? Any potential pitfalls I may not be seeing? Has anybody here done something similar? How do you deploy a large PHP framework application (We're using Moodle)?
