In[1]:= Needs["Utilities`CleanSlate`"]          In[2]:= x := 4          In[3]:= x          Out[3]= 4          In[4]:= CleanSlate[]          During evaluation of In[4]:=   (CleanSlate) Contexts purged: {Global`}          During evaluation of In[4]:=   (CleanSlate) Approximate kernel memory recovered: 0 Kb          Out[0]= {"Utilities`CleanSlate`", "PacletManager`", "QuantityUnits`", \ "WebServices`", "System`", "Global`"}          In[1]:= x          Out[1]= 4      When I use CleanSlate[] the variable x should be cleared from memory right? Why does it still remain afterwards?
