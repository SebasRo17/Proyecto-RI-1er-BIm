I work in a company going through a downsizing process. It is assumed that a lot of "let go" developers jobs will eventually be outsourced. Some of those programmers had some design to do. Is it possible to outsource both design and creation/coding properly? I feel that by outsourcing design, we lose any in-house capability of really "owning" the code. It will be very difficult to maintain. Also we'll have a hard time ensuring a proper development. How can I address those issues?
