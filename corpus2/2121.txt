I am new to Mathematica. I have used the WolframAlpha online calculator to find roots of equations (listed under the heading `Root` in the output generated in response to a submission). When I try to find the roots of the same equation in Mathematica, I receive various errors. I have tried `FindRoot` and `Reduce`. Is there a function in Mathematica that corresponds to whatever is generating the `Root` output in the online WolframAlpha calculator? Thank you.
