I wanted to investigate the periodicity of functions so I tried to `Plot` them on Mathematica using the `Plot` function. The particular function was $\cos(\cos(x))+\cos(\sin(x))$. What I did was first plot them individually, then together. Individual results were as follows:               Plot[Cos[Cos[x]], {x, -4, 4}, Ticks -> {Table[x*Pi, {x, -2, 2, 1/2}],     {1.530, 1.535, 1.540}}, AspectRatio -> .1]      ![diagram 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3JnEb.png)               Plot[Cos[Sin[x]], {x, -4, 4}, Ticks -> {Table[x*Pi, {x, -2, 2, 1/2}],      {1.530, 1.535, 1.540}}, AspectRatio -> .1]      ![diagram 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qAXoE.png)               Plot[Cos[Cos[x]] + Cos[Sin[x]], {x, -4, 4}, Ticks -> {Table[x*Pi, {x, -2, 2, 1/2}],     {1.530, 1.535, 1.540}}, AspectRatio -> .1]      ![diagram 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ncTVa.png) Now all together:               Plot[{Cos[Cos[x]], Cos[Sin[x]], Cos[Cos[x]] + Cos[Sin[x]]}, {x, -Pi, Pi}, Ticks ->     {Table[x*Pi, {x, -1, 1, 1/2}]}, AspectRatio -> 1/2]      ![diagram 4](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wJsrL.png) See the yellow plot? That's supposed to be my original function but the individual function plot seems to be very different. Why is that so? Is it some system error or is it my fault?
