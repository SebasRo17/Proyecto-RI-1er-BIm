I'm in the early stages of my programming career and I've been working with MVC for just about a year now. I've spent much time learning about the pattern and the concepts behind it, but as the projects I'm working with get larger I'm starting to think that maybe I don't have the best understanding of how the model layer is supposed to work. I hear a lot about always having a View Model to protect your Domain Model but how does this work in practice? What does the relationship between the two look like? What if a model doesn't need any extra "view" logic, should I just create a copy of it? Why?
