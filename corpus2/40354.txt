Would it be possible to get Mathematica to group units more sanely. For example the calculation:               m = Quantity["Meters"];     D[       D[        Sin[p] (m),        Quantity[p, "Seconds"]] ,       Quantity[p, "Seconds"]] // Expand      This gives an visual output:               (-1 m/s^2) Sin[p]      however it would be more natural to show:                -Sin[p](m/s^2)      I there a way to make this happen. Notes:   * Expand is strictly not necessary in this case but can nice be in more complex cases.
