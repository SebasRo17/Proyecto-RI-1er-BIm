Right now I'm interning at a major engineering company. I'll be leaving in a few months though, so my project manager has requested a print out of my source code for a VBA project I've been working on. He would like to have it reviewed to make sure I didn't do anything ridiculous, and to make sure it's organized well enough for someone to maintain easily enough once I'm gone. I'm not really sure why he would want a print out instead of files, but since the VBA editor is ugly as sin this is probably a good thing. I would like to make an impression with this - however minor - so my question is how can I make this look professional? I.e., maybe there are certain fonts that make sense here, perhaps I could apply a color scheme to the words, etc?
