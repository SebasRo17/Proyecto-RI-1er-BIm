I have worked with a client for two weeks who knows nothing about the complexity of programming a CMS. After two weeks, our relationship has gone from mildly discomforting to the point where I have said "forget this, I quit if you are going to act like this". Problem is we have two week's worth of code developed (on my server luckily). I emailed him and said that I should keep the downpayment and he can get the code. I think he can find someone overseas to finish up my tasks within a few days as the project is about 80% done. He seems to think that is unfair and wants the code AND the downpayment back. What rights or what avenues should I take to resolve this? What would you do? I would not like to give the code back as I do not feel that he should receive something I have spent two weeks developing for free. I feel that if he gets the downpayment back I have every right to keep the code and destroy it. Seeking honest answers from fellow programmers. Any help is greatly appreciated.
