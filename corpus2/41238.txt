I've just started to use _Mathematica_ and I'm using the free-form input a lot. The computation time for simple problems seems to take a lot of time and my CPU isn't really used at all. I first thought that the f-f-input would be transferred to a Wolfram server, converted into the _Mathematica_ programming language and computed on my PC. Is that really the case? I didn't find anything about this on the _Mathematica_ website and I'd like to know how that and Wolfram Alpha-queries in _Mathematica_ 9 works.
