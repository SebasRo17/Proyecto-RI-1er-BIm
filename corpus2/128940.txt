For example, I've got a root object exposed in a SOA service, say `Invoice` (`Invoice` has line items as children). Sometimes, I need to retrieve its detail line items. I'm thinking to make it lazy loading, because it's a traffic overhead to transfer line items every time `Invoice` is required. But in SOA fashion, it seems unlikely. Because all it can expose are `Invoice` POCOs, with contain no logic. Thus I cannot attach my lazy loading logic to `Invoice` to instruct it to load lines items when needed.
