I'm part of the development team for a 2D animation program. One of the key features of the program is the ability to pose figures using Inverse Kinematics. Although we have that part down, we need to be able to pin joints in their place so moving another joint won't move the pinned one, or any past it. This is currently working for single joint pinning with the current algorithm we're using. However it's a necessity for us to be able to pin multiple joints at once and the algorithm we're using just isn't designed to work with it, and everyone on the team is stumped as to a solution. Are there any algorithms out there for joint pinning for use with inverse kinematics, while keeping in mind that it will have to work for any kind of non-closed figure?
