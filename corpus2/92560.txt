If computers are able to parse data organised in curly braces, why are we using `<foo></foo>` syntax in certain languages? Only because of legacy etc or are there further reasons behind this? I think I speak for many people if I say that that looks just redundant and it's awkward to work with. In adition it doesn't "enforce" indentation like brace-based languages do. **Update** \- I made the mistake of treating curly braces and key-value pairs (which I didn't mention until now) as the same concept. Taking into account this, I'd like to ask my question again: Is tag syntax really more convenient than a JSON-like language?
