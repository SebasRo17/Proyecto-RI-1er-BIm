Let's say we have some class structure:                    public interface IA { public void doA(); }          public class A implements IA { public void doA(){ System.out.println("A class doA");}          public class B extends A { public void doA(){ System.out.println("B class doA"); }      And now in a main I state this:                    //in a main          IA ia = new B();          ia.doA();      Am I correct in stating that the the runtime object of `ia` is a B class and it has inherited all the super classes methods and attributes? The printout from within the imaginary main is `B class doA` as the method `doA` in B will hide the same methods in its super classes?
