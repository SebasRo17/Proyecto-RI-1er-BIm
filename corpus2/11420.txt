An intermediate step in my analysis requires me to work in polar coordinates, but I would like to convert the results back into cartesian coordinates. The conversion is very simple but tedious for complex expressions. I expected to use substitutions, but it isn't panning out for me               polarf[{r_, phi_}] := r^6 Sin[phi]^2 Cos[phi]^2     cartesianf[{k1_, k2_}] :=       polarf[{r, phi}] /. r^2 Sin[phi]^2 -> k2^2 /.         r^2 Cos[phi]^2 -> k1^2 /. r^2 -> k1^2 + k2^2     cartesianf[{k1, k2}]      gives me back my original expression:               r^6 Cos[phi]^2 Sin[phi]^2      I'm pretty sure there is a way to get Mathematica to spit out               (k1^2 + k2^2) k1^2 k2^2      or something similar. But how? My searches of Google, Mathematica documentation, and this site have not turned up an answer.
