We have a small webdesign firm, and count with one designer. We can currently not afford too much expansion in the design area, so that means that the designer creates the main design of a website (which often means: the homepage), and the programmers then work with this to make it into a website. In general, this works for us. However, I have noticed a big difference between the abilities of different programmers to apply 'nice design touches' to a website. Given that we only have the homepage design, we often need to structure internal sections ourselves. Nothing major, no design program needed, but CSS skills come into play. So let's say we need to show a list of different sections in the website. I will have the content and assign this to two programmers. One will come up with this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jw6Lr.png) And another will do very much his best - and has the same CSS knowledge - but can only come up with something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aVTiU.png) NOTE: sample image taken from MailChimp website. The second programmer is aware that his 'design' lacks style and that it needs improvement, but he is just not able to create something nice without having it all drawn up by somebody else. He wants to work on this, but I do not know what a good approach would be. Any tips? Anybody with similar experiences?
