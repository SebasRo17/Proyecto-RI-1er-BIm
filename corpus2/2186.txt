I'm trying to export a 1000*100 matrix of numbers to a `.dat` file using `Export` (I want the numbers to be separated by a tab) and it's very slow, it takes several minutes, whereas when I export to an Excel file it takes a few seconds. Is there a way to speed this up ? Also how can I control the number of decimals I want to export ? **Edit**   I found the issue, this happens when I export my dat file on a network drive (at work), the export to an Excel file and a dat file must be implemented in different ways that produce different behaviours. Thank you though for the different interesting answers.
