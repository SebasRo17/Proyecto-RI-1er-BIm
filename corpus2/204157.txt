I have a unique problem which I'm hoping someone can assist with. I have One big text file, our **Production** file. The data in the file is delimited in the following format               Reference|Cost Centre|Analytics Base Value|....      UMBY_2288|023437|2883484|...      NOT_REAL|1343534|283434|...      The average size of this file is about 30MB. with about 120000 rows. and then I have about 20 **Regional** files. these files are similar to the Current big file in structure. except that they are smaller. average size 50000 rows. Now I have to loop through each line in the big Prod file. For each **Reference** code, I have to search through each of the 'Regional' files to see which ones contain that specific reference code. and then copying some of the data from that line into a report. There is no way of predetermining what files to look into. And each reference can be in multiple **Regional** files.. As you can imagine, looping through each row in each file, multiple times is a very time consuming process. Due to memory constraints, I can't load the files into memory. Does anyone have any smart ideas on how I can do this? I don't need code samples. just pointers on ways I could solve this problem. I'm developing the tool in C#.
