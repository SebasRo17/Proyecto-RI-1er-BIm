I am a student of Computer Science and I already have basic programming experience in Python 2.x, 3.x, C++, and HTML. I never made a program with a GUI. I have just programmed games, scripts/plugins, and console applications. First time developers in Ubuntu are recommended to use the GUI designer Glade, which creates GUIs for the GTK toolkit. They are also recommended to program in the Qt framework. I intend to create a cross-platform application (Linux/Windows/Android/iOS/OSX). Given my experience, is Glade a reasonable option for me to use in order to create a cross-platform application, especially in my first application that needs a GUI?
