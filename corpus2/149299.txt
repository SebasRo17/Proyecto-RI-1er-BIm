And No, i am not referring to single variables in loops or exceptions. Lets say pointer/struct names in large c ,c++ programs . Are there any languages where this type of naming is acceptable or is the norm. Or any constructs in c/c++ ( not iterators,loops) where it is implicit. what is the general practice in handling such naming conventions ? would you change it? if so how would you change it? If you are a team-project lead and some one raises an issue with regards to the naming convention how would you view it?
