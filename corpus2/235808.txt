1. Linux is packaged in a format known as a Linux distribution for desktop and server use. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting utilities and libraries and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution's intended use. I wonder if there is also a similar concept for a software application? A "distribution" of a software application? How is it defined?   2. For a Linux distribution can have many releases and versions. I wonder What is the difference and relation between release and version, for either a OS distribution or a software application? Thanks!
