I'm a freshman Computer Science student and we just started doing some actual projects in Python. I have found I'm very efficient when I use the pen and paper method that my professor suggested in class. But when I can't write my problem down and work my algorithms out on paper I am really slow. During labs, I always seem to have to take the assignment back to my dorm. When I get there and write it out I solve the problem that took me the whole class in like 5 minutes. Maybe it's because I get stressed seeing people solving labs before me. Or maybe it's the pen and paper method. I was browsing through forums and someone wrote that if you have to write your programs on paper then you shouldn't be a programmer. I'm really worried because I'm so much better when I can see what the program is doing and track my way through it before typing actual code. Am I doing something wrong? Edit: Sorry for being unclear, but when I said writing on paper I meant my problem solving approach (e.g writing examples, making tables with values, etc.) not my actual code. I just use the paper to get my ideas out.
