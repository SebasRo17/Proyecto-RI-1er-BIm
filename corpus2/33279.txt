I've read and tried the previous StackExchange suggestions here about installing the SerialIO package (including placing SerialIO in the same folder as init.m and and editing the init.m file per Turkel. But when I use                <<SerialIO`      I still get the error               LinkOpen::linke: Specified file is not a MathLink executable..      (I installed SerialIO from the github repository on a Ubtuntu 12.04 64 bit machine). (Using **Terminal** ) when I change directory to the SerialIO folder and run the script               ./SerialIO      I see the "Create Link" and "Connect to Link" prompts. I have 2 related questions:   1. What should be entered at the Create Link / Connect to Link prompts to ensure SerialIO can 'connect' to a device on my system?   2. What else can I check/adjust to have _Mathematica_ correctly call the SerialIO package ?
