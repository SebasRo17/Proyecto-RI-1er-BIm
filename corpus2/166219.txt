I need a bit of advice from you developers who deal with cross-platform applications (specifically programs with a GUI). I will be creating an application soon that needs to be cross-platform and so I have done some preliminary research on two different frameworks: JavaFX 2.0 and Qt. Honestly, both would more than suit my needs. So then I asked myself why I would choose one over the other (SPOILER ALERT: I don't know the answer :P ). I do know that JavaFX 2.0 is rather new (as of 2012) and is not fully supported across platforms, but it will be eventually. The question I pose is this: which one of these would you use for a cross- platform application, and what criteria did you look at when making that decision? Thank you for taking the time to read this! :)
