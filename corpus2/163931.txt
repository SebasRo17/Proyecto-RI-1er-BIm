I use buffer for quite a long time when I need to copy a stream or read a file. And every time I set my buffer size to 2048 or 1024, but from my point of view a buffer is like a "bucket" which carries my "sand" (stream) from one part of my land (memory) to an other part. So, increase my bucket capacity will in theory allow me to do less travel? Is this a good things to do in programming?
