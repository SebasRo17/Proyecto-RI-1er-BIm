I have two functions $A(x), B(x)$, given in a special power series form: $A(x)=1-x^{2}\left(\frac{a}{10}-\sum_{k=1}^{9}b_{k}\left(\frac{(x^{2}-1)}{r}\right)^{k}\right)$ $B(x)=1-x^{2}\left(\frac{c}{10}-\sum_{k=1}^{9}d_{k}\left(\frac{(x^{2}-1)}{r}\right)^{k}\right)$ where $a,b_{k},c,d_{k}$ are real numbers, and $r\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$. What I want to do, is to find the composition of these series $A(B(x))$ in a similar form, i.e. find such $u=u(a,b_{k},c,d_{k},r)$ and $v_{k}=v_{k}(a,b_{k},c,d_{k},r)$ so that $A(B(x))=1-x^{2}\left(\frac{u}{10}-\sum_{k}v_{k}\left(\frac{(x^{2}-1)}{r}\right)^{k}\right)$ I tried defining these series by brute force:               A[x_] := 1 - x^2*((a/10) + Sum[b[k]*((x^2 - 1)/r)^k, {k, 1, 9}]);                B[x_] := 1 - x^2*((c/10) + Sum[d[k]*((x^2 - 1)/r)^k, {k, 1, 9}]);      And then calling `A[B[x]]//Expand` but it took forever long to run. Is there an efficient way to get an explicit power series expansion for `A[B[x]]`? Then I can just get the desired form by simple equating coefficients, but what my question is: how to get an output for `A[B[x]]` in the standard power series form? Thanks! (this is not homework)
