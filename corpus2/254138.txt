After using the chrome debugger to inspect the ajax requests of Facebook (for curiosity), I noticed that the response is in JSON, however it is always prefixed with               for(;;);      In example, if the JSON were `{hello:"world"}`, then Facebook would respond               for(;;); {hello:"world"}      Does this have any use? I imagine it must have a purpose...
