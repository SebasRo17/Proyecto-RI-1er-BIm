Assuming a comment won't fit (or can't go) on the line it applies to, should one write the comment before the code or after? Well, wherever future readers will best understand the comment's scope. In other words, wherever most programmers/scripters put such comments. So **where do most programmers/scripters put a comment: before or after its code?** If your answer applies only to specific languages, please indicate which. And if you can cite an accepted spec or guide that supports your answer, so much the better.
