I've need an interface that assures me a certain method, including specific signature, is available. So far his is what I have:               public interface Mappable<M> {         M mapTo(M mappableEntity);     }      The problem arises when a class should be mappable to multiple other entities. The ideal case would be this (not java):               public class Something implements Mappable<A>, Mappable<B> {         public A mapTo(A someObject) {...}         public B mapTo(B someOtherObject) {...}     }      What would be the best way to achieve this remaining as "generic" as possible?
