Suppose that I make a plot of $x^2$ vs. $x$:               myPlot = Plot[x^2, {x, -1, 1}, Frame -> True]      ![myPlot1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PkklF.png) If I click on the plot, I see the orange handles with which I can resize the plot: ![myPlot2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xfyTX.png) Now, suppose that I want to actually crop the plot -- I would like to effectively shrink the orange box so that some of the plot is actually cropped. ( _Why in the world would I want to do this?_ It's a long story...) I have found, from answers to a question that I previously asked, that this is possible using `ImagePad` with negative arguments. For example, suppose that I want to crop 40 pixels off the right side of the plot. I can do the following:               ImagePad[myPlot, {{0, -45}, {0, 0}}]      ![myPlot3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fh4Vy.png) It looks good so far. **_However,_** when I resize the resulting cropped plot by dragging the orange handles, it looks like the image has been rasterized: ![myPlot4](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BhwSu.png) **But, in contrast, I need the image to remain a vector image (non-rasterized) after cropping.** Is that possible? I am running both version 8 and 9.
