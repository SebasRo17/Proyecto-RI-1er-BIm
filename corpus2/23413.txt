I want to generate an EGARCH process. My problem is that I do not see how to create new processes beyond those available. The process itself is : $$\epsilon(t) = \sigma(t) \eta(t)$$ $$\log(\sigma(t)^2 ) = w + b\log(\sigma(t-1)^2) + c\eta(t-1) + d \lvert\eta(t-1)\rvert$$ Notice that I want to use `RandomFunction` to generate the simulated values. Then I'd like to estimate it using the `EstimatedProcess` to estimate the parameters. I want to experiment with false models..
