I'm a .Net C# developer who got most of my experience working for a government office in DC. There, it was relatively easy to find a job. I would put my resume out, and in no more than a month I would have an offer. I now live in Seattle, and a 2-month job search full of in-person interviews returns the same output: "We like your personal skills and you're a good team fit, but your coding is not up to par with our standards." I have 2 theories as to why this might be: 1) Most development jobs in DC are for support of low-level administrative applications. Just so long as 20-30 people can use it without problems, it's a good product. However, most development in Seattle is done for real companies who develop real products used by a wide array of customers... and HAS to be up to tighter development standards. 2) (This one is probably more obvious) I'm searching for jobs that match what I made in DC. Since the cost of living is lower here, that means I'm setting my bar to a more Senior level, which is working against me. Does this at all make sense to anyone else? Does anyone else find this kind of variance between being a developer in contrasting areas? ...or am I just trippin'? lol
