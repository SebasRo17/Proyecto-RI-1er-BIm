I am quite stumped by this problem :               Reduce[ N^(x-y) <1 && N > 0 , x, Reals]      gives the expected result               (N>1 && x<y) || (N<1 && x>y)      but               Reduce[ N^(x-y) <1 && N > 1 , x, Reals]     Reduce::nsmet This system cannot be solved by the methods available to Reduce      and more importantly               Reduce[ N^x < N^y && N > 0 , x, Reals]     Reduce::nsmet This system cannot be solved by the methods available to Reduce      Now this would not be a problem but I am trying to apply `Reduce` automatically to large quantities of inequalities, and I would rather avoid having to rewrite each and every one by hand. Especially considering that some will be multiple inequalities like               N^x < N^y < N^z      Do you have any idea why `Reduce` fails and how to go around this ? Thanks in advance.
