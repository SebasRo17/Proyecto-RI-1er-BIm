I met a tricky problem with `ContourPlot`, which is when I change the range of my variable, I get a totally new figure. For example:               ContourPlot[2.` c^4 - 1.693 c^4 x - 0.861 x^2 + 0.0417 Log[10^(-6)] x^2 +         0.25` x^2 Log[1/c^(2/3)] + (1.` c^4 + 0.673 x) x Log[x] -         0.125` x^2 Log[x]^2 == 0, {x, 3, 100}, {c, 1, 5}, PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UpAe0.gif) But if I change the range of `c` from `{1,5}` to `{1,50}` the figure is different: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fN7Kc.gif) Anyone knows the reason? Which figure is correct?
