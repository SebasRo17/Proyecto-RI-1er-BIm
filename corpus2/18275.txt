I have the following problem: I want to multiply two matrices and sum them to another matrix C. A.B+ 2B Easy! The matrix A varies as a function of three inputs a,b and c. The second matrix, B, is a 2x2 identity matrix. here is the code                    Grid[{{"a", "b", "c"},            {InputField[Dynamic[a], FieldSize -> 1],             InputField[Dynamic[b], FieldSize -> 1],             InputField[Dynamic[c], FieldSize -> 1]}}]                  A = {{Dynamic[a]*Dynamic[b], 0}, {0, Dynamic[c]}};             B = IdentityMatrix[2];             A.B + 2 B      Let's say a=c=10 and b=2. Result But I don't want to get 10 2+2 and 10+2, I need 22 and 12! It just shows the value of a and c without multiplying. Using               A = {{Dynamic[a*b], 0}, {0, Dynamic[c]}};      instead of               A = {{Dynamic[a]*Dynamic[b], 0}, {0, Dynamic[c]}};      solves the first problem. I got 20+2 and 10+2, which is good but not enough. It seems that it not possible to simplify operation when using Dynamic... How can I solve the problem? Thx!
