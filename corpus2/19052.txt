I have a question on axis label alignment of ListPlot3D and Histogram3D. These labels are not aligned with the axis of the view, but only horizontally. I have tried very hard to align them manually, but the method sucks and still the output lacks precision and neatness. I wonder if M 9.0.0 has this facility? If no, then please suggest some clean way which aligns through exact calculations. Thanks in advance.               ListPlot3D[Table[Sin[i + j^2], {i, 0, 3, 0.1}, {j, 0, 3, 0.1}],      AxesLabel-> {Xaxis, Yaxis}, PlotLabel -> Sin[i + j^2], PlotStyle -> Purple]          Histogram3D[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], {500, 2}],     AxesLabel ->{Xaxis, Yaxis}]      Image by P.Fonseca ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NiCuL.gif)
