The VertexRenderingFunction seems to only use names, not labels. For example:               GraphPlot[Import["D:/dev/ProjectEuler/keylog.gv"],VertexLabeling->True,PlotStyle->{Black},VertexRenderingFunction->({EdgeForm[Black],White,Disk[#1,0.08],Black,Text[#2,#1]}&)]      The imported gv file here has both names and labels defined for each node. The names are always unique, but the labels are not necessarily unique. Unfortunately, the above GraphPlot only shows the NAMES of the vertices, not the labels. How can I get the labels and not the names? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kdM22.png) The vertex annotations above are names, not labels of each vertex. The DOT file is as follows:               digraph Passcode {         0 [label="3"];         1 [label="1"];         2 [label="9"];         3 [label="6"];         4 [label="8"];         5 [label="0"];         6 [label="2"];         7 [label="7"];         0 -> 1;         0 -> 2;         0 -> 3;         0 -> 4;         1 -> 4;         1 -> 6;         1 -> 5;         1 -> 3;         1 -> 2;         2 -> 5;         3 -> 4;         3 -> 2;         3 -> 6;         3 -> 5;         4 -> 5;         4 -> 2;         6 -> 2;         6 -> 5;         6 -> 4;         7 -> 3;         7 -> 1;         7 -> 6;         7 -> 0;         7 -> 2;     }
