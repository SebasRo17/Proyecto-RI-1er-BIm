Lets say I have a file named `test.m` containing some functions.               test[arg1_, arg2_] := (       Print[arg1];       Print[arg2];     )     test3[arg1_, arg2_] := (       Print[arg1];       Print[arg2];     )      What would be a good way to generate a list of butons that would allow you to invoke the functions easily? For example. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3l0yK.png) The tricky part here (and is mainly why I am asking this question) is calling the functions, which will have several different argument types? I had thought about using an `InputField` with a `MessageDialog`, but I would bet there is better way to incorporate _Mathematica_ 's features.               ClearAll[loadFile];     loadFile[path_String?FileExistsQ] := DeleteCases[ToExpression[         FromCharacterCode[BinaryReadList[path]]         , InputForm, HoldComplete], Null];     x = ReleaseHold[        loadFile["test.m"] /.         HoldPattern[sym_[args__] := eval_] :>          Button[sym, eval]        ];     x[[0]] = List;     x
