Hexagon bin plots are a useful way of visualising large datasets of bivariate data. Here are a few examples: With bin frequency indicated by grey level... ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O9lFp.png) ..and by glyph size ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5okWO.png) There are packages for creating this kind of plot in both "R" and Python. Obviously, the idea is similar to `DensityHistogram` plots. How would one go about generating hexagonal bins in Mathematica? Also, how would one control the size of a `plotmarker` based on the bin frequency? **Update** As a starting point I have tried to create a triangular grid of points:               vert1 = Table[{x, Sqrt[3] y}, {x, 0, 20}, {y, 0, 10}];     vert2 = Table[{1/2 x, Sqrt[3] /2 y}, {x, 1, 41, 2}, {y, 1, 21, 2}];          verttri = Flatten[Join[vert1, vert2], 1];      overlaying some data..               data = RandomReal[{0, 20}, {500, 2}];          ListPlot[{verttri, data}, AspectRatio -> 1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EOQk0.png) next step might involve using `Nearest`:               nearbin = Nearest[verttri];          ListPlot[nearbin[#] & /@ data, AspectRatio -> 1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F7GgN.png) This gives the location of vertices with nearby data points. Unfortunately, I can't see how to count those data points..
