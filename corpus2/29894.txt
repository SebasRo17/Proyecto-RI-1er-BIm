I got to a problem where as I just can't find the proper _Mathematica_ command. I'm given a list, for example: $\\{1,x1,-x1,x2,x5,x3,-x2,-x4\\}$ I need this to become $\\{1,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5\\}$ The example is just a small possibility with all $x_i$ present. There's only 1 variable at all times. $X =Array[x,6]$ A second example to be more clear. I'll make it a little bit more terrifying: $\\{1,x_1,-x_1,x_2,x_5,x_3,-4x_2,-x_4,-1,x_1x_2,-x_3x_5,x_6^2\\}$ needs to become $\\{1,x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_1x_2,x_3x_5,x_6^2\\}$
