When you have a short deadline to being with, and you're nearing the end of development, would you rather rush through coding to dedicate more time to QAing or keep your pace and possible have VERY little QA time? I am a sole developer on this project and I am the sole QAer as well. It is an extremely short time period I have to do this, notice to release. It is a very data-driven application and the data tends to be a little......user-inputed. I could spend days searching through intermediate processes, but it will take away from the little valuable time I have left. What do you recommend? Maximize QA time by rushing to finish? Or keep steady and cross my fingers on release? I don't like the feeling of a release version and just watching a new batch of data just waiting for it to snag and fail. Thoughts? Opinions?
