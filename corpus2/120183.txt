How to casually do the required Software Engineering and designing? I am an inexperienced developer and face the following problem:   1. My company is a start up and has no fix Software engineering systems.   2. I am assigned tasks with not very clear and conflicting requirements.   3. I don't have to follow any designs or verify requirements officially. Problem:   1. I code all day and finally get stuck where requirement conflicts and I have to start over again.   2. I can-not spend a lot of time doing proper SRS or SDD. How should I:   1. **List out Requirements for myself. (Not an official document)**   2. **How to verify and validate the requirements?**   3. **How to visualize them?**   4. **How to design them with minimum effort? (As its going to be with me only)** I don't want to waste my time coding something that's gonna collapse according to requirement conflict or something! I don't want to compromise with quality but don't want to re-write everything on some change that I didn't expected. I imagine making a diagram for my thought process that will show me conflict in the diagram itself, then finally correcting the diagram - I decide my design and structure my code in terms of interfaces or something. And then finally start implementing my design. I am able to sense the lack of systematic approach, but don't know how to proceed!
