I was looking for some answers in SO or here, but without any results, that's why I would ask you. Let's assume I have a two different projects - for example server part and client part of an app. I'm developing my own part, while my friend is making the second one. But both of us should use some common interfaces like `User` or `AccountInfo` or `ChangableAccount`... whatever in order to ensure a compatibility. For example if a clients send a User data to server, then the server should operate on the same class. The same with interfaces etc. Moreover, if there are any changes in a common interface, both projects should adjust its code to the new situation. The only solution I can see now is, to create a one extra project in which all common things are defined. We, me and my friend, should add this project as a dependency to a main project (client or server). Shared project can be managed by some version control system, so we have always the most up-to-date state. What other solution would you suggest? How such problems are solved in professional apps?
