I'm working on a .net web app project where we develop on our personal machines, but our testing and production environments are in a corporate intranet. The problem is I run into bugs that only present in the testing/production environment, but not in dev. I find this makes it really difficult to track down the cause of the problem. Are there any tips/strategies to deal with this issue? **Please note I have no control or options when it comes to setting up new servers or modifying the test environment. I can only make changes to my local machine. I also do not have access to a company image file to image my PC.
