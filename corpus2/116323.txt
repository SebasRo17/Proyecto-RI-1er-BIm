You can have different HTML `input` elements on a single HTML `form` and all of them, have their associated remembered values (values that you've entered in those fields); Is it related to the `id` or `name` attribute of the `input` element? No. Proof? Your email address appears on many `input` elements across different websites, and all those fields have different `id` and `name` attributes. So, there is a mystery here I don't understand. How browsers remember values for HTML form controls? What is the algorithm? How they know that they should show your email on _this_ control and not on _that_ control, while controls are both HTML `input type=text` elements?
