I've been searching around for the answer to this question, but haven't been able to find a solution. I am working on a distributed client-server system that uses TCP. The program's functions is to transfer money to an from the server, but also between the clients, a sort of MobilePay. When one client wishes to transfer money to another client, that client will need to accept the transfer before it is succeeded (one of the systems requirements). So, my problem is, i would like the client to get notified (preferably through a message dialog) whenever a transfer is ready to get accepted. All the payments/transfers is stored in a SQL table. I would like the client to get notified when there is a pending payment/transfer in his/hers name, that is, when a new row (with the clients name as receiver) in the transfer table is added, in stead of the client needing to actively see if there is any pending payments (as it is now) Can anybody help my how to get around this problem Thanks in advance Best regards
