I would like to convolute the inverse square root on the interval `[0,inf]` with a Gaussian function, like so:               f[x_] := 1/Sqrt[x]     g[x_, sigma_] := Exp[-x^2/(2 sigma^2)]     conv[x_, sigma_] := Integrate[f[y] g[x - y, sigma], {y, 0, \[Infinity]}, Assumptions -> {sigma > 0}]     conv[x,sigma]      The result from Mathematica (9) reads               Exp[-x^2/(4 sigma^2)] Sqrt[-x] BesselK[1/4, x^2/(4 sigma^2)]/Sqrt[2]      which is purely imaginary for `x>0`. This is certainly not the answer to the question I had in mind, which should be a positive real-valued function for all real-valued x (correct?). Please tell me what is going wrong and (if possible) what I need to change to get the result I am looking for. P.S. Adding assumptions like `x>0` also doesn't seem to help (it simply will replace `Sqrt[-x]` by `I Sqrt[x]`).
