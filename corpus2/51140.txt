I'm looking for a way to find a specific solution to a differential equation. As a simplified version of my problem, here's a similar setup for a simple harmonic oscillator problem.               aargh =        NDSolve[{        -0.000000000001 + q''[x] == -q[x],         q'[π] == q'[-π], q[-π] == q[π]},         q, {x, -π, π}];     Plot[Evaluate[q[x] /. aargh], {x, -π, π}]      The reason for the 0.00000000001 is to perturb the system slightly to ensure that I get a nonzero solution. This gives a beautiful harmonic function as a solution. Now, what I want to do, is specify a starting trial solution for `NDSolve` to look around. For example, say I wanted to find the $\sin(x)$ solution to the differential equation. Is there any way by which I can specify this and ask _Mathematica_ to look around a particular function for my solution. My actual problem is far more complicated, but is essentially the same. It is also homogenous, so I've added a perturbation there as well to find the non zero solution. Once again, _Mathematica_ is returning an approximately valid solution, but I know that there exists another solution somewhere else. How do I tell _Mathematica_ to look there?
