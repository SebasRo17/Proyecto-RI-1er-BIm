I've been trying to calculate the following in _Mathematica_ :               Solve[205.73/(1 + cet)^5 + 205.73/(1 + cet)^4 + 205.73/(1 + cet)^3 +          205.73/(1 + cet)^2 + 205.73/(1 + cet) == x, cet]      but it keeps returning > "Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficient" How can I calculate the above? I just want to isolate `cet` so I can create an algorithm to solve it.
