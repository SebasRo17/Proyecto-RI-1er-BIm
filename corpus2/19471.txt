Is there a Front End option (or programming option) in Mathematica 9 that limits the amount of time that functions take to execute? I have a function (as part of a Mathematica Application) that shows page breaks and iterates though each cell of a notebook. The function operated on large notebooks without problem in Mathematica 8, however in Mathematica 9, it reaches a different point of the notebook each time (and almost gets to the end if page breaks are already showing). The function operates without problem on each half of the notebook (and on smaller notebooks). I have not used any TimeConstraint options. Also note, that I am able to execute the function using Workbench (with Mathematica 9). **EDIT** The function is to create a table of contents (a slightly modified version of the code given on Stack Exchange: Generating a Table of Contents). It includes cells that are already tagged. The code is executed via a button.
