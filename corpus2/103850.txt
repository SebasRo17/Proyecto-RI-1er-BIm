I'm a year away from university/college at this point in time, I'm currently 17 years old and practice programming as a hobby. I'd like to get a job one day in the market, I -love- programming. And I was wondering what would be my best course of action at the moment to get myself ready for a potential career in programming? I've talked to a couple comp sci majors and it doesn't seem like what they're doing isn't terribly hard (although, I'm sure it differs from school to school). I kind of feel like I'm in an odd limbo where it's gotten a bit stale, because I don't feel like I'm making 'progress'. As far as programming this is my current skill set: Languages: Lua, I know this one very well, I'd put myself at least a little bit past 'moderate' with Lua, I know how to use it's features and what to do, and not to do. C, I know C in a way I'd call a bit below moderate, I can write C but I don't know the best practices, and I often find myself consulting documentation on C. Projects: I've made a couple toy interpreters, I shipped a roleplaying modification for a Garrys Mod (while this doesn't sound like much, I and my friend have produced at -least- 20,000 lines, including comments and such), and I've made a couple small games. Experience: I'm fairly familiar with GNU tools and Linux, I can write a basic makefile etc. I know how to use command line tools, and I use Linux as my day to day operating system, but also have years of experience with Windows. I know how to use Git and SVN (I'm a master at niether, but I can use them well enough to maintain a project.) So if there's anything you guys could suggest? Should I be actively doing things now or just kind of waiting it out for university? I'm feeling lost. Edit: I put "is" instead of "isn't" terribly hard. What I meant to say is all the Comp Sci major I've talked to said that the material isn't terrible hard if you've got a bit of experience programming.
