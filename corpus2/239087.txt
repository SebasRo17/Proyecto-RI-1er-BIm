I started using TDD for the first time on a project I started recently. I have a few objects with dependencies and structures that look something like this:               public class MyClass     {         private readonly IDependency1 _dependency1;         private readonly IDependency2 _dependency2;              public MyClass(IDependency1 d1, IDependency2 d2)         {             _dependency1 = d1;             _dependency2 = d2;         }              public MyClass()         {             _dependency1 = new Dependency1();             _dependency2 = new Dependency2();         }     }      For tests I use Mock objects for the dependencies but in the implementation I sometimes let the constructor new up a concrete object. It feels like I am cheating by doing this but I'm not sure why it is bad in practice. Is this considered bad practice? If so why?
