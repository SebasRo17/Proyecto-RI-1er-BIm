I'd like to calculate the Mean or Median value of a function over some interval $[a,b]$. However, I can't seem to find how to do this in help. Specifically I'd like to have something that works like the following:               f = x;     funcMean[f,{x,0,1}];     out :> 0.5;      The way to actually do this is to compute the integral:               1/(b - a) * NIntegrate[f, {x, a, b}, WorkingPrecision -> 20]      But I suspect there's a built-in function to do that same? What about for calculating the Median over the same interval?
