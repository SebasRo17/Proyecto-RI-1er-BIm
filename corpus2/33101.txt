I'm wandering is there Master document concept in Mathematica so that the counter will be counted sequencially in master document. Mean file in child document, the counter follow from master document. I knew that I can setup the counter in the specific file, but then if I add some new section in the first file, then I should change the start counter in the next file. I don't want it, I like next file change the start counter directly, just like Latex
