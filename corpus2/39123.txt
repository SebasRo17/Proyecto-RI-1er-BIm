Mathematica really struggles to simplify complex conjugates of complicated expressions - even given assumptions for every symbol in the expression being real. Often times I've found that I can actually accomplish what I want better by doing my own conjugation using replaceall and manually switching all the i's to -i. For example, I'll have `psi = Exp[I k x]` (well, a more complicated mixture of things like that), so to get `psi*` I just do               psi /. I -> -I      This works quite well - but apparently `I`, `2I`, `3I` and so on are all different, so I have to look at the expression, pick out all the `I`'s, then do something like this:               psi /.{I->myi,2I-> 2 myi, 3I-> 3 myi}     psiconj = % /.{myi->-I}      This seems to work, usually. Is there any way I can do this without individually specifying each form of `I` that appears? Like `psi /. x_I :> -x I` ? (That doesn't work). Or maybe /. x?ImaginaryQ:>-x or something? I'm also open to other suggestions. The problem here is that mathematica is being very careful - and that keeps it from doing things incorrectly in certain situations... but in most cases, I know what I want, and I just want a simple straightforward conjugation that switches all visible `I`'s to -`I`'s. EDIT: I edited to clear up confusion about i vs I in code snippets. As for why I wouldn't want to use Conjugate - if it's not clear enough above, than see other issues such as these: Remove annoying Conjugate http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13337630/mathematica-simplify-conjugate- expresion Conjugates often cause expressions to not simplify - best case scenario it will work as long as I explicitly tell mathematic to assume that every symbol in the expression is real and positive, but with lots of symbols this is cumbersome - and when I know the expression well enough to know that a simple switching of just the visible I's to -I's will work, I don't really want to spend time doing something more complicated. ComplexExpand and Refine sometimes can help - but sometimes not. What does work for me in my situations is what I described above - but they're not very general. I've toyed around with what I said above, and this seems to work, though it's not very elegant (still much better that using Conjugate, Simplify and having to explicitly tell mathematica to assume a bunch of symbols are real and positive):               psi = Exp[3 I k x + 5 x + Sqrt[2 I m]]     psi /. {x_?(NumberQ[#] && Element[#, Complexes] &) :>  Conjugate[x]}      EDIT 2: Szabolcs suggestion is simpler/better than what I that above:               psi = Exp[3 I k x + 5 x + Sqrt[2 I m]]     psi /. x_Complex :>  Conjugate[x]
