This is a question about preferences. Assume a programming language offers these two options to make a string with some variables:   1. `"Hello, my name is ". name ." and I'm ". age ." years old."`   2. `StringFormat("Hello, my name is $0 and I'm $1 years old.", name, age)` Which do you prefer and why? I have found myself using both without any clear reason to pick either. Considering micro-optimizations is not within the scope of this question. **Localization** has been mentioned as a reason to go with option #2 and I think it's a very valid reason and deserves to be mentioned here. However, would opinions differ based on aesthetic viewpoints?
