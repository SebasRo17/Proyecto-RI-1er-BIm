I've been programming for a while on different languages. I never really studied programming at school nor worked on a team of more than two people (me included). Still, I've been a professional developer for over three years. Last year, I took over my first C# project and it ended up being fine. I can't help but think that because I learned and worked alone I must be missing some concepts/hints/edge. For those who've been solo developers before being part of a team, can you share your experience? Did you realize you were missing something? Did you find it hard? Did you learn faster after?
