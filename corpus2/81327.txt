The question jQuery plugin file including the jQuery library came up today on stackoverflow, and I strongly advised against including jQuery in the plugin. I didn't really get any support from others on this; in fact there was more support to include jQuery than not. Is this ok or are there good reasons not to do this? I think it's a really bad idea as I think it should be up to the developer using the plug as to what version of jQuery is being used.
