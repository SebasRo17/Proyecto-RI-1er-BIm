I work for a company that primarily builds Java applications and I'm trying to convince everybody to stop checking-in binary files (dependencies and final products) to SCM. They know it is a bad practice but they think that "it works" and it is not really a problem even when many people know about Maven and other tools for building besides Ant. Both PMs and programmers (around 50 people) are ready to listen to any argument against and even acknowledge that it is a waste of backup space but I want to be really convincing because the habit change would involve a lot of effort. What arguments do you use to support a change? **Edit:** Okay, it makes sense to make a distinction between files that almost do not change, like dependencies, and generated files. Even so, I'm interested in reasons against the latter.
