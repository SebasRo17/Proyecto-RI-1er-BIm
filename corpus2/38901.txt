I have a square matrix of the form $$M=D+\overset{N}{\underset{n=1}\bigoplus}R_n,$$ where $R_n$ are circulant matrices, $D$ is a diagonal matrix and $\oplus$ is Kronecker sum. Its size is quite big, but as can be seen from its form, it's in fact not very dense in a way. Namely, its elements can be generated by a simple procedure not needing much memory - the only things needing storage are a vector for diagonal of $D$, and a set of smaller vectors for first rows of $R_n$ (i.e. totally two vectors matching dimensions of $M$). Actually, diagonal matrix is simple to get with `SparseArray`, but I don't know how to make "sparse" circulant matrices. So the question: is there a nice way to store this matrix sparsely so that it could be operated on by e.g. `Eigensystem[]` with Arnoldi method or something similar?
