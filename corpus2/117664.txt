I have created a desktop application(winfoms) using C#.net 3.5, the application is an SEO application, so it has to be connected to the internet, i implemented a simple licensing routine where every time the application is started it will query the web service on my server with the key and machine hash to validate. But recently i have noticed that some "crackers" have disabled the license verification (simply removed the lines of code that does that) of the application which i have obfuscated, and the sad thing is that they are selling it at a cost that is only 10% of what i am selling for, they didn't even bother to remove my website address and company details from the about box. The application is having an auto-update feature, which they so-called crackers have intentionally left it on in the cracked version I was just trying to figure out a way out of this, i can release an update and disable all the versions that are brought from the crackers, but without a proper licensing it will broken again and the next time, i don't have the guarantee that they will keep the auto update feature on.
