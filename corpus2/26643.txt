I've injured my wrist and looking over at the designer sitting across me using his pen and tablet made me think if that's something a web developer (20-40% time spent in photoshop) could use and maybe even be more efficient in the long term? **Are you a developer using pen / tablet and seriously not missing a mouse anymore? Why?** I did a search and found these but they don't answer my question exactly, or in enough detail:   * Development with a tablet (dated 2008)   * One handed coding with tablet   * One guy using a tablet / pen likes it   * Programming with feet?   * A designer switches to a tablet (good comments) But what I did find I can summarise as follows:   * It is easier on the wrist.   * There is a learning curve.   * For pointing intensive work (ala photoshop) it is superior.   * You get better at keyboard shortcuts if you're not already.   * You might hold the pen while you type if you find picking up / putting down harder.   * Tablet to screen mapping is awesome (absolute positioning, i.e. tablet corner = screen corner) I think I've almost convinced myself here :)
