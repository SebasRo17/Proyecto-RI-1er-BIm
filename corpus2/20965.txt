**Hello**   Over the years have I made a programming journey from C in 1990 to Pascal, C++ with I programmed commercially, java VHDL, C# and now I'm taking a look on F#. In the spring I will go back to study embedded programming in C in a university course so before I do that I will refresh my knowledge in C.   I don't remember much of the C that I learnt and I think I am thankful for that for probably learned some bad habits back then. I have some questions to get me on the way.   **\--edit--**   To clarify: I am thankful for tips that have been given regarding embedded programming but now I am more interested in relearning C in general. Sorry if my question was unclear,   1. Compiler, Debugger, IDE? As a microslave I was thinking about 2010 C++ Express, any alternatives?   2. Where do you find good libraries with code for C. I'm thinking something similar to Boost, POCO in C++   3. Source for procedural programming patterns and best practices. Where can you find good code learn from? Thanks in advance   Gorgen
