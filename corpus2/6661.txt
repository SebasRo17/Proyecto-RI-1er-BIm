I am in a resizing mood these days. This code works quite well, up to a point.               Grid[Partition[       Table[Pane[Style[FromCharacterCode[96 + i], FontSize -> 150],          ImageSizeAction -> "ResizeToFit",          ImageSize -> {Scaled[1], Scaled[1]},          Alignment -> {Center, Center}], {i, 1, 25}], 5], Dividers -> All,       ItemSize -> {Scaled[.2], Scaled[.2]}]      It makes a 5x5 grid of 25 letters with boxes extending and shrinking according to the Notebook's width, and the strings centered in each box. The letters also shrink and expand accordingly. That's the minimal example of what I wanted. But when I shrink the window a little too much, the result is clipped instead of shrinked: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2FYoQ.png) And when I enlarge the window a little too much, depending on the fontsize used, the letters stop to enlarge as well, as you could probably guess, this is not what I want. Moreover, I would like the code not to be dependent on an heuristic font size. I have tried various options but without success. Any idea, any better code ?
