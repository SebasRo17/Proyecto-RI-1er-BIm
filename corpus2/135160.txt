I have been recently studying more on the dynamic types in C#. With some examples I understood once the code is compiled, it does not need to be recompiled again but can be executed directly. I feel the flexibility provided by the keyword to actually be able to change data type at will is a great advantage. Question, Are there **any specific shortcomings** apart from wrong dynamic method calls which throw run time exceptions **which developers must know** before starting the implementation.
