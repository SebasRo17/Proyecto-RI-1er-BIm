Hi I just want to flatten a function, I tied it with Joined->True, but it did not work, hope somebody of you can help me. This is my code:               Remove["Global`*"]     m = 30; (*number of banks*)     n = 5;(*number of defaults*)     AssetV = 100;(*asset value at T*)     DebtV = 80;(*debt value at T*)     μ = 0.2;(*annual drift*)     σ = 0.3;(*annual volatility*)     T = 5;(*years*)     ρ = 0.8;      Since I want to use a BinomialDistribution I calculated the individual probabilities through:               P = (CDF[NormalDistribution[], -(Log[             AssetV/DebtV] + (μ - 0.5*σ^2)*T)/(σ*Sqrt[           T])])      In the following I generated a table where I wanted to see the probabilities where k=n1, varies from 0 to 30 since n=30, and this is given by:               data1 = Table[       Probability[x >= n1,         x \[Distributed] BinomialDistribution[30, P]], {n1, 0, 30, 1}]      In order to plot the probabilities I entered:               Plot[Probability[x >= n1,        x \[Distributed] BinomialDistribution[30, P]], {n1, 0, 30},       PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {"# of Defaults", "PD"},       Filling -> Axis]      and now I just want to flatten this function. I tried it with Joined-True, which did not work out. I want also to show the density by:               DiscretePlot[PDF[BinomialDistribution[30, P], n1], {n1, 0, 30},       PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {"# of Defaults", "PD"},       Joined -> True]      However, is there the possibility to implement data1=Table[...] into the two functions, would it be then possible to generate the plot by the ListLinePlot function? thank you for your help.
