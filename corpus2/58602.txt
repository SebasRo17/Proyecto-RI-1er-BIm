I tried to use `Glow` to create a neon light effect on a torus object. The result shown on the left of the picture below looks quite different from the real one on the right. Is there a way to obtain a better result?               (* Assuming the .obj file located in the root of c: *)     model =  Import["c:\\torus.obj"] ;      Graphics3D[{Glow[Cyan], First[model ] }, Boxed -> False ,      Background -> Black       ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vlTwC.jpg)
