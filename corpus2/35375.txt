I was always confused about header files. They are so strange: you include .h file which doesn't include .cpp but .cpp are somehow compiled too. Recently I joined a team project, and of course, both .h and .cpp are used.   I understand that this is very important, but I can't live with copy-pasting every function declaration in each of multiple classes we have. How do I handle the 2-file convention efficiently?   Are there any tools to help with that, or automatically change one file that looks like example below to .h and .cpp? (specifically for MS VC++ 2010)               class A     {     ...         Type f(Type a,Type b)         {             //implementation here, not in another file!         }     ...     };          Type f(Type a)     {          //implementation here     }     ...
