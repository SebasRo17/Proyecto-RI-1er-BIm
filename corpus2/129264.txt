I realize this idea might seem really foreign but I started thinking about this a bit back. Far as web sites go, at least in my experience, there is far more time spent retyping things to a String than the other way around. For instance: Say you have a user model:               user        int UserId      And I wanted to log the user in:               View  -> string to int -> controller -> int to dbInt -> database -> dbint to int -> controller -> int to string -> View      At no point in that whole exchange did I need an int. The one typing I did need was with the database, but that's just kind of expected. Now if I wanted to show a list of users based on a group id, the same thing happens except that UserId conversion happens for how many there are on the list and in the end it will just be represented as a string in the UI. Now I understand that a string might be larger memory wise than some types (bool for example) but is this more costly than all the typing that happens? Could it be more productive to only type when needed (Validating a number, date, ect) and just leave them as strings for the most part?
