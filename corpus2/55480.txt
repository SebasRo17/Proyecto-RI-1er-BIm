I feel a bit uncomfortable with Mathematica 10's layout. I mean, I'm impressed how powerful functional programming can be and so on, but it's me or those programs are often just a bunch of nested functions with no way to make out which is the argument to whom? So, is there a way to split every function prototype in a column - with correct indentation - by DEFAULT? So to get, for example: ![indented](http://imageshack.com/a/img539/5096/dc2bbe.gif) instead of this: ![not indented](http://imageshack.com/a/img742/6458/5cf4bf.gif) That'd make everything easier - for me, at least. You may think I'm another of those "traditional coders" who can't stand the change, and yes, a sort of... But who cares? Any help, guys?
