While working with asp.net, I came to an approach that uses asp.net services for the data/business logic layer and html/javascript/jquery for the UI layer, because I could not reach the needed level of customization of the user interface with asp.net web controls. While I've seen plenty of books describing usage of asp.net web controls and their integration with asp.net server side technology, and of html/js/jQuery client side web development without connection to any server side technology, I haven't seen any book dealing with combination of asp.net server side + html/js/jQuery client side. My question is, is this approach acceptable, or have I overlooked some widespread technology which is better suited to accomplishing such tasks? My constraint is that it has to be based on asp.net/mvc server side technology, because my management urges that.
