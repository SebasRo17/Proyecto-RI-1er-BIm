I was wondering whether the community utilizes automation tests to the extent of UI? Is there some common best practices for testing UI? Also - the product I'm working on is flex-based. I would love to get ideas how to test it. Mainly I want to test:   1. Data appears on the screen as expected   2. Field validations (for example: field is not a number) are working as expected   3. Alignment of fields And so on
