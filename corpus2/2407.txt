I am learning Mathematica and the Image Processing functions. I have the following `Manipulate` procedure which works fine:               helix = Import["/Users/dmcleod/imgs/helix_spitzer_720.jpg"];          Manipulate[      w = ImageAdjust[helix, {contrast, brightness, gamma}],      {{contrast, 0}, -1, 5, 0.01, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {{brightness, 0}, -1, 5, 0.01, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {{gamma, 1}, 1, 10, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      Delimiter,      "Histogram",      Dynamic[ImageHistogram[w, Appearance -> "Separated",         ImageSize -> 250]],      ControlPlacement -> Left      ]      My question is: In addition to `ImageAdjust` how can I add a slider to perform `Sharpen[]`, and another slider to perform `GaussianFilter[]`. Both functions (i.e. `Sharpen`, and `GaussianFilter`) must update the image helix. Is this possible? Can someone provide a simple example how to do this? Sorry, I just don't see how to add the additional sliders that call separate functions.
