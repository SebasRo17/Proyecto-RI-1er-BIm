I am considering writing a new software product. Performance will be critical, so I am wary of using an interpreted or language or one that uses a emulation layer (read java). Which leads me to thinking of using C (or C++) however these are both rather long in the tooth. I haven't used either for a long time. I figure in the last 20 years someone should have created something which is reasonably popular and is nice to code in and is complied. What more modern alternatives are there to C for writing high performance code compiled code? _edit in response to comments_ If C++ is a different beast than it was 15 years ago, I would consider it, I guess I had an assumption that it had some inherent problems. Parallelisation would be important, but probably not across multiple machines. _edit after giving tick_ given the tick to zxcdw but thanks for all the c++11 is worth a look answers.
