I often need to do some operations in a loop and some other operations between the iterations. A simple example would be collecting words from an array into a string, spelled backwards and separated with commas. Is there an idiom or language support for this in any language? (For now i am mostly interested in Ruby.) I usually do something like               a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']     s = ''     n = a.size - 1     i = 0     loop do       s << a[i].reverse       break if i == n       s << ', '       i += 1     end      But i know no way to save this half iteration if using a ruby iterator:               s = ''     ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'].each do |w|       s << w.reverse       # ???     end
