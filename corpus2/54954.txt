Kamke's differential equation #574 has a solution, but Mathematica generates an error message as it tries to solve it. It still gives the solution. My question is: What could have caused Mathematica to generate these errors? Trying this on Maple, it gives also the solution shown with no error message. Should Mathematica have generated these error messages?
