I'm in a team where I am the only Java developer. The rest of the team are VERY experienced in their own programming language, but their area of expertise is not object orientated. I found the first time that I had a code review, it was a lengthy process that involved a lot of tangents about how Java works, or how OOP works etc. The second time, we got caught up on something and they had to bail as it was taking too long. **How can I make this process easier**?   I desperately want my code reviewed as I myself am quite new to Java programming, and really to programming in general, but this is taking a long time (especially as, for instance I'm writing quite large chunks of code by refactoring old code that the last Java dev worked on).
