I'm very new to python and (coming from Java) am trying to think in a "pythonic" way. I'm having trouble understanding how Django turns a function (or variable) name given in string to the actual function. Example from Django tutorial: If we give:               list_display = ('question', 'pub_date', 'was_published_recently')      Django reads the function and some related properties from the code:               def was_published_recently(self):             return self.pub_date >= timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=1)         was_published_recently.admin_order_field = 'pub_date'         was_published_recently.boolean = True         was_published_recently.short_description = 'Published recently?'      **So, my question: How does the string get turned into the actual function name?**
