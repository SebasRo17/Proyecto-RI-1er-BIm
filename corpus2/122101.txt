I decided to improve my knowledge in template meta-programming. I know the syntax and rules and been playing with counteless examples from online resources. I understand how powerful templates can be and how much compile time optimization they can provide but I still cant "think in templates", I can't seem to know by myself if a certain problem could be best solved with templates and if it can, how to adapt that problem to templates. Is there some kind of online resource or book that teaches how to identify problems that could best be solved with templates and how to adapt that problem?
