We have an enormous number of nested SQL stored procedures, and a number of different ways of debugging them (varying from developer to developer). So far, our methods include:   1. An optional `@debug` parameter, that causes the procedure to `print`messages as it runs (passing the variable down to called procedures).   2. Checking `@@servername` against a table of test server names, and `print`ing as above   3. Writing everything the procedure does to a log table (in production and test) Which of these is preferable (and why), or is there a better method we've overlooked?
