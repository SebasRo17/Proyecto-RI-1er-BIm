I'm a solo iOS developer - mostly self taught, but have made several successful apps so far and potentially starting some slightly bigger projects. ## What I want to do: As I'm working on some bigger and more complex apps now, there's some things that I want to do - which from what I gather, repositories are what I should be looking at. Basically, I want to:   * Online backup of all my code (for now, dropBox works fine)   * Work on new features of apps, while somehow being able to update/bugfix the older version and have the changes applied to both versions So, are repositories what I should be looking into? From the brief look I've had, it does look like a bit of a learning curve, with the downside that I could only do work when an internet connection is available (sometimes not the case). ## Is there: any alternative to repositories that would achieve the 'branching'/new features - e.g. is there any way to already achieve this using Xcode and not relying on some server? This would be the easier option in my case. Alternatively, if there isn't: What repository system would be best for me, and easiest to use (and probably free!)?
