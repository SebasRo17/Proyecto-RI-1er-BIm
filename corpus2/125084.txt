I'm trying to understand the difference (if any) between the two. According to the Wikipedia page for Multiple Dispatch it is synonymous with Function Overloading, but then later on goes on to say: > In a language with only single dispatch, such as Java [â€¦] which seems like a contradiction, since Java does support function overloading. So which is it? Is Multiple Dispatch different from Function Overloading, or is the article wrong in claiming that Java does not support Multible Dispatch?
