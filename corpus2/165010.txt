I never know where it's acceptable to post something like this, so please forgive if it's in the wrong place. I'm very interested in going further in to web development; I know a bit of javascript, a bit of php, and so forth, but I'm now seeing these services that will go from psd to wordpress for 200 bucks and I'm wondering how the hell is anyone able to compete with this? So I'm wondering if those more knowledgeable than me could tell me what areas are the least likely to be able to be outsourced, for 5 bucks to some kid in Uzbekistan( no offense to that kid).. do you think it's on the database management side, or maybe app development? ideas appreciated.
