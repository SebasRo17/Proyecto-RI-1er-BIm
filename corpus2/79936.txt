Is it considered impolite to file a bug report against an abandoned open- source project, or an abandoned branch of a still-continuing project? Is it perceived as making a request of the former author(s) of the project, which they're no longer willing to fulfil, or are bug reports merely seen as a description of the current version of the software, which may be fixed by a different person in the future?
