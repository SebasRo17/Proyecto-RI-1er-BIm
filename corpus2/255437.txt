I am planning to develop a web based **invoicing** application. It will be used by individuals to log and review their invoices. Their data must be saved to a common database but kept separate from other logins (ie data must not shared across users/logins). I suspect I will need the following...   1. a login page / authentication   2. forms to enter an individual's unique customers and items   3. a form to enter invoices   4. solid reporting tools / dashboard capabilities The current knowledge base is Microsoft suite (ie C#, .Net) **Can anyone advise the best RAD Tools / environment to achieve this outcome? Cheers!**
