# Background Looking to develop a WYSIWYG editor for ordered lists so that people can directly edit lists of instructions on a web page. # Problem The `contentEditable` attribute is woefully immature for editing ordered lists (e.g., `<ol contentEditable="true">...</ol>`). I discovered four bugs in Firefox 25.0.1 within seconds of editing; Chromium was acceptable; IE8+ will likely border on nightmarish. A number of inline editors exist, and I've gone through almost all of them. Even the lightest-weight editors are far too heavy, or have too many bugs, for accomplishing such a seemingly simple task. # Question What approach would you take to developing a browser-based WYSIWYG inline editor for enumerated lists? Some of my ideas have included:   * Take the most robust inline editor and trim back all needless functionality.   * Build up an inline editor that meets my needs. Both approaches will be time-consuming. What other approaches are worth considering?
