Suppose you have a matrix (mxn), simplified for illustration               m= {{a, b, c}, {d, e, f}}       And a set of combinations (simplified for illustration purposes but can contain more combinations...)               combinations = {{1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, -1}, {1, -1, 1}, {1, -1, -1}, {-1, 1, 1}, {-1, 1, -1}, {-1, -1, 1}, {-1, -1, -1}}      What is the best way to derive a matrix that holds all the combinations of the matrix m? As an illustration:               m1 = {{a, b, c}, {a, b, -c}, {a, -b, c} … … …  {-d,-e,-f} }
