We have a WCF Service (self-hosted) which can receive several types of calls from the outside, each call encapsulates a business logic procedure. We need to construct a web application which will act as an administrating app, for all users of the service. So we need to have access to all inner-entities of the service and not just the business calls. How should this be done the most effective way? **EDIT:** I wasn't too specific because I see this as a general issue. our Customers are retailers which have clients of their own, so when I say Customer, it's our client and when I say Client - it's our client's client. **Example:**   * Service X allows registered clients of Customers to commit transactions.   * there are several transaction types.   * the service receives the transactions from several different devices.   * The service is a WCF self hosted service. The Customer, needs to register devices for use, register different configurations for different devices and many other registering and administrating which needs to be done. All of this is done in a website. **The website users are the Customers, the Retailers, not the end clients** So as I see it I have these options   1. Reference the dll which holds all service-related entities - this is ok now because the website and the service are on the same machine, but what if this changes? is this a good approach?   2. Make service calls for all of this registering and administrating, which I'm not even sure how it should be done. So, I need your help in understanding the best way to do this...
