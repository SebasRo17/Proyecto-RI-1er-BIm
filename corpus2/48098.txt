I'm working on a Dynamic ListPlot with a few thousand plots, and it seems that wrapping the points with Tooltip slows the Dynamic responsiveness substantially. With the simple example below, dragging the Slider is sluggish. If you change the Show line from "plot1" to "plot2", the Slider response is smooth. Notice that the ListPlot and Tooltips are not being modified by the Control. Maybe Show is muddling things when it combines the graphics, but still, the slowdown doesn't make sense to me, since Tooltip isn't active during the drag, and isn't changing in any way.               x = Table[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, .5], 2], {i, 5000}];     boxPts[x_] := {{x, x}, {-x, x}, {-x, -x}, {x, -x}};     plot1 = ListPlot[MapIndexed[Tooltip[#1, First[#2]] &, x]];     plot2 = ListPlot[x];     Control[{{z, .5}, 0, 1.5}]     overlay = Graphics[{Opacity[.2],         FilledCurve[{{Line[boxPts[1.5]]}, {Dynamic[Line[boxPts[z]]]}}]}];     Show[overlay, plot1, PlotRange -> 1.5, AspectRatio -> 1]      ![Output of above code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5F7EJ.png) I'd prefer to be able to use Tooltip, if it's fixable, or at least understand why it's so slow. I'd also be interested in any alternative methods for doing mouseover-style feedback, which could show up inside or outside the plot area. Thank you! (This is in Mma 9.0.1 on OSX 10.8.5, on a 2012 MBP.) Update: I noticed that if I execute the Control line _after_ the Show line with plot1, the Slider works smoothly. I then noticed that merely moving the cursor away to a new point can make the Control work normally. This only makes a difference with the plot that has Tooltips, since the other is always smooth.
