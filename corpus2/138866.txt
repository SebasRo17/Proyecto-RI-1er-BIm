I have a MMOG server running on C++, using winsockets. My server won't support more than 200 players. I had the idea of redesigning it so it will use multiple servers instead of one, so, maybe, for example, each server could take care of a number of players, and, if it was too laggy, it could transfer the responsability of that player to other server. I'm not sure of how to program a consistent game logic like that, though. Are there techniques for this?
