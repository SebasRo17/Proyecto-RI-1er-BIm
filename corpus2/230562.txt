I have content that is CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 (see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/), can software that uses it still be produced commercially and just let the user download the content separately? In other words, if I have commercial software that uses the content with CC license, can the software still be distributed as commercial and just not be distributed with that content... OR, would that still violate that CC license and the software therefore can't be commercially sold? If someone knows the answer or can point me to a place to find out the answer, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!
