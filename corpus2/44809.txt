The task is to identify the image region of the tumor. ![tomography of kidneys with tumor \(white area on the left kidney\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mZ4fR.jpg) I try to use example from documentation centre:               tom1 = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/mZ4fR.jpg"];     tumor = SelectComponents[               DeleteBorderComponents[ Binarize[ tom1, {0.75, 1}]],                {"Area", "Holes"}, 2800 < #1 < 2900 && #2 > 0 &];     circle = ComponentMeasurements[                 ImageMultiply[ tom1, tumor],                 {"Centroid", "EquivalentDiskRadius"}][[All, 2]];     Show[ tom1, Graphics[{Red, Thick, Circle @@ # & /@ circle}]]      but get unsatisfactory result: ![tumor detection](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NoUAu.png) i try to identify tumor like this but selection was noisy:               SelectComponents[       DeleteBorderComponents[ Binarize[ tom1, {0.75, 1}]],        {"Area", "Holes"}, 2800 < #1 < 2900 && #2 > 0 &]      ![tumor](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6YIGK.png) So, can you help me to make clearer allocation of the tumor and then calculate the area of ​​selection?
