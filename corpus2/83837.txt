When working on a project, the code may be developed reasonably fast in a single day or bit by bit for a prolonged period of few weeks/months/years. As code commits are becoming to be considered as a measure of project development, it doesn't really mean it has more code written than a project that has lesser commits. So the question is when to really make a commit to the repository so that the commit is justifiable? As a add-on: Is it a correct practice to measure a project's development based on its commits?
