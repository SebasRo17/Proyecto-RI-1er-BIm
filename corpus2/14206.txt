I'm a student of web development languages like PHP, Ruby, and Python. Currently I'm working on some school projects but I'm trying to work on some weekend projects which I can use to showcase for potential employers, what's the best way to set this up? Specifically, are there any tips you have for a new programmer because I don't want opinions on how this or that should or shouldn't be set up. If possible please give real examples. **Edit:** what about Git? Is this a good place to show my projects?
