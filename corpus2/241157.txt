In Java 6               Class<? extends ArrayList<?>> a = ArrayList.class;      gives and error, but               Class<? extends ArrayList<?>> b = (Class<? extends ArrayList<?>>)ArrayList.class;      gives a warning. Why is (a) an error? What is it, that Java needs to do in the assignment, if not the cast shown in (b)? And why isn't `ArrayList` compatible with `ArrayList<?>` I know one is "raw" and the other is "generic", but what is it you can do with an `ArrayList<?>` and not with an `ArrayList`, or the other way around?
