Is there a way to set the number of colors used in ListDensityPlot. I am using "Rainbow" as follows:               ShowLegend[     ListDensityPlot[TestList, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow"],     {ColorData["Rainbow"][1 - #1] &, 10,      ToString[LMax], ToString[LMin], LegendPosition -> {1.1, -.4}}]      TestList is a list like {{x1,y1,z1},{x2,y2,z2},...} In the Legend, to get 5 colors, I can change the 10 above to 5, and I get 5 colors. I would like to do the same in ListDensityPlot as well and get 5 colors. Can someone tell me how to do this? Thanks. Shrihari
