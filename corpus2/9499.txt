_Warning: possibly dumb question :-(_ I have two functions I want to plot with the `Filling` option, like:               Plot[{Sin[t], Cos[t]}, {t, 0, 4 Pi}, Filling -> Axis]      That's OK. But if I only want the sine filled, and try               Plot[{Sin[t], Cos[t]}, {t, 0, 4 Pi}, Filling -> {Axis, None}]      MMA returns error messages that `Axis` and `None` are not valid Filling specifications. How can I selectively apply `Filling`?
