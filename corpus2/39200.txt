In this comment it was asserted that `Divide[a,b]` and `a/b` are different, though the documentation indicates that they are the same. In particular, it was asserted that `a/b` is evaluated as `a * 1/b`, whereas `Divide[a,b]` performs the division directly. It was further asserted that this could result in an observable difference in behavior for machine-precision numbers. The question is: is there a difference? If so, what is it exactly? How does it manifest itself? Is there an example where `Divide` gives a different result than `/`? I tried a few edge cases with `$MaxMachineNumber` and `$MinMachineNumber`, but didn't find any differences in behavior between the two.
