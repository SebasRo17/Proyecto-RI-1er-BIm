I'm a bit of a jester so the idea of an easter egg still appeals to me. I have added them in my code before but my group of friends has a running joke of using CTRL-FU to trigger the egg. Now I'm also a bit paranoid about performance so I like removing excess whenever possible. This heavily contradicts with easter eggs as they are 100% superfluous code. What arguments are there against easter eggs? Also, are there any arguments to even support easter eggs?
