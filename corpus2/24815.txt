First I tried it directly, but it overflowed:               In[1]:= 2^3^2^3^5^8 < 3^2^2^7^6^7     During evaluation of In[1]:= General::ovfl: Overflow occurred in computation. >>     During evaluation of In[1]:= General::ovfl: Overflow occurred in computation. >>          Out[1]= Indeterminate < Indeterminate      Using double `Log` did not help either:               In[2]:= Log[Log[2]] + Log[3] 2^3^5^8 < Log[Log[3]] + Log[2] 2^7^6^7       During evaluation of In[2]:= General::ovfl: Overflow occurred in computation. >>     During evaluation of In[2]:= General::ovfl: Overflow occurred in computation. >>          Out[2]= Overflow[] < Overflow[]      Then I tried to use the `WolframAlpha` function, and it seemed to be able to handle this and even much higher towers:               In[3]:= WolframAlpha["2^3^2^3^5^8 < 3^2^2^7^6^7", "MathematicaForms"][[2, 1]]     Out[3]= True          In[4]:= WolframAlpha["2^2^5^2^7^4^9^3^7^6^9^9^9^9^3^2 < 3^3^6^3^9^4^2^3^2^2^2^2^2^3^3^3", "MathematicaForms"][[2, 1]]     Out[4]= True      But then I discovered that it failed to perform certain comparisons:               In[5]:= WolframAlpha["4^6^8^8^9 < 3^2^3^3^3", "MathematicaForms"]     Out[5]= {}      And sometimes even gave wrong answers, even in seemingly trivial cases:               In[6]:= WolframAlpha["3^3^3^3^3 < 4^4^3^3^3", "MathematicaForms"][[2, 1]]     Out[6]= False      Can anybody suggest a correct and robust method to compare two expressions given in the form `Hold[a^b^...^z]`, where `a,b,...,z` are positive integers?
