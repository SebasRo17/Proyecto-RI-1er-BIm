We are using Tornado for our system (behind nginx) -- and everything is working fine. Now we need to integrate a client lib (for Neo4j Graph DB) into our system. The problem is that it is blocking. My question is:   * is it OK to use blocking libs in non-blocking environment   * what are the possible ramifications if we do so   * how much work is involved if we decide to roll our own async lib I know there is Node that does everything in non-blocking fashion. But we can't go there because our core is written in Python.
