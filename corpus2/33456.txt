I am trying to force mathematica to solve a generally defined function for d lp: In a reduced version, `w` depends on `l2`, `lp` and `t`. `l2` and `lp` depend on `t`. Furthermore, `w` is constant with respect to `t`. So, I did               Solve[Dt[w[l2, lp, t], t] == 0, Dt[lp, t]]      which works. The problem is that the dynamics of `l2` do not depend on `w`, so they can be defined by:               l2[t_] := l20*E^(p*t)      where l20 is a constant. So, I tried the following:               l2[t_] := l20*E^(p*t)     Solve[Dt[w[l2, lp, t], t, Constants -> {l20, p}] == 0, Dt[lp, t]]      which did not help. Second try was this one,               Solve[Dt[w[l20*E^(p*t), lp, t], t, Constants -> {l20, p}] == 0, Dt[lp, t]]      which did not help either. Does anybody have an idea?
