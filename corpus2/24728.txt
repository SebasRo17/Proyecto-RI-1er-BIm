I just started to work with a database through _Mathematica_. I have a large data set. I use an `.mx` file to store my data. Now I have to store the data in a database, I have installed Microsoft SQL server 2012 in my system. My problem is I don't know how I should store my big list of data in the database. My options seem to be   1. store the mx file in database and retrieve it using SQL command in _Mathematica_   2. create a column in a database table and insert an element from my data list into each row. I tried the SQL route to insert the `.mx` file into the database, since I thought that would be better than inserting the list element-by-element.               insert into test select * from openrowset(bulk 'I:\MsSql\test.mx', single_blob) as test1       I executed the above line in Microsoft SQL server 2012. It appeared to work, but when I tried to retrieve my data set from the database table through _Mathematica_ , I got results that look like a big sublist containing some random numbers and characters. > {{282A546869732069732061......}} I have googled it, but I couldn't find a useful answer. Please explain what I did wrong or refer to me to good material I can learn from.
