I trying to do a tensor problem but for simplification I'll only ask for assistance with one simple part. I set my variables using subscripts like so.. $Subscript[y, 1] = - .23556;$ But when I try to do a simple exponential like this $(Subscript[y, 1])^2$ I get as an output $(-0.23556 + TextCell[""])^2$ I have no clue why this problem persists but I can't seem to figure out the solution. Sorry if this has a simple solution, this is the first time I have used mathematica like so.
