The code is a complete mess of a combination of classic ASP/ASP.NET. The scrum consist of us patching up the big mess or making additions to it. We are all too busy doing that to start a rewrite so I am wondering.. Where is the part in Scrum where the developers can have the power to say that enough is enough and demand that they are given time to start the big rewrite? We seem in an endless loop of just patching old code with 'Stories'. So things are being run by the non-technical people who seem to have no desire to push for a rewrite because they don't understand how bad the codebase has gotten.. So who is in charge of making this big rewrite change happen? The developers? The Scrum Master? The current strategy is just to find time and do it ourselves without the higher-ups involved since they are mostly to blame for the current mess we are in.. `<-` insert rant about non-technical people telling technical people what to do here `->`.
