After a round of interviews earlier this year, which included some practical questions with access to a computer, I noticed that, at least for the applicants we were seeing, there was a high inverse correlation between quality of applicant and the explicit choice of Bing/IE as the stack for search/browsing the web. That is, a large number of applicants specifically searched for IE to use as a browser when browsing the web, and specifically used Bing as the search engine (even typing in Bing in the Google search box, before starting a search) Is this just an outlier, a fluke, or is there some sort of information I can obtain from this observation? So far, my best candidates are:   * Yes, there is a high correlation between good programmers and choice of web browser/search engine   * There is some training program, or community, which advises using IE/Bing during interviews, and I just happened to run into a poor selection from that group   * Something else is going on, that I don't know about, but someone here might know. So, to repeat, the question is: is there more than coincidence at work here, and, if there is, what's going on?
