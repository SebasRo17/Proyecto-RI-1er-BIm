Define               d[p1_, p2_] := (p1 - p2).(p1 - p2)      to be the square of the distance between two points. I am trying to solve equations like:               Solve[{d[{p1, q1}, {0, 0}] == 1, d[{p2, q2}, {0, 0}] == 1, d[{p1, q1}, {p2, q2}] == 1,      d[{p2, q2}, {x, x}] == 1, d[{p1, q1}, {x, x}] == 1}, {p1, q1, p2, q2, x}]      I get 12 solutions. But when I approximate these solutions with:               NSolve[{d[{p1, q1}, {0, 0}] == 1, d[{p2, q2}, {0, 0}] == 1, d[{p1, q1}, {p2, q2}] == 1,      d[{p2, q2}, {x, x}] == 1, d[{p1, q1}, {x, x}] == 1}, {p1, q1, p2, q2, x}]      I only get 4 of the solutions. What gives? For larger number of equations, it takes too long to use Solve[ ] and then N[ ] the result. Erich
