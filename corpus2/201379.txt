Throughout my life I've accumulated a fair share of scripts that have proven to be useful to me in many cases and might be useful to many others. I look at things like todo.txt (which probably started off as just someone's personal text file manager) and even simpler ones online and sometimes I feel like I want to put my stuff out there for people who are looking for it to be able to use, open source. What's the best way to just put things out there where people who might want to find it would find it? Should I start a well-read blog? post in forums? I don't want to advertise or spam it, just have it in some kind of way where anyone who would might be looking for something of similar functionality would find it through google or something.
