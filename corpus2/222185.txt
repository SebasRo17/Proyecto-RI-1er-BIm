I am currently working on an application (basically its a kind of execution engine capable of running user defined jobs and generate output in real time) that needs to handle rollback functionality, it might sound crazy but is it possible to have such thing at the application level? e.g. imagine some user tries run a job J1 and once it is started to execute he wanted to Edit/Modify it ,      \- that means the current running job has to be killed,   \- all the action taken so far must be reverted and   \- re-run the job J1 again few things that comes in my mind is we must anyhow store or maintain application states somehow, somewhere and then call the rollback stuff along with the previous save points. I was reading few articles on DB level rollback but the scenario does not fit in this case as it need to work on a real time environment. But I am unable to find a proper approach as to how to proceed and what else should be taken into considerations. Please let me know if this sounds unclear, I shall try to provide more info if possible. Any help or advice?
