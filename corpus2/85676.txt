I never learnt anything about VB6 (and I dont want to) but I wanted to search for bad things in computer software, so my first though was VB6. So for example, VB6 was strongly typed with late binding. Makes some sense to have a language with that combination? (I dont think so). I want to know reasons of why VB6 was like this! or why is good idea for a lenguage to be like this. Bad things that happend with a lengugage like this? good things?
