While I've come across several ways to implement/enable autosave (see: Is there a notebook autosave frequency configuration?, Saving my code before cell evaluations: Insurance against front end hanging, How can I set up a versioning system within a notebook?), I've never found a reason why it isn't enabled by default. It seems incredibly useful to me - surely there must be some good reason why Wolfram chose to leave it unconfigured! Why isn't autosave enabled by default?
