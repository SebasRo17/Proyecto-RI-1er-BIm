I currently have a web app hosted in Azure, with a few worker background jobs. My goal is for a user to click print on a page, and to them the printer will magically start printing a document(for security purposes). The setup will look something like this:                    Azure           |     _____________     |     |     |     B1    B2    B3      Where each 'B' is a building. When a user from B2 clicks on a web app to print a document, the document will start printing in the designated printer in B2. Each building is on its own network when it comes to workstations and computers. I'm not 100% sure how to approach this. One option is to have a Windows task running on each workstation that will continuously ping blob storage for new documents. If one shows up if will start printing. This is probably the easiest route but seems like it would be maintenance hell for 100+ buildings. It also seems like a waste when there may only be one document a day. Are there any other options for printing a document in such a fashion?
