I am making a game using LWJGL and this is their license. What I don't understand is what must I do? I plan on making a game and distributing it, not the source code just the .jar file and maybe sell it for a few dollars. It said that I must retain the copyright, so would that mean I must include the doc folder that the library comes with in the jar or do I have to make something in-game like credits and say "made with LWJGL"?
