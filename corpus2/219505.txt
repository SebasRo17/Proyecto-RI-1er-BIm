Do you think it is a good practice to use function return values as if conditions? I'm coding in PHP atm but it holds for many other languages.               if(isTheConditionMet($maybeSomeParams))     {     }      or               $res = isTheConditionMet($maybeSomeParams);     if($res)     {     }      I can't think of a situation where the first one creates a problem, can it? EDIT: Assume return value is not going to be used after condition is evaluated.
