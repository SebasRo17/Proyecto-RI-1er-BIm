I am trying to write a function that read what is the FrameLabel of a plot and translates that to filesystem friendly name, that, for instance does not contain "/" or greek characters and so on ... The goal is to get a function that exports a plot to PDF and automatically gives it a meaningful file name of the type XAxisLabel_YAxisLabel_PlotLabel.pdf Here is what I got so far. 1) a translation for unwanted character and strings:                 FileSystemFriendly={\left->,\right->,\text{->,$->,\{->,\}->, ->,\->,{->,}->,/->.over.,>->.gt.,<->.lt.,=->.eq.}      2) a function that actually takes the plot and looks for the labels                 PlotAutoExport[inputplot_]:=Module[{res,respath},           res=Export[StringReplace[ToString[TeXForm[FrameLabel/. inputplot[[2]]]],FileSystemFriendly]<>__<>StringReplace[ToString[TeXForm[PlotLabel/. inputplot[[2]]]],FileSystemFriendly]<>.pdf,inputplot];           Print[File put in,respath=Directory[]<>/<>res];           Button[Open it!,SystemOpen[respath]]         ]      This is giving some acceptable results so far, which means that the filenames are usable on a regular filesystem. However the typical name is plenty of garbage, for instance for a very simple label I still get `(beginarraycc1-Cumulative&Nonep_T,j_ 3&Noneendarray)__PlotLabel` which has lots of stuff that I do not know where it comes from. I could chase and remove one by one the unwanted stuff but I feel like I am not doing it the right way. Hence I wanted to ask for some advice. Thanks for sharing your knowledge, Roberto
