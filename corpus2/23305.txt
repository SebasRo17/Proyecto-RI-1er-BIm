What does it mean if this message appears: > {Im[(1-E^Times[<<3>>] f)/(1-Power[<<2>>] f)]-0,Im[(1-E^Times[<<3>>] > f)/(1-Power[<<2>>] f)]-0} must be a list of equalities or real-valued > functions. >> while Iam trying to plot this complex function               (I α)/π (Log[(1 - E^(-((I π(1 - α))/α)) f) / (1 - E^((I π(1 - α))/α) f)])      How can I plot this function for the range {α, 0.1, 1} and {f, 0.2, 1}? ### Edit Corrected errors in the expression to be plotted.
