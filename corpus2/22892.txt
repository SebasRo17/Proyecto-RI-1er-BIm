Imagine the following scenario: user A is developing a project with documentation in workbench. She wants to give her (unfinished) work to user B , so that user B can continue work on the project and eventually deploy it on her PC. The 2 users might have different operating systems. What is the best way to accomplish this? WRI does something similar when it offers sample projects online. We "import" the project into our WB. So in the above scenario, user B has to "import" the project, in order to make it work in her WB. What is not too clear to me is what is that user A has to do. One would think that user A has to "export" the project, but there are many different (and unclear to me) options available for exporting a project. So, even assuming that "export" is the right thing to do, what precisely is the correct procedure? I performed a couple of experiments and it seems to me that the end result of some of these "export" options, generate folders or archives which have a different file structure than the original project folder has. Hence my question.
