From what I can see `PolynomialQ` will return `False` whenever some exponent is another variable such as here:                   PolynomialQ[x^n, x]      Is there an alternative test that will return `True` for such a polynomial? **Motivation:** In another thread I need to use               Product[x^k (1 - x^k), {k, 1, n}]      for which _Mathematica_ returns:               x^(1/2 n (1 + n)) QPochhammer[x, x, n]      However those two forms do not expand in the same way, for instance with $n=3$:               With[{n = 3},       Expand[{x^(1/2 n (1 + n)) QPochhammer[x, x, n], Product[x^k (1 - x^k), {k, 1, n}]}]]     (* {x^6 QPochhammer[x, x, 3], x^6 - x^7 - x^8 + x^10 + x^11 - x^12} *)      Indeed, _Mathematica_ treats only the second expression as a polynomial:               With[{n = 3}, PolynomialQ[#, x] & /@        {x^(1/2 n (1 + n)) QPochhammer[x, x, n], Product[x^k (1 - x^k), {k, 1, n}]}]     (* {False, True} *)      even if I specify that n is integer as follows               f[x_, n_Integer] := x^(1/2 n (1 + n)) QPochhammer[x, x, n];     PolynomialQ[f[n], x]     (* False *)
