Here is a list that was orignially output from Fortran.               {{"(0.277336296055697, 0.120000000000000E+000)"},       {"(-1.489297392708939E-002, 0.340000000000000E+000)"}}      which is to be interpreted as a list of two complex numbers. Of course, _Mathematica_ does not understand this, so, I would like to convert it into something like               {{0.277336296055697 + 0.12I}, {-0.01489297392708939 + 0.34I}}      Can I do this programmatically in _Mathematica_?
