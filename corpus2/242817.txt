I want to make a non-english programming language that is identical to what CoffeeScript is to JavaScript. What I mean is that I don't want to build my own design or syntax. Just want to have a non-english programming language that compiles to JavaScript. I want to follow everything CoffeeScript fellows so I don't really want to make any design decisions. For example: This is coffeescript:               number   = 42     opposite = true          number = -42 if opposite      I want my language to be something like:               رقم = 42     عكس = صحيح          رقم = -42 إذا عكس      that get compiled to:               var number, opposite;          number = 42;          opposite = true;          if (opposite) {       number = -42;     }
