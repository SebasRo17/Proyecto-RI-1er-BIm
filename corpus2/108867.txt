For the sake of argument:   * Let's assume the application we are building is an amortization schedule.    * Let's also assume that the database has a table called tblAmortizationPayments that stores the information about each monthly payment in a separate row.    * Let's further assume that the database language can support the math calculations needed to perform the calculations. If you were to build this amortization schedule for a 30 year mortgage, how would you decide between placing the code for performing these 360 calculations inside the database (I'm assuming this would be a stored procedure) or inside the application? I'm more interested in your thought process for making this type of decision or any similar scenario that might come along.
