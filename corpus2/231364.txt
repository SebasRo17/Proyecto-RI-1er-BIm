I'm coming into a project where the overlying method is to open the page, then use jquery AJAX calls to populate all of the dropdowns dynamically in the page. To me, this seems like an extra burden on the server and it looks terrible, plus the functionality seems to be limited as the user can start using the dropdowns even though they aren't loaded yet. To me, it seems to make much more sense to create a SelectList in the model and populate the dropdown in the View before the page is ever sent over to the browser. Am I missing something in my thinking here? Is there a good reason to dynamically bind the dropdown via AJAX initially?
