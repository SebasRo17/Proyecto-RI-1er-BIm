again, I have a list like this:               list={0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \     0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, \     0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, \     0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}      I want to search for the pattern: **{1,0,0}** and mark all the numbers matching this sequence in Red with the Style option. I tried to use Cases to help me out, which does not work. Checked the help a few times, but no idea so far :/               Cases[list, {1,0,0}]
