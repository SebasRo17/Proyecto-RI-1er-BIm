I have some problems converting data which I imported from a txt-file into proper Mathematica expressions. After importing my data looks like               sample = {"{3", "\"string1\"", 45, "\"string2\"", 8.32, " {2013", 8, 1, 0, 6, " 19}", "0.}"}      Now I would like to transform it into               converted = {3, "string1", 45, "string2", 8.32`, {2013, 8, 1, 0, 6, 19}, 0.}      I imported the file using `Import[file.txt,"Data"]`
