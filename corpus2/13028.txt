Although the following lines of code work fine they are very awkward. My questions are below               a = RGBColor[1, 0, 0]     b = RGBColor[0, 1, 0]      Is there a more compact way to construct ab? Can the three entries of `RGBColor[u,v,w]` be extracted as a list? Can the RGBColor argument be entered as a list RGB[{list}]?               ab = RGBColor[a[[1]] + b[[1]], a[[2]] + b[[2]], a[[3]] + b[[3]]]     Graphics[{{a, Disk[{0, .5}, .5]}, {b, Disk[{.25, .5}, .5]}, {ab,         Disk[{.5, .5}, .5]}}]
