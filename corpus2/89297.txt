I am currently working on a little language, and I'd like to express its grammar more rigorously. I know about EBNF and it's great to generate parsers (Bison/Yacc), however it's not that easy to visualize. The Wikipedia page on Syntax Diagram points out that one of the success of JSON is due to the display of its grammar as a Rail-Road diagram. Indeed if one goes to the JSON webpage, one can see nice diagrams, that are easily accessible and (I find) visually attractive, for example: ![http://json.org/object.gif](http://i.stack.imgur.com/raLaZ.gif) It easily conveys the structure of an `object` in JSON, dealing with multiple alternatives and repetitions easily. A very similar way of expressing the grammar can be found on SQLite (though I prefer the JSON one). ![http://www.sqlite.org/images/syntax/delete- stmt.gif](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Oiv6H.gif) Does anyone know if there was a tool used to generate the JSON diagrams ? (and if so, where I can find it). The wikipedia page reference some generators but none seem to generate such nice diagrams.
