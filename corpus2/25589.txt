I tried to detect the rim of the following cup as an ellipse. ![some cup](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H63BK.jpg) I've tried the solutions given in How to find circular objects in an image? to detect the ellipse, but the detection result was not quite what I wanted. The reason might be that `ChanVeseBinarize` function can't separate the rim from the body. Therefore `SelectComponents` will view the whole cup as one component and consequently detect nothing. Then I tried to use edge detection. After manipulating the parameters, I can detect the edge of the rim like this: ![edge detection attempt](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SPiTW.png) But I can't find an algorithm that detect the line of an ellipse. How might I do that?
