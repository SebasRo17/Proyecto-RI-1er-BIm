The following scenario often happens with my team at the office. Let's say we decided to plan our Sprint this way:   * 50% new features   * 50% bug fixing (they are high priority AND _unestimated_ as the fixes are easy, the hard and time-consuming bit is the investigation) The Sprint goes well and we finish all the features, say X story points, and quite a few unestimated bugs. Two questions come to mind:   1. What is our Sprint velocity? Is it X?    2. Assuming it is X; how do we plan the next Sprint using "yesterday's weather" (X story points) if we now want to do an 100% new features Sprint?
