So, my 12 year old son is interested in programming for Android. He's never done a real program before, but he did play briefly with Alice. I'm trying to figure out what the best way to introduce him to programming would be, and more specifically, if it would be better for him to just jump into Android programming, or if I should have him do Java first. Any suggestions?
