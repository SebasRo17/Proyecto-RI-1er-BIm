I want to distribute a .cdf to my students wherein they manipulate 5 locators on a graph to define various shapes. The .cdf opens with the locators in a "nice" position, but of course it is very hard to return the locators, by hand, to these positions once they have been moved. Is there a way to utilize a "Reset" button that returns all settings to the original state? The only method I can see right now is to reopen the file in the CDFPlayer.
