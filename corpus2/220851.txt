Driving instructors (at leas in Germany) often mention 100.000 km driven as a reference point where a driver is considered experienced. Is there a similar number for programmers? For example, how many lines of code does the average junior/senior developer have written when starting their job? Also: after how many lines in a specific language does one usually become an expert of that language? Of course, there are many other factors, that make up who is a good programmer and who is not, however I feel like the number of lines of code could be a pretty good indicator of hands on experience. ## Update: Originally, I asked for a number of lines of code. Of course I am aware, that it makes a big difference, what quality of code was written, in what fields etc. I would not consider any person, that has driven over 100.000km, a good driver either. And I am still convinced, that everybody needs a certain time of experience, to become a great programmer. Though hours was not the measure I was looking for, the number of hours in the answer of suhit was essentially what I wanted. A more clear version of my original question might be: After how many lines of code has a dedicated programmer, who constantly challenges himself, likely acquired enough knowledge and skill to be considered experienced?
