I have 3000 files (for example: aa101.csv, aa108.csv, aa120.csv, ...) and I need to process them. I need to load five files from a folder, process them, and export them to new list in Excel. Then I need to take another five files from the same folder and process them, and so on. I tried               printer[n_] :=        Module[{file = n},              calculation...         ...              Export[name <> ".xlsx", {data}, "Data"];       ]          printer[Import["E:\\mathematica\\a\\*", "text"]];      But `printer` loads all files from the specified folder. Could you please help me with this problem?
