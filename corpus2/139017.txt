Ok, so I have what appears to be a complex situation, and I'm wondering how to best organize it. I have limited experience with Git so I might be missing system. I have a framework developed internally. This framework is being used my ProjectX, ProjectY, and ProjectZ. If I update the core components of the framework (Located in /core and /resources) I want it updated for all of my projects. However I want to be able to update the custom components of each project and have that tracked in Git as well (All custom content is located in /app). So I'm thinking on our central server we should have a Git repository just for the core framework. This will contain the following:               core/*     resources/*     .htaccess     index.php      Then each of our projects will have their own repository on the server containing the app/ folder. Would this work with Git locally however? Can we pull the contents of two repositories to one folder? We might have `/home/brandon/projects/ProjectX`. Just looking for input on how to organize this. Also, how would we push to the live/test environments? Would SSHing into the production environment and pulling from the central repository be the way to go?
