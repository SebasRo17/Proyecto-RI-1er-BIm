I started to use the new funcationality 'Dataset'in Mathematica 10.0.                  dataset = Dataset[{           <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> "x", "c" -> {1}|>,           <|"a" -> 2, "b" -> "y", "c" -> {2, 3}|>,           <|"a" -> 3, "b" -> "z", "c" -> {3}|>,           <|"a" -> 4, "b" -> "x", "c" -> {4, 5}|>,           <|"a" -> 5, "b" -> "y", "c" -> {5, 6, 7}|>,           <|"a" -> 6, "b" -> "z", "c" -> {}|>}]      Then I get a error as show in the next image ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pjUfI.jpg) I tried the same syntax in combination with Needs["TypeSystem`"];, but wiyth the same result. Who has a suggestion to solve this issue? Thanks Michiel
