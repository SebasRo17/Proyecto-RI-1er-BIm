In my experience, it is useful to spend a little while sketching plans for a project before getting into code. Such planning usually includes choosing frameworks/tools, writing requirements and expectations, and doing mockups. I usually only do this for serious projects though, not so much for one-off or short-lived attempts. I'd be interested to hear how much time you spend on planning/designing projects before starting to do the coding. Do you do it for every project, or just the "serious" ones?
