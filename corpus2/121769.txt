I was just wondering if there were some "standard" examples that everyone uses as a basis for explaining the nature of a problem that requires the use of a buffer. What are some well-known problems in the real world that can see great benefits from using a buffer? **Also, a little background or explanation as to why the problem benefits from using a buffer, and how the buffer would be implemented, would be insightful for understanding the concept!**
