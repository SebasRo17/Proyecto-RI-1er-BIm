I have the following as the first step to a sequence.               x = 2 - GoldenRatio;     Ceiling[x + x^(1/2)]      It gets a precision exception. The value is correct, but I would like to prevent the exception. (If we subtract 0.000001 from x, everything is fine.) Is there a way to limit the precision? For one step only? Edit: the sequence where 2-GoldenRatio is the seed.               x = 2 - GoldenRatio; t = Table[(x = Ceiling[x + x^(1/2)]), {2000}];      If ceiling is removed the first step works fine. However, I need the ceiling for alternate steps. Edit2: $0 < x \leq 2-\phi$ where $\phi$ is the golden ratio. $\textit{When x = 2 - $\phi$, the first step equals $1$}$.
