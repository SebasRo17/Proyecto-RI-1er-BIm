Is there a way to directly transform an image? This works but seems klunky :               Graphics[{Translate[ Raster@ImageData@image, {x,y}], .. other graphics objects .. }]      Just wondering if there is a better way.. Per JM.s comment, you can sort of do this with `ImageForwardTransformation` I actually looked at those before asking the question and didn't think they would work, but now I went back and figured it out.. here is a simple translation:               {w, h} = ImageDimensions[img]     ImageForwardTransformation[ img , (# + {x, y}) &, Background -> 1,              DataRange -> Full, PlotRange -> {{0, w + x}, {0, h + y}}]      This creates a new larger image, large enough to contain the transformed result but still anchored with a corner at {0,0}, so isn't really equivalent to simply translating the image.
