Is there a term to describe the point at which adding more developers to a software project will provide diminishing returns? I realize that at a high level, it is more complicated that just a number of developers at which the project will be at productive capacity (ex/ state of the project, quality of the added developer), but I am trying to come up with a way to relate this to non-technical management through repetition. I'm basically looking for a term which invokes a strong mental image like "terminal velocity", except for Brook's Law.
