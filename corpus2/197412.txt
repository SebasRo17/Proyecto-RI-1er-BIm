Different types of dependencies have particular names, such as _linear dependency_ , _circular dependency_ , _self-referencing object_ , etc. What is the name of the dependency where those rules are true?   1. A has zero or more B,   2. B has zero or more C, and:   3. A has zero or more C. ![An UML diagram illustrating the relationship described above](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjRPK.png) If there is no particular name for such relationship, do you have any suggestions?
