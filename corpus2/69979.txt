I am in the research phase of a project that needs to make use of 3rd party libraries that are in Java so I am stuck using Java to at least a small degree. I am considering implementing Ruby as the front-end layer. That would leave me with the option of calling the Java classes as a web service by hitting a certain URL, is that correct? Is that generally a solid approach to things? Also, how would it affect my build environment when I create the .war file using Ant? should I have src/java and src/ruby code, or do the ruby files go somewhere else? Any tips and pitfalls on this? I am a little bit new to Ruby so advice would be appreciated. Also, I considered JRuby, but it seemed like a less mature tool that just has a JVM for a smoother calling of Java classes, correct? I am concerned with the maturity of that tool and its bein neither Java nor Ruby.
