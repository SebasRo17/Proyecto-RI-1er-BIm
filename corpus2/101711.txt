How do you recursively delete paths of the data that your app created? The deleting process itself is trivial. The question is, do you do extra validation? And if so, what kind? From one point of view, maybe it's simply an uncomfortable task to do, but on the other, imagine if the program has a bug and something passes "c:\" to the recursive function, or if there is a memory overflow and some data becomes corrupt, causing paths you work on to be truncated etc. Is there even a way to do a clean validation?
