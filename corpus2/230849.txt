Based on this book , refering to pages 156 to 159 , it talks about the two different types of software architecture model : MVC & Layered . There are distributed system architecture patterns such as : Master-Slave , 2 tier client-server , multi-tier client server , P2P These are my questions : 1) In MVC , there is the Model , View , Controller which is in essence a three layer architecture with View on top , Controller in the middle , Model on the bottom and all three layers are only able to communicate with the layers above and beneath them only which is exactly the same as layered architecture . What is the actual difference between them ?? 2) Isnt MVC a form of client server architecture ?? 3) Master-Slave seems exactly like 2 tier client-server where the server is the Master and the client is the slave , I dont understand how Master-Slave differs from Client-Server
