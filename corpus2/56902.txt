I want to be able to join two datasets by keys, pretty much like I'd do in SQL. I thought the JoinAcross function might do it, but it doesn't operate the way I thought. The example in the documentation shows:               JoinAcross[     {<|a -> 1, b -> X|>, <|a -> 2, b -> Y|>},     {<|a -> 1, c -> X|>, <|a -> 2, c -> Y|>}, Key[a]]      resulting in:               {<|a -> 1, b -> X, c -> X|>, <|a -> 2, b -> Y, c -> Y|>}      This joins down. What I need is like the following:               JoinAcross[     {<|a -> 1, b -> X|>, <|a -> 1, c -> Y|>},     {<|a -> 2, b -> XX|>, <|a -> 2, c -> YY|>}, Key[a]]      To give me:               {<|a->1, b->X, c->Y|>, <|a->2, b->XX, c->YY|>}      That's what I expect from a SQL join. Is there some way to do this with datasets, or should I go back to the "old way" of gathering things together? Also, I really would like to do this by joining on 2 keys. Not just Key[a], but something like {Key[a],Key[b]}.
