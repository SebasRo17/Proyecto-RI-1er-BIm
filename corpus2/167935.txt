This is a continuation of me rewriting GPL project. What will be the correct way of attributing my project as being a derivative of some other GPL-licensed project? So far I came up with:               HgSharp          Original Copyright Matt Mackall <mpm@selenic.com> and contributors.          The following code is a derivative work of the code from the Mercurial project,      which is licensed GPLv2. This code therefore is also licensed under the terms      of the GNU Public License, verison 2.                                                               For information on the license of this code when distributed with and used      in conjunction with the other modules in the HgSharp project, please see      the root-level COPYING file.
