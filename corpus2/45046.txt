I'm still fairly new to Java but have definite comfort now working within the framework I am used to which would mainly be focused on Spring, Hibernate and JEE 6. It seems like every time I talk to a recruiter all they do is throw around the keyword "J2EE", they need someone with J2EE experience, etc. I am aware that legacy systems would still be using J2EE but it seems like at least some jobs would be advertising JEE now. Just curious if they are just stuck with some keyword that they can't seem to wrap their heads around it having a newer version or what. Having not done Java all that long, I haven't used J2EE specifically but wouldn't it be fairly easy to adapt having used the newer enterprise edition? Just curious to hear anything about this from someone with more experience.
