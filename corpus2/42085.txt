So I want to numerically compute the integral of a long complicated expression over a specified domain (in this case an ellipse). I know how to use a Boole function to sample within the ellipse, but I want to pass a list of points within this ellipse into the function and have the integral be evaluated at each of these specific points. An example would be: $\frac{1}{(x \cos(\theta)+y \sin(\theta))^\frac{5}{2}} $ So I want to integrate over θ from 0 to 2 π and I want to use different points (x, y) within the specified domain when integrating. Can anyone help me with this?
