I think this may just be one of the most frequently asked questions by a novice (like me) on this site. Please pardon me for that. My question is I wish to get better at solving the harder problems of competitive programming which almost always are very tough dynamic programming formulations, dynamic data-structure manipulations and hard combinatorial object manipulations. How should I go about training myself to not only gain confidence but also gain an expertise in these areas. Yes, I know the obvious answer is practise! But, I'd want to know say books or materials that I should look up to before hitting a programming site like say spoj, hackerrank, codechef, codeforces and the like.
