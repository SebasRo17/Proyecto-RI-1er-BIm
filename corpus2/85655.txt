The firm I work at keeps a copy of the compiled source code on production. So basically on our Production server, we have two folders:               ProductionServer\SourceCode\          ProductionServer\SourceCodeRollback\      The Rollback folder always contains one version older code. This is done so that on deployment nights, if something is wrong with the new code, the deployer(who is not familiar with source control software) has the older version to revert back to. My question is: Is there an official computer science term/nomenclature for the Rollback folder? Or is "Rollback" itself the official term?
