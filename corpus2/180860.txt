I'm about to leave a project, and before I go my boss has asked for me to document code (I've not documented very well). It's not a big deal, the project is not terribly complex. But I'm finding places in my documentation where I would like to say, "Notice on line XYZ that such-and-such happens." In this case, it doesn't make sense to refer to a specific line number, since adding or deleting a single line of code would immediately outdate the documentation. Is there some best-practice for referring to a specific line of code without referring to it by line number? I've considered littering the code with comments like:               /* linetag 38FECD4F */      Where "38FECD4F" is some unique tag for that specific line. Then I can put in the documentation, "On the line tagged '38FECD4F', notice that such-and-such happens." Any other ideas? I feel like it's generally better to document code units as a whole, rather than specific portions of them, but in the case of this particular project there are LONG swaths of procedural code, which have never been refactored into smaller units.
