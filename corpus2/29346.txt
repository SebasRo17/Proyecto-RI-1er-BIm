I considered the following function:               sin[x_] := Module[{},       Print["x=", x];       Sin[x]     ]      in _Mathematica_. Next, I tried to plot it using:               Plot[sin[t], {t, 0, 2 Pi}]      Surprisingly, the first three lines of output are:               x=0.000128356     x=t     x=1.28228*10^-7      Can someone explain this behavior? In this case it doesn't cause a problem, but in my "real" case it does. ### Summary acl's answer below offers, at its very beginning a solution to the specific problem. In very-short, the reason that this `x=t` appears is hidden somewhere in the way _Mathematica_ evaluates the functions. The answers below provide interesting insight into the way it works. The interested reader _should_ read all the answers and details below, they are invaluable, although might be behind the reach of some of the readers (like, partially, in my case).
