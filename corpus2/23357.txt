I have a list of about twenty `InterpolatingFunction`s that I'd like to plot. They are interpolations from experimental data (frequency spectra between 100 and 5000 MHz, since you asked).               In[210]:=  interps     Out[210]:= {InterpolatingFunction[{{100.,5000.}},<>],                 InterpolatingFunction[{{100.,5000.}},<>],                 InterpolatingFunction[{{100.,5000.}},<>] (* ... etc ... *)}      I tried this:               (* Through[interps[f]] threads the argument f through the list *)     Plot[Through[interps[f]], {f, 100, 999}]      ![First attempt: inline expression](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C7w3q.png) This took about thirty seconds, and as you can see the lines are all the same colour. On a whim, I tried replacing it with this:               expr = Through[interps[f]];     Plot[expr, {f, 100, 999}]      ![Second attempt: extracting a variable](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3niGz.png) This only took about two seconds, and the default colours worked this time. This was a major 'WTF' moment for me. Is this a bug? Why aren't the two versions of the code equivalent? I'm using Mathematica 9.0.1.0.
