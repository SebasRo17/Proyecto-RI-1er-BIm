I'm working on creating a line plot from a histogram, as in the following:               {g, {binCounts}} =        Reap[Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 100],               {-2,2,0.25},               Function[{bins, counts}, Sow[counts]]]];          {g, ListLinePlot[binCounts]}      What I'd like to know is, how can I normalised this line so the area under the curve is 1? (So I can compare the shapes of these histograms independent of the number of counts)
