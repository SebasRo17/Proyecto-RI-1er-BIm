I've got an expression like               expr = (1-x)(a+b)      that I would like to distribute / expand while keeping factors of `(1-x)` intact, i.e. the result should in the above example should look like               (1-x)a + (1-x)b      I know that for the explicit example given here, `Expand[expr,(a+b)]` would yield the desired result. However, I would need a solution where `(a+b)` can be any arbitrary algebraic expressions that is distributed with `(1-x)` being left untouched. Is there maybe a way to define a pattern that matches my `(1-x)` terms that I can than hold while distributing?
