I have the feeling that a lot of developers disregard corner and edge cases. Often they tend to just ignore these. I was once working on a logistics project. In the order management of the application there was a case where about 5-10% of the orders had to be specially handled. One colleague said that we just shouldn't handle that case automatically, which would have lead to a high manual workload of the applications users. I think this has somewhat to do with a bad attitude. Another example I noticed shortly was in a comment to one of my answers here. Since this was just a comment, I think the reason for that was just, that the commentator did not pay too much attention for it. Have you made similiar expierences? Is this something you see very often? Is this just a matter of attitude or are there other reasons? btw: I had problems finding good tags for this question. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
