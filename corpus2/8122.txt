I am confused by why _Mathematica_ uses `[[3]]` to get the 3rd element, or `[[i,j]` to get the i,j-th element of a 2D array. This seems counter-intuitive. Is this main reason for this to separate array- indexing from function calls? i.e. where I see:               f[3, 4] <-- this is currently function call     f[[3, 4]] <-- f is a 2D array, and we're accessing 3,4-th element      **Question** : Given that Mathematica knows the type of the arguments, can't it infer:   * if we're dealing with a function, apply arguments   * if the object is an array, index it? Thus, why do we need separate `[[ ]]` notation for array indexing?
