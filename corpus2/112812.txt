I've read Franco Moretti's work, but I'm looking for something more technical and perhaps broad in scope, if possible. Specifically, I want to learn about techniques programmers are using to glean information from complex networks, eg clustering. I'd also like to know what are some interesting questions/problems when it comes to graphs. So far I've just skimmed academic papers with very specific applications. I would appreciate any advice. Thanks!
