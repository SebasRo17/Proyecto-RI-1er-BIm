This is probably a really simple one, but I'm stumped. I want `Symbol["x"]=3` to work just like `x=3`. However I can't figure out how to get Mathematica to evaluate the `Symbol`, converting the string to the symbol `x`, but then _not_ evaluate `x`. > x = 2 > > 2 > > Symbol["x"] = 3 > > Set::write: Tag Symbol in Symbol[x] is Protected. >> > > 3 > > Evaluate[Symbol["x"]] = 2 > > Set::setraw: Cannot assign to raw object 3. >> > > 2 I know that I can remove the definition, but I have a ton of these and would like to be able to replace their values that have been already set. `x=3` doesn't require that I remove the definition of `x` to set it. In case it matters, I'm using 10.0.0.
