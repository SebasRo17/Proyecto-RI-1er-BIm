i'm designing a client-server system via web broswser and i have this problem: I send the data to the client via JSON, then the javascript view shows the stuff. Then the user takes actions and commands are sent back to the server. Usual stuff, the problem is what if the view's data is corrupted or old? One solution i thought is making a hash via SHA1 or some other algorithm of the full objects in the client's model, but JSON data is not ordered, also this adds delays to the system. How do google docs manages this kind of thing? Also, sending ALL THE DATA, every time the model is updated doesn't make sense, but how do i keep consistency by only sending changes? I think the whole problem is just one.
