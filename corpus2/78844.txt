I have an `AccountModel` and a page where the user can upload a file. What I would like to have happen is when the user uploads the file. The `PageController` does something like the following. this is a quick attempt just written in the question to illustrate my question.               public class PageController : Controller {       private Service service;           public ActionResult Upload(HttpPostedFileBase f){              service.savefile(f,_AccountModel_whatever.currentlyloggedinuser.taxid)          }     }               public class Service     {     // abunch of validation and error checking to make sure the file is good to store     }      Wouldn't this approach be in bad practice? Since I'm making my controller dependent on the existence of th AccountModel? This will become a **HUGE** program over the next few years, and I really want to maximize the quality of the framework now.
