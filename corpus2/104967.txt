I am looking for the current, state of the art, coding standards for web development (mostly PHP). Since I do not want to reinvent the wheel I would like to reuse libraries written by people much clever than I am. I know about OWASP which is a wonderful source of best practices and brilliant information. Their web site is however quite unorganized when it comes to libraries.   * On the one hand there is OWASP ESAPI with pointers to libraries.   * On the other hand there is OWASP AntiSamy, which also has libraries. It in turn points to HTMLPurifier or the MS Anti-XSS library. I did not find any links between these different solutions. Is there currently a consensus on the most recommendable libraries to use in order to mitigate the major security risks? Thank you
