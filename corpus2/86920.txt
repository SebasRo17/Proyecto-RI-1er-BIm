I'm looking at helping a friend learn programming (I'm NOT asking about the ideal first language to learn programming in). She's had a predominantly mathematical background (majoring in Maths for both her undergrads and graduate degree), and has had some rudimentary exposure to programming before (in the form of Matlab simulations/matrix operations in C etc) - but has never been required to design/execute complex projects. She is primarily interested in learning C/C++ - so, with respect to her background, what would be a set of suitable problems that would both engage her interest ?
