When retrieving curated data, v10 now returns `TimeSeries` objects. For example,               ts = WeatherData["KP60", "Temperature", {{2013, 7, 1}, {2013, 9, 30}}]          DateListPlot[ts]      What is the most convenient way to extract a range from this temporal data, for example for plotting purposes? E.g. only plot the first two weeks of August from this data. I know I can simply convert it to a list using `Normal` and then use e.g. `Select` to filter. Is there anything better?
