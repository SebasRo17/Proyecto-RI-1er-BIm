There are a lot of questions about what programming books should be on the programmer's bookshelf. How about non-programming related books that can help you become a better programmer or developer? It would also be interesting to know why they would help. My first choice would be Sun Tzu's "Art of War" (however clich√©), because it made it obvious that the success of any project depends on the strength of its weakest link (and warfare is a big project).
