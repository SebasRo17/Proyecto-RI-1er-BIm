In my application,I have a feature like this: The user wants to add a new address to the database. Before adding the address, he needs to perform a search(using input parameters like country,city,street etc) and when the list comes up, he will manually check if the address he wants to add is present or not. If present, he will not add the address. Is there a way to make this process better. maybe somehow eliminate a step, avoid need for manual verification etc.
