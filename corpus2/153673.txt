I am a front-end developer. For many experiements I do I need to have a server that talks JSON with my client side app. Normally that server is a simple server that response to my POSTs and GETs. For example I need to setup a server that saves, modifies and read data from a "library" database like this:   * `POST /books` create a book   * `GET /book/:id` gets a book and so on... What is the fastest to set up and easiest technology stack for database and server in this case? I am open to use Ruby, Nodejs and anything that do the job fast and easy. Is there any framework (on any language) that do stuff like this for me?
