I want a quick way to roll back our production build in the event of any mishaps - a one-click solution, if you will. My gut is telling me that this is important - and I believe that my gut is correct, but I want implementation advice. My current thought is to start a local repository on our production server, and simply commit the entire production build to the repo - binaries, web assets, everything. When we make an update to the production site, we can commit the changes to the repo. This way, if anything breaks for any reason and we need a quick rollback - it's simply a case of checking out the previous commit. What better methods are available for this type of rollback? I know that there are multiple backup solutions, but a VCS is familiar to work with and provides similar benefits. Am I stepping into a trap?
