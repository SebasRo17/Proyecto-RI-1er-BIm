I am looking for statistics (or estimations) that backup the claim that coding standards help reduce bugs. Hard-numbers would be nice, although I haven't had much look finding any. I've even looked at bug tracking for various open- source projects, but have not been very successful finding what I need. Does anyone out there know of any place I might be able to find this? Or do any of you contribute to any open-source projects that have had bugs that may have been avoided with better coding standards?
