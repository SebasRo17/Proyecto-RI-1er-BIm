In most programming languages, variables do not have identifying characters like they do in PHP. In PHP you must prefix a variable with the `$` character. Example;                var $foo = "something";      echo $foo;      I'm developing a new scripting language for a business application, and my target users do not have a programming background. Do these characters make code easier to read and use? One reason PHP uses the `$` is because without it PHP can't tell if a name is a function reference or variable reference. This is because the language allows strange references to functions. So the `$` symbol helps the parser separate the namespace. I don't have this problem in my parser. So my question is purely on readability and ease of use. I have coded for so many years in PHP that when I see `$foo` it's easy for me to identify this as a variable. Am I just giving a bias preference to this identifier?
