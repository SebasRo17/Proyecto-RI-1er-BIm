I'm using Mathematica 8 with operating system Mac OS X Lion. When I open Mathematica it always loads a blank notebook. I don't want it to load anything by default. In the Preferences pane there is a tab for Appearance. Near the bottom of the tabview there is an option "Show at startup" with a drop down menu. There is no option for not showing anything at startup. Is there a way around this?
