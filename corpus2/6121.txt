I am new to _Mathematica_ and stuck with one problem i.e. How can I add a graphics option to an already made plot which a manipulator to control itself.               s = Manipulate[        PopupWindow[         Graphics[          DiscretePlot[Sin[a t], {t, 0, 2 Pi, Pi/6}, ExtentSize -> Full,            ImageSize->Scaled[1], AspectRatio -> .2]], {a}],         OpenerView[{"Vertical", Control[{{a, 1, "Manipulator"}, 1, 30}]}],         ControlPlacement -> Bottom]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UO4iV.png) Now I want to add a plot `Label` by calling the already produced plot `s` because I don't want the duplication of code again as I have to use 4 more different plots in a popupmenu. For example, when I select `s` from then popupmenu then it should give the output `t`               t = Show[s, PlotLabel -> "Popup Window Plot"]        but this is showing error `Show::gtype: Manipulate is not a type of graphics.` Is there any way to sort out this problem? **Note:** The MathGroup version of the same question is found here.
