I have a C# .NET app that downloads a users Tweets using LinqToTwitter. This is for TV broadcast - the client wants to show Tweets on air. We have two other apps that need to access these tweets. One is a C++ app and one will use MS Script Host. These two apps don't run at the same time - it's one or the other. My question is, of the many ways to share this data, which would you choose? **DataBase** \- Like MySql. This was my first choice. But then it seemed like overkill for the 10-20 tweets they would get per day. **Streaming** \- Like TCP or named pipes. This would involve some type of protocol. Like "Give me the last 10 tweets..." **Xml** \- Store the data in a file all programs can access. Simplest, but just doesn't feel right for some reason. **Memory Mapped IO** \- I think this would require a COM library for the scripts to be able to use it There are others. Just curious what you would use. I am the only programmer in a small company and don't have others to bounce ideas off of. Thanks.
