I previously posted this question on Mathgroup but received no response I am using Workbench to profile my code. Suppose I have 2 modules, let's call them A, B (they are too long to replicate here). While running my code, Module B is called repeatedly from A, say in a `Do` loop. Module A is called once. I would like to profile total usage of B (not just one instance), which rules out embedding each call to B in a `Profile[]` statement (as this generates a Profile output for each call). I could, of course, profile A, but the information produced on B would be buried in between timing data pertaining to other parts of A (which for my long module A makes it virtually impossible to understand what's happening in B). Is there a way to accomplish this?
