I see the terms "declaration," "prototype" and "symbol" thrown around interchangeably a lot when it comes to code like the following:               void MyUndefinedFunction();      The same goes for "definition" and "implementation" for things like this:               void MyClass::MyMethod()     {         // Actual code here.     }      Are there any distinctions between the terms, or are they truly synonymous? EDIT: I'm unsure whether or not this belongs on Stack Overflow...
