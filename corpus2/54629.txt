Mathematica 10 release appears to have changed the default styling of plots: the most visible changes are thicker lines and different default colors. Thus, answers to this stackoverflow question are only valid for Mathematica < 10\. For example, plots in this code will not give identical output in Mathematica 10, although they do in version 9:               fns = Table[x^n, {n, 0, 5}];     Plot[fns, {x, -1, 1}, PlotStyle -> ColorData[1, "ColorList"]]     Plot[fns, {x, -1, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vBMw1.png) So, my question is: what is the new way of getting the default colors to reproduce for own uses?
