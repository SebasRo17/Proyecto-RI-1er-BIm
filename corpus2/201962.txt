Is it acceptable form to take Linux kernel source from any version, change it, claim it is mine, and then distribute it for monetary gain? In such a case open-source software is entitled to a sort of "grab, change, sell" mechanism in which anyone can just tinker with something to look different from the original source, make it work their way, and sell it as if they made it entirely themselves. Isn't that illegal?
