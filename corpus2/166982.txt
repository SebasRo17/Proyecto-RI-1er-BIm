I'm starting with scrum and saw many partial examples on books and tutorials, but when try to use scrum in the real life, it's not easy to write the user stories and create the product backlog. I want to see a real project with user stories, product backlog and sprint backlogs to see if I'm doing it in the correct way. Is there any open source project with a public product backlog ? Is there any shared complete user stories and product backlog from a real project?
