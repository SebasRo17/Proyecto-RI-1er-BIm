I have been interested in design patterns for a while and started reading "Head First Design Patterns". I started with the first pattern called the 'Strategy' pattern. I went through the problem outlined in the images below and first tried to propose a solution myself so I could really grasp the importance of the pattern. So my question is that why is my solution to the problem below not good enough. What are the good / bad points of my solution vs the pattern? What makes the pattern clearly the only viable solution? **MY SOLUTION** **Parent Class: DUCK**               <?php     class Duck     {      public  $swimmable;      public  $quackable;      public  $flyable;           function display()      {       echo "A Duck Looks Like This<BR/>";      }           function  quack()      {       if($this->quackable==1)       {        echo("Quack<BR/>");       }      }           function swim()      {       if($this->swimmable==1)       {        echo("Swim<BR/>");       }      }           function  fly()      {       if($this->flyable==1)       {        echo("Fly<BR/>");       }      }               }     ?>      **INHERITING CLASS: MallardDuck**               <?php     class MallardDuck extends Duck     {      function MallardDuck()      {       $this->quackable = 1;       $this->swimmable = 1;      }           function display()      {       echo "A Mallard Duck Looks Like This<BR/>";      }     }     ?>      **INHERITING CLASS: WoddenDecoyDuck**               <?php     class WoddenDecoyDuck extends Duck     {      function woddendecoyduck()      {       $this->quackable = 0;       $this->swimmable = 0;      }           function display()      {       echo "A Wooden Decoy Duck Looks Like This<BR/>";      }     }
