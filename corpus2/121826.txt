let's start off with the problem statement: My iOS application has a login form. When the user logs in, a call is made to my API and access granted or denied. If access was granted, I want the user to be able to upload pictures to his account and/or manage them. As storage I've picked Amazon S3, and I figured it'd be a good idea to have one bucket called "myappphotos" for instance, which contains lots of folders. The folder names are hashes of a user's email and a secret key. So, every user has his own, unique folder in my Amazon S3 bucket. Since I've just recently started working with AWS, here's my question: What are the best practices for setting up a system like this? I want the user to be able to upload pictures directly to Amazon S3, but of course I cannot hard-code the access key. So I need my API to somehow talk to Amazon and request an access token of sorts - only for the particular folder that belongs to the user I'm making the request for. Can anyone help me out and/or guide me to some sources where a similar problem was addressed? Don't think I'm the first one and the amazon documentation is so extensive that I don't really know where to start looking.
