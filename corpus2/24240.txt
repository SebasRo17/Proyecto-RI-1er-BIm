1. How can I draw trigonometric angles of any radian measure associated with the unit circle, complete with the x-axis and y-axis?    2. How can I draw arcs of rotation inside positive or negative angles?   3. Is there a method for drawing arcs inside angles of more than one rotation? Here is a link showing what I would like to draw: http://hotmath.com/hotmath_help/topics/coterminal-angles.html
