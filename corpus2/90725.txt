This is a little bit of a non-technical question for those working in the software development field. My employer has spent a fair amount to renovate 2 executive offices into 1 software development area. There are 3 programmers here, and I am the only one who holds a degree, and the only general software developer - my co-workers program in a scripting language that controls our hardware product. I feel that my employer is attempting to demonstrate to customers and others who visit the office that they are taking an active step in quality and functionality control by bringing the development in house (some of it has previously been contracted out). I feel that we're being looked after; new furniture, new hardware to work on, etc. I am considering whether it is appropriate to display my degree in the office. I generally feel that it would be fine, I'm proud of it and worked hard for it. My only hesitation is that there are engineers here who are much more well established in their careers who don't display any of their certifications (mind you, their work area is constructed of partition walls instead of drywall, but I don't think this is the deciding factor, but may be). I would, of course, consult my employer before hanging anything on the walls, but I thought it would be good to get a feel before approaching them. What has been your experience with this sort of decision, and are there other considerations that I am overlooking? Thanks
