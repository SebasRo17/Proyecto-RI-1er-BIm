I cannot understand the meaning of the error > BoundedDiagram::notuniq: BoundedDiagram requires that boundary vertices lie > in unique Voronoi polygons. >> > > BoundedDiagram::nobd: Bounded diagram failed. >> When I try to run the following code, it gives me the above error.               Needs["ComputationalGeometry`"]     Boundary = {{-2, 2}, {2, 2}, {2, -2}, {-2, -2}};     points = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}};     BoundedDiagram[Boundary, points]     DiagramPlot[points]      Is it a problem with the code? Have i misunderstood `BoundedDiagram`? What I have posted here is a simplified situation. I am using more points in real work.
