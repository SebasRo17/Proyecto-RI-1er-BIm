Hopefully the topic is not too confusing, I am curious though as lately I have seen more and more use of the word parameter to denote a function's passed in values, whereas during my studies I feel as if argument was used almost exclusively. Is parameter more appropriate as argument is more specific to a programs arguments specific at runtime whereas when a function is called, the values passed to it are parameters to the function itself? From a curious programmer.
