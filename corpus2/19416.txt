Consider the example               plotOptions = {PlotPoints -> 10, MaxRecursion -> 2}          Plot3D[x y , {x, 0, 10}, {y, 0, 10}, plotOptions]      Why does this causes the error:               Plot3D::nonopt: Options expected (instead of plotOptions) beyond position 3 in      Plot3D[x y,{x,0,10},{y,0,10},plotOptions]. An option must be a rule or a list of rules. >>      ? I would say that plotOptions _is_ as list of rules... If I use               Plot3D[x y , {x, 0, 10}, {y, 0, 10}, {PlotPoints -> 10, MaxRecursion -> 2}]      it works... What is then the correct way of passing a list of options to a plot? One situation on when this happens is when I want to create several plots with the same options.
