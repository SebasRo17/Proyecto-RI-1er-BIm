I am doing web development for the past 6 years. But somehow, I never got the feeling that I did a good job. I always felt that my code was not production quality. I felt like someone who delivers sub-par products. **An analogy:** Me developing apps for paying clients is like.... a 14 year old who just knows how to shoot and move around the basketball court without falling down, playing among professionals in the NBA. That should be an accurate description :| **I wouldn't buy from me, if I were the client.** I want to move from this current position to a stage where I feel confident that my websites web apps are "professional", "secure", "scalable", (insert all requisites of a product that is worth paying for or relying on for your business). **My question is:** **1\. What are the things I should learn, and..** **2\. From where can I learn those..** **..in order to create truly professional websites and web applications that other people/businesses can rely upon?** I am sick of feeling like an amateur even after so many years. I want help in getting started. I can learn if I know _what_ to learn. I can learn given enough time and things to experiment with, but I don't want to make my clients guinea pigs. **Here is what I know and don't know:**   * I know or can learn the needed syntax in C# to convert the required business logic from concept to working code.   * I can write somewhat complex select queries and even a few joins if needed to fetch data. Of course I can insert, update, delete. But that's it. I know nothing else in SQL server.   * I know enough web front-end technologies to develop good UI. This is not a problem area.   * I know enough about hosting/domains to register and buy hosting and point servers at each other so that example.com actually loads the website. Not much more than that.   * For all practical purposes, ZERO knowledge or experience in handling security and server load   * No idea about caching, at any level.   * I only know the coding best practices, dos and donts. I don't know the same for real world apps that thousands of people are going to use.   * Every time I read a question in SO that has anything to do with a production application, all the answers and the question itself is all Greek and Latin to me. I feel inspired that there is so much to learn, but I can't figure out how to start. * * * I will primarily be working with the Microsoft Stack. So any answer specific to it will also be great.
