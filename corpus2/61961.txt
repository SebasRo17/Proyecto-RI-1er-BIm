I've got a problem. I find really difficult to foresee the effect that my changes to the code will have over the whole application, either when I have to add new features or re- factor it. Very often it is not until testing time that I find out that I should have done things in a different way or that those changes produce an unexpected behavior. I would like to know how you guys approach changes in the code, how you get to know how those changes will affect your current code, what tips or tricks work best for you, or any recommended readings about the matter. Any help will be sincerely appreciated! Thanks a lot guys
