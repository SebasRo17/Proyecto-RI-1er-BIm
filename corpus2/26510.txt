Is this just me being stupid, or is this a known bug in Mathematica?               Coefficient[2 x + 2 y, x + y]      gives 0, while               Coefficient[2(x + y), x + y]      gives 2. The documentation says that it should work whenever the expression is expanded or not... I can see the problem with Coefficient[x-y, x + y] but if all coefficients in _expr_ and _form_ are positive, then surely there is a well-defined largest number k, such that `expr-k*form` have non-negative coefficients? And this is what I'd expect.               Coefficient[expr,form]       EDIT: In my case,               PolynomialReduce[expr,{form},vars][[1,1]]      does the thing I want. This computes _k_ such that _expr-k form_ is minimal in some sense.
