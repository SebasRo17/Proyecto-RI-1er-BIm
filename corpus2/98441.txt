I have been working on the JVM for years and I have very rarely experienced a JVM crash ... that is until approx 6 months ago. Since that I have experienced approximately 5 JVM crashes resulting from 2 JVM defects. The solution from Oracle was always the same ... upgrade. Each upgrade is always to and from a point release ... i.e. and Oracle's latest suggestion (after confirming that they did fix the bug) was to upgrade from 1.6u20 to 1.6u26. How concerned should I be upgrading minor versions of the JVM? Is this a big event that necessitates enormous amount of regression testing or are they safe upgrades that should be embraced?
