I have the following problem: given a list of polynomials `P = {p1, ..., pn}` on the variables `x[1], ..., x[n]`, find a list of monic monomials `M = q1, ..., qm` on `x[1], ..., x[n]` and a matrix `A` that does not depend on `x[1], ..., x[n]` such that `A.M = P`. For example, taking `P = {x[1] x[2] + x[1]^2 x[2], a x[1]^2 + b x[2], c x[1]^2 x[2] + d x[2]^2}` a possible solution is: `M = {x[1] x[2], x[1]^2, x[2], x[2]^2, x[1]^2 x[2]}`, `A = {{1, 0, 0, 0, 1}, {0, a, b, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, c, d}}` I managed to find a long and clumsy solution by using a lot of replacement rules, but I want to know if there is an easy way of doing something like this. Many thanks in advance.
