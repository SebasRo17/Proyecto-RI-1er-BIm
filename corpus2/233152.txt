I need to make an architectural decision for developing (actually porting) my embedded solution on a tablet.   The choice comes down to Ubuntu or Android, so I have some specific questions to help me decide.   * On Android, is it possible to develop applications outside of Dalvik, using Python? If yes, can I access the hardware this way, without the API's provided by the Android SDK?   * On Android, can I control the process' `core_affinity` to bind a process to a single core? And can i use `isolcpus` to isolate other processes from that core making it a (almost) dedicated core for a process? This is possible in regular linux, not sure if it can be done in Android.   * On Ubuntu, how much control over the HW do I have outside Ubuntu SDK?
