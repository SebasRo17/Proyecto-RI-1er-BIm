I found this cool comparison table for integration servers on Wikipedia, but I am a little uncertain how to rank the tools vs. my needs and interests. The chart itself seems to have a lot of boxes marked unknown, so if you are comfortable updating it on Wikipedia, that could be great too. Are there a few top performing products so I can quickly narrow down to four or five options? Which products seems to have the largest user communities and most ongoing enhancements and integration with new tools? Are the open source offerings best, or are there high quality tools that can be a great deal for a single user at home? Will use of multiple systems (primary desktop, local only home network server, personal and work notebooks, multiple virtual machines spread across all) create problems and how can they be managed?
