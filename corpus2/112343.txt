I'm starting at this new company as a scrum master, and they want to dive into Scrum, which is nice and all, but they only have enough people (4) for one team. The road map includes delivering a new product and maintaining the old one, so what should we do?   * 2 products backlogs for 1 team? How should we do planning in this case?   * 1 product backlog for 2 products? How will sprint review work in this case?
