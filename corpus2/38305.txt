What is the default `ColorFunction` for `Image3D`? I find it a bit confusing that the most intense colour is not shown where the highest values appear:               data = Table[        Exp[-3 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)], {x, -1., 1, .01}, {y, -1.,          1, .01}, {z, -1., 1, .01}];          Image3D[data, ClipRange -> {{100, 200}, {0, 200}, {100, 200}},       ColorFunction -> Automatic] (* default colour function *)      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4V39D.png) Note that the bright yellow is not in the middle of the sphere. I wanted to understand what causes this effect (possibly some interplay of opacity and colours?). Otherwise I like the default. Did anyone try to reconstruct the default `ColorFunction` for `Image3D`?
