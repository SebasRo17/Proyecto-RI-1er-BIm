I'm having a big problem as I don't know touch typing. I look at the keyboard (hunt and peck). However, I really want to learn touch typing. I have tried many times, but I don't have the patience and time to spare an hour everyday for that. So, can I learn typing while I do some practice at my work? I mean, practicing those lessons whilst coding. Anyone know if that will work?
