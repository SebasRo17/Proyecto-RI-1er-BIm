I'm going to start off by saying that I'm in my second year as a Software Engineering major at R.I.T in New York. I had no experience programming in high school and ever since attending college I have been programming my ass off. I have had some struggles trying to think things through from a logical programming stand point and I was curious, for all of you professionals and people that have been programming from an early age: How do you approach situations? Do you get implementation ideas from past experience or does it just come to you?
