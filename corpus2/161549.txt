Besides logical and physical architecture diagrams, comps / mockups and tables for expected network load between components and various data schemas, what kinds of visual content, tables or diagrams might I want to include in my Project Architecture Document? The specific project is an integration of 3rd party social networking features into a fashion site. Please post example graphics. Thanks.
