According to Wikipedia, a stack: > is a last in, first out (LIFO) abstract data type and linear data structure. While an array: > is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or > variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. As far as I understand, they are fairly similar. So, what are the main differences? If they are not the same, what can an array do that a stack can't and vice-versa?
