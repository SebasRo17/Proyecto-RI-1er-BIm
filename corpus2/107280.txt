Today, I started reading the book _CSS Mastery 2nd edition_. It is really a good book for anyone who is interested in learning some techniques. On page 151, I discovered the `box-reflect` property from CSS3. I tried to find out more information about which browser suports it and the syntax of the property, but I only found a site that didn't explain much. Can anyone please provide me with a link to a website that is up to date regarding the CSS3 elements? The site should also contain information about browser-support for the different elements. I'm primarily interested in the `box-reflect` property and to update my knowledge of CSS3 properties.
