I'm having a technical interview with a graphics society in a few time and I'd like to expand my knowledge related to the following subjects:   * TLB (translation lookaside buffers and their role)   * low level optimizations   * cache and how the process of fetching data for an instruction execution works   * threads and synchronization   * interrupts, deadlocks and spinlocks, irqs and interrupt masking Can you suggest some exceptionally explained book/resource about these topics?
