I'm working on an investigation on the NLP field. Since software engineering and software documentation are not the primary concerns of my whole investigation I decided to do it using XP. My question is, can you recomend:   * Any tool you've used to manage XP projects   * Any recomendation/link on how to manage investigation projects I'm very biased with XP because I've used it before, but if anyone has a better methodology you can post it as well
