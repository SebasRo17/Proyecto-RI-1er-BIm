Can I perform Terminology Extraction in Mathematica? More specifically, can I extract candidate terms from a corpus of text documents? The corpus is made up of different text types and formats. Mainly semi- structured data with usually only NP expressions (and sometimes just proper nouns). Also, some unstructured data. Can I preprocess this dataset in Mathematica so that I can perform the required information extraction?
