I am a junior developer and have only been in the industry for 5 years. At my current company there is a senior let's call him Infestus. Occasionally I am being given opportunity to shine and do something completely brand new from scratch. One of the most recent examples was that I had to make a singleton in the multithreaded application. I have decided to use this method. As soon as Infestus saw it, he quickly proceeded to call me stupid and told me to use this approach. Upon asking him why he just brushed it off as this is better and that's how this and this book about java says it is better. And it is a common pattern, whenever I get a chance to do something new, I quickly get shot down by Infestus and the only reasoning why his method is books written by famous programmers. He is always trying to give me books to read so that I may "learn" which ways to program. I have only been programming for money for 5 years, but is it always a good idea to just blindly follow the book on best ways for solving a problem, or should I try experimenting every now and then? The constant barrage of complaints from the Infestus is starting to cause me to never try anything new and follow examples in books. EDIT: I am utterly lost. Yes I know that following anything blindly is a bad idea. But this godlike programmer Infestus who seems to know a lot, tells me that the only way to program properly is by reading books and following everything down to a T. All the rules he imposes are the ones written in books, so I am just wondering if books are the only correct way. EDIT2: Infestus is not my boss. He is just one of senior developers in charge of reviewing the code. And most of his comments after reviews consist of book names where such and such method is wrong.
