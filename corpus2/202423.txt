I'm 18 Years old; I started teaching myself programming when I was twelve. I've developed many projects in PHP, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails. I know a very little about C, C++, Objective C and extending PHP with extensions created in C Programming Language. Now I'm working as a freelance Web Developer with a very low salary :(, My Dream is to get a good career with very high salary so I thought of Big Companies like Google Or Microsoft. My Question is How to get Accepted on those big Companies ? What Pre-requests they want And do you need to finish collage education ?
