I would like to make easy to change the variable for which I am making a set of plots. Say I want to plot Sin, Tan, Cos and other functions of the same argument. To quickly switch from plotting it as function of x or y I wanted to use a "dummy" plot variable var and assing it to y or x depending on the need.               x = 1; var = y;     Plot[Sin[x*y], {var, 1, 2}]     Plot[Tan[x*y], {var, 1, 2}]     Plot[Cos[x*y], {var, 1, 2}]     Unset[{x, y, var}];      Unfortunately this doesn't quite works because `var` in the range specification `{var,1,2}` is not evaluated. Any suggestions?
