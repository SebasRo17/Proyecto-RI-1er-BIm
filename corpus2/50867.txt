Consider the statement: $\forall x\left(x<7\Rightarrow \exists a\exists b\exists c(a^2+b^2+c^2=x)\right)$ This is true provided the universe of discourse is $\mathbb{N}$ Now I use `Resolve` as follows to assess the validity of this statement:               Resolve[ForAll[x, Implies[x < 7, Exists[{a, b, c}, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 == x]]]]      and _Mathematica_ returns `True`. Why? If I did not specify $\mathbb{N}$ as the domain how does _Mathematica_ justify returning `True`? Is there a way to specify $\mathbb{N}$ as the domain?
