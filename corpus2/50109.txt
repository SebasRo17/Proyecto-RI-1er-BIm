Two years ago, following 15+ years in Win32 and SymbianOS, I decided to intensively focus on Android. I took the best part of 2009 off work to learn the new platform thoroughly, and that seems to have been a good strategic decision: Android is everywhere now. But it seems strangely hard to find Android development work. I have this nagging feeling that there must be some website, some secret society or labour exchange, that has somehow eluded me. What's going on? If you're an Android contractor, how did you find your current work?
