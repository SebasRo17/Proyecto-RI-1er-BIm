Analyzed one web-server.   * for the `http` request i got: `apache 2.2...` what redirects to https, and   * for https got `apache-coyote 1.1`.   * and the server runs xwiki java app. Trying to understand how it is implemented. After googling a hour trying to find any **simple** page what explaining java technologies for an _java dumb person_ \- giving up - and trying to ask here. I'm mostly using Poet / Mason / Starman (PSGI) for my needs, so trying to find equivalent perlish terms. So, from Wikipedia (shortened): Tomcat: > Tomcat is an open source web server and servlet container ... Tomcat > implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications > ..., and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to > run in. Tomcat's components: Catalina, Coyote, Jasper. > Coyote is Tomcat's HTTP Connector component ... for the web server or > application container. Coyote listens for incoming connections on a specific > TCP port on the server and forwards the request to the Tomcat Engine to > process the request and send back a response to the requesting client. It > can execute JSP's and Servlets. Jasper > Jasper is Tomcat's JSP Engine. Jasper parses JSP files to compile them into > Java code as servlets (that can be handled by Catalina). At runtime, Jasper > detects changes to JSP files and recompiles them. Catalina > Catalina is Tomcat's servlet container. Catalina implements Sun > Microsystems' specifications for servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP). So, in comparison with Poet/Mason application:   * The Mason == `Jasper` \- it compiles my `.mc` and `.mi` files to pure perl/Moose code and manage my Mason app.   * `Catalina` is the `app.psgi`. Is is my "container" for Mason application and, it implements configuration, and many other things for the Mason app and it is based on   * the `PSGI` specification (something like `Java Servlet` specification) what defines the middlewares and how to write PSGI apps and so on...   * and the `Coyot` is like Starman or plackup - a PSGI compatible web server written in pure perl, what allows for perl apps to run in. and the whole things together: `Tomcat = deplyoment of my "Starman/Poet/Mason"`. It is plus-minus right or I completly misunderstand the java buzzwords? If I'm wrong, **please** correct me in _simple perlish terms_. :) So, the server in the top of question is like:   * on the port:80 runs apache - what redirects to   * 443 - what runs like `plackup`   * in what is runs the xwiki (like my perl application) It is more or less correct?
