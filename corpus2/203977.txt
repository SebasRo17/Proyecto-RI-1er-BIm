We make iOS apps where we often get data in a list from an API, then we select the data and go to the next ViewController. Often it happens that the server is down or some API is not ready. What is a good development practice where we can continue our regular work flow without depending on the webservice and then when its ready without making much changes continue using the web-service and till then use some fixed data.
