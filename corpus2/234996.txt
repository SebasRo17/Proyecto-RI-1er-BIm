`A` is a sorted list. `B` is a sorted list, and a subset of `A`. If an element is inserted into `A` at index `i` what's the most efficient way to determine the correct index `i'` for it's position in `B`? Given the fact that both lists are sorted, and that we know `B` is subset of `A` I would think we should be able to devise quite an efficient algorithm, but I'm not happy with what I've come up with so far. Thanks!
