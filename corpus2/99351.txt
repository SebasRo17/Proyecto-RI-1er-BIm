Recently there's risen this small subculture in Denmark with geeks meeting up and hacking along on their sparetime projects together. The base is that there is no session, there is no keynote or anything, it's pretty much just meeting up and getting some prime time put into your project. You can choose to fiddle with anything you like, and you are free to sit and help people all day...pretty much just an open day. I have a bit hard time identifying if it matches any of the names in the topic, as I see it codecamp does have a topic, hackathon seems like devs doing a big solution together...and well codejazz is not really defined anywhere but another danish usergroup used that term.
