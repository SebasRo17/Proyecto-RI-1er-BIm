As we can see from the `Compile` documentation, the typical arguments for `Compile` should be `Integer`, `Real`, `Complex` and `True` | `False`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4dBA6.png) Is it possible to use a `String` as argument type for `Compile`? May be somebody knows a tricky way? I met with task to read the data remotely from oscilloscope and it can send it just as huge, long strings. So I need convert it after to numerical form. It is not a problem but it needs a lot of time if that string contains 5-6 thousands of chars.
