The data in my website is stored in many different tables(friends,relatives,etc) and every-time I have to query each and every table. But all this data is subject centric. E.g. data for a person is of the form               data[301]={             "pid"=>301,             "friends"=>array(),             "relatives"=>array(),             "interests"=>array()             }      So I want to store it in a cache in the db (and hence query only one table). But how do I store such data? should I be using blobs?
