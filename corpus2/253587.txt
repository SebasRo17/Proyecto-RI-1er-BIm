Hi I m trying to use **Social Plugins** in my website For a Tweet on Twitter   `<a id="twitter-link" href="https://twitter.com/share" class="twitter-share- button" data-lang="en" data-size="large">Tweet</a>` I have included the above line my url is something like this   localhost:3000/#a=abc `to give it a faster response i used a location.hash instead of changing params so to avoid reloading the webpage` so when any user clicks on any image the url changes to localhost:3000/#a=def but the twitter share button tries to shares the url `localhost:3000/#a=abc` How can i solve this?   Thanks in advance!!
