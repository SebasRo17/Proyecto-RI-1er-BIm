I'm about to move into my final year at university, and it's finally kicked in that in just over a year from now, I'll be doing my best to secure a job. Yet I still have no clue about the level of proficiency expected of graduates trying to make their way into the programming industry. I've read that they'll weed out the non-programmers with some fizzbuzz style questions, but after that, what sort of people am I likely to be up against? And what skills would be worth studying to push myself ahead of the competition? I'm currently trying to get comfortable with inheritance / polymorphism, currently just with my own code, the next task I've set myself is gaining confidence in extending existing code. I've studied PHP, Javascript(+JQuery), Actionscript (and probably some others I can't think of off the top of my head) as hobbies, Java at university, and currently pushing my way through C# (in an attempt to kill two large birds with one stone). Is this panicking undergraduate headed in the right direction? D=
