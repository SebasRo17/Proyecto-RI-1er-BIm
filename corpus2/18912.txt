I would like to use `ToExpression` (or `Symbol`) within `Manipulate`. Specifically, when running `Manipulate`, I want to build variables from strings, convert them to symbols (dynamic ones) and return values. But I guess I am missing something. Possibly very straight forward. Here's an example:               a2 = 37; (*GLOBAL*)          Manipulate[     Module[{a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 3, a4 = 4},      Column[{text, var, ToExpression[text <> ToString@var],a1}]], {{text,      "a"}, {"a", "b"}}, {var, 1, 2, 1, ControlType -> SetterBar}]      So I set a global `a2` (to visualize the effect), the rest is local and it returns: ![Manipulate 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dzN78.jpg)![Manipulate 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UUZUu.jpg) If I change to `a2`, the **global** value is retrieved in the third line, i.e. 37, see the screenshot on the right. So I think the contexts are confusing me. In order to solve my problem, here's what I tried then: I created a `Dynamic` `x`outside the `Manipulate` and well, consistently (to me), I can now use two different sliders to control the variables (both called `x`) within `Manipulate`, see here:               Column[{{Slider[Dynamic[x]], Dynamic[x]},        Manipulate[           Column[{            Style["Within Manipulate", Bold],               x, Dynamic[x],ToExpression[x], "",             Style["Context", Bold],               Context[x], Head[x],"",             Style["Converting String", Bold],               ToExpression["x"], Dynamic@ToExpression["x"],               ToExpression["Dynamic[x]", InputForm, Hold],               ToExpression["FE`x"], ToExpression["Global`x"],               ToExpression["x", InputForm, Dynamic]}],         {{x, 2.5}, 2, 3}]}]      resulting in: (note: running command in Mathematica directly returns context FE`, whereas it returns FE`Global` using export) ![Manipulate](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zKUfU.jpg) So, my question is: is there an easy way within `Manipulate` to go from strings to symbols? (outside `Manipulate`, it works just as I expect it to) Thanks in advance! **EDIT** To clarify: when I use a variable directly in `Manipualte`(such as `a1`) its (local) value is returned (i.e. `1`), if I use `ToExpression["a1"]` (i.e. from string) it retrieves the global value. And whats confusing: `ToExpression[a1]` yields local value. So the question: how to retrieve the local value of a variable in `Manipulate` when given the "name" (string) of the variable.
