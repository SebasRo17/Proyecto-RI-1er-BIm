setup and tried a simple CDF document and it worked like a charm. That was a couple of months ago - now the post does not show evidence that the shortcode is working at all - the shortcode is in the post - yet, nothing on the view. This has occurred on two sites that I've place test posts with CDFs. I do not recall an update to WordPress or WolframCDF recently - and may well have misted something. I do not know how long the CDF plugin hasn't been working The post http://nomtbf.com/2013/04/weibull-vs-exponential-pdfs/ should have a obvious CDF under the get player button. any ideas on what's happening here and how to fix it? I've deleted the plugin and reinstalled. No love. I checked my machines player (most current) and did a reinstall, no love. Ideas? cheers, Fred http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wolfram-cdf-plugin/
