I recently created a custom stylesheet. I then created a notebook with the new style, confirmed that the notebook had adopted the style, and then saved a copy in CDF. But when I opened the CDF in Wolfram's CDF Player, the style had not been applied to the document. Does this mean that CDFs are not able to adopt the style of the original notebook if the style comes from a custom stylesheet? How can I embed the style into cdf?
