I would like to run a time consuming function:               TimeConstrained[f[x],maxseconds]      and be able to change maxseconds during running (increasing or decreasing max time) using a slider. Ideally when i decrease maxseconds below the time it has already consume it will stop. I could implement such a functionality inside f but i would have to do this for all f i want to create , so this way is out of the question. Thanks in advance, Theodore.
