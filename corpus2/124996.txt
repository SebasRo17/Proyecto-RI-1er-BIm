So when I was at university I was educated on the benefits of UML and its future in code development. But from my industry experience, I've found that while we do use diagrams—ranging from ER diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, to work flow diagrams—all of it is for communication purposes. That is, I've never generated code automatically from diagrams, and from a communication standpoint, I generally try to keep my diagrams as simple and easy to understand as possible. But when I look at Visio and Enterprise Architect, it seems they have many different types of graphs, shapes, properties objects, most of which I don't use. Do people use UML to do more sophisicated things such as code or database generation?
