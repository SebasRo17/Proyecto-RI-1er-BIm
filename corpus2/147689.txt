I'm currently looking into API documentation generation tools and I noticed that apparently there are no efforts going on in standardization. Javadoc style is kind of an ubiquitous convention... it is used for Java (duh), PHP (PHPDocumentor, Doxygen, Stubbles), C/C++ (Doxygen again)... and there is even IDE support for it even in other languages that are not java. Even NaturalDocs which has a completely different syntax for documentation has some compatibility for it. So my question is: **are there any efforts going on in standardizing in-code documentation syntax?** , which can in turn be used for documentation generators or language metadata across different languages?.
