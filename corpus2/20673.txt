I have the following data:               bData = {{0.05, 0, 3.0198054316361485}, {0.05, 0.55,       1.1092237487369552}, {0.05, 1., 0.835126287487935}, {0.05, 1.61,       0.3647962208597364}, {0.1, 0, 2.991741037155516}, {0.1, 0.55,       1.1270688044265789}, {0.1, 1., 0.8493688576645464}, {0.1, 1.61,       0.5932718812318991}, {0.15, 0, 2.8183386248853517}, {0.15, 0.55,       1.6096377385996246}, {0.15, 1., 1.1088595437185633}, {0.15, 1.61,       0.5368907021939747}}      I plot my data as follows:               p1 = ListPointPlot3D[bData, PlotStyle -> PointSize[Large]]     p2 = ListPlot3D[bData, MeshStyle -> Red, PlotStyle -> None,        Mesh -> All, InterpolationOrder -> 1(*,ClippingStyle\[Rule]None*),        PlotRange -> All]     Show[{p1, p2}]      What I want to achieve with this is to show the data points clearly and also connect them in the x and y direction with simple lines. I have done the following ![Output1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sORYG.png) ![Output 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xus1d.png) ![Output 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6auV6.png) I would like to remove all the diagonal lines and just connect the points in the x and y directions. If I do `Mesh->Full`, I get the following: ![Output 4](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D7C66.png) Is there also a way of marking the vertices, without having to superpose two different plots? That complicates the labelling and legending I also want.
