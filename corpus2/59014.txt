I have an implicit function with seven variables defined as follows: $F(g,a,b,c,d,e,f)=2g^5 (1+g)^{-(2+a+b)} \Big(f(c-1)(e-1)(1+g)^a - (d-1)(1+g)^b \big(1+ef+(c-1)(1+f)(1+g)^a\big)\Big)=0$ All variables are subject to certain restrictions: $-1<g<1$, $0<b<a$ and $0<c,d,e,f<1$. Now I would like to examine how changes in each of $a,b,c,d,e,f$ affect $g$. Maybe I should use an implicit function theorem: $\frac{\partial g}{\partial a}=-\frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial a}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial g}}$ and see if this expression is positive or negative. It is most probable that it will not be a clear-cut positive/negative but will be positive/negative 'under certain conditions'. Anyway, for this, I have first coded the implicit function:               F[g_,a_,b_,c_,d_,e_,f_] := 2g^5 * (1 + g)^(- 2 - b - a) * (f * (c - 1) * (e - 1) * (1 + g)^a - (d - 1) * (1 + g)^b * (1 + e * f + (c - 1) * (f + 1) * (1 + g)^a )))      And the partial derivatives are coded as:               D[F[g,a,b,c,d,e,f],a]     D[F[g,a,b,c,d,e,f],g]      These produce very scary results which do not allow to see if positive or negative. Is there any way to check these with Mathematica? Or, is this the right way to proceed at all?
