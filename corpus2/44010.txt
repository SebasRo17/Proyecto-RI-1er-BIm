I have some lists of interpolated functions and I want to know if there is an easy way to operate with them. A simplified example:               listsin = Table[FunctionInterpolation[Sin[i*x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}], {i, 1, 10}]     listlinear = Table[FunctionInterpolation[i*x, {x, 0, 2 Pi}], {i, 1, 10}]      This generates two lists of ten functions each. I want to be able to perform basic operations with these functions: sums, derivatives and products. I came up with a way that works               listsumd = Table[With[{i = i}, (listsin[[i]]'[#] + listlinear[[i]]'[#]) &], {i, 1, 10}]      But want to know if it is possible to do this without having to iterate through all the elements in the table, just by operating directly on the lists.
