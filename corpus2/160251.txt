I am managing a team of 6 people that recently moved to Scrum. We have a Scrum Master (one of the developers in the team) and a Product Owner. Since I have quite a lot of free time (because a lot of management work that I used to do is now done by the Scrum Master and Product Owner), and since I want to remain technically relevant, I am doing some technical development work. I act as a part of the development team, commit to some of the stories in each sprint, and participate in all the meetings as a part of the team. Do you think it is a good idea? Can it contradict the "self-organization" of the team?
