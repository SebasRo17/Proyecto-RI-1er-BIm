I need to solve a particular diffusion equation with NO boundaries http://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/~chenpf/c/courses/fluid/pringle81.pdf equation (2.10) with `nu = cost`. I use this code to simplify the equation:               pde = D[s[x, t], t] == (3/2)*D[s[x, t], x] + (3/4)*x^-2*D[s[x, t], {x, 2}] - 1/(4*x);     mu = 0.5;     sigma = 0.05;      and to solve the equation (which by choosing `nu = cost` becomes a linear diffusion partial equation) I use this:                sol =        DSolve[{pde, s[x, 0] == Exp[-(x - mu)^2/(2*sigma^2)]/Sqrt[2*Pi*sigma^2]}, s[x, t], {x, t}]      with a particular choice of the initial function (a gaussian function). But when I try               Plot3D[s[x, t] /. sol, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, Automatic}]      to plot the results, which should reproduce Figure 1 in the paper above, I get a lot of errors and I don't understand why.
