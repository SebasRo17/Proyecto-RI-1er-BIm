Here is an undirected graph                 m = Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,         3 \[UndirectedEdge] 4, 4 \[UndirectedEdge] 5,         4 \[UndirectedEdge] 6, 5 \[UndirectedEdge] 7,         6 \[UndirectedEdge] 8}, GraphLayout -> "SpringEmbedding",        VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 10]      We can get the Adjacency Matrix as follows               g = AdjacencyMatrix[m]      The Normal Form of the sparse array g is as follows.               In[28]:= Normal[g]          Out[28]= {{0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1,        0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,        0}, {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0,        0, 1, 0, 0}}      The adjacency matrix does not appear to be correct for the graph m.
