Mathematica can easily compute exponentials and logarithms of concrete quaternions:               Needs["Quaternions`"]          Exp[Quaternion[1.3, 3.5, -0.7, 0.9]]     Log[Quaternion[1.3, 3.5, -0.7, 0.9]]      > Quaternion[-3.14824, -1.79206, 0.358412, -0.460816] > > Quaternion[1.36196, 1.17075, -0.23415, 0.301051] Even for exact numbers:               Exp[Quaternion[1, 3, 7/2, -5]]      > Quaternion[E Cos[Sqrt[185]/2], (6 E Sin[Sqrt[185]/2])/Sqrt[185], ( 7 E > Sin[Sqrt[185]/2])/Sqrt[185], -2 Sqrt[5/37] E Sin[Sqrt[185]/2]] But it seems to be unable to expand this for the general quaternion:               Exp[Quaternion[a, b, c, d]]      > E^Quaternion[a, b, c, d] I've tried using `Simplify`, `FunctionExpand`, `ToQuaternion` on this, but still it doesn't give a `Quaternion` object. But there does exist a closed form for such functions. I can, of course, define such functions myself, like:               exp[q_]=With[{v=q-Re[q]}, Exp[Re[q]](Cos[Abs[v]]+v/Abs[v]Sin[Abs[v]]) ];     ln[q_]=Log[Abs[q]]+(q-Re[q])/AbsIJK[q] ArcCos[Re[q]/Abs[q]];      But is there a way to get Mathematica itself expand these functions of general quaternions, without me having to redefine them all?
