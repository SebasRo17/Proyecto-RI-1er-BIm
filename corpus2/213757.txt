I have a few FOSS projects that I want to release under the BSD license, since I only wish to maintain the intellectual property of the code, that others will know I've been writing it. I suppose all I need to do is:   1. Have a file called `LICENSE` only in the main folder of the software.   2. Write at the top of each source file the following text: > This software is released under the BSD License.   >  Full text of the license can be found in the file named 'LICENSE' at the > main folder of the software.   >  Copyright (c) 2013, Dor. Am I correct? Is there anything to add/remove/change?   Should I include my full name,   or may I just use the first name and first letter of last name (e.g. `Dor K.`)? The BSD license text that's contained in the file `LICENSE` is:               ------------------------------------------------------------------------     This software is released under the BSD License     ------------------------------------------------------------------------     Copyright (c) 2013, Dor K.
