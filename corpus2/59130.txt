I would like to plot some data in time and am trying to format it so that tooltips on mouse over gives the date and a value. Something of the form                   DateListPlot[Tooltip[data,         StringForm["Time: ``, ``= ``", DateString[data[[x, 1]],{"Month","/", "Day", " ", "Hour", ":", "Minute"}],Title, data[[x, 2]]]]]      Is similar to what I want except I need data[[x,1]] or data[[x,2]] to have x as a reference to the current position DateListPlot is in the list so that mouse overs give correct time/value. This example works when I just make x some number 1 <= x <= length(data).
