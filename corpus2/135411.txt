From http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28942 > ASP.NET MVC 4 also includes ASP.NET Web API, a framework for building and > consuming HTTP services that can reach a broad range of clients including > browsers, phones, and tablets. ASP.NET Web API is great for building > services that follow the REST architectural style, plus it supports RPC > patterns. If ASP.NET MVC 4 supports RPC style communication what does that mean for WCF? On what basis should we chose to use WCF or ASP.NET MVC Web API's RPC mechanism?
