I'm working on development of SMS parking software, and I'm stuck at one point for a month... I need to implement periods of payment (or work time, of a work day, if you will). Here's the problem: For an example, traffic wardens work from Monday to Saturday. From Monday to Friday, the work times are from 07:00 to 21:00, and on Saturday, the work time is from 07:00 to 14:00. The project request was, that the customer can pay parking by SMS unlimited, which I did, but didn't implement this logic. I started with making a table for this periods of payment, it consists of: dayofweek (INT, for use with mysql function DAYOFWEEK, to tell me which day in week is the current date), work_start and work_stop (DATETIME, for defining starting and ending the work day), but I'm unsure if I should use DATETIME, beacuse of the date, or should I use only TIME. The idea is this: If you send an SMS, at 20:50, Monday, it should be valid until 07:50, Tuesday (it's payed by the hour). Extending the time of payment, regarding the work time in week. Currently, it works with extending time by the hour without this rule. Really would use some help, or some ideas, I'm stuck with this for quite some time...
