I'm evaluating some NoSQL solutions for a project of mine and JCR popped up during my searches as a document store. But it seems somehow of an obscure niche which didn't have the impact its designers hoped for. I'm interested in the technology, but so far there does not seem to be a lot of resources out there to show it's potential (there is some info on the Jackrabbit site, but otherwise, pretty much scarce info). Hopefully someone in the SE community could share from their experience with this technology. What are its advantages/disadvantages? In what situations does this technology perform best?
