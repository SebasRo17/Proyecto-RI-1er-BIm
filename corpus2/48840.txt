That's just an example case. What I'm trying to point out is, how can you claim something (software/website/or any 'ontouch-able' products) as yours while at the same time you are using some existing technologies behind it? (such as database engine, programming languages, compilers, or even the computer it self!). If you can, how far can you claim it?. Can we put a notice (Copyright (c) by Me) on an website that built on top of LAMPP?. Or can I put my own copyright notice for the program I wrote on top of OpenGL? I have the basic ideas about software licenses such as GPL, MIT, LGPL, etc. What I still don't understand is, the fact that we are all being helped all the time by existing technologies such as DBMS, compilers, IDE, and even the computer we use, now if we create something from these technologies, how far we can claim it as ours?
