I have been programming in BASH for a while now and the scripts that I write are starting to get more complicated. I realized that I started to bring in some habits from C/C++ and wanted to get confirmation on if I needed to break my current habits or not. The reason being, not all programming languages are the same and they should be used to capitalize on their strengths. **Using Variables**               function()     {         #declaration block         runCommand=              for string in "$@"; do             runCommand="$runCommand $string"         done     }      vs               function()     {         for string in "$@"; do             runCommand="$runCommand $string"         done     }      **Which is advised for BASH/SH and for what reasons?** I have currently referred to the following websites. http://lug.fh-swf.de/vim/vim-bash/StyleGuideShell.en.pdf http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15610794/bash-coding-conventions http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/style **Edit: My question was a little unclear so I changed the code example a little bit.**
