The company I work for has no version control. It will never have version control, so a server-based solution is out of the question. Also, our network is extremely slow. Often, it takes a few seconds to save a small file. I work with a small team. Are there any version control options for a shared network folder? I'm looking for something where I can go to work, do a pull, work off my C: drive all day, then push at the end of the day. Basically the same thing as GitHub, except with a network drive, I guess.
