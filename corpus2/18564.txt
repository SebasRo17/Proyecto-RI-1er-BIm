I want to get the eight points of intersection from the equations `2 Abs[x] + Abs[y] == 1` and `Abs[x] + 2 Abs[y] == 1`. To solve these equations, I tried               Solve[{2 Abs[x] + Abs[y] == 1, Abs[x] + 2 Abs[y] == 1}, {x, y}]      but could only get the four points. I then tried               y /. Quiet@Solve[#, y] /.         Abs[x_] -> {x, -x} & /@ {2 Abs[x] + Abs[y] == 1,  Abs[x] + 2 Abs[y] == 1}          p = ({x, y} /. Solve[y == #] & /@ {{1 - 2 x, (1 - x)/2}, {(1 - x)/2, (           1 + x)/2}, {(1 + x)/2, 1 + 2 x}, {1 + 2 x, -1 - 2 x}, {-1 - 2 x,            1/2 (-1 - x)}, {1/2 (-1 - x),            1/2 (-1 + x)}, {1/2 (-1 + x), -1 + 2 x}, {-1 + 2 x, 1 - 2 x}})~       Flatten~1      > {{1/3, 1/3}, {0, 1/2}, {-(1/3), 1/3}, {-(1/2), 0}, {-(1/3), -(1/3)}, {0, > -(1/2)}, {1/3, -(1/3)}, {1/2, 0}} It works, but I don't like it. Could you recommend a better method? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0GPLC.jpg)
