I am trying to simplify some expressions using assumptions and got an inconsistent behavior of _Mathematica_ 9 when working with indexed variables. Consider               Assuming[Subscript[x,_] ∈ Reals, Refine[Im[Subscript[x, 10]]]]      > 0               Assuming[Subscript[x,_] ∈ Reals && Subscript[x,_] > 0, Refine[Sign[Subscript[x,10]]]]      > >     Sign[Subscript[x, 10]] >                 Assuming[Subscript[x,10] > 0, Refine[Sign[Subscript[x,10]]]]      > 1 It appears that assumptions about an indexed variable being real work, but assumptions about the positivity of an indexed variable seem not to work.
