OK, I am creating a game using JavaScript and HTML5. The variables such as `map`, `x`, `y`, `level`, `exp`, etc are stored in JavaScript to keep track. On my client page, the JavaScript variables are stored to play along with the game. Every 5 seconds, the client page sends a POST AJAX call to the MySQL database and it successfully updates it. However a user can easily modify the JavaScript variables and cheat their way in the game. Then once they edit the JavaScript variables, the POST grabs that and updates it even though they edited it unethically. So, how do I prevent this from happening?
