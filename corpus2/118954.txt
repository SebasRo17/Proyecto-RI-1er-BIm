I would like to set up my computer so that I can develop in .net, C#, Java, ActionScript, JS/CSS, and functional languages such as Scala or Haskell. However, I want to do this with the least amount of full-featured IDEs to learn / programs taking up harddrive space on my computer / running multiple IDEs simultaneously. Which programs can I use to minimize the amount of full-featured IDEs I have to learn/use. (For example, if Eclipse could handle all of these frameworks, that would be a valid answer)
