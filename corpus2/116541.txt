Here's an interesting discussion of Tennent's Correspondence Principle, and a brief description from Neal Gafter: > The principle dictates that an expression or statement, when wrapped in a > closure and then immediately invoked, ought to have the same meaning as it > did before being wrapped in a closure. Any change in semantics when wrapping > code in a closure is likely a flaw in the language. Does the Groovy language follow this principle?
