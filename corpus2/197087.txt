I thought it would be very useful if there is an embedded application development tool like Visual Studio for web development. I mean when we develop web applications we have a toolbox and we drag and drop components and generally use events. In embedded systems events are interrupts. So why don't we have a toolbox which has electronic circuit components and we drag and drop them, also by clicking on them writing the behind code. Is there any extension like that for visual studio? or Is there any other environment like that?
