So I'm fairly new to programming in the real world (outside of academic projects) and have come across lots of posts saying that using `instanceof` is a bad thing to use to determine what class a specific object is. My situation is that I have three classes, a base product class, one that extends off that and another that extends off that. These are all stored in the same table in a database and I have some code that needs to use the methods on each to pull data off them. What is the best practice to get around this way of doing it? I have read some things about polymorphism but I can't find any examples that fix the issue I have. They all usually override a method which for me won't work as I need to pull different things from the different objects. Is there a better way to do this or am I stuck with using `instanceof` or some sort of reflection to get the fields specific to the objects?
