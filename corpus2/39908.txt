Does Mathematica implement binary search to find a 0, and ternary search to find a local min/max?:   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search As nearly as I can tell, there's no "BinarySearch" method for FindRoot, nor a "TernarySearch" method for FindMaximum. I realize these are numerical, not symbolic, methods, but I was surprised Mathematica doesn't implement them. I even ran into a case where binary search would have worked, but FindRoot didn't. It would be easy to implement both in Mathematica, but I can't believe it's not already included?
