I have a project that requires me to control movement of SCARA robot using VC. I am a beginner in programming so I thought of using existing program as my reference. The SCARA robot that I am using is regarded as a valuable property of the department and must be operated with extra care. I cannot simply make a program out of nowhere to ensure no damage on the robot. I find it difficult to understand the existing program and am overwhelmed with the long lines of coding. Unfortunately, the last person involved with the program already left and no one in my department has any experience with the program. Currently I am not getting the help that i really need.Hopefully someone can give me guidance on this project.
