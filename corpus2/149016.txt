When I was reading the summary of previous work in _Dogsa T, Batic D. The effectiveness of test-driven development: an industrial case study. Software Quality Journal. 2011;19(4):643-661._ it struck me that the measurements used in a lot of studies around TDD are based on things like lines of code, defects and time spent on development. Are there any studies out there that focus on the total cost of ownership for products that have been developed using TDD vs ex traditional development or test-last? I am especially interested in the total cost of acquisition and operating costs.
