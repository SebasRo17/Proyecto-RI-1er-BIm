How do I get `Graph` to display the transition probabilities for a Markov process as labels on the graph's edges? The information is clearly present in the graph, but only displays when I hover over the edges. Is there a way to get the information to display as edge labels (without going through complex machinations)? For example,               mp = DiscreteMarkovProcess[{1, 0, 0}, ({          {0.6, 0.1, 0.3},          {0.2, 0.7, 0.1},          {0.3, 0.3, 0.4}         })];     Graph[mp]      gives ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Opyht.png) with no labeling of edges, even though I can hover over any edge to see the associated transition probability (s a tooltip).
