Maybe I'm just less smart than other people but for once I'd like to say that all the puzzles, riddles, code questions and code-on-paper exercises seem just a bit hard to me. I've always thought of myself as a above-average smart guy, but in an interview when they ask me to solve something or write code on paper in order to ask something, I think I'm just not suited to that. Maybe I'm not as productive as someone who is totally reactive and a fast- thinker, but I repute myself a creative thinker, someone who is able to solve every problem if he's given enough time (which is not EONS, just some time more than a fast'n'furious minded applicant). In my opinion is not guaranteed that a fast thinker is smarter than a less-fast thinker (not slow, just LESS fast). Is speed everything in face-to-face-with-paper interviews?
