If I request mathematica evaluate an integral for me, I'll often get a more general `ConditionalExpression` than I want. Example :               Clear[ii, u, z, l, jj]     ii = Integrate[ 1 / Sqrt[z^2 + u^2], {z, -l, l}]      > >     ConditionalExpression[ -Log[-l + Sqrt[l^2 + u^2]] + Log[l + Sqrt[l^2 + > u^2]], >                                            Re[u/l] != 0 || Im[u/l] >= 1 || > Im[u/l] <= -1] >   I can reduce this after the fact with something like:               jj = FullSimplify[ii, u > 0 && l > 0 && Element[ u | l, Reals] ]      > >     Log[(u^2 + 2 l (l + Sqrt[l^2 + u^2]))/u^2]   >   but I'd imagine it should often simplify the calculations if I could provide the assumptions up front, especially the obvious ones like restricting various variables to the domain of reals. Is there a way to do this?
