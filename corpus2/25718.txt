You do a ListPlot.               Plot[Sin[x^2], {x, 0, 1}]       pdat1 = With[{fig = Plot[Sin[x^2], {x, 0, 1}]},        First@Cases[fig, Line[x_] :> x, Infinity]];        ![fig 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8CSkq.jpg)   ![fig 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GapgK.jpg)   ![fig 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XUpUH.jpg)   ![fig 4](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q6TH4.jpg)   ![fig 5](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z2jc9.jpg)   ![fig 6](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N68Jd.jpg) You get your diagram. fig 1.   You select the ListPlot area.   A red fram shows.   A tooltip says: Double-click to edit. fig 2.   You Double-click the plot line.   Another red fram shows. fig 3.   You again Double-click the plot line.   The data points become visible. fig 4.   You take a handle to resize a data point. fig 5.   You deselect the Plot. fig 6. There are now some new values constitute the diagram.   Question is:   How can you list/table the plot diagram values after this manipulation?
