What are some explicit and official guidelines or standards for template parameter naming in C++? I've done something like this in the past:               template<typename TContainer, typename TKey>     void AddKeyToMap(TContainer& the_map, TKey const& the_key);      I've also seen names like `container_t` and `key_t`. I'd also accept advice against standardization here, if it makes sense.
