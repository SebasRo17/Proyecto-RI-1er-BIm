A few other students and I are forming a group that wants to become good at what we do: websites. We are making websites for free for friends at the moment in order to get ourselves some experience and to learn from each other. We are about to finish our first website this week. In 6 months time we plan to have a portfolio and hope to start charging for websites. The issue is that we are all beginners and we are unsure about how to keep records of the websites we do. It is important as we may want to maintain a few websites or add to them later on. How does a proper web design business keep records of all info needed? Is there a program or software package we can use?
