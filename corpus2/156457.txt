I have to perform 3 tasks: an insert, a delete, and a write I'm not sure what the best way to do this is. My mainframe program design skills aren't too tight, so I was looking for advice. Could I avoid doing a COBOL program for this? The way I see it, I just need JCL that executes SQL statements. If I design my statements correctly, then they should be able to preform tasks 1 and 2 this way. But I'm thinking I may need to have a COBOL program to write to a file? If I do, would I just run through database with a cursor, then process each row and take appropriate action based on the row? Each task seems similar, but the queries are different and produce different results, so the SQL statements are very different. But they are all working with the same table. Task 1:   * preform SQL query   * For each row that the query picks up      * Insert a new row based on that row Task 2:   * perform SQL query   * For each row that the query picks up      * delete the record Task 3:   * perform SQL query   * For each row that the query picks up      * Write that record to a file
