As the title says, I want a cell containing the dynamic solution of a DAE- System to be available over the whole document. I use a lot of different Plots and Sliders scattered over the document and it is pretty annoying that after the cell scrolled off screen, the dynamic stuff stops working altogether (as this is the nature of `Dynamic` as the documentation explains it). If I copy `Dynamic[Solution]` and insert it all over the place everything works perfectly fine but does of course look unprofessional. Therefore I tried `DynamicWrapper["This is a text", Dynamic[Solution]]` to hide `Dynamic[Solution]` inside titles and texts that are scattered around anyway. This does however not work as I imagined it must. If someone has an idea how to comfortably solve the issue I would be glad. Edit: The system is a scale that works by compensation method; some code: This is my variable called solution               solution =      Dynamic[sol2 =      Quiet[NDSolve[{d1'[t] == d2[t],      d2'[t] == k*d1[t] + b*d2[t] + (ki*l)/\[Theta][t]*d3[t] + (l*g)/\[Theta][t]*              (mersatz - mass[t, offset, Mass]),      d3'[t] == -((ki*l)/L)*d2[t] - R/L*d3[t] + (U[t] + Uoffset)/L,      U[t] == kP*U2[t] + kI*IntegralPart[t] + kD*U2'[t],      U2[t] == -ks*l* d1[t],     D[IntegralPart[t], {t, 1}] == U2[t],     d1[0] == 0, d2[0] == 0, d1'[0] == 0,      d2'[0] == (l*ki)/\[Theta][0]*Uoffset/R + (l*g)/\[Theta][0]*               (mersatz - mass[0, offset, Mass]),        d3'[0] == 0, d3[0] == Uoffset/R , U[0] == 0, U2[0] == 0,        IntegralPart[0] == 0}, {d1, d2 , d3, U, U2, IntegralPart}, {t,        0, duration}      ]]]      After that follows a big plot of the measured / calculated load on my scale               PlotWeight =      Manipulate[     Quiet[Plot[{measuredweight[t] /. sol2,       If[referencew == 1, mass[t, offset, Mass], ""]} , {t, 0,       duration}, PlotStyle -> {Automatic, Darker[Green]},      ImageSize -> {1200, 400}, AspectRatio -> Full,       ExclusionsStyle -> {Darker[Green], None},      AxesLabel -> {Style["time [s]", FontFamily -> font1],        Style["measured weight [kg]", FontFamily -> font1]},      PlotRange -> {{0, duration}, If[scale == 1, Full, {0, scale}]}]],     Style["      +", 12]     , {{scale, 1,      Rotate[Style["AxisScale", FontFamily -> font1, FontSize -> 12],       90 \[Degree] ]}, 0.01, 1, ControlType -> VerticalSlider},      Style["      -",      12], {{referencew, 0,      Style["activate weight reference", FontFamily -> font1,       FontSize -> 12]} , {0, 1}},      ControlPlacement -> {Left, Left, Left, Top}, Alignment -> Center ]      Other variables displayed in interactive Plots are current, voltage, angular velocity, angle, etc. All those are coming from the DAE that is fitted in solution (in the variable sol2 inside of solution). ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wcadK.png) A full picture in this Pdf.
