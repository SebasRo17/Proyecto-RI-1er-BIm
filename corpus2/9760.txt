I want to fit some data to a model of exponential decay using the `FindFit` function:               data = {{0, 78}, {24, 64.5}, {48, 70.5}, {96, 54}, {144, 64.5}, {216, 3}, {336, 0}, {696, 0}};     model = data[[1, 2]]*Exp[-k1*t];          fit1 = FindFit[data, model, k1, t]     fit2 = FindFit[data, {model, k1 > 0}, k1, t]          modelf1 = Function[{t}, Evaluate[model /. fit1]];     modelf2 = Function[{t}, Evaluate[model /. fit2]];          Plot[#[t], {t, 0, 696}, Epilog -> Map[Point, data], PlotRange -> All] & /@ {modelf1, modelf2}      Interestingly, the model with no specified constraint on _k1_ finds a much better solution than the constrained model, but the solution of the unconstrained problem falls within the range of the constrained one. Here is the output: * * *               {k1 -> 0.00512571}     {k1 -> 1.01979}      ![Result of the Plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bB51j.png) Why isn't the solution to the constrained problem at least as good as the solution of the unconstrained one?
