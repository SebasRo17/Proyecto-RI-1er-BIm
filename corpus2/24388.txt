I have a large array of real (positive and negative) numbers and I want to plot the histogram of it. I can use               Histogram[data, "Log", PlotRange->All]      but this gives me log scale only in X-axis. How would you get log scale on both axis for a histogram? I have heard that Mathematica 8 has added this feature, but I am using Mathematica 7 right now. Moreover, say I just want Log scale on Y-axis. Is it possible too? Thanks!
