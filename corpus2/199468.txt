In many programs and web apps (stack exchange included) the program is able to backtrack what edits where made to the piece. My issue is similar: I want to be able to store a "timeline" of edits, where the user can go back and see what they typed at a specific time/when the typed certain words. What's the standard way to do this? Also, in things like google docs and other programs, they automatically "group" actions together (Like if I delete something by hitting back space 5 times, it knows I was deleting one word), any ideas on how to do that to?
