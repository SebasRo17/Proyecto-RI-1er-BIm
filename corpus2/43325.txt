I'm having trouble understanding why the skewness of built-in distributions is not the same as the skewness of their probability density functions. For example, the following are different (the first being correct):               Skewness[NormalDistribution[0, 1]]     Skewness[PDF[NormalDistribution[0, 1], Table[x, {x, -4, 4, 0.1}]]]      ..despite them both being (looking?) the same:               Plot[PDF[NormalDistribution[0, 1], x], {x, -4, 4}]     ListPlot[PDF[NormalDistribution[0, 1], Table[x, {x, -4, 4, 0.1}]]]      What I'm trying to do is estimate the skewness of a distribution resulting from a numerically solved PDE model (i.e. a distribution for which I have no analytical solution). Mathematica's skewness function is giving me positive skewness estimates even when the distribution is clearly negatively-skewed. Thanks. * * * @Szabolcs The PDE itself is rather "complicated" (boundary conditions, etc.), so I’ll try illustrate with a simpler version (which, unfortunately, doesn’t exhibit the negative skew of the complete model):               deqn = D[u[x, t], t] == d D[u[x, t], x, x] - a  D[u[x, t], x] - \[Lambda] u[x, t]          g[x_, \[Epsilon]_]:=Piecewise[{{0,x<0}, {1,0<=x<=\[Epsilon]}, {0,x>\[Epsilon]}}]          d=0.02; \[Lambda]=0.001; a=0.05;          sol=NDSolve[{deqn, u[x,0]==g[x,0.1], u[-10,t]==0, u[10,t]==0}, u, {x,-10,10}, {t,0,300}]          Plot3D[Evaluate[u[x,t]/.sol[[1]]], {x,-10,10}, {t,0,300}, PlotPoints->40, Mesh->False, PlotRange->All, AxesLabel->{length, time, density}]          Plot[Evaluate[{u[1, t]/.sol[[1]], u[5,t]/.sol[[1]]}], {t,0,300}, AxesLabel->{time, density}, PlotRange->All]      It is the skewness of the two distributions in the second plot that I'm after. Thanks.
