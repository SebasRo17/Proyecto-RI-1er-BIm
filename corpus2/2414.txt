I'm trying to run this:               domain := {n, 0, 10};     Plot[n, domain]      but it doesn't work. Instead, it generates the message               Plot::pllim: Range specification domain is not of the form {x, xmin, xmax}.      and returns               Plot[n, domain].      Why? I've also tried alternatives such as using `=`, or trying to define `Domain[n_] = {n, 0, 10}` but it all seemed to be of no avail.
