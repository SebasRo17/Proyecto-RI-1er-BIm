I am using google code prettify. After a page renders, I decided to check how `<code>` and `<pre>` tags and their contents were manipulated.   But in view source, I found no changes were made (in contrast to online syntax highlighters, which generate css style code with code text).   So, how/where is info about keywords, variable, comments, etc (from code tag text) stored and manipulated?
