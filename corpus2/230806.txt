I am going to develop a simple Point of Sales system. Mainly all the data will be stored in a central db (mysql server). All the application are going to be winforms. Together each local client will have its db copy stored locally and all the operation will be based on the local db except for one operation that the transfer of stock between outlet. So at certain interval there will be updates from the local db into the central db. The reason to have the local copy of the db in each client desktop in case there is problem with connectivity with the central server so that business can go on as usual and update once it is online. I need help in deciding the right path to move to solve this solution is my design acceptable or being flaw ?
