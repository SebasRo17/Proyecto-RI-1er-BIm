I heavily use CTRL+ to jump between tokens in code (the `_`s are the navigation points):               _fooBar _+ _barFoo_;      Some editors, like the one in the current version of QtCreator, have (by default or optionally) camel case navigation, which goes like this:               _foo_Bar _+ _bar_Foo_;      What is the rationale behind this? I remember some people back in school saying "cool" and "fancy", but is that the whole story? I do not think it is cool, I find it very annoying actually.
