My temperature distribution looks like:![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l06fu.png) Mean wire temperature is :               To[x_] := 2 c1 Cosh[x a1] + a2      And it is continuous at two points. In positive part:               Tu[x_] := 10 Exp[-m (x - 0.0005)]      In negative part, it is symmetry of Tu:               Tu2[x_] := 10 Exp[-n (- x - 0.0005)]      I found c1, m, n by using boundary conditions:               To[x_] := 2 c1 Cosh[x a1] + a2     Tu2[x_] := 10 Exp[-n (- x - 0.0005)]     bcs = {To[-L/2] == Tu2[-L/2], To'[-L/2] == a4 Tu2'[-L/2]};     s = First@Solve[bcs[[1]], c1]     Quiet@Solve[bcs[[2]] /. s[[1]], n]          To[x_] := 2 c1 Cosh[x a1] + a2     Tu[x_] := 10 Exp[-m (x - 0.0005)]     bcs = {To[L/2] == Tu[L/2], To'[L/2] == a4 Tu'[L/2]};     s = First@Solve[bcs[[1]], c1]     Quiet@Solve[bcs[[2]] /. s[[1]], m]      Now I know the constants of my functions. Then I have non-linear differential equation which can be solved with Green's function. I solved that differential equation with Green's function when the boundary conditions were To[L/2] ==0 and To[-L/2] ==0. Green's function must satisfy boundary condition and differential equation. Because of this reason               green[-(L/2)] == 0, green[L/2] == 0      Now, same problem but different boundary conditions which are presented above. Before, I used that code with To[L/2] ==0 and To[-L/2] ==0, and got green[y]               eqn1 = D[green[y], {y, 2}] q - green[y] (f0 - b g0 + I w p) - DiracDelta[x - y]     ans1 = DSolve[{eq1 == 0, green[-(L/2)] == 0, green[L/2] == 0}, green[y], y]      It worked well. But I could not applied new boundary conditions into those code. Program gave an error. Because I have 4 boundary conditions:               green[L/2] == Tu[L/2], green'[L/2] == a4 Tu'[L/2]     green[-L/2] == Tu2[-L/2], green'[-L/2] == a4 Tu2'[-L/2]      How can I get Green's function with new boundary conditions ?
