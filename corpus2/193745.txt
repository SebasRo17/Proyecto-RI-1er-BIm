If i have two systems (A and B) running on LAN(INTRANET) which are directly connected. There are no routers in the middle. In this case, if system A sends a few UDP packets every few milliseconds to system B: Is it possible that system B receives the packets in a different order? Please note that I'm not asking whether to use TCP or UDP. I'm interested in whether the above scenario will have packets out of order - I'm aware that UDP packets are not guaranteed to arrive in order.
