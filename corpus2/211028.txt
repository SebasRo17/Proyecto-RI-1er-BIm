I've been heavily using a pattern for years now, but I don't know what it's called. It looks like this....               class xzy     {            public function getFoo()       {         if ( undefined(this.foo) )         {            this.foo = new Foo;         }         return this.foo       }            public function setFoo(foo)       {         this.foo = foo;         return this;       }            public function getResult()       {         if ( undefined(this.result) )         {            this.result = this.getFoo().action();         }         return this.result;       }          }      It find it great for testing yet still allows for a high level of encapsulation. It's also great for drying up code. I also very rarely use a constructor. I'm now in a position where I could really do with specifying the pattern in some documentation but I don't know what it's called and it's a hard thing to try and Google.
