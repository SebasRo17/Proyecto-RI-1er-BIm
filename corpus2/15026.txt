Is it possible to plot `y = x^2` and `x = y^2` on the some graph? For some reason, I can't get it to plot the `x = y^2` properly. Here is what I get:               Show[{ Plot[x == y^2, {y, -1, 1}], Plot[y = x^2, {x, -1, 1}]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V03MN.png) Thank you for your time.
