In your ASP.NET MVC 3 applications that use a DataContext or DbContext, where do you instantiate your data access object? Here is a non-exhaustive list of where I've seen it done:   * Individually within each method of the controller   * In the controller's constructor   * As a property (lazy-initialized) of the controller   * In an ActionFilter, shoved into ViewBag   * In Global.asax Application_BeginRequest   * In an HttpModule  I can't identify a clear front-runner amongst all of those. What's worse, whenever I start a brand-new project, I tend to change it up, _just because_. Does anyone have any battle-tested advice?
