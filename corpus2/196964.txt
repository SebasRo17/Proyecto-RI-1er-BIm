Is it even realistic to try and do enter the software industry coming from the game industry? I feel like I have pretty strong skills with regards to programming in general- I'm somewhat into Agile programming techniques and pay close attention to code quality, have some limited experience using SCRUM, and have a pretty strong knowledge of C# and to a lesser extent C++ however I don't have experience with any business technologies- only game technologies. Whenever I see any ads they are always heavy on technology experience so I'm not sure how I would have any chance.
