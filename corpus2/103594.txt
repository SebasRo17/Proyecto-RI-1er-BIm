I'm working on a project that requires a simple dictionary for checking spelling; it will be large, but will lack definitions. The solution we're currently working on has the base word list in a text file, and customizations (extra words, excluded words) in the DB. The entire list needs to be loaded (best cached I think) for paginated display and customization using an existing JS widget, so what's the best way to store and load the base word list? My initial thought was to have a text file with one word per line and write my own loader and cache object, but my boss suggested using a ResourceBundle to leverage the built-in caching. I'm thinking that could be done by using the words as keys with empty values and using the keyset of the bundle. What would be the best solution to this?
