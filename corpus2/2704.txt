I cooked up this simple bit of code in hopes to exceed pseudorandom number generation maybe touch the face of true randomization:                   For[i = 1, i < 65, i++,       seed0 = RandomInteger[{1, 22957480^3}];       SeedRandom[seed0]; seed0 = RandomInteger[{1, 22957480^3}]];     SeedRandom[seed0];      I am concerned over the default seed value though. Anyone have a better way to generate randomness?
