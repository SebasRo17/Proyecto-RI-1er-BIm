Every once in a while (read: about every day) I come up with a new idea, start a new project in my favorite editor/IDE, start coding and the next day I delete it and start something new. I've been programming for about six years now and in those six years I have only really completed one very small project (a Dashboard widget for Pastebin.com). Though this might be great for learning coding, I really want to complete something. What are some things I should do before, while and after the actual coding? What are good resources that teach me how to organize such one-man projects? * * * If it matters, I want to do web or Mac development.
