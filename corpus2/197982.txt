i'm using **Ruby 1.9.3** I figured out that you can use an `array`, or a `hash` as hash key in ruby:               h = Hash.new          h[Array.new] = "Why?"     h[Array.new] # Output: "Why?"          h[Hash.new] = "It doesn't make sense"     h[Hash.new] # Output: "It doesn't make sense"      But an object works differently...               h[Object.new] = "LOL"     h[Object.new] # Output: "nil"      But this one works as expected:               o = Object.new          h[o] = "LMAO"     h[o] # Output: "LMAO"      Tried this:               o = Object.new           # Output: #<Object:0x2c78c10>     h["#<Object:0x2c78c10>"] # Output: nil      Tried it in **Python** and **PHP** and it throws an error. I'm just curious about how it works, and why would you want to use an `array`, or a `hash` as hash key in ruby? Thanks.
