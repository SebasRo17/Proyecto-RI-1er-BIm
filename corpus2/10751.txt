sol = NDSolve[{Derivative[2][y][t] + Sin[y[t]] == 0, Derivative[1][y][0] == 0, y[0] == 1},     y, {t, 0, 2}]      the above-mentioned differential equations can be solved by Numerical interpolated integrations at a series of discontinuous points, and the number of the points depends on the Integration methods selected by the NDSolve. My problem is that how I can obtain all these points selected because I want to get the specific value of `y[t]` at each interpolation point?
