I'm trying to solve a system of non-linear equations with `FindRoot`, and I get the answer, but also a > >     *partd* (part spec longer than depth of object) >   error. This throws me off and makes me think it's poor programming. Is there a way to code this such that I don't get this message?               Clear["Global`*"]     F[x_] := {x[[2]]*x[[3]], -x[[1]]*x[[3]], -0.51 x[[1]]*x[[2]]}     dt = 0.1;     xi = {0, 1, 1};     xj = {x[1], x[2], x[3]};     FindRoot[xj == xi + dt*F[xj], {xj, xi}]          Part::partd: "Part specification xj[[2]] is longer than depth of object."     Part::partd: "Part specification xj[[3]] is longer than depth of object."     Part::partd: "Part specification xj[[1]] is longer than depth of object."          {{x[1], x[2], x[3]} -> {0.0985269, 0.990196, 0.995024}}
