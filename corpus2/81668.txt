Sometimes when I'm working with a class (usually one that represents a database model), I'll have about 15 different properties on it, usually of different types. These are properties that need to be accessed by the users, as well, so each property will typically need some function like               T getPropertyName();     setPropertyName(T value);      But, it's also extremely valuable for me to be able to iterate through each property **in a particular order** (although, I suppose that "value" may stem from laziness of not having to type each one individually). Is there some logical way to set up this class, so that I could iterate through it in this order? Or am I helpless for organization, and I should just go back to the basics of having 15 private variables, and 15 "getters" and "setters"? As an aside, currently I'm working with Android and Java, so answers pertaining specifically to that would be the most helpful, but seeing how I encounter this somewhat frequently in other languages, too, any solution would be ideal. **Edit:** I've been thinking about using something similar to a Bundle with a list of keys, but I don't know how effective that would really be either.
