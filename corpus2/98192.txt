At the stage of a project right before you actually start putting code in the editor how do you organize the project and your "tasks". Ticketing systems are great but I can't seem to find a way to make them worthwhile on a project until after launch. When tracking bugs and gathering enhancement ideas for later versions. What is a good methodology or "system" that you have used in the past that has helped keep a project organized and moving forward. A way to track your tasks and notes?
