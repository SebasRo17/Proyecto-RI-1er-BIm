Take for example the following:               public interface IManager     {            void AddItem(CollectionItem item);         void RemoveItem(CollectionItem item);     }          public interface IManagerCustomCollection     {         ManagerCollection Systems;     }      Is it usually more preferable to create a collection, and allow the consumer to operate directly on the collection?
