From REST in Practice: Hypermedia and Systems Architecture: > The current state of a resource is a combination of: > >   * The values of information items belonging to that resource >   * Links to related resources >   * Links that represent a transition to a possible future state of the > current resource >   * The results of evaluating any business rules that relate the resource to > other local resources > a) why would " _links to related resources_ " also represent the current state of a resource? b) I also don't quite understand why " _Links that represent a transition to a possible future state of the current resource_ " also represent the the current state. Namely, those links represent the possibility, not the current state. Analogy would be an int variable set to value 10. It's possible that in the future this variable will get processed and set to value 100, but we don't claim its current state also includes possible future state of 100?! **REPLY:** **1)** > links to related resources: imagine a "chat_room" resource. The links to > people in that room will change as they come and go. In other words, a > resource's relationships to other resources may change. **a)** I also began learning domain driven design and there an entity **E** may have _child entities_ ( thus **E** is a parent in a relationship ) and **E's** relationship with its _child entities_ may change ( ie some _child entities_ may be assigned to different parent or may get deleted). But even though **E** has _one-to-many relationship_ with its _child entities_ , we don't consider that relationship as also representing _the current state of E_. That's is why I'm puzzled as to why in REST the **links to related resources** also represent the _current state_?! **b)** > imagine a university has a "student" resource. There might be a link to > "register" in a class, a link to "apply for housing", and links to "tune > in", "turn on" and "drop out". Each link may change the state of the object, > or may yield appropriate information for the resource state. For example, > the correct Student Housing application for that student. It sort of makes sense that the _state of current resource_ also constitute **those links to related resources** , which may state change _the state of the current resource_. But it doesn't make sense that **the state of the current resource** also constitute **links to those related resources** which don't change the _state of the current resource_?! **2)** > But the resource may be a sort of state machine. So a "car" resource might > have links to "start_engine" if it's stopped. It might links to "speed_up", > "slow_down", and if the speed is slow enough, "stop_engine". In other words, > links to transition to other valid states based on the current state. **a)** > links to transition to other valid states based on the current state. I assume you've made a typo and what you meant to write is " _links to transition to other valid states **is** based on the current state_"? **b)** So could we say the reason why **links that represent transitions to other states** also represent _current state of a resource_ is because _every resource with such links_ could be considered a _state machine_ , and with _state machine_ , _links to other valid states_ do represent _current state_ ( I hope my ramblings make some sense )?! **2\. REPLY:** **1)** > But it seems more natural in handling structured data to just bundle the > "chat_room" and "chat_room_person" information together. I assume technically, _related resources themselves_ don't represent the _current state of a resource_. Instead, only _links to these related resources_ represent _the current state of a resource_?! **2)** > In REST, the goal is to eliminate all out-of-band communication.

The > resource representation can tell us, "This is where I am, and this is where > I can go next." In REST the **links that represent transitions to other states** also represent _the current state of a resource_ , but could we argue that logically ( thus not in the context of REST ) these links don't really _represent the current state of a resource_ , and thus only reason why in REST they do represent _the current state of a resource_ is because REST is build around that assumption ( or is at least more efficient that way )? thank you
