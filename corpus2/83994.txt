I am bound and determined to setup CI at work. I have played with Jenkins, and will download TeamCity when I get home (damn you work enforced download filters!) I have no IT support, and only so much spare time. My main question: Can Jenkins or TeamCity integrate with git or mercurial repositories that exist only on a shared drive rather than a true server (via http, https, ssh, etc)? I would like to use a DVCS with my CI setup, but would also be ok with settling on SVN because it is familiar, and already setup (but no projects to migrate if I decide on a DVCS). I am familiar with the benefits of DVCS and I don't think they will come into play very often in my current environment. My CI will live on a plain Windows XP box on the network. Given the above, will it be fairly easy to integrate either Jenkins or TeamCity with git/mercurial, or should I just stick with SVN as it is more or less ready to go?
