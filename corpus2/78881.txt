> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do you dive into large code bases? I am currently a student and started programming a few years ago. I am able to write complete working software in many languages. However, there is something that bugs me about contributing to open source projects: how do you understand how the organization structured its source code? I tried to add functionality to Apache Tomcat and found it difficult to find myself in all these source files. Is there something I am missing that makes it easier to understand the organization of the work done?
