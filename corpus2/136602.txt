The last month I have had idea of a very large project to take as a software hobby/potential business project - simply because I saw some "vision" of a great tool if this would be done. The idea behind the project is really a common idea, and there is this one very big competitor (as the size of a corporation with dozens if not hundreds of programmers working on a product that might contain my "visionary" features in the future) - their product gets polished every year with their new edition. A few days ago I saw their latest edition, and it literally "shut my wind" down : Their latest edition contained about 50% of the features I dreamed about. And they implemented those in a good way. Also, those "features" that they have implemented, are part of a very large product of theirs, so they benefit from integrating those features to their big product. If I were to code my own product, those "features" will simply be a stand-alone product without any other _nice and efficient tools_. So my doubts are these : If I were to begin coding this myself, this would take perhaps a few years. Should I really take this project idea and invest my time in it, while some big corporate company might suddenly have those same features implemented in, let's say, one year from now? Should I really _think_ before entering a whole new project about my chances of success, or, simply, should I _dive and kamikaze_ on it?? What do you think? P.S. If you can, please recommend me information resources about starting up projects and eventually getting commercial. Thank you very much.
