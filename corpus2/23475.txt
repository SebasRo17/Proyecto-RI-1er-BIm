So I am giving my first shot at making a Mma slideshow. But I am finding difficult to change the formatting of Sections and others in the slideshow. I can change the style of Sections in the Working environment through the Format > Edit Stylesheet menu. Yet, even when I change the environment to Slideshow (via Format > Screen Environment > Slideshow), and then edit the stylesheet I see no results. Here is what I see in the stylesheet editor when trying to change the style of the slideshow:               Cell[StyleData[StyleDefinitions -> FrontEnd`FileName[{"SlideShow"}, "Sapphire.nb",        CharacterEncoding -> "WindowsANSI"]]]          Cell[StyleData["Section"],      FontFamily->"Calibri",      FontSize->48,      FontWeight->"Bold",      FontSlant->"Plain",      FontVariations->{"StrikeThrough"->False,      "Underline"->False}]      Could you tell me what I am doing wrong? I tried changing the Font to Calibri and make it Bold, but when I start the presentation, none of this shows up. Thanks in advance
