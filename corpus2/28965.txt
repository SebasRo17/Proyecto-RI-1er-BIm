Is it possible to use `CCodeGenerate` to generate code which calls functions from other C libraries? For example, I would like to do something like this:               CCodeGenerate[Compile[{{x}}, f[x]+1], "f1"]      where `f` is a function defined in some other library (which I would then link to the generated code). I tried to first make `f` available in _Mathematica_ via LibraryLink, but then `CCodeGenerate` issues a warning (`CCodeGenerate::wmreq`) and returns `$Failed`.
