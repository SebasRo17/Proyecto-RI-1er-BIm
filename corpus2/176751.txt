I have to make a rather complex system for my diploma work. Logically it will consist of the following components:   1. Database   2. Web-service   3. Management with web interface   4. Client iOS application that will consume web-service I decided to implement all the first three components under .NET. Firstly I will create a database depending on the information load - this is clear. But then I need a web-service that will return data in JSON format for iOS clients to consume - that's obvious and not that hard to implement. For this I will use WCF technology. Now I have a question, if I implement the web-service, how will I be able to respond to POST requests with JSON? It probably involves WCF JSON or something related? But I also need some web pages as admin part, so will this web- application be able to consume my centralized web-services as well or I should develop it separately? I just want my web service to act like a set of controllers. There is a related question here but this doesn't quite reflect my question.
