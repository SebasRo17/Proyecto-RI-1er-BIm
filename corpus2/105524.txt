The idea is to make use of HTML5 local storage to store frequently accessed CSS and JavaScript. For example (pseudo-code):               var load_from_cdn = true;     if (detect local storage)       {       if (cache of css, js found)       {          load the local storage cache          load_from_cdn = false;       }     }     if (load_from_cdn)     {        document.write('<script>...');     }      Is this possible or realistic? I do aware browser cache, there will be still some header access checking,   I assuming no HTTP access is better (in my _thinking_ ) PS : It seems that local storage only support **key-value pair** , can someone prove it ?   (best with some examples)
