Why doesn't (open source) compilers contain builtin funtionality for (shared) caching and reuse-fetching (using SHA1-hash of compiler-version, build-flags, target-platform and inputs) of executable output objects (ELF or COFF) similar to what `ccache` does and `scons`? Many large software projects would benefit enormously in required build-disk- space and -time if this was present in, say GCC.
