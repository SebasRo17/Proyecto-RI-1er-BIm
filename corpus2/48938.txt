I'm trying to come up with a good name for a data access object that executes non-query SQL statements. I know DML is a valid term, but I wanted to make sure it is the best. Right now we have OracleNonQuery, but I'm hoping to find something better. **UPDATE:** OracleDML or OracleDMLStatement are good suggestions. I'll probably go with one of those unless someone has a better term.
