We have developed a job-portal where users can view jobs and and also post jobs. We have used Php and MySQL. We hosted this on web faction. Now we want to develop the mobile app of the job portal for android, ios and windows. As the database should be synchronous and aligned dynamically with apps and website database. As the back-end code has to be changed to Java in android and c# in windows, how to manage a single synchronous database?
