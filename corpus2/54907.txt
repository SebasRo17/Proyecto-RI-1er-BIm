I have an array               data = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};      And I want map `Standardize` over the column of the array. I use following code               Composition[       Transpose,       (Standardize /@ #)&,       Transpose][data]      > >     {{-1, 0, 1}, {-1, 0, 1}, {-1, 0, 1}} >   Is there more shoter way to get that result? PS: maybe using of `MapThread`, but function `Standarize` take a list as input. **EDIT** I have picked a bad example. Use this example:               data = {{-4, -8, -8}, {-9, 4, 10}, {-3, -9, 0}}      The result I desire:               {{0.4147806779,-0.5068532453,-0.9609876522},{-1.140646864,1.151939194,1.034909779},{0.7258661863,-0.6450859486,-0.0739221271}}
