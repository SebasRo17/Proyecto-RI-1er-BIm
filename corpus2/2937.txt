I am trying to use `Show` to combine two plots so I do the following:               g1 = Plot[x, {0, 100}, AspectRatio -> 1]     g2 = ListContourPlot[data, FrameLabel -> {"label1", "label2"},        PlotLabel -> "title", AspectRatio -> 1,        DataRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 100}}]          g3 = Show[{g1, g2}]      Everything looks great on the computer. Now, I want to export.               Export[g3, "test.pdf", ImageResolution -> 600]      This creates a problem. The y-axis label is completely missing. The image is cut off on the left-hand side. It's not white space or anything like that. It's just not there. The whole left side of the image is missing. The title of the plot is partially cut off too. How do I fix this?
