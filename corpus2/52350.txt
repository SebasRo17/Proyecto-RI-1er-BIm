I've got a 64x64 Matrix `L` for which I want to find the solution to the matrix equation `L . x == rho`. L is defined as `L[a, b, c, d, e, f]` with assumptions `Element[{a, b, c, d, e, f}, Reals]`. As long as I put specific numbers in `L`, e.g. `L[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `LinearSolve[L, rho]` (with `rho` something like `rho = {1, 0, 0, ..., 0}`) finds the solution within a fraction of a second. But when making even one argument symbolic, say `L[a, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `LinearSolve` finds no solution (with `rho` as defined above): > LinearSolve::nosol: Linear equation encountered that has no solution. But there is a solution, at least all values of `a` I tried manually. And `a` is only added linearly in only some of the components of `L`. And even `Det[L]` is nonzero, so there should be a solution. I assume I'm doing something pretty wrong. Can anyone help me? Edit: Here is a sample matrix L[a,b,c,d,e,f] with fewer dimensions(5x5) where LinearSolve works(probably not the best sample because the big L matrix is more or less spare and this example doesn't look so):               L[a,b,c,d,e,f]={{1, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, (0. + 2. I) c, -((I dSin[f])/Sqrt[3]), -((I d Cos[f])/Sqrt[3]), 0},     {(I d Cos[f])/Sqrt[3], -((I d Sin[f])/Sqrt[3]), -11.565 - (0. + 1. I) a +(0. + 0.666667 I) c, 0, -(1/2) I e Sin[f]},     {-((I d Sin[f])/Sqrt[3]), -((I d Cos[f])/Sqrt[3]), 0, -11.565 - (0. + 1. I) a + (0. + 1.33333 I) c, 0},     {0, 0, -(1/2) I e Sin[f], 0, -0.2 - (0. + 1. I) a + (0. + 1. I) b - (0. + 0.2 I) c}}      i is no variable but the imaginary unit
