Suppose we have a model of a human muscular system containing the following muscles each within a specific muscle group:   * **Arms**     * Biceps     * Triceps     * Forearms   * **Torso Front**     * Abs     * Chest     * Shoulders   * **Torso Back**     * Trapezius     * Lats     * Rear Shoulders     * Lower Back   * **Lower Body**     * Quads     * Hams     * Hip & Butt     * Calves Now, given a list of selected muscles, I need to find combinations following the given rules: **If all muscles are selected from a group:**               Full body (All muscles)      Arms      Torso     Torso Front     Torso Back     Lower Body      **If there are full groups together:**               Arms and torso     Arms and torso front     Arms and torso back     Arms and lower body     Torso and lower body     Torso front and lower body     Torso back and lower body      When both the front and back of the torso is selected it can be considered just "torso". **If there are more than 2 muscles selected from a group but not all:**               Parts of torso (This is the case where there are muscles selected from both front- and back-torso)     Parts of torso back     Parts of lower body      "Parts of torso front" and "Parts of arms" never occur on their own as they only have a total of 3 muscles, **thus those cases can be represented by their names: eg. "biceps and triceps", etc.** **Combinations of these aforementioned "parts"**               Parts of arms and torso     Parts of arms and lower body     Parts of torso and lower body     Parts of  arms, torso and lower body.      Parts = groups are not full and there are more than 2 muscles selected. This "rule of 2" is the most important one. * * * **Examples of output** **biceps, triceps and chest:** parts of arms and torso **biceps, triceps, calves, tai biceps, triceps, quads, hams, hip & butt:** Parts of arms and lower body **biceps, abs, calves:** Parts of arms, torso and lower body **biceps, triceps:** Biceps and triceps **biceps, triceps, forearms:** Arms **chest, shoulders, abs, trapezius, lats, rear shoulders, lower back:** Torso and so on, there are multiple possible variations. * * * Now my problem is that I have no idea how to write this as clean and modular as possible, so that rules can be added or removed if necessary. I could just write a massive if-elseif-else pile that would consider all cases, but you know why I won't. How would **you** tackle this kind of task?
