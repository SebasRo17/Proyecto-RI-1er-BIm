I'm a .NET developer and mostly builds GUI's but of course also pure C# due to architecture and database level needs. To me, developers of games in discussions often being simply referred to as "gaming developers". I find that a little too shallow and I'm curious what a "gaming developer" really stands for. What would we, in turn, be to a gaming developer? Are there ever conversions from one direction to another and what are the main differences in a regular development process?
