W3Schools has a reputation of being incomplete, sometimes incorrect, and ridden with advertising; still, when looking to look up some things or link to documentation when answering a SO question, it still is the only handy cross- browser resource. There are other resources like the Mozilla Developer Network that is doing an increasingly great job documenting JavaScript, and the legendary and great Quirksmode. But they, as brilliant as they are, cover only parts of the areas I am talking about, and provide no community editing and quality control options. Is anybody aware of efforts to create a collaboratively edited, cross-browser HTML/CSS/JavaScript/DOM encyclopedia? If you will, I'm thinking of a challenger to W3Schools like SO was to Experts Exchange.
