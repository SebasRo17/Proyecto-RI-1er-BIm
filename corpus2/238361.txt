I'm developing a application based on two technologies: ASP.net (SharePoint) and JavaScript. I use server-side code for retrieve data from database and manipulate it whereas I use client-side code for build front-end(I'm using JSON format). I have very problem with this "architecture" because ASP.net is strong-type whereas JavaScript is less-type. My data "jumps" from front-end to back-and and vice versa. How can I have my model class in client-side code too?
