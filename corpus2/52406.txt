In version 10, when the mouse is over a Mathematica command, a small pop-up window comes up that one can click on for help on the command. Is there an option to disable this feature? Screen shot: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CYLLQ.png) I tried number of options here, but no effect. It must be in the advanced perferences? But not sure what to look for. **Update:** Thanks to Martin answer below. These options can be changed permanently in advanced options ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nVmbF.png) I also turned off the "ShowCodeAssist" just in case ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/crjVw.png)
