I'm considering purchasing the Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) library for use with my Delphi applications. I'm interested in the signal processing functions. Mainly for re-sampling and FFT. Has anyone used IPP with Delphi? How did it go? I'm wondering how easy it will be to begin using the library. I don't have any experience using non-Delphi code/libraries with Delphi.
