I am planning to read some design patterns and I took the book on "design patterns in C++' by gang of four. However, I am not really some one who reads book and prefers reading slides/watching course lectures and then apply and read the book. I cannot find any course lecture videos on net(yeah, its not that important a course as algo/OS). Any one know any course website, preferably on C++
