What is the exact border between the static and dynamic languages? I mean I am told the following parameters are the deciding factors:   1. Compilation or interpretation   2. Typing   3. Runtime generation   4. Dynamic evaluation But when I see these parameters, I can find most of them (upto a major extent) in static languages too like late binding of C++, reflection in Java and C#, void or Object types etc. My question is,   * with so much of dynamicness in these static languages, is it necessary to actually learn the dynamic languages?    * I know C++, Java and C#. On the other hand, I know PHP and Javascript. My teacher recommends me to learn more dynamic languages like Python and Ruby. Is it really necessary to do so?    * What is the commercial preference between these languages? Thank you.
