It seems most jobs that I've been exposed to come with a 3 month trial period, during which the employer decides whether the employee is doing good enough work, and is a good fit. 3 months seem like overkill to me, for most cases we've known much sooner whether someone wasn't a good fit. How long does it take you, on average, to evaluate whether a newly hired programmer is both talented and a good fit for your team?
