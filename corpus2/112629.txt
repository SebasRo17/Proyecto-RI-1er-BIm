I am interested to know how many real world web application servers are hosted by windows? I am going to learn C# and ASP.NET and want to convert my self from an embedded developer to a web app developer. My friends told me that there are ways more Linux based servers than windows servers. He also mentioned the Java skills stack is much more useful than .NET in the world of web application. My experience of Java and C# are rougly the same. I am an experienced C++ developer though. Can anyone give me some suggestion about it? Many thanks
