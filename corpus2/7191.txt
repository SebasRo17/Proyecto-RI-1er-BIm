Mathematica is struggling to find the inverse of this function f(r): `f[r_]:=ArcCos[(-1 + 4.20278 r (0.008712/r^2 + 0.475876/r - 1/(1 + r)))/Sqrt[ 1 - 10.598 r^2 (0.008712/r^2 + 0.475876/r - 1/(1 + r))]]` If I attempt to use Solve or NSolve `(N)Solve[s==f[r],r]` mathematica just hangs up. The same is true for InverseFunction[]. I was wondering if there were any strategies to find the inverse of this function, even perhaps a numerical approximation. I have many functions like this and need to find their inverses. Many thanks.
