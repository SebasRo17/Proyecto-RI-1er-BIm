Today I feel like I finally grokked currying (in Javascript), and of course, like any programmer who has learned a new trick, my mind immediately began racing over how to improve my current codebase using it. And again, like any programmer, the little voice shouting "[new trick] all the things!" was silenced by another saying, "[new trick] is really complex. maybe you shouldn't use it." Curry is sugar, essentially, after all. I understand that there's nothing wrong with using a feature in moderation, especially one as mind-bending as currying, but for the sake of simplicity should I avoid using it if something equally as efficient is sufficient?
