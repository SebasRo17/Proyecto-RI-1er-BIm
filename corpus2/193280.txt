I'm in the middle of designing an API for a very basic flashcard application for learning purposes and I'm wondering if you all think there can be any improvements. In the app, a Folder contains Folders and Sets. A Set contains Cards. The Homepage lists any top-level Sets and Folders that the I've created (but never cards). Here's the URI schema I've come up with: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r8lES.png) Does this seem ok? My goal is to keep the URIs terse/concise/simple and push any relationship metadata (parentFolderId, parentSetId, etc) into the body of the request. Thoughts?
