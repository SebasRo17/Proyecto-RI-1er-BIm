Little heads up, I'm the only lonely dev building/planning/mocking my project as I go. I've come up with a preview release that does only the core aspects of the system, **with good business value** , and I've coded most of the UI as dirty throw-able mockups over nicely abstracted and very minimal base code. In the end I know quite well what my clients want on the whole. I can't take agile-ish cowboying anymore because I'm completely dis-organized and have no paper plan and since my clients are happy, things are getting more complex with more features and ideas. So I started using and learning Agile & Scrum Here are my problems: * * *   1. I know what a functional spec is(sample): Do all user stories and/or scenarios become part of the functional spec?   2. I know what user stories and tasks are.   Are these kinda user stories? I don't see any Business Value reason added to them. * * * I made a mind map using freemind, I had problems like this: Actor : Finance Manager >> Can Add a Financial Plan into the system because well _that's the point of it_? What Business Value reason do I add for things like this? > Example : A user needs to be able to add a blog article (in the blogger app) > _because..??_ It's the point of a blogger app, it centers around that > feature? * * * How do I go into the finer details and system definitions:   _Actor:_ Finance Manager >> _Action:_ Adds a finance plan. This _adding_ is a complicated process with lots of steps. What User Story will describe what a _finance plan in the system is_ ??   I can add it into the functional spec under definitions explaining what a _finance plan_ is and how one needs to add it into the system, but how do I get to the **backlog** planning from there? > Example: A Blog Article is mostly a textual document that can be written in > rich text in the system. To add a blog article one must...... But how do you create backlog list/features out of this? Where are the user stories for what a blog article is and how one adds/removes it? * * * Finally, I'm a little confused about the relations between functional specs and user stories. Will my spec **contain** user stories in them with UI mockups? Now will these user stories then branch out tasks which will make up something like a technical specification? Example : _EditorUser_ Can add a blog article.   1. Use XML to store blog article.   2. Add a form to add blog.   3. Add Windows Live Writer Support. That would be agile _tasks_ but would that also be part of/or form the technical specs? Some concrete examples/answers for my questions would be nice!!
