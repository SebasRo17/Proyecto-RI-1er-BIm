I was reading the wonderful post of Trent Walton : UniTasking which contains a lot of useful thoughts and ideas, plus some good links to some neat OS X apps. (which I have started using right after I read the blog.) But I noticed a funny notion. Many people talked very negatively about using multiple screens. Onwards to Tom Cunningham's : Stay productive, he actually mentions using only 1 monitor as the first tip to increase productivity. Is this a common belief ? And has anyone done any tests with this ? I work at a software studio, and we have three screens as standard (Macbook 15" + two 21" screens) but due to the fact that I take my macbook with me every day, and set it up every morning, I can easily go an hour or two with only the main screen turned on. So what are your beliefs on this ? Myth, fact or completely up to individual preferences ?
