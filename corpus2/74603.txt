I am a Realtor in a large metro area. Our MLS provider is building the next generation of its MLS software on Flash. Many in the beta test group are against this, citing numerous reasons including lack of native iPad compatibility, buggy behavior, and the general assertion that Flash is simply the "wrong" platform upon which to build an enterprise level system such as this. Ultimately, as a Realtor, I continue to be dismayed at the poor quality of software products provided to our industry's software providers while at the same time wondering why sites like Redfin, Trulia, Realtor.com, Zillow are so far ahead of us in user interface and functionality, at least from the end user standpoint. Any thoughts or opinions?
