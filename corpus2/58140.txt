I'm not sure if this is the place of my question or not. I'm working in a software company as senior software engineer, but my team leader is controlling everything in the development life cycle. I can't give my opinion on anything. I'm just forced to tasks only without any discussion. I can't even apply any design patterns or UI guidelines. Is that OK in my career position now? What is the responsibilities of senior engineer?
