Suppose I have two matrices A, B, whose entries are functions of x. Suppose they are 2*2. In the product, each entry is of the form $\sum_k A_ik B_kj$. There are two summands corresponding to k=1,k=2. I want to evaluate the two summands at some point, say x=5, and pick out the larger summand as a function of x to form a new matrix c, I write the codes as follows. I think the mistake is in the data type of c,               A[x_]={{x,2x},{3,4}};     B[x_]={{x,x^2},{4,5}};          (*first create a matrix c whose entries are set to 0*)          For[i=1,i<3,i++,            Forj=1,j<3,j++, c[x_][i][j]=0     ]     ];               For[i=1,i<3,i++,            For[j=1,j<3,j++,              For[k=1,k<3,k++,                 If[ c[5][i][j]<A[5][[i,k]]*B[5][[k,j]],                c[x][i][j]=A[x][[i,k]]*B[x][[k,j]],                c[x][i][j]=c[x][i][j]              ]           ]         ]       ];               Table[c[x][i][j], {i,10},{j,10}]//MatrixForm      In the output, you can see that the (2,2) entry is the resulting matrix is wrong.
