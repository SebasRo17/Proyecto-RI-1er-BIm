I believe this is a bug in GraphicsGrid.               x = Graphics[Circle[]];     g1=GraphicsGrid[{{x, x, x}, {Item[x, Background -> Red], SpanFromLeft, x}, {x, x, x}}, Frame -> All];     g2=GraphicsGrid[{{x, Item[x, Background -> Red], x}, {x, SpanFromAbove, x}, {x, x, x}}, Frame -> All];     g3=GraphicsGrid[{{x, Item[x, Background -> Red], x}, {x, SpanFromAbove, x}, {x, SpanFromAbove, x}}, Frame -> All];     Row[{g1,g2,g3},"   "]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fKeMO.png) SpanFromAbove do not works like expected, formats are not respected. Changing GraphicsGrid into Grid we get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Knx6.png) I tested this in V9 for Win and in V10 for Mac and Win.
