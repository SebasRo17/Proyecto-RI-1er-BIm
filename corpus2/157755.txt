On my way to learn Lisp I have discovered the all powerful and feared so called Macros, then after spending a hard time trying to understand them and their usefulness I said to myself, I FINALLY GOT IT.   I couldn't be more wrong, I was thinking that the only purpose of Macros was to define new control structures and that was all I needed to know until I start reading more and more on the subject and a whole new world has comes to me ! One can use Macros for new **Domain Specific Language** , **Code Transformation** and to avoid **Boilerplate Code**. Hence, if a few examples at which the aforementioned usages of macros and others as well, with a concise and simple-to-understand explanation could be given it would be really nice.
