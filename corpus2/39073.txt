I'm slightly new to the world of Mathematica, so I can't assess the difficulty of my request, but anyhow, this is my question: I have 2 datasets that I want to plot with two y axes, and a reversed x axis. (as to 'why do you want a reversed x-axis': the time parameter is in thousand years before present, which decreases in value as time moves forward, such that 0 is the present day) The data is the following:               area = {{0, 443.387}, {1, 443.387}, {2, 443.387}, {3, 443.387}, {4,       443.387}, {5, 444.06}, {6, 445.406}, {7, 446.751}, {8, 447.424}, {9,      698.385}, {10, 718.57}, {11, 734.044}, {12, 772.395}, {13,       822.856}, {14, 878.7}, {15, 5933.58}, {16, 6837.85}, {17,       7254.32}, {18, 7362.65}, {19, 7458.86}, {20, 7540.94}, {21,       7621.01}}                    ;     distance = {{0, 10.3807}, {1, 10.3807}, {2, 10.3807}, {3, 10.3807}, {4,       10.0923}, {5, 10.0923}, {6, 10.0923}, {7, 10.0923}, {8,       10.0923}, {9, 9.69003}, {10, 9.65897}, {11, 9.65897}, {12,       9.35579}, {13, 8.94344}, {14, 8.22982}, {15, 7.4932}, {16,       6.66484}, {17, 5.21611}, {18, 5.21611}, {19, 4.47083}, {20,       3.94395}, {21, 3.72562}}     ;      I made a YY-plot code using this code: http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/647/11219, which produces: ![YY_plot-example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wI5og.png) And then reversed the original data using the code as found here: http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/5717/11219, which should reverse both the data and the axis ticks. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Ddi2.png) As I hope you can see: the data is transformed correctly, the labels on the x-axis are not. So in combining the two codes I found, I broke the Ticks on the x-axis. Is it possible to fix this? Even a manual setting of the labels is fine with me, all my plots have the same data range from 21--0. The current code is:               TwoAxisListLinePlot[{f_, g_}] :=       Module[{fgraph, ggraph, frange, grange, fticks,         gticks}, {fgraph, ggraph} =         MapIndexed[         ListLinePlot[#, Axes -> True, PlotStyle -> ColorData[1][#2[[1]]],            Mesh -> Full,           Ticks -> ({Transpose[({#[[1]],                      Reverse@#[[2]], #[[3]], #[[4]]} &@                   Transpose[Sort@#[[1, 2, 1]]])], #[[1, 2, 2]]} &@              AbsoluteOptions[ListLinePlot@#1, Ticks])           ] &, {f, g}]; {frange, grange} =         Last[PlotRange /. AbsoluteOptions[#, PlotRange]] & /@ {fgraph, ggraph};       fticks =         Last[Ticks /.            AbsoluteOptions[fgraph,             Ticks]] /. _RGBColor | _GrayLevel | _Hue :> ColorData[1][1];       gticks = (MapAt[Function[r, Rescale[r, grange, frange]], #, {1}] & /@            Last[Ticks /.              AbsoluteOptions[ggraph,               Ticks]]) /. _RGBColor | _GrayLevel | _Hue -> ColorData[1][2];       Show[fgraph,         ggraph /.          Graphics[graph_, s___] :>           Graphics[           GeometricTransformation[graph,             RescalingTransform[{{0, 1}, grange}, {{0, 1}, frange}]], s],         Axes -> False, Frame -> True,         FrameStyle -> {ColorData[1] /@ {1, 2}, {Automatic, Automatic}},         FrameLabel -> {"Years before present [ka]", "Area [km\.b2]", "",           "Isolation [km]"},        FrameTicks -> {{fticks, gticks}, {Automatic, Automatic}}]]      And then run as               k1 = Transpose@({Reverse[#[[1]]], #[[2]]} &@Transpose@area);     k2 = Transpose@({Reverse[#[[1]]], #[[2]]} &@Transpose@distance);     TwoAxisListLinePlot[{k1, k2}]
