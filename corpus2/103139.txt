I think about doing the 4 exams required to become a MCPD Webdeveloper 4 Visual Studio 2010. The examns can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mcpd.aspx#tab2 I found only one book at amazon, having a rather bad rating. Can somebody recommend any training material for those examns?
