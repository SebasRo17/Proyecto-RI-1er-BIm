I am creating a web app on Flask and was planning to use mongodb. Most of the examples using this stack that I've come across have used an ODM of some kind and was wanting to figure out whether or not I should as well. I have worked with ORM for a Java web app before and found its utility to be limited and apart from preferring just using JDBC and writing the sql myself, we came across a few instances where our own hand written queries increased performance noticeably. I realize that the NoSQL db is a different beast, so I was just wondering if there are many parallels between ORM and ODM and the issues I observed with ORM. Might there be performance hits in some instances using an ODM with mongodb? Is the only benefit ease of use/natural translation between code and db objects? I have no quarms about Essentially, I am wanting to know if I am missing out on too much by just using plain old `pymongo` in the flask application rather than an ODM? PS. If it is important, I expect my application to be high volume but balanced read/right in nature.
