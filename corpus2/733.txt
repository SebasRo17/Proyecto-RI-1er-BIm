As Conrad Wolfram said at the TED conference, in the future kids should focus more on new technology. Computers compute better than humans, so we should focus more on thinking and getting the knowledge how to use available software. I teach programming to my young friend, he is 14. He is very talented, however he still has very much to learn. I wonder how I can teach them to use Mathematica to help with homework and maths materials... I finished my IT studies. I have only used Mathematica a few times, but I am not an expert.
