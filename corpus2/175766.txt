In corporate in-house software development it is common for requirements to be determined through a formal process resulting in the creation of a number of requirements documents. In open source software development, this often seems to be absent. Hence, my question is: how are requirements determined in open source software projects? By "determining requirements" I simply mean "figuring out what features etc. should be developed as part of a specific software".
