I just started a job where I'm writing Python after coming from a Java background, and I'm noticing that other developers tend to quote strings using single quotes (`''`) instead of double quotes (`""`). For example:               line1 = 'This is how strings typically look.'     line2 = "Not like this."      Is there a particular reason for this other than personal preference? Is this the proper way to be quoting strings? Specifically, what I want to know is if there is some type of standard or accepted best practice that drives this style of coding.
