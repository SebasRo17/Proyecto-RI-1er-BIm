I have a betting type site where I publish a number (between 0-100) that is encrypted. Then after a period of time, I would review what the number is and prove it with a key to decrypt the encrypted number to prove that I'm not cheating. I also want it to be easily verifiable by an average user. What encryption algorithm/technique/package should I use? I'm no expert on cryptography. There seems to be so many options out there and I'm not sure what to use. python friendly is a plus.
