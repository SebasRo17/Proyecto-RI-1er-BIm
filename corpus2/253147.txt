Should one log success of an operation within a try-catch-block, or after it? Example:               try         do x         log('successful')     catch         log('fail')     end      or is this better:               try         do x     catch         log('fail')     end     log('successful')      I would say that a logger should never fail, but what if, for some reason, it does anyway? In this specific case, I had a logfile on a network drive which disconnected due to actions of do(x), which however did not fail -- obviously my try failed, but my operation worked. However, I find the latter example harder to read, and I try to keep my code as tight as possible for readability.
