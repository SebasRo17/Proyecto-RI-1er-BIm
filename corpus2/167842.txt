Plenty of sentiment exists that measuring commits is inappropriate. Has any study been done that tries to draw in more sources than commits - such as:   * browsing patterns   * IDE work (pre-commit)   * idle time   * multitasking I can't think of an easy way to do these measures, but I wonder if any study has been done. * * * On a personal note, I do believe that reflection on one's own 'metrics' could be valuable regardless of (or in the absence of) using these for performance eval. I.E. an un-biased way to reflect on your habits. But this is a discussion matter beyond Q&A.
