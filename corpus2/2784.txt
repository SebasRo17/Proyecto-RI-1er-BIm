I've difficulites with the `NonlinearModelFit` function. In principle Mathematica should be able to deal with complex data. E.g. if I define the following table               set = Table[{i, (3*i^2*I + 1*I)}, {i, 0, 10}]      and perform `NonlinearModelFit`, Mathematica has no problem finding the right values               NonlinearModelFit[set, (a + b*x^2*I), {a, b}, x]     (* {a -> 0. + 1. I, b -> 3. + 0. I} *)      But I need to fit some fractional functions, so I tried to fit just the inverse of the above set of data (I don't change any syntax, besides putting `1/` in front)               set = Table[{i, 1/(3*i^2*I + 1*I)}, {i, 0, 10}]     NonlinearModelFit[set, 1/(a + b*x^2*I), {a, b}, x]      Then Mathematica comes up with an error:               FindFit::nrlnum: The function value {1.-1. I,0.5-4.5 I,<<7>>,0.000152393-244.012 I,     <<1>>} is not a list of real numbers with dimensions {11} at {a,b} = {1.,1.}. >>      So now I'm confused- there is no syntax or misspelling problem â€“ is Mathematica just not able to perform such a fractional fit? Or are there any mathematical restrictions, which I have not considered? I'm using Mathematica 7.
