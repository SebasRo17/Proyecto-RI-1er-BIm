Floating licensing is a software licensing approach in which a limited number of licenses for a software application are shared among a larger number of users over time. Nice for the corporates to reduce the costs. It has also the developer aspect. I saw lots of pricing examples for many software. As far I understood, there is no standard to set the prices. As a software developer, it is also a goal to maximize the yield. Which criteria should I take in account by setting the floating license price?
