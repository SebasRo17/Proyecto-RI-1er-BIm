When you create a new styled notebook from the Stylesheets chooser dialag, you get a new notebook using the chosen style with some sample content provided. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F5Ycu.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h4qZw.png) * * * But if you apply styles from the same stylesheet to an open blank notebook, there will be no sample content such as `Enter title here` * * * My question is how can I create one new cells with a given style and some sample content already present? For example: I would like to be able to press `Alt+1` to create a Title-style cell with words `Enter title here`.
