I've been using Python for a little while now and I am enjoying it, but a few of my friends are telling me to start using a language like C# or Java instead and give these reasons:   1. Python is a scripting language   2. Python apps don't port well to people who don't have Python   3. It's hard to make good GUIs in Python since it's a scripting language I like the batteries included approach to Python and the ability to download and upload pre-built modules from PyPI is really useful to me. Is there any specific reason why Python is considered a weak language?
