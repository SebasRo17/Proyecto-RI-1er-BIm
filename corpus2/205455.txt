Hello everyone and thank you for your time :) So I'm a 17 portuguese boy and I'm thinking about starting a website, but because I don't have much money I decided I'd need to learn how to do it myself. So I got several books on the main languages ([X]HTML, AJAX, JS, PHP, MySQL, CSS) but I'm not sure what to do with them. I started studying them in January and, for I thought this was hard, I decided to basically copy the books into several notebookes, and then, once I got the general picture of how these languages operate, I'd restart and starting apply the knowledge. However, this is taking too long. I've been studying this for over 6 months now, wasted over $20 in notebookes, and still there are several books that remain untouched. I'm thinking: maybe it would be a better approach to simply study the books and directly apply the knowledge and keep doing that, step by step, instead of overkilling like this. Meaning: instead of taking notes as you'd do in a normal school class, simply ignore that and dive right into the action and learn from experience. Thoughts? :) Thanks again.
