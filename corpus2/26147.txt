I want to know what $ a^4+b^4+c^4 $ would be when $ a+b+c=1, a^2+b^2+c^2=2, a^3+b^3+c^3=3. $ I tried               Solve[{a + b + c == 1, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 == 2,      a^3 + b^3 + c^3 == 3}, {a, b, c}]          a^4 + b^4 + c^4 /. {a -> ... }      I copied and pasted one instance from the result of `Solve[]` into `{a -> ...}` The solution and the result of `Simplify[]` of it was not quite what I expected. So as a test, I tried `a+b+c /. {a -> ...}` Still it was strange, it didn't come up with 1 which is obvious correct answer. So am I missing anything here? Is there any better way?
