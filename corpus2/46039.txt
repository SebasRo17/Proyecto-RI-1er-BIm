I am currently studying the git documentation to get a hang of distributed version control workflow and use of git command line. I want to first start using git with small, personal, pet projects so to gain experience before doing it on large scale (i.e., bigger projects, team dev). What areas of the git system should I, as a lone player, devote most of my study time to... what parts should I leave for the larger scale work later on. In other words what features of the git system will fully be grasped in team work only, and therefore should not be too involved with at an individual level?
