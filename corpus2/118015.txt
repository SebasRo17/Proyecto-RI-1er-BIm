I'm considering using appledoc, a flavor of Doxygen for use in generating Objective-C code documentation, in order to create documentation for my company's iOS apps. The idea is that a server will generate the docs on a post-commit hook, then publish the documentation on an internal network. Right now we have very little documentation of any kind, even comments in the code itself, so I'm expecting I will have to ask people to begin writing more documentation as they code. In this vein, I will also collaborate with my team in order to create a "style guide" for Objective-C code (like Google's), which will lay down some ground rules on how to write and document code. What are some potential pitfalls in the above plan? Are style guides effective? I see the benefits in adopting a coding standard, but will developers find it restrictive? And do documentation projects such as this one work? And if not, why do they fail? _(I've posted on Stack Overflow a few times with moderate success, but this is my first time posting here. Please let me know if I could improve my question in any way. Thanks!)_
