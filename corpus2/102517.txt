I recently developed an application for an organization (and I'm not charging them). I want to maintain total ownership of the source code and there are various Open Source Project that I've used. I want/need to comply by the rules of the licenses that they use and still keep the project within a few guidelines: >   1. If I ever give the source code out to the organization, It cannot be > modified, redistributed, or shared in any form without my written permission > (which needs to be re-obtained every version). >   2. It should always attribute credits to the developer. >   3. I retain all rights to redistribute/reuse the source code, _since well, > I made it_ >   4. It needs to comply with the App Store's rules (which aren't too open- > source friendly) > The organization has retained the copyright for the compiled application (if that matters) The licenses include: >   1. liberal BSD >   2. Apache License, Version 2.0 >   3. royalty free >   4. public domain (same as 3) >   5. Small amount of artwork from an MIT licensed project > So my question is how can I comply with these licenses but also create a license for my own project that allows me to retain ownership of the source code.
