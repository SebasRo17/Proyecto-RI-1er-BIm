I wish to try the trial version of the latest Intel C++ Compiler for Windows with _Mathematica_. I have downloaded the current version of IntelÂ® C++ Composer XE 2011 for Windows and installed only the "Intel C++ Compiler" component from this package. But _Mathematica_ does not recognize it:               In[1]:= Needs["CCompilerDriver`"]     CCompilers[]          Out[2]= {}      How to configure _Mathematica_ to use the Intel C++ Compiler?
