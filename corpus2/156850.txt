I was wondering if this license is:   * self defeating   * just a clone of an existing, better established license   * practical   * any more "corporate-friendly" than the GPL   * too vague/open ended and finally, if there is a better license that achieves a similar effect? I wanted a license that would (in simple terms)   * be as flexible/simple as the "Simplified BSD" license (which is essentially the MIT license)   * allow anyone to make modifications as long as I'm attributed   * require that I get a notification that such a derived work exists   * require that I have access to the source code and be given license to use the code   * not oblige the author of the derivative work to have to release the source code to the general public   * not oblige the author of the derivative work to license the derivative work under a specific license Here is the proposed license, which is just the simplified BSD with a couple of additional clauses (all of which are **bolded** ). > Copyright (c) (year), (author) (email) > > All rights reserved. > > Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without > modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: > >   1.
