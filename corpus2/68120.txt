In the last interview I attended, I was asked to solve a puzzle where I was expected to measure exactly blah liters of water given two buckets with capacities - blah and blah liters respectively. I was unable to solve the puzzle in given time (~5 minutes). The interviewer was a bit disappointed and said a programmer has got to have "these" skills. I didn't get what skills he was talking about. I have always felt strange about these kind of puzzles that are normally asked at programming job interviews. I do not understand what, if at all, is the connection between such puzzles and programming. Exactly what skills do interviewers intend to assess with such puzzles?
