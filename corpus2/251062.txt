I need to fit at least 300 bytes (or much much more) into a QR code and think I can do this by mapping each byte into the associated ISO/IEC 8859-1 character located here. Since each byte (1-255) will only have one character associated with it, I can test the utility of the idea with this demo (the Email link has the dense QR I'm referring to) Since I know that camera resolution plays a factor here, among other things I'm unaware of, I'd like to get a sense of how many individual characters I can put into a QR code before running into issues. Any sizing, or resolution tips would be helpful. The other assumption I have is that a QR reader can read every ISO/IEC 8859-1 character and pass it to my app
