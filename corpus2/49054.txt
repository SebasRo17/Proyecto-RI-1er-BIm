I have tabular data on a webpage. It looks like this:               Import["http://mfvonh.me/numericalTable.html", "Plaintext"]      > 1.0 > > 1.1 > > 3.53 However, I have many columns, so I want to import it using `"Data"`:               Import[ "http://mfvonh.me/numericalTable.html" , "Data" ]      > { 1. , 1.1 , 3.53 } I'd like to prevent `Import` from converting number-like forms to numbers, as it has done above, and simply extract all tabular data as strings. Obviously there are easy ways to hack this with a workaround; I am looking for an answer that involves `Import[ _ , "Data" ]`. I assume this conversion is somewhere in the `Trace`, but I was overwhelmed when I tried to look at it:               (Import["http://mfvonh.me/numericalTable.html", "Data"] //        Trace) >> "trace.txt"      produced **26 megabytes** of plain text. I took a look. Now I'm stuck.
