We have implemented Scrum quite successfully for the past 5 months. Though, we are 3 weeks away from PROD without _ever_ doing any end-to-end integration test. OUCH! I need help. Without tackling the causes of this (at THIS point), we need now to plan the current iteration, which consists of minor improvements and MANY still unknown bug fixes. How do you account for this scenario? How do you plan your iteration to fix bugs yet to be found?
