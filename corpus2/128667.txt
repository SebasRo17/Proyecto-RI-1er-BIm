Almost all questions and information on both SO and "Google" describes how different licenses works and what license to choose for your work? **But how do they work in reality.** Almost everyone I have spoken to have vastly different thoughts of how they work, including hard core open source developers that gladly share their libs and consultants who is only interested in money and would never reveal their libs. First I will give my impression of how they work in practice with three questions / statements and you can agree or disagree with me on those.   1. Lets say I make a large application and have a small portion of that from GPL code, then the copyright holder can't do much about it as it's deemed non essential code for my application and thereby the "law" rules over the GPL?   2. If the code is generic the copyright doesn't hold. For example if I make a tutorial on how to set up a chess engine no one have to care about my license. That's because my code is mechanical in nature.   3. If I use a lot of GPL code that is essential for my application and don't disclose it and someone finds out, my "punishment" will be to release all my source code, large companies are terrified by this.   But for a small hobby developer this isn't much of an issue as the software wouldn't be written at all or would be open sourced from the start anyway? I don't like this approach personally because I find it unethical and disrespectful to the original author. **EDIT:** Clarified as a comment made was that I din't ask a question. My question is are the 3 statements correct.
