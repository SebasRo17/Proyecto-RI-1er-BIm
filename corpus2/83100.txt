I stumbled upon this Study (of The Development of Programming Ability and Thinking Skills In High School Students)( **link only opens with left-click correct, not in new tab?! dunno why** ) claiming, that students seem to have serious problems learning how programming, abstraction into algorithms,... actually works. What do you think about this and has somebody links to newer free available studies investigating the learning process of programming newbies? Im wondering if this is mainly due to worse teaching or more abstract & difficult to learn languages like C in the past. Of course abilities in mathematics play likely also a bigger role, but this shouldnt be a fundamental hurdle? Is there maybe a connection to how difficult your mother language is structured (grammar, syntax, vocabulary). It is known that programmer newbies of distinct mother languages faster adapt to distinct programming languages? Are there programming languages specially oriented to, for example, chinese/german language? Is the origin of more and more new programming language a sign of individual adaption to a single programmer liked syntax? I would suppose that from a theoretical informatics view there should be a limit of use & different problem types how many different programming languages are really needed. But they seem to grow on and on.
