This is a fairly general question. I know a bit of Perl and Python and I am looking to learn programming in more depth so that once I get the hang of it I can start developing applications and then websites. I would like to know of an algorithm (sequence of steps :)) that could describe my approach towards learning programming in general. I have posted small questions on Perl/Python and I have recieved great help from everyone. Note:- I am not in a hurry to learn. I know it takes time and that's fine. Please give any suggestions you think are valid. Also, please don't push me to learn Lisp, Haskell etc - I am a beginner.
