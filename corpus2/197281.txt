I am currently reading a draft of the C11 specification. The new introduced keywords: `_Bool, _Alignof, _Atomic` all feel like custom extensions, instead of standard reserved keywords like `struct, union, int`. I realize that the standard basically consists of standardized extensions ... but still, this is awful! Maybe we will soon end up with `__Long_Long_Reallylong_Integer_MSVC_2020_t` creeping in the standard! _Is the backward compatibility of nonstandard code the only reason of the new style of the keywords?_
