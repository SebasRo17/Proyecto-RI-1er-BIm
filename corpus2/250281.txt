I find myself loading several models over and over again throughout my application. Instead of typing the code to load the model, run a find, would it be reasonable to put that code in a method and just call it from the controller. For example: **Instead of**               public function view() {         $this->loadModel('Foo');         $this->Foo->find('list');     }      **Could I use**               public function view() {         $this->ComponentName->fooLoad();     }
