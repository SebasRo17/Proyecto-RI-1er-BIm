Let's say I have `BaseA` and `BaseB` classes. `BaseB` can have to several references of `BaseA` instances. Now, we have two other classes, `DerivedA` and `DerivedB` that respectively inherit from `BaseA` and `BaseB`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rnlRx.png) How can I show in such a diagram that `DerivedB` should only store instances of `DerivedA` and not instances of `BaseA`? It seemed pretty simple before I tried to draw it, but now I'm confused. One obvious answer would be "redesign your code"; if there is no alternative, I will probably try to do so.
