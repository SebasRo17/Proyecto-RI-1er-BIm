I'm reviewing my peer's code. I use SourceGear DiffMerge as my diff program, on a Windows environment. While I'm using the diff program, I can clearly see the code changes, etc. Is it possible to save the diff display somehow, with all its colorful rendering and strike-throughs so that I can send my comments by mail? In other words, is it possible to export the diff display to a single file (which includes all the relevant data) to be displayed without the actual need to save the two files separately? (Perhaps HTML is fit for this job). Can you recommend on a diff program that can export the diff as a single file? Thanks in advance!
