I am trying to extract some graphics stored in PICT format from a Mathematica notebook, using a platform that doesn't support PICT. If I look at the `.nb` file in a plain text editor, or if I use `FullForm`, then I can see that the picture is stored as a `GraphicsData` head with a text string encoding the picture. It doesn't appear that the `GraphicsData` head uses Base64 or any other binary-to-text encoding that I know of off the top of my head, but I would like to be able to copy-and-paste the `GraphicsData` string and decode it manually. Is this possible? Does `GraphicsData` use a well-known encoding scheme?
