This question applies to both parameters and arguments, since I've seen this style used in both. I usually write parameters like this               someFunction(arg0, arg1, arg2)      but I've recently noticed that many people write theirs like this               someFunction(     arg0,     arg1,     arg2     ) // the bracket doesn't have to be on its own line      I have a multi-faceted question here: 1) Is it standard practice, good practice, or negligible to put each argument on their own lines?   2) Are their exceptions to this style, like when there is only one argument?   3) What are the pros and cons of such a design?
