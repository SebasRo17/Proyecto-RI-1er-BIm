I apologize if similar questions have already been asked, but I have some difficulties with replacements in Mathematica and I would like to make a substitution like               Exp[I m phiA] --> f[m,phiA]     Exp[I m phiB] --> f[m,phiB]      where m is a number and `phiA`,`phiB` are variables, in expressions that contain sums in the exponent, e.g.               2 + Exp[-2 I (phiA + phiB)] + Exp[2 I phiA + 2 I phiB]      which should give               1/4 + f[-2,phiA] f[-2,phiB] + f[2,phiA] f[2,phiB]      Is this possible? How can it be done?
