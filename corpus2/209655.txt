I am looking for help designing the display of available times for appointments (for example a hairdresser's appointment book). Currently I have a query that returns a collection of periods that are unavailable for appointments (whether there is an existing appointment or if the service provider is closed). So lets say Feb 3rd, from 12 to 5 is unavailable, i want to output the following string: Jan 1st 12 am - Feb 3rd 12pm Feb 3rd, 5pm - Dec 31 12 am. My entire range is 1 year from Jan 1st to December 31st and there can be as many unavailable dates.
