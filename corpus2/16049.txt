As an assignment I need to re-implement `Position`. I've managed to do this except for one small thing, the resulting list is not in the current format. The following piece of code is what I have so far.               findPosition[lst_, x_] :=       Module[{output = {}, index = 1},         For[index = 1, index <= Length[lst], index++,           If[lst[[index]] == x,             AppendTo[output, {index}],             False,             If[MemberQ[lst[[index]], x],               AppendTo[output, Map[{index, #} &, findPosition[lst[[index]], x]]];               False             ]; (* If *)           ] (* If *)         ]; (* For *)         Return[output]       ] (* Module *)      This gives the following output:               findPosition[{1, 2, {3, 2, 1}, {1, {4, 2, 1}, 2, {2, 6}}, {2, 6}}, 2]     {{2}, {{3, {2}}}, {{4, {{2, {2}}}}, {4, {3}}, {4, {{4, {1}}}}}, {{5, {1}}}}      While the original gives:               Position[{1, 2, {3, 2, 1}, {1, {4, 2, 1}, 2, {2, 6}}, {2, 6}}, 2]     {{2}, {3, 2}, {4, 2, 2}, {4, 3}, {4, 4, 1}, {5, 1}}      **Am I doing something wrong or is there a way to make my result match the one from the original?** I've tried things using `Flatten`, but it's hard to control what is flattened and what is not. The closest I've come to is `{{2}, {{3, 2}}, {{4, 2, 2}, {4, 3}, {4, 4, 1}}, {{5, 1}}}` using               AppendTo[output, Map[Flatten[{index, #}] &, FindPosition[lst[[index]], x]]];
