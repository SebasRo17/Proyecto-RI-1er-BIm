To me the ultimate beauty in working as a developer is the fact that given a nice CV, your are going to find a new job, everywhere at any time. So I would like to ask if somebody here as experience in working while travelling for example. Or job-hopping from metropolis to metropolis every, say, six months. For example I have been investigating for how to get to Brazil. But it seems like that working as an employee in Brazil would be no option, b/c it takes a lot of time/money/effort to get the proper visas and permissions. So the only practical solution would be to freelance and the just travel, while getting your job done wherever you are. I bet my ass that there are loads of IT-guys out there and on here who know exactly what I am talking about. I'm looking forward to interesting ideas and stories. **EDIT** for the BOUNTY: I am not so much intersted in general wisdoms but rather in concrete accounts of personal experiences addressing the subject from people who can relate to my question and do have actual personal experiences to share. I am not asking for opinions and accounts of second-degree nature. **EDIT** for **_EVERYBODY_** (concrete questions):   1. Where do you work while travelling? (office pooling? libraries? caf√©s?)   2. Where do you sleep? I guess hotels are somewhat to expensive. (hostels? couchsurfing?) **EDIT** I accepted Andy's reply as "the" answer mainly b/c of its romantic and positive undertone. Though of course there is not THE answer to that question. I was hoping for an intriguing discussion and given 11 vote ups and 5 bookmarks I seem to be not the only one who is interested in some input. So I hope some more people chime in and share their experiences.
