I have a sorted list of blocks `L` that I want to put in 4 containers `C`, the containers have a size limit `S`. I want to have similar containers height, by similar I mean the size variance should be as small as possible. eg:               S = 4     L = [1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]      should result in:               C = [[1, 1], [3], [1, 2], [1, 2]]      note: it is always possible to put every blocks inside the 4 containers and I can't change blocks order is there a way to do this efficiently? I couldn't find algorithm names about this but I didn't really know how to search for that
