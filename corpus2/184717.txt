I have a list of entities. Every entity contains a number that holds how many times the entity has been selected. I need to make a function that selects `n` (say 25%) of the entities, randomly. What I want to do is increase the odds for entities that have been selected the least times. Suppose after 5 runs the times the entities have been selected can be anywhere from 0 to 5. But I don't want to have such a spread. I want the times the entities are selected more or less to be equal. How can I write a function that increases the odds for entities that haven't been selected as often as others? One way I could think of is to make a list that has more occurrences of lesser selected entities, increasing the chance the randomizer selects that entity. Any hints, tips, ideas? **EDIT:** Wow. Closed as not being a real question and reopened again. For not being a real question it did get a lot of answers and comments. Thanks for that. I got exactly what i wanted from them. I got some nice ideas to work out and to test.
