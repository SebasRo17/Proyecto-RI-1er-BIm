When I started learning about Web Pages I followed several of the Microsoft tutorials, all of which utilized WebMatrix. I did this until I realized that WebMatrix offered no debugging. Wait? What?? No way. And I quickly moved my Web Pages development to Visual Studio. While there were some things that I thought were nicely done in WebMatrix, I have found nothing that I cannot do in in Visual Studio. Also, unless someone who knows better than me enlightens me, I am vehemently against developing the same project with two different IDEs; It just seems like an unnecessary risk to me. Nevertheless, I would like to ask for your thoughts/insights about this. I am very curious to know if any of you use them in tandem and, if so, what aspects of each do you utilize the most? And, of course, does it cause problems?
