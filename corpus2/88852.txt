I manage a team of coders (5people) that maintain a few modules in a large project. On top of doing coding, we also do production operational tasks (like doing server housekeeping, batch backlog tracking) These tasks are done daily, done by 1 person, and is rotated weekly The problem is this: These tasks are routine, but there I cant think of a practical way of ensuring the person does what he is supposed to do. I thought of using spreadsheets to track, or to the extent of doing a paper checklist, which the person on duty will have to physically sign off. I just want the guy on duty to remember and execute every daily item. What works on your project?
