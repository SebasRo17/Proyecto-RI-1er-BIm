I am running a project where I pay developers to contribute to my semi open source project. My problem is that it is easy to hire developers, but it is very difficult to get anyone to do code reviewing. I have repeatedly attempted to get the senior developers to review the code of the junior developers. I have attempted to pay them more, give them higher status etc. But they just seem to want to code instead of reviewing code. Now I am considering forcing all developers that want to code, to also review code, but I have a feeling that it is a bad idea. My question is, therefore, how can I motivate capable people to review the code of others? How is this done in successful open source projects like Linux, PostgreSQL, LibreOffice etc.
