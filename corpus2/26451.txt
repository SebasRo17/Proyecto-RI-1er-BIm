I am trying to solve the following: $\begin{align*} &X \sim N(1,1)\\\ &\mathrm{cov}(X, X^3) = \text{?} \end{align*}$ where $\mathrm{cov}$ is the covariance. How would you do this in _Mathematica_? I have tried               X = NormalDistribution[1, 1]          cov[x_, y_] := Mean[TransformedDistribution[a*b,                         {a \[Distributed] x, b \[Distributed] y}]] - Mean[x] Mean[y]          cov[X, TransformedDistribution[a^3, a \[Distributed] X]]      But this doesn't seem to work.
