If in a notebook you enter:               WolframAlphaResult["Sunrise june 25, 2013", {{"DaylightInformation", 1}, "ComputableData"},                        PodStates -> {"DaylightInformation__More"}]        you get:               {{"begin astronomical twilight","3:16 am EDT"},     {"begin nautical twilight","4:07 am EDT"},     {"begin civil twilight", "4:50 am EDT"},     {"sunrise","5:24 am EDT"},      {"sunset", "8:31 pm EDT"},      {"end civil twilight","9:05 pm EDT"},     {"end nautical twilight","9:48 pm EDT"},      {"end astronomical twilight","10:39 pm EDT"},     {"duration of daylight", {15, 8}}}        as a result (I didn't know there was something called "nautical twilight," but now that I do, I want it). Unfortunately, the result is returned not as a nice list, but instead embedded in a complicated `WolframAlphaResult` format. Despite trying many different approaches, I have been unable to discover a way to get just a list of this data returned. It is possible?
