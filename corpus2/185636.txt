Is it a good idea or a bad idea to create an interface for data transfer objects? Presuming that the object is usually mutable. Though my example is in Java, it should be applicable to any other language that has similar concepts.               interface DataTransferObject  {         String getName();         void setName(String name);     }          class RealDataTransferObject  implements DataTransferObject {              String name;         String getName() {             return name;         }          void setName(String name) {             this.name = name;         }     }      Of course, this is a simplified example, in real life there may be more fields.
