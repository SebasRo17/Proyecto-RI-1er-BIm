Different from Fastest way to document software architecture and design. I'd like to write a manual for my software which includes   1. Command line usage   2. Howtos/Tutorials on using the software    3. Example code for writing plugins   4. Manual on functions and classes for the plugin sdk I'd like to mark words for linking so i can write "also see FuncA, FuncB, etc" with each func as a link. Perhaps have the code sample monospace width/font and indented like you would see in many books. What software/markup/format may i use to generate a manual? I'm unsure what format the manual will be but it will likely be html, pdf or both. Bonus if its a text format and plays nicely with source control (i'm using git) but that doesn't matter as i'll probably have it outside of my source control.
