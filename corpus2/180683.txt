This is my understanding of the _Application Layer_ : • It implements _Application logic_ • this layer contains _Application Services_ , which are used by external consumers to talk to your application • _Application Services_ are coarse-grained and orchestrate operations which map directly to _use cases_ ( hence also the term _Workflow Services_ ) 1)   From: > Application Logic is mostly workflow logic. It is the application specific > coordination of domain and infrastructure components according to the > requirements of that particular application. From: > Let's start a company, shall we?

Thus, does only the the first definition describe the logic contained in _Application layer_ , while the latter definition is describing a different kind of logic? b) If indeed both definitions describe the logic in _Application layer_ , then wouldn't this mean that _Application layer_ performs two tasks: orchestrating operations that map directly to _use cases_ and executing non-business related logic (such as security, caching etc)?
