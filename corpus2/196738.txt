These days there are more cross programming language compilers (specially from some 'X' language to JavaScript). I wonder how these are developed? What are the general steps to be taken care to write algorithms if I were to develop one? Do I need to be completely thorough in Lexical Analysis? As far as my knowledge is concerned they should follow the same steps of translating some 'X' language to Assembly language (basic compilation). Is that how they actually been developed? OR there is some different way? Thanks
