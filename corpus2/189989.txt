There are some open source projects that I'd like to incorporate into a product at work. We don't have the bandwidth nor the subject matter expertise to do it ourselves. I found these by searching in Google. I'm unaware of any "major players" that utilize the projects, but I'm pretty encouraged by what I see. Now, I'm a bit concerned about the amount of risk I'm exposed to by using joe- blow's open source project. If it takes me 95% of the way there, perhaps the remaining 5% is easy to add or fix. Perhaps it's non-trivial. **How do people go about determining whether an open source project is mature enough to use in a product?** This is not a hobby project, so stability, maintainability, etc. are paramount.
