The application which I am working on currently is a bit huge. It cannot be explained in 15 minutes or so. Last time I ended up drawing some class diagrams and how they are linked, but I could see that the interviewer was not happy with the answer. What are the main things that should be highlighted when answering this question? For example, how session is managed, how persistence is achieved are few things. What are other things, which should not be missed?
