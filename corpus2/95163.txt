For fairly small, non-complex web applications, we have utilized jQuery to make asynchronous calls to an ASP.NET web service for interaction with our Sqlite data store. This has proven to be a pretty clean way to isolate the application tiers while taking advantage of the powerful client-side functionality of JQuery. However, we are currently in the process of designing a larger application that consists of potentially hundreds of data elements. I am concerned that the sort of architecture mentioned above could get unwieldy pretty fast if we are passing hundreds of elements into the web service from a jQuery ajax post. I was interested in others experience with this sort of design and whether you would recommmend another approach.
