> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Do Diversified Skills Foster or Hinder Specialization? I am 27 years old and I've been working professionally as a developer for about 4 or 5 years now. I've worked mostly on Web based projects using either PHP or ASP.NET. Recently, I've been doing mobile development at work developing apps for iOS, Android and BlackBerry. I've been bouncing back and forth between languages and technologies, but I feel like it would be hard to present myself to an employer as an expert or demigod in a particular thing. I'm sort of a jack-of-all trades kind of guy. Lately, I've been thinking about specializing in LAMP (CodeIgniter as a framework) for the Web side of things and Android and BlackBerry on the Mobile side. My question is should I be specializing at all? Or should I try to adopt which ever technology the company I'm working with takes on?
