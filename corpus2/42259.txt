When I read these lines aloud to someone:               $controller->process();          UserManager::getInstance();      How should the `->` and `::` be pronounced? Reading the characters themselves in cumbersome and I don't know of any nicknames for them. Being a developer who is used to C-style syntax, I'd like to say "dot", but I'd like something that is easy to say _and_ people can easily understand. It would also be good to know if there are any pronunciations that have become de-facto standards among teams of developers.
