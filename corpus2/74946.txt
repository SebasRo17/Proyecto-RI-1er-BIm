We're a bunch(4-5) of 3nd year college students about to begin our 3 months summer vacation and we would like to get going on a project. We want to make a game with XNA, it doesn't have to be big or something but we have 3 months so I'm not sure how big it can get. I plan on being the "team leader" because I have the most experience with C#/XNA and I'd like to learn how to be a team leader, this could be good training. So how should I proceed with this ? Whats the best way of leading a small team when you've never done it before ?
