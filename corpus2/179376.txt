I am trying to create a localized application in C# / WPF in Visual Studio 2012. For that I created two resource files and changed one string in a (XAML) window to use the resource files (instead of a hardcoded string). I see the English text from the resource file, which is correct. However, I want to check if the other resource file (fr-FR) also works but I cannot find a setting or procedure how to change my 'project' to run in French. Thanks in advance.
