There is a useful feature in _WolframAlpha_ that allows to find a possible closed form for approximate numeric values. It can be used, for example, to guess the value of an integral that _Mathematica_ cannot evaluate symbolically.               Integrate[LogIntegral[x]^3/x^5, {x, 1, ∞}]     (* Integrate[LogIntegral[x]^3/x^5, {x, 1, ∞}] *)          N[%, 20]     (* -2.7107171698324070788 *)          Sign[%] WolframAlpha[ToString[Abs[%]], {{"PossibleClosedForm", 1}, "FormulaData"}] /. Hold[expr_ ≈ _] :> expr     (* -1/4 π^2 Log[3] *)      I noticed that sometimes _Inverse Symbolic Calculator+_ can find a closed form for numbers that cannot be recognized by _WolframAlpha_. Can anybody suggest _Mathematica_ code that queries _Inverse Symbolic Calculator+_ , parses a closed form returned by it and converts it into a _Mathematica_ expression?
