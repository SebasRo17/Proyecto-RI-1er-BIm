Can _Mathematica_ solve $\; d^2/dx^2{}+ (1/x) d/dx\;$ form of equations?   For example, I am trying to solve the system of equations given below:               eqn1 = D[w[x], {x, 2}] + (1/x) (D[w[x], x]) - w[x];     eqn2 = D[v[x], {x, 2}] + (1/x) (D[v[x], x]) - (v[x] - u[x]);     eqn3 = D[u[x], {x, 2}] + (1/x) (D[u[x], x]) + v[x] - u[x] - w[x];     eqnSet = {eqn1 == 0, eqn2 == 0, eqn3 == 0, w[1] == 0, v[1] == 0,            u[1] == 0, w'[0] == 0, v'[0] == 0, u'[0] == 0};     DSolve[eqnSet, {w[x], v[x], u[x]}, x]      I am getting `DSolve` returning the input statement unevaluated.
