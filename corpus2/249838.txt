I'm trying to think up a scenario when I'd have three different forms of NSData (or whatever) to be sent to three different services like Evernote, Google drive, Dropbox. Granted, each of those has there own SDKs to be bundled into the iOS app, and thats okay. Now, I want to create a single Class that serialises the both sending and receiving data to and from the above services. My mind is taking me to a `singleton`, a shared class with `NSOperationQueue` at its foundation. I'd periodically add `{send:"this data" to:dropbox}` into an `NSOperationBlock` and add it to the `singleton`. At any given time say the following operations could be within the `singleton`'s `NSOperationQueue`.   * `{send:"this data" to:dropbox}`   * `{send:"this number" to:evernote}`   * `{send:"this dude" to:googledrive}` The `singleton` would need to handle internet reachability, app sessions etc. This class would be connected to **Dropbox** , **Evernote** and **GDrive** and their respective SDK bundles. So, in reality the only thing this class would do is, hand over the data to the respective SDKs to handle it on their own (which is like saying, handle it and let me know if it was a success or failed.) I'd really like suggestions/critique on the approach i'm taking. I have little experience with `NSOperationQueue`, I don't know if I'm making the right choices here. Some clues to a good API pattern would really be helpful. ## UPDATE It was suggested I create a wrapper for each service. But If can stress that theres little to do in a `Dropbox Wrapper` classes, Since in iOS everything is handled in their own SDK. For example, **Evernote** extends only a simple `[ENSession .. uploadNote..]`. All I wanted to do, is serialise my uploads into a single global queue and then dispatch the single methods to either `Dropbox` or `Evernote` or wherever. If suppose there is a service that requires some form of data handling, I'd then use a _wrapper_ and dispatch its own thread. I'll add this into the question too. Its the serialising & queueing I want.Sounds reasonable?
