I want to ask about how can we control `Manipulate` function so that it is not incrementing the step until the expression is calculated. I have the following simple code:               data = RandomReal[1, {100, 10}];     data2 = ConstantArray["Emp", {100, 10}];     Manipulate[           data2[[1 + IntegerPart[i/10.00000001], i - IntegerPart[i/10.00000001]*10]] =        data[[1 + IntegerPart[i/10.00000001], i - IntegerPart[i/10.00000001]*10]];            data2 // TableForm, {i, 1, 1000, 1}]      If you see when you click the `"PlayButton"`, the `Manipulate` jumps the step in non-sequential odder so that it is not calculating the expressions in sequential odder. I want to ask if there is any way to control the play action of `Manipulate` so that it is not moving to `i + 1` until it is calculated the expressions at `i`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nnz6T.jpg)
