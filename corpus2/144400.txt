Which of these two programmers is "better", from a managerial standpoint? The first programmer is Albert. You tell Al to make a system that will pass you the salt at the dinner table. He does it in less than a day. It works fine. The second programmer is Ben. Ben is _told_ to make a program to pass the salt, and after two days, he's still working on it. ![The General Problem](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FZKx7.png) It will save time in the long run...if you need pepper, ketchup, etc. There isn't any clear indication that there will be a need for this, but it's not improbable. Who's the better programmer to have working under you, as a manager?
