I would like to use `NIntegrate` in a function with some parameters from a list. I simplified my problem for this forum. The list of parameters is as follows:               aH = {aH1, aH2};     pars = {aH1 -> 2., aH2 -> 3.};      Normal integration works fine. The next function gives numerical output for numerical values of t and T.               f[t_, T_, k_Integer]:=Exp[-Integrate[aH[[k]],{u,t,T}]]      Now I would like to define the function using `NIntegrate`               f[t_?NumericQ, T_?NumericQ, k_Integer, aH1_?NumericQ] := Exp[-NIntegrate[aH[[k]], {u, t, T}]]      Unfortunately, this does not give numerical output when trying to evaluate by:               f[0., 1., 1, 2.]      Does anyone know how to solve this? Your help is much appreciated. Best regards, Frits
