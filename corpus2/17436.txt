I have this list:               a = {{{0, 0}, {1, 7}, {2, 0}, {3, 2}, {4, 7}}, {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {2, 1}, {3, 2}, {4, 7}}}      and I'd like to transform it to this:               a = {{{0, 0}, {1, 7}, {2, Na}, {3, 2}, {4, 7}}, {{0, 0}, {1, Na}, {2, 1}, {3, 2}, {4, 7}}}      ie I'd like to replace every 0 by Na except in the first sub-sub-list of each sub-list. All I can come up with is:               Part[#, 2 ;; All, All] & /@ a  /. 0 -> Na      and it works I get               {{{1, 7}, {2, Na}, {3, 2}, {4, 7}}, {{1, Na}, {2, 1}, {3, 2}, {4, 7}}}      but the modification is not attributed to `a`. How can I do that?
