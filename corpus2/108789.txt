When I apply for jobs I have to compete with too many other software engineers who have little or no skill and dilute the candidate pool. I feel it devalues our profession and ultimately pushes down salary levels for all practicing software engineers. I feel my career, and that of other skilled software engineers, would benefit if less unskilled software engineers were prevented from entering the field until they passed a standard set of tests to become "licensed", like other professions such as medicine and law -- they have made it very hard for others to join them, creating an artificial shortage via strict license and boards. They are paid a lot more than most engineers. And even other engineers have PE exams before they are allowed to "practice". Would requiring licensure of software engineers or having a Software Engineer Board increase skill and salary levels in the field?
