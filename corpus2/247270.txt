With all the noise about EC6, one thing that I realized I haven't heard about is expanding Javascript's standard library. Javascript has a fairly sparse standard library. You need a 3rd party library to do many basic things like date manipulation. I'd rather have more built into the browser via a standard library then have to download Javascript to do basic things. Is this a focus of the standards body? Is it contingent on ES6 modules? Is it even correct to discuss an "Ecmascript standard library" (does the standard specify a std lib like say C++'s spec does) or is it something specific to the Javascript implementation of the Ecmascript standard?
