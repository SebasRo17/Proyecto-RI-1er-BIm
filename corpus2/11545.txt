Inspired by Sjoerd C. de Vries' nice answer to this question, and the desire to pimp a Graph I did with Mathematica recently I would like to know if there are ways to customize the arrow's shaft rather than its head (other than using `Tube` in `Graphics3D`). I am especially interested in arrows with non-uniform thickness along its length. Consider some examples grabbed from the web: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xR25d.jpg) Any chance to come up with a solution that allows to have Graphs like the following with automatically drawn/scaled arrow? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cIYRI.jpg) P.S.: This is a 2D question:). I understand that Line (and Tube) have the advantages to be easier to handle in 3D.
