I’ve been working on something outside of my day job and they have asked me if they can use it. It is a closed source project, but I don’t mind giving them the source code; but I definitely want to retain the intellectual property and any improvements they make. Is there a prewritten licence I could use for this? Has anyone got any experience of this situation? Update I decided to drop the “any improvements they make” bit. So I’m looking for a licence that has the following • The intellectual property to stay with me • they cannot sell the source code • but free to use it in all products and to make modifications I think if I modify the BSD license that will achieve this....
