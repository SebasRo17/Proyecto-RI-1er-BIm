I want to generate a couple of plots/graphs with Area51 statistics. Since Area51 doesn't work with the SE API, I'm forced to find another way to get the information I want. That other way is with `RegularExpression[]` (or _Mathematica_ 's string patterns). Let's start with a specific example, then move on to a more general case. _Mathematica_ lets me fetch the source of an `HTML` page with               src=Import["http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4470/martial-arts","Source"];      `src` now contains a string, which is the source code of the page. **What am I looking for?** The information that interests me is the value inside each of the blue squares, as well as its textual counterpart, namely _Needs Work_ , _Okay_ , or _Excellent_. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tncq6.png) I would use something like               StringCases[a,       RegularExpression[        "regex"] ->        "$1"]      to get the data I want, but unfortunately I don't know how to write regexes. _Side question_ : should I use _Mathematica_ 's string patterns, or `RegularExpression[]`? **The more general case** Once I can fetch the data above for one site, it's a piece of cake to get it for every proposal in beta. My goal is to be able to plot this data, to see how our site compares against the others concerning SE's top 5 health indicators.
