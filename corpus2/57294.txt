I'm trying to use NestList to calculate a continued function. It works great, except when there is an overflow or an indeterminate value, which might happen for some initial values. How can I use an equivalent of Break[] to exit a NestList before it finishes? I'd like the working equivalent of (say) this:               NestList[Check[f[# z],Break[]]&, z, 1000]      which does not work because NestList is not treated like a For, a While or a Do. If I use another expression instead of Break[] (say the string "err"), the computation of NestList continues and produces a complete list of `... f[z f[z f[z err]]]` which has to be handled afterwards. EDIT: I found a simple solution, many thanks to paw!               NestWhileList[f[# z]&, z, NumericQ, 1, 1000]
