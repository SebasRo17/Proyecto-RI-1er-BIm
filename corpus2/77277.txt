Our shop is about to release a major rewrite of our application. And, we are going to need to do bug fixes on versions out in the field while developing new features for the next version. Frankly, I'm a bit overwhelmed by the thought of trying to manage it all with the command line. Are there any really good Subversion clients that help manage branching and merging? We have Windows and Linux computers available to us; so either platform is fine. If there aren't any good tools that help idiot-proof branching and merging, what are the best tips you have for managing multiple branches?
