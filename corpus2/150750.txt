The Queue class in the python kombu library inherits from MaybeChannelBound, which in turn implements the **call** method (making it callable). The **call** () method itself is a thin wrapper around the bind() method. It is not clear why this was done, as calling the bind() method seems (to my simple mind, at least) to be clearer and more descriptive of the intent of the function. Why would somebody use the **call** () method in a situation like this?
