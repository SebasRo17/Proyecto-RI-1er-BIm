I am looking for any ideas about how to colorize an ellipsoid with a custom gradient style or by a `Blend` function. I would like to colorize ellipsoid as follows:   * at $(5,0,0)$ and $(-5,0,0)$ should be red color,    * at $(0,2,0)$ and $(0,-2,0)$ should be green color   * at $(0,0,2)$ and $(0,0,-2)$ should be blue color All other points should be interpolated, respectively to their locations. I tried to use `Blend` function, but something went wrong. My code:               ParametricPlot3D[{5 Cos[u] Cos[v], 2 Cos[v] Sin[u], 2 Sin[v]},     {u, 0, 2 Pi, Pi/10}, {v, -Pi/2, Pi/2, Pi/10}, Axes -> False,      Boxed -> False, Mesh -> None,      ColorFunction ->Function[u, v,      Blend[{Red, Green, Blue}, {5 Cos[u] Cos[v], 2 Cos[v] Sin[u], 2 Sin[v]}]]]
