At some point in time, I just stopped coding for fun. I used to go to work, finish my assignments and then upon arriving home I'd go and write stuff on the side for fun. However, I now just go home and try to avoid the computer. I'd rather read the paper, watch TV, go out to the bar, etc. Is this a bad sign? I mean I still try to keep up on the latest trends, hit up the developer forums/blogs/etc but I haven't said, "I want to learn language X - I wonder if I could write app Y in it" Has this happened to anyone else?
