Background: How to enter matrices in block matrix format? and the following: I want to create $$ f(A,t) = \left [ \begin{matrix} A & t \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right ] $$ where $A$ is a $n$ by $n$ square matrix size , and $t$ is a column vector of length $n$. The solution in the question above works for case 2, the following code works for cases 2 and 3:                 Transpose[Append[Transpose[Append[IdentityMatrix[2], {0, 0}]], {a1, a2, 1}]] // MatrixForm       Transpose[Append[Transpose[Append[IdentityMatrix[3], {0, 0, 0}]], {a1, a2, a3,1}]] // MatrixForm      **Question: What is the best code for case $n$?**
