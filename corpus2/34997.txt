I'm writing a paper and all my code is in _Mathematica_. The snippets are mostly simple, and consist of loops, maps, variables, and conditionals. I'd like add it to my paper, however, not many academic journals accept verbatim code in a specific language, and I'm short on time, so here is my question: **Does anyone know of a package that translates _Mathematica_ functions and code to pseudo-code?** Of course there is no universal syntax pseudo-code, but I'll accept anything that is adequately general (bonus points for robust exportability to $\LaTeX$). Here are some examples of this utility in other languages:   * http://www.rapidqualitysystems.com/Products/CodeRocketEclipse   * http://www.bigresource.com/VB-Pseudocode-Generator-sjETRTxkP2.html When writing papers I always do the translation by hand, but enough is enough, _Mathematica_ should excel at a high-level translation problem like this and at least get the bulk of the work done for me! I use the pseudocode environment from the `fancybox` package to typeset pseudocode into $\LaTeX$. Please note that I fully intend on trying to write an answer to this myself, so don't down vote for the lack of code just yet! `:)`
