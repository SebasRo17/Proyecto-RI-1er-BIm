I'm getting a new computer and would like to minimize the time spent configuring and maintaining dev environments on my various machines. To that end, I'm thinking that creating a vm with my preferred ide and configuration and using that vm for development on all my machines. I'd like to use Windows 7 as the vm's os. For those who have tried or currently use an approach like this,   1. How can I keep the disk image synchronized without resorting to a thumb drive? What are pros/cons (if any).   2. As I do this first configuration manually, should I record my steps in the interest of scripting them later?   3. If so, what approach would you recommend for scripting? Cygwin + bash? Ant? Something else? Why?   4. Are there potential difficulties I should be aware of re: sharing a filesystem? For instance, in A) accessing vm files from the host machine or B) accessing the vm's HTTP server from the host machine?
