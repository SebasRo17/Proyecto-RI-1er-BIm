I am plotting a function and for labeling the axes I use:               AxesLabel -> {Style[y, FontSize -> 21], Style[{Subscript[f, i], Subscript[q, i]}, FontSize -> 21]}      here $y$ is for the $x$-axis and $\\{f_i,q_i\\}$ is for the $y$-axis. The problem is that I dont want to have $\\{\\}$. I only want to have $f_i,q_i$ at the $y$-axis. How can I manage this? Thank you very much.
