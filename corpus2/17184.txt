I have a list of coordinates that define the edges of a polygon and I would like to get a function defining the area Inside out if it (The polygon is convex and the points are in order) So that for example: `List[{0, 2}, {4, 2}, {.5, 0}]` Becomes: `Boole[(y < 2 && 7y > 4x-3 && Y > 2-4x)]` I found the Polygon function to accept lists but I don't know how to turn it into a function. I guess there is some easy way to do that as it's a quite common thing but I fail to find it.
