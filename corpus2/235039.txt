I'm wondering what the difference is, and at what stage these different terms are used within the Agile/Scrum methodology? `use case`, `user requirements` and `user stories` Am I right in thinking they start off in the requirement elicitation stage as `use cases` then become the `user requirements`, which are pretty much the same as the `user stories` used in the `products backlog`? Trying to write a university report and haven't been able to find anything defining all of these terms in the same place, which has made it difficult to understand the differences. Are some of these terms even required within an Agile approach?
