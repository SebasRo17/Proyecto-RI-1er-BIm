I work at a web design/development shop. Everything we do is centered around the Joomla! CMS. I'm a bit worried-if anything goes wrong with Joomla (major security flaw revealed, Joomla folds and ceases development) we're sunk. I'm meeting with the CEO to plan the next few steps for our company. Should I recommend that we create our own in-house CMS or am I just being paranoid about a single point of failure?
