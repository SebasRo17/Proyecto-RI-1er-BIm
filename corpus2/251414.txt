I have an external thermometer connected via USB that is controlled by my SW. Different parts of my system will use it but never at the same time (all in one thread). However, it is a single device communicating over an established connection so for some reason I think either its method (GetTemperature) should be static or I could do it as Singleton. I will be happy for suggestions. Thanks
