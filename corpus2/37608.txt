I want to know what `Dispatch` actually does to rule the list. Why is it so fast? The documentation says > Dispatch generates a dispatch table which uses hash codes to specify which > sets of rules need actually be scanned for a particular input expression. What is a hash table? How does it specify which sets of rules need actually be scanned for a particular input expression? What about `DeleteCases`? Since it is fast too, Does it use hash table too?
