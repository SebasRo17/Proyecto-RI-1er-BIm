I am now the owner of a Struts-1 application, and the Hibernate session management is all over the place. I have searched online documentation but have not found a clear explanation of the best way to manage Hibernate sessions in a Struts application. Presumably a Hibernate Session should be created (or fetched) at the start of each action, and a transaction opened, and then the transaction committed or rolled back at the end of the action. Is that correct? How can this be managed for all actions without duplicating code in each action? Should each Action fetch objects from the DB, call model functions, and then save the objects, ala Ruby on Rails?
