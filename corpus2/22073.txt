I want to create the matrix H of dimensions nxn and matrix elements H(i,j). Because of the physical problem I am dealing with, it is necessary to build it in the following not trivial way. I know how to do it in Fortran, but this time I have not been able to figure out how to do it in Wolfram Mathematica. FORTRAN WAY:                 do iy=1,n               do ix=1,n                  do jy=1,n                     do jx=1,n                      i = ix+(iy-1)*n                      j = jx+(jy-1)*n               (Now I give a list of "If" about i and j, and give values to my matrix elemnts H(i,j))                      enddo             enddo         enddo     enddo      Does anybody know how to do this in Wolfram Mathematica?
