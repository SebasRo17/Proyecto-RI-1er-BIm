I see a lot of people talking about how cool functional programming is, how awesome Lisp and Haskell and F# are, etc, but what I don't see is them actually being _used_. Just about every program on my computer is written in either something in the C family, Delphi, or Python. I see tutorials talking about how easy it is to use functional languages to do complicated math problems, but no one talking about using them to do things most people actually care about using computers for, like business applications and games. Does anyone have any examples of actual programs that people have heard of and are using, written in a functional language? The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Abuse, from almost 15 years ago. (Things like Emacs, where the core program is written in C with a functional language scripting layer on top, don't count.)
