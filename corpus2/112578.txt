Here's what is meant by operators and methods. Attempting to keep the questions as simple and open ended as possible, since the question is more about the conceptual nature of operators and methods NOT how a language has decided to implement them. **Proof of Concept:** This example in Ruby is more of a proof of concept than anything else. EXAMPLE: In Ruby, "`1+2`" is equivalent to "`1.+(2)`", meaning the object "1" implements a method called "+" with object "2" as the method's argument.
