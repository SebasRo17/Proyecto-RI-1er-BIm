I'm based in the UK and have been developing software for over 10 years so think I am a reasonable way through my career. On and off in various jobs I have had I have been members of various institutions, the BCS and the IEE being the main ones. At the moment I am not a member of either. I have tended to work in areas where most people are system engineers rather than software engineers but there has generally been a push to try and get everyone chartered at a level or other. However I actually do not know what use chartership has for me. Many senior people I have worked with say hat they have never bothered. It has never been part of any interview I have been one and it seems to make no difference to pay/training/conditions etc. So, can anyone tell me if looking at chartership for software roles is useful or important and if so, should I be looking at BCS or IEE?
