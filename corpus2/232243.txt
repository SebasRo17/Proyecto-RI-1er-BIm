I currently have a test class with a `setUp` method for creating a temp file and a `tearDown` method for deleting a temp file. However, only some of the the `test_` methods in that class require this functionality. Is possible to either ignore those 2 methods for the test cases which do not require it or to only call those 2 methods for test cases which do require it? It feels a bit 'wrong' to call these 2 methods for every test even if the temp file is not getting used in each one.
