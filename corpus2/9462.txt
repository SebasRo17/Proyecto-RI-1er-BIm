In Mathematica 8, the Integrate command sometimes strangely integrates polynomials yielding unsimplified (and unexpected) fractional results. As an example, the line:               Integrate[((h-x)*(q[1]+q[2])+x*(q[3]+q[4]))^2,{x,0,h}]      The (unsimplified) result is:               h^2/3(-(q[1]+q[2])^3+(q[3]+q[4])^3)/(-q[1]+q[2]+q[3]+q[4])      while the (theoretical) result cannot be a fraction. What are the proper command lines which lead to a polynomial?
