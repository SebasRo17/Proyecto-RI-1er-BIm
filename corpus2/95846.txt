I am a developer for the last 8 years. We used XSLT primarily to transform XML into HTML. We also used it for XML to XML transformation. But we have replacement for everything now. HTML can be comfortably created through programming languages such as ASP.Net. XML can be read and manupulated in any standard highlevel languages. As programming in XSLT is a little complex, any one would prefer working on latest programming languages. Now my question: Will XSLT be a significant choice in future, not considering the fact of maintaining already developed XSLT? Can I recommend new programmers to study XSLT?
