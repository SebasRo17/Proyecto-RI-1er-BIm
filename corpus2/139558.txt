I love being a programmer. There, I said it. However, with that said, I've realized lately that I really can't _stand_ bug-fixing. At all. In fact, while I'm developing something, my productivity is extremely high. Even when writing unit-tests and doing self testing of my development, I'm generally really productive. I can focus well, and I can get tasks done. However, when QA time comes around and I'm working on fixing bugs, my inspiration takes a massive nosedive. I have to force myself with pretty extreme measures (you know, high BPM music, excessive amounts of caffeine, etc.) to get _anything_ done. My job is usually involved with stepping into an existing massive project and adding new features or fixing bugs, so I can't exactly tell my employer that I need a couple weeks to write unit tests for all of their code :) In addition, the server technology that we often use is very prohibitive to both unit and integration testing, as it has quite a few Java classloader issues. I'm not completely against bug-fixing, sometimes it can be fun, but it's _not fun at all_ when you have to make minor changes and wait 30 seconds to 3 minutes to be able to see if they worked or not (due to the way the system works). How can I improve my productivity and motivation when bugfixing? Is this something that most programmers deal with?
