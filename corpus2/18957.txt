I'm puzzled by `FontSubstitutions`. The help says this: > FontSubstitutions is an option for Style and Cell that gives a list of > substitutions to try for font family names. I typed this:               Options[Style, FontSubstitutions]      with the result: > Options::optnf: FontSubstitutions is not a known option for Style. >> OK. So I try the example instead:               Options[$FrontEnd, FontSubstitutions]      and get a list of rules:               {FontSubstitutions -> {"Helv" -> "Helvetica", "Arial" -> "Helvetica",        "Times New Roman" -> "Times", "Courier New" -> "Courier",        "Lucidabright" -> "Times", "Charter" ->  "Helvetica",       "Lucidatypewriter" -> "Courier", "Fixed" -> "Monaco",       "AGaramond" -> "Times", "Avant Garde" -> "Helvetica", "Bodoni" -> "Times",      "Bookman" -> "Times", "Caslon 3 Roman" -> "Times", ...      (Some of these rules are a bit strange - almost like misspellings...) In the tutorial _tutorial/TextAndFontOptions_ , I read: > In addition, you can set FontSubstitutions to be a list of rules that give > replacements to try for font family names. So my interpretation of this is that, when you supply a string for `FontFamily`, _Mathematica_ will, on failing to find any kind of matching font for that string, see if there's a rule for it, and then use the equivalent font given by that rule. However, I've not yet managed to make it happen. Here I try Bodoni. It's not currently active (and the basic face is called Bodoni Book anyway), so it should be substituted by Times. But it appears as Lucida Grande.               Style["The quick brown fox", 60, FontFamily -> "Bodoni"]      ![font substitutions](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JGs0T.png) and I couldn't get any of the rules to be applied. I also tried setting a paragraph of text in a particular font (the terrible Dom Casual, which has a rule replacing it with Helvetica), then closing Mathematica, de-activating the font, then re-opening Mathematica and the document. The paragraph's font reverted to ... Lucida Grande. So, does anyone know how `FontSubstitutions` works?
