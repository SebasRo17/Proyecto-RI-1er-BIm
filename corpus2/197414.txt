I am working on adding test coverage for an application that previously didn't have any. One additional requirement that emerged is that one of the background processes should be able to process 100,000 rows at a time. I've written a unit test that ensures that the background process is able to work with the 100,000 entities without crashing the interpretter (PHP) on a 4.0MB memory limit. But each test run takes close to 4 minutes to finish. All other tests take just 10 seconds to run. Can this be approached differently than a unit test?
