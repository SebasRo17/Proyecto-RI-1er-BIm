OK, let's make one final attempt; they say the third time is the lucky one! Following @rm-rf 's suggestions, I will try to be as clear as I can. My Mathematica code reads and plots simultaneously some data files. The output of the function `plo` below can be either a `Graphics` object (`ListPlot`) or a null string (`""`) if the data it reads doesn't exist. I want to arrange the 20 plots below in a grid of fixed dimensions ($ 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 2 \times 2$) like so:               P0 = Show[GraphicsGrid[{     {plo[1, 1], plo[2, 1], plo[4, 1], plo[7, 1]},     {plo[1, 2], plo[3, 1], plo[5, 1], plo[7, 2]},     {plo[1, 3], plo[3, 2], plo[6, 1], plo[8, 1]},     {plo[1, 4], plo[3, 3], plo[6, 2], plo[8, 2]},     {plo[1, 5], plo[3, 4]},     {plo[1, 6], plo[3, 5]}}]]      Since some data files may not exist, I would like the plots to rotate so that there are no blank spaces in between the plots but all the `Null` plots get moved to the end of the grid. For example, if `plo[2, 1]`, `plo[7, 2]` are missing I would like them to take up the last two slots in my grid while the rest of the plots preserve their ordering.
