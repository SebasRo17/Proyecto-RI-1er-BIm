Using               f[s_] := Log[(s/r)^α ((α - 2) n0 r^α  + 2 π Pmax ρ r^2)                 /((α - 2) n0 s^α + 2 π Pmax ρ s^2)]/s      When I run the following line:               Assuming[ s > r && r > 1 && Pmax > n0 && n0 > 0 && ρ > 1 && α > 2,      Maximize[f[s],s]]      I get the following output:               Maximize[Log[((s/r)^α (n0 r^α (-2 + α) + 2 π Pmax r^2 ρ))                 /(n0 s^α (-2 + α) + 2 π Pmax s^2 ρ)]/s, s]      Actually, Mathematica ignores the assumptions and outputs the function only. That is, nothing is done by Mathematica. I know that `Assuming[.]` works with `Refine`, `Simplify`, and `Integrate`. But, is there any way to use `Maximize` with assumptions? What do you think about the given function? Is it analytically solvable at all? **EDIT:** Let `g[x]=n0 β + 2 π ρ Pmax x^(-β)`, where `β = α - 2`. We can rewrite `f[s]` as:               f[s_] := Log[g[r]/g[s]]/s      for `β>0`. Therefore, the optimal point is found by maximizing `Log[(g[r]/g[s])^(1/s)]` or equivalently maximizing `(g[r]/g[s])^(1/s)`. Mathematica cannot solve the latter optimization problem as well. Even with some more simplification, `r=1` and `n0=1`, which results in the following problem, it cannot be solved:               Maximize[{((β + 2 π Pmax ρ)/(β + 2 π Pmax s^-β ρ))^(1/s), β > 0, Pmax > 1, ρ > 1}, s]
