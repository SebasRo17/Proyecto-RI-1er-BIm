I want to create an undo history whenever the user updates a form. Because it's an update, I want to use a PUT request. However, I read that PUT needs to have no side effects. Is it acceptable to use PUT here? Are there better alternatives? `PUT /person/F02E395A235`               {        time: 1234567,        fields: {           name: 'John',           age: '41'        }     }      In the server               doGet('person/:personId',        // create a new person snapshot     )      Edit: The history will be visible to the user, calling multiple times would result in multiple versions. The solution was to check if the version was unique before creating it.
