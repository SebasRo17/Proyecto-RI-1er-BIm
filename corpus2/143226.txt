I'm presenting on Concurrency in ColdFusion at CFObjective this year, and I'd like to hear how you're using CFThread in your ColdFusion applications. In addition, what problems have you had while using it, and how (if at all) have you solved them? What do you dislike about CFThread? Have you run into significant weaknesses with CFThread or other problems where it simply could not do what you wanted to do? Finally, if there's anything you'd like to add related to concurrency in CF, not specifically related to CFThread, please do tell.
