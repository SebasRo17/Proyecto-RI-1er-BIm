I'm looking to learn C# mainly so i can get into XNA. I know the basics of programming and I've tooled around with GameMaker, which has it's own scripting language. I'm not really looking to jump into the industry and honestly I'm not sure I would ever want to program for a living. However, I'm having a hard time teaching myself with tutorials and I thought taking a class might be worthwhile. The school I'm looking to attend is a community college and they offer a certification course in C# and I might take it if I find it worth the price. My question is, **will it be worthwhile**? I know it depends largely on the school and the instructors but by taking a certification course will I learn any more than I would by just shelling out the same amount of money into some decent books?
