What suggestions would you give to find networking opportunities or to network at user groups and other developer venues? For instance, if you went to a code camp, would you try to network with other developers there? How would you go about doing it? Would you go up to someone you don't know at lunch and introduce yourself? I recently attended a user group meeting and found it somewhat boring. Only a few people really seemed to talk to others. Most attendees seemed to keep to themselves. Is this typical for developers? I've never been good at networking, probably somewhat introverted around people I don't know, so networking isn't my strong point. However, I would definitely like to branch out more and meet other developers.
