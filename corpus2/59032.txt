Having said that I'm no expert, I have some problems in generating a list of functions inside a loop. The functions in the list should depend on the elements of a _parameters_ list, that are read in sequence. The stripped down examples here below should show what I mean. First I tried this (rather naively)               parameters = {a, 3, 6, E, 2}; p = 1;     While[p <= 5, funclist[[p]][x_] := parameters[[p]] x^p; p++]      Naturally it doesn't work. After some other trials I arrived at this possible solution               parameters = {a, 3, 6, E, 2}; p = 1;     While[p <= 5, With[{p = p}, funclist[p, x_] := parameters[[p]] x^p]; p++]      But in this case the output is not actually a list but rather a sort of indexed function that cannot be manipulated as a list could be. What I'd like to get is a list of functions that, for example can be used in the following ways:               in: funclist     out: {a x, 3 x^2...}      and also               in: funclist[[2]][4]     out: 48      or also               Plot[funclist[[2]],{x,-1,5}]      Is it possible?
