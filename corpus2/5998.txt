I have restricted the context of my notebooks to each individual notebook. So variables in each notebook are local and are not seen in another notebook. But in two of my notebooks I have two functions that I want to plot simultaneously with the command `Show`. Please note that I want variables of each notebook to be local except for those two functions. So I need to define two global variables and then plot that two functions in `Show`. How can I define global variables in Mathematica?
