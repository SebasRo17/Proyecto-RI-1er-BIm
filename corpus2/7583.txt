I have bkwrd compatibility issues when I save my NDSolve result (which is an interpolating polynomia) using `DumpSave` from Mathematica 8 on Windows 7 and then try loading it using Mathematica 7 on Linux. Is there any way I could specify backward compatibility (and cross compatibility: files can be imported into different OS with or without the same version of mathematica) in `DumpSave`? I have read this and this but they don't address the same issue. Also, is there anyway the interpolating functions can be saved in a human readable format? Example code to work on, for convenience.
