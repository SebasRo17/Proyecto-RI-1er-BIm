I find that the encapsulation required by OO has me frequently passing paramenters down the line from parent to child to great grandchild to second grand nephew once removed (not actually that bad). But inevitably in the process, and especially if graphics are involved there will be garbling the by the third iteration of `someConstructor(int minX, int minY, int maxX, int maxY)`. I found at least one question here suggesting that parameter objects are the solution. These seem to me more like a kludge designed to satisfy a low parameter count fetish than genuinely useful. Besides, in these scenarios, I am generally cutting the numbers into smaller pieces (of screen) with each step. It occurs to me if these constructor calls are laid out line by line higher up the chain, I'd have easy comparisons. But this seems to lose all semblance of OOPiness. In my most recent adventure with find-the-transposed-measurements, I was drawing a music keyboard. I don't want the main view to know or care what or exactly where the G# key is. So, best practices? Please don't say, go slower, be less sloppy.
