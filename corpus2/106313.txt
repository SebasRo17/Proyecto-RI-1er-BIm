Sorry, I'd be happy to have someone improve the title of this question. What are the benefits and downsides of "positively formulated" logic vs. having it "english readable". I'm looking for a generic position that can be placed into code guidelines. Examples of what I see as "positively formulated" logic               if ($obj->isValid()){               if ($found){                    if ($first){         //do nothing     }else{         doX();     }          $this->useFields(array('a','b'));      Examples of what I see as "negatively formulated" logic               if (!$first)         doX();     }          $this->unset(array('d','e','f','g'));      Whereas if focusing on "English readable" I would see this as good:               if (isValid()){                         if ($found){      and this is not "English readable"               if ($l){                    if (isValid() || !isActive()){         doX();     }
