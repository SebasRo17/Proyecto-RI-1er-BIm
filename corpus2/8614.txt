This past semester I taught an introductory electromagnetism course and had quite a nice time using Mathematica to draw all sorts of figures and diagrams (mostly for problems and etc.). However, I was unable to create a nice environment for the basic circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, etc. A Resistor, for instance, was annoying to draw a single one by hand. But after that, ideally, I would have liked to have a function `Resistor[{p1,p2}]` which functions exactly like the `Line` function but gives a line with a resistor in it (labels are not necessary since they can easily be added latter with the `Text` function). This function could then be readily generalized to a function `CircuitElement[{p1,p2},element]` where "element" stands for any element one has previously drawn. I have had quite some difficulty with these kinds of functions, perhaps due to my lack of knowledge on computational geometry. I think this kind of functionality might be of interest to many people. So, any thoughts or tips on how to get started? * * * Additionally I would like to have output that is similar to the following: ![circuit diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KYB0K.png)
