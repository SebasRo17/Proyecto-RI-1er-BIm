The iPhone app i have an idea for deals with processing of the data stored as part of Oracle database at work. It'll be an interface to a dynamic set of data that is updated tens of thousands of time a day. Each time you look, results are likely to be different. That being said, the company i work for does not have an enterprise appstore, which (as i understand it) means that i would have to publish my app onto the regular appstore with some kind of access key. > Q1. Is this a common practice, given no company specific app store exists? I wonder if any of the cocoa API allows for east access and synchronization with Oracle databases. > Q2. If you know of one and can point me in the right direction, i'd be very > grateful. Is there anything else i should know when dealing with such a problem? Security is obviously a concern, the data will likely be of absolutely no interest to an outsider, but then again, we do want to be as prudent as we can be. Please let me know
