The application package I had working in Mathematica 8 no longer works in Mathematica 9. I believe the problem lies in how I cycle through cells and test for reaching the last cell of the notebook. In `MyTools\MySubTools1`, I previously used:               SelectionMove[nb, Next, Cell];       While[(*Keep moving cell by cell until the end of the notebook*)        MathLink`CallFrontEnd[FrontEnd`CellInformation[FrontEnd`NotebookSelection[nb]]]=!=$Failed,        (*Code*)         SelectionMove[nb, Next, Cell]}];      but have since changed the code to:               SelectionMove[nb, Next, Cell];       While[(*Keep moving cell by cell until the end of the notebook*)        Developer`CellInformation[nb] =!= $Failed,        (*Code*)         SelectionMove[nb, Next, Cell]}];      To my package I have added:               BeginPackage["MyTools`", {"Developer`", "MyTools`MySubTools1`", "MyTools`MySubTools2`"}]      The updated code now works as required when debugging in Eclipse but not when running in Mathematica. What is the best way to check whether I have reached the end of the notebook?
