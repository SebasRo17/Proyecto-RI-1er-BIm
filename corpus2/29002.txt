I'm currently working on a display project using `Manipulate` and was wondering if there is a straightforward way to alter the placement of the control options that I use. For example, the following shows my issue: ![control area](http://i.imgur.com/ewDGbDE.png) The `Manipulate` argument of concern is as follows:               Style["View Control", 16, Bold],     {{setter, True, ""}, {True -> "Zoom", False -> "Pan"}},     ControlPlacement -> Left,      I would just like the Zoom and Pan buttons of the SetterBar to be a bit larger and closer to centered if possible. I've messed with things like `Appearance` and `Alignment`, but haven't really had any luck with previous questions or my own efforts.
