I've the following problem I cannot solve. I allocate an empty matrix, v, of size n x m. Then I want to do a Parallel loop (ex. ParallelDo), and do some operations (described by a function operation[j,y] of two arguements) that as a result gives a numerical output. I want to "store" the i-th output in the i-th element of the list. If I use a Parallel loop with inside a For loop, there is no way to in fact store the output in the list, and at the end of the loop, v, is empty. If I do the same thing with a regular loop (ex. Do), then it works. Here I report a generic expample:               v = Table[{}, {j, 1, m}, {i, 1, n}];          ParallelDo[For[j = 1, j < n+1, j++, v[[j,i]] = operation[j,i]], {i, 1, m}]      But in this case, no matter of what the operation function is, V is still an empty matrix. If I use Do, instead of ParallelDo, then it works. All DistributeDefinitions and related stuff I think are taken care correctly. Thanks!
