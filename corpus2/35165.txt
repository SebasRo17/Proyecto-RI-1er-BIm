The following code:               ExportString[{"a" -> 2000000., "b" -> 0.000001}, "JSON"]      Gives the results               {"a" : 2.e60,      "b" : 1.e-6}      The first one is obviously having a wrong numerical value. Also, 1.e-6 is not parsable by python, but 1.0e-6 and 1e-6 works, so I guess it is not following the standard. The same problem also exists for `Export[]`. I need it to exchange data with other programs. What is the easiest way to fix this kind of problem?
