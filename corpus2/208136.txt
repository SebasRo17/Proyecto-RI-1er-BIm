I have a simple console application that will be deployed as a scheduled job. Below is its pseudo code               Main(string[] args)     {         //get xml string from database         Reports reports = ReportsDB.GetReport(args[0].ToString());              //Generate xml file using xmwriter              //post the file to sftp site     }      I was wondering how to include logging functionality for this job. Also, will it be suffice to use a text writer to write to text file every time it is run or use libraries such as log4net **Edit** I should be able to log the execution of the job like start time, debug info, etc. that will be for my self.
