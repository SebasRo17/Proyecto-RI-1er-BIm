I am attempting to solve a system of linear equations using `LinearSolve[]` . In my case, the number of unknowns are more than constraints. I learnt that LinearSolve does not give me all solutions. However, I am also unable to use `Solve[]` to get all possible solutions. Here is my example:               InpMatrix={     {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},     {15,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},     {90,48,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},     {270,216,144,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},     {405,432,432,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},     {243,324,432,0,0,16,0,0,0,0,0,0},     {16,0,0,0,0,0,256,0,0,0,0,0},     {0,0,0,-16,-16,-16,47104,1024,0,0,0,0}     };          synd={{0},{0},{0},{0},{0},{0},{256},{1024}};          In[217]:= sol = LinearSolve[InpMatrix, synd]          Out[217]= {{0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {1}, {-45}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {0}}      However, the solution I am looking for should be:               {{0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {1}, {-45}, {0}, {30}, {15}, {0}}      Hence I tried to use `Solve[]` in the following way:               Solve[InpMatrix.var == synd, var]      But it gives me an error saying:               Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Solve. >>           Solve[{     {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {15, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0},      {90, 48, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {270, 216, 144, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {405, 432, 432, 0, 16, 0, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {243, 324, 432, 0, 0, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 256, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},      {0, 0, 0, -16, -16, -16, 47104, 1024, 0, 0, 0, 0}     }.var == {{0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {0}, {256}, {1024}}, var]      Could anyone kindly help me with correctly using `Solve[]` or any other functionality that yields all posible solutions ? Preferably I would general solution, a symbolic form with free variables.
