I have the following code: Read all the DOW jones financial instruments `instruments = FinancialData["^DJI", "Members"]` Then I create a dynamic variable called ticker               Dynamic[ticker]          ticker =.      And I create a popup menu with               {PopupMenu[Dynamic[ticker], instruments], Dynamic[ticker]}      So far it all works. I have my list of stock instruments in variable instruments and the popup menu comes up and when I pick a stock from it, the ticker (displayed to the right of the menu) updates to show the ticker I chose from the drop down list My problem is that I would like to have a chart automatically updated once I pick a ticker. For now I have:               data = FinancialData[ticker, "OHLCV", {{2008, 7, 3}, {2008, 9, 30}}]      And I use               InteractiveTradingChart[data]      To display the chart This works if I hit Shift enter on the last line. However, if I go to the popup menu and select a different stock (say INTC for Intel) the chart is not updated. I am new to Mathematica and I am sure that my problem is not understanding how Dynamic works. What I don't understand               InteractiveTradingChart[data]
