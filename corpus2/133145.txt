I'm about to embark on a project that makes extensive use of a properly RESTful approach. That is, it uses HATEOAS and serves up resources in a manner that allows for general exploration by a client. I would like to ensure that I provide a description of my endpoints in a manner that would allow client applications to be automatically generated in a wide variety of languages. I understand that for SOAP based web services I can use WSDL and that apparently there is WSDL2 that provides greater definition of the HTTP verbs in use with REST. However I see many articles swinging back and forth over it's utility. So, should I use WADL to allow external code generators to quickly build a client for my web application or is there a better standard that is expected?
