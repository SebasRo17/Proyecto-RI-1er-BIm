When creating a table, there is an option for us to set the numeric primary key as autoincrement where it's value increases whenever a new data in inserted. This primary number can be used for setting the relationship of a table where it is assigned as a foreign key to that table. So my question is it a good practice for us to use the autoincrement numeric primary as foreign key or should we use the programmatically generated code. **e.g.** for a table 'products' we have the fields 'id' (autoincrement primary key), 'productCode' (program generated unique item code. field property also set to unique), 'Description'. and we are going to create a relationship to a transactions table. What field should be used as foreign key, the 'autoid' or the product code?
