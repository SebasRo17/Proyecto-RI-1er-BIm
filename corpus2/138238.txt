What would be the best approach at unit testing a model that integrates into an application that is tightly coupled to database? The specific scenario here is a shopping cart - I'd like to be able to test the adding removing and retrieving of items from the cart as well as pricing logic etc. This in my mind all requires database access though I have read several times that database access should be avoided.
