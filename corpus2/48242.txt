I have a question. I try to integrate this function:               Integrate[Exp[I k z]*Exp[-Sqrt[k^2 - A^2]x]*Exp[-k^2*L^2/4]/Sqrt[k^2 - A^2],          {k, -Infinity, -A}]      But Mathematica doesn't want to give an answer. It just prints me my integral. The same story I have when I try to calculate the residue of this function at the infinity point, for example. What's wrong? Thanks.
