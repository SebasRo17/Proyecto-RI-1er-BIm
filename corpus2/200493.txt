I used the Process Editor (from TFS Power Tools) to update the **Workflow diagram** of a particular Work Item Type (viz., the "Issue" type). There are a dozen other projects on our server that share the Issue type, and I would like to port my changes to all of them. But unfortunately, while the Process Editor allows you to export/import Work Item Types to/from the server, it only includes the`.xml` (definition) file, which doesn't include the workflow diagram. (The diagram is stored in the`.wit` and the`.wit.diagram` files, which do not get imported with the`.xml`). Is there any way to copy the diagram to all the projects? (Note: I eventually intend to make similar changes to several of the work item types, so an automated solution to propagate these changes across all the projects would be much appreciated!)
