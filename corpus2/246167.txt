I'm trying to understand why the output file sizes are significantly different when using a C and a C++ compiler. I was writing a small hello world program in C and C++, I noticed that in C version, the size of the executable was 93.7KB and in C++, the size of the same hello world program was 1.33MB. I am not sure why that is. I think it may be because C++ has more libraries and namespaces to use so I removed the `using namespace std` line and simply used `std::cout` and still the result was the same. **C**               #include <stdio.h>          int main()     {         printf("hello world");         return 0;     }      // size 93.7KB **C++**               #include <iostream>          int main()     {         std::cout<<"Hello world";         return 0;     }      // size 1.33MB There doesn't seem to be much difference in the code above. Is there some sort of compiler difference that creates the differing file sizes?
