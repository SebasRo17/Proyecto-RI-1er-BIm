I'm using _Mathematica_ to create some images and labeling them after a simple calculation done previously. As the name of the file depends on the result, I want to show it with no decimal separator (because the "." can be a program as I'll use these images later on LabView). I'm using the following code: `ang = NumberForm[N[frac], {5, 2}]` where the result has 5 precise digits and 2 digits to the right of the decimal. Then, I'm doing `angle = ang*100`, but I still get the decimal marker but no number after it. How can I get rid of this?
