My first programming language in school was C. Then I learnt C++ and Java and got stuck with Java for 2 yrs. I was so addicted to java and OOP at first. I started making Java applications and became fully thorough in OOP. Now I would like to learn different languages. My mind is full of C style syntax. Sometimes in my dreams, I see camelCase words and paranthesis and braces and dots. Even JavaScript uses C like syntax. I want to get adapt to different languages so that I won't find difficulty when I get a job that requires me to program in different syntax and different paradigm.. I do not know what functional, logical, hybrid paradigms mean. So I am asking here. Suggest me a different language (and some good book on it if possible) to learn..
