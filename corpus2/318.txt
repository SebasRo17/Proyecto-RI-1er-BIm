What I want to do is to draw graphics part by part, because I made a function that generates coordinates according to which I will draw graphics. The problem is that MMA does not operate as I expected. To figure out what I'm doing here's simplified example:               Graphics[{       a = 1;       Label[tag];       If[a < 3,        {Circle[{a, 1}, 1],         a = a + 1;         Goto[tag];},        {Text["It's finished", {0, 0}]}]       }]      And what I get as output is simply text "It's finished". But what I want as output is graphics with two circles with radii 1 and centers positioned at {1,1} and {2,1} together with text "It's finished". I figure out the way MMA thinks, and why it gives me this as output. But how can I accomplish my desired output? **Edit:** Here's the code, It's really messy and tips on how to neatly write code in MMA would be appreciated.                  Manipulate[              Graphics[{              (*calculating incident angle*)         α = ArcSin[H/R];         (*calculating x-coordinate where incident ray leaves prism*)         p = Sqrt[R^2 - H^2];         (*Drawing incident ray*)         {Red, Thick, Line[{{-2, H}, {p, H}}]},              (*Drawing prism*)         {Blue, Opacity[.5], Disk[{0, 0}, R, {0, Pi/2}]},              (*checking whether it's reflection or refraction*)         If[H < R/n,                 {(*refraction*)                 (*calculating x-coordinate where refracted ray hits surface*)                 l = (R^2 n)/(Sqrt[R^2 - H^2] n - Sqrt[R^2 - H^2 n^2]);                 (*Drawing refracted ray*)                 {Red, Thick, Line[{{p, H}, {l, 0}}]}                 },              {(*internal reflection*)                     (*calculating x-coordinate where after internal reflection ray hits \     surface*)                     new = H;                     k = 1;                 Label[tag];                 s = R Cos[α] - new/Tan[2 α];                     If[s <= R,                     {                     {Red, Thick, Line[{{p, new}, {s, 0}}]}                     },                            {                     θ = (2 k + 1) α - k Pi;                     f = R Cos[θ];                     h = R Sin[θ];                     k = k + 1;                     Line[{{{p, new}, {f, h}}}],                     new = h;                     p = f;                     Goto[tag];                     }                     ]                 }             ]                 }],              {{H, 3, "Height"}, 0.0001, R - 0.0001, Appearance -> "Labeled"},         {{n, 1.5, "Refraction"}, 1.001, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"},         {{R, 10, "Radius"}, 0, 10, Appearance -> "Labeled"}                 ]
