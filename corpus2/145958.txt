If I am about to develop an Enterprise application, but as far as I understand from agile process, I break features into small chunks and develop them iteratively. I used to create the database and the core of the application first, then I extend these iteratively. The question is: Do I have to keep what I used to do previously (develop the core first) or I have to distribute core development over stories' development? In the later, I am not sure the code will be flexible enough for future extensions! Any idea?
