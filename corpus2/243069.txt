I am using a proper binary tree to simulate a tournament bracket. It's preferred any competitors in the bracket that are teammates don't meet each other until the later rounds. What is an efficient method in which I can ensure that teammates in the bracket have as much distance as possible from each other? Are there any other data structures besides a tree that would be better for this purpose? EDIT: There can be more than 2 teams represented in a bracket and there is no requirement to have an equal number of people from each team in a bracket. I intend to use this for individual sports where a person still has an affiliation with a team and we want to delay teammates facing each other until as late as possible.
