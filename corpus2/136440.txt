I'm wondering if I wanted to implement a web service based on java that does web analytics, what sort of architecture should I use. The actualy processing of the Big Data would be done by Hadoop. However I am not sure what I would need to do to make it asynchronous, or is Hadoop already asynchronous by nature? Could I do something with JMS? If so, how would that fit into the whole thing? Would it be something along the lines that upon receiving the web service request, I use JMS to send a message to Hadoop to handle a particular data, and then wait for it to come back to me? I am not too familiar with asynchronous java so I'm not sure where to start.
