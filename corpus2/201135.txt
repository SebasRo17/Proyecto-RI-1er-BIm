As a side project I wrote a simple macro in SAS to add syntatic sugar to SAS code. I hate how verbose SAS is sometimes! So my macro looks like this               %macro md(code);         /* expects a superquoted string */        * append a b;        %if %lowcase(%scan(&code.,1)) = append %then %do;             proc append base = %scan(&code.,2) data=%scan(&code.,3); run;         %end;     %mend;      Instead of writing               proc append base=a data=b; run;      to append two datasets, I can simply write               %md( append a b);      This got me thinking. Since I work with SAS all day and I enjoy programming. Why not (for fun) design a new data processing language that compiles to SAS?! As many of you can guess this idea was inspired by CoffeeScript which compiles to Javascript. I learnt that CoffeeScript was initially written in Ruby? But why? How did the author choose Ruby? What are the things to consider in choosing a language? And what resources are available that might be useful in pursuing this?
