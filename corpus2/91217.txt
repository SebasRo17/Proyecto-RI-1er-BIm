So, I have this idea for a huge game that would take years to develop if I did it on my own (with help from friends) I've learned a lot about game programming, but nowhere near enough to start coding the thing itself. It would still take at least two years if I started a business and hired programmers How much will open-sourcing it speed up the project? Should I open-source it, given that I have no code to show for my learning in this kind of programming? Can an open-source project be directed to keep the original idea alive, or will it often veer away from the creator's original idea? Can an open-source project receive any kind of reliable funding (can we have investors, for example)? Should I make a business and hire programmers to get it moving, and then open- source it? If that ends up being the case, I'd like to send the full specification to anyone who wants to see it.
