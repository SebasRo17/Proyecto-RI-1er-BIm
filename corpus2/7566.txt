I am interested in knowing if it is possible to recover intermediate results from a `Table` after an interruption. Let us say I want to produce a really useful table               tt = Table[Pause[0.1*i]; i, {i, 50}]      and since _Mathematica_ takes too long to evaluate it, I get impatient. Is it possible to interrupt the calculation and recover what it has already calculated? I am guessing the answer is no, but would like to be proven wrong.
