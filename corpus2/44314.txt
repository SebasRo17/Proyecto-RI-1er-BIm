![explanation of Correlate](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S1Ijv.png) I am a beginner in using Mathematica, know little about optics. However, I would like to know how to understand the function `ImageCorrelate`, since the introduction in Mathematica Book is too brief and not quite informative. I've read a solution here, How can I extract data points from a black and white image? But can not understand this ![code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G1PMe.png)
