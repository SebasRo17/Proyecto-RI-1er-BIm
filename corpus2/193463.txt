I've heard the term pop all around. I've read various articles regarding the subject and heard two main definitions to the term "Service Location":   1. A glorified Registry - Bad practice, global variables, general evil.   2. A type of Dependency Injection Container - Can help with managing dependencies, making modular and extensible applications, generally helpful. But I can't differentiate between the two. What does a Service Location really means? Can you give a simple example of a Service Locator? Is it good or evil?
