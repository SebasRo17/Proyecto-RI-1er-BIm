I have plenty of experience with both Ruby and Python, and I'm looking to embed either one of these on a C# application I'm developing. I don't really care which, but I'd like to know which one currently has better support and is overall less buggy, and is the easiest to implement and deploy. I also took a good look at Boo, which I'm also messing around with. C# Is too complicated and verbose, so I'm leaving that as the last option. As for what I'm doing, I need to extend some classes in a friendly and dynamic way, without the need to recompile. They will also need to have access to a data structure created on the C# side of the code. So, any recommendations on which should I use?
