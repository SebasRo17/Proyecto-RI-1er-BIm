I have written a set of functions in a .m file in Mathematica 9.0 using Workbench 2.0. When I right-click the .nb and click Debug as Mathematica, The .m file loads and successfully initializes. Messages from the console are below.               Start Debug Session     Connected     Loading      EKSPredictiveModel.m     Initialization Complete      I set a breakpoint at the top of my function and execute the function from the nb. When I press Shift Enter, the output line in the notebook simply repeats the function name. No breakpoints are hit - no additional information or errors are shown. Is there a way to diagnose this?
