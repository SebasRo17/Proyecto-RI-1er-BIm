I have been working in development for a good company for a while now since graduating from university, I really enjoy it and have some great fun in the office and enjoy everything I am doing. But recently I have lost that old buzz, I cant bring myself to code outside of work, a while back I could be outside of work and come up with a nice idea and go away and develop that idea, but I feel that buzz has gone, I still love developing and technology but I just cant find the energy to do it when I am not at work. Has anyone else gone through a phase like this? What did you do to combat it and get that energy and buzz back? Maybe I need a new tehcnology, or a holiday!
