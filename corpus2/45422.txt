I have the following code with the intention to have a 3D plot:               f0[y_] :=1/(E^((1 + y)^2/2)*Sqrt[2*Pi])     f1[y_] :=1/(E^((-1 + y)^2/2)*Sqrt[2*Pi])          l[y_] :=f1[y]/f0[y]          t[x_] :=NIntegrate[f1[y]^x*f0[y]^(1 - x), {y, -Infinity, Infinity}]          epsilon0[x_] :=-Log[t[x]] + (x*NIntegrate[l[y]^x*f0[y]*Log[l[y]], {y, -Infinity, Infinity}])/t[x]          epsilon1[x_] :=-Log[t[x]] + ((-1 + x)*NIntegrate[l[y]^x*f0[y]*Log[l[y]], {y, -Infinity, Infinity}])/t[x]          Plot[epsilon0[x], {x, 0, 1}]     Plot[epsilon1[x], {x, 0, 1}]      I have the following figures ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GWL05.jpg)! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q3CnX.jpg)! **Good:** > However I want to have a single graph probably a 3D plot for epsilon0, > epsilon1 and $x$ For example when $x=0.2$ we have $\epsilon_0=0.08$ and $\epsilon_1=1.28$ if I change $x\in[0,1]$ I will get a pair $(\epsilon_0,\epsilon_1)$ for each $x$ and this should be representable in 3D at least as points. But I couldt do it. **Ugly:** > What is the 3D figure if we allow **any** pair of continuous densities $f_0$ > and $f_1$ on $\mathbb{R}$ which have $D(f_0,f_1)=2$ and $D(f_1,f_0)=2$ where > $D$ is the relative entropy or KL divergence?
