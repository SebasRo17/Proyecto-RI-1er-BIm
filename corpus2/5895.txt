When exporting a dashed plot with a color gradient to a vector graphics format such as EPS or PDF, the dashing is partly ruined. For example, this command:               Plot[x^2, {x, -2, 2}, PlotStyle -> Directive[Dashed, Thick], ColorFunction -> Hue]      Creates the following plot: ![A dashed plot with a color gradient exported to png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/c1NnJm.png) However, when exporting the plot to EPS or PDF, I get this plot (notice the ruined dashing, especially near the vertex of the parabola): ![A dashed plot with a color gradient exported to eps](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zxy9Dm.png)   * **~~Am I doing something wrong, or is this a bug?~~**   * **~~If~~ it is a bug, is there a workaround?** I am using Mathematica version 8.0.4.0 ( _edit:_ on Win7 64bit) **Edit:** I got an email from wolfram support, which I understand confirms this is a bug. Until they fix it, any workarounds which properly export the plot as _vector graphics_ are welcome.
