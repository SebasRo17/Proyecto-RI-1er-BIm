Many of us coders, programmers and developers struggle with repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel, etc. I've been curious about introducing voice control into my workflow in order to save myself some stress. This has led me to my current question: Would it be possible or practical to implement a programming language (or superset of an existing language) which was primarily phonetic, and hence well suited to programming by voice?
