Obviously users like to see text properly pluralized, and pluralization schemes vary in the various written languages one may encounter. When internationalizing an app, what pattern(s) are useful for handling messages with possible pluralization? What about messages with multiple possible pluralization? For example: "N review(s):" One pattern would be               reviews.title.singular="{0} review:"     reviews.title.plural="{0} reviews:"      And this may not support all languages. Or a more complicated case: "Found M question(s) with N comment(s)." This would be difficult to support even in English.
