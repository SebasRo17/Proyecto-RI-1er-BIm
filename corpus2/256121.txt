As an ISV, what is considered best practice for implementing Application Role based security? In other words, only allow users to access certain features in the application based on what Roles they belong to. We currently just use a table in our database to store this, but it has been suggested that for max HIPAA compliance, this isn't secure enough. My first thought was to just use Active Directory Groups, as it would seem that is what they are designed for, however, it just doesn't seem practical to rely on our clients IT departments to create Groups and assign users to them for groups that are specific only to our application. This can't be best practice for ISVs ... At this point it my research, it seems that possibly the best solution might be to use something like Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) (Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services) and possibly AzMan (Windows Authorization Manager)? Again, this is for a Windows Forms Application, not a Web application or in an "In House" solution. If it matters, we are also in the process of transitioning our home baked authentication to instead use active directory for authentication. Also of note is this needs to be secure (HIPAA Compliant). All the information i can find on this subjects seems to be for developing applications for in house use, or for web applications, and neither of these approaches feels appropriate for a winform application. (We are using .net for development.) help! :)
