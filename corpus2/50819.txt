I am making a RGB color function which assigns an RGB color to each point in the plane. To check if it does what I think it should do (i.e. debugging it), it is helpful to be able to plot the function to see how the problematic areas are arising. How can I plot this function? i.e. is there something along the lines of               Plot[RGB[f[x,y],g[x,y],h[x,y]],{x,0,10},{y,0,10}]
