It used to be quite straightforward to change the default settings of a notebook in terms of inputs, outputs, text styles and font sizes in previous versions of _Mathematica_ using initialization cells with commands such as `$TextStyle` and `$FormatType`. However, as of _Mathematica_ version 6, functions have been superseded by `BaseStyle`. May I know how to use this new function to accomplish the same?
