Given a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin and $n$ spheres with radii $r_i$ centered at predefined coordinates, $c_i$, in space, I am after the surface area of the unit sphere that is not intersected by any of the surrounding spheres. E.g. given the coordinates               c = {{{1.2,0,0},1}, {{0,-1.7,0},1.2}, {{0.7,1,0},0.9}, {{-0.5,-0.5,-0.5},1}}      I am interested in the (potentially) visible blue surface area in the graphic generated by:               {Blue, Sphere[{0,0,0},1], Red, Sphere[#,#2]&@@@c} // Graphics3D      In principle, I can obtain this area by evaluating the following integral               fun = Function[{t,p},          Evaluate[ Times @@               (UnitStep[Total[({Sin[t]*Cos[p],Sin[t]*Sin[p],Cos[t]}-#)^2]-#2^2]& @@@ c)         ]     ]     NIntegrate[Evaluate[fun[t,p]*Sin[t]], {t,0,Pi}, {p,0,2Pi}] // AbsoluteTiming      However, this approach is slow (in particular for a large numbers of spheres), and has convergence issues. In an attempt to speed up the integral evaluation, I have devised the following code snippet, which is based on a naive (non-adaptive) application of the trapezoidal rule:               n = 1000;     theta = N@Pi/(n-1)*Range[0,n-1];     phi = 2*N@Pi/(2*n-1)*Range[0,2*n-1];     int1 = ConstantArray[1.,n];     int1[[{1,-1}]] = 0.5;     int2 = ConstantArray[1.,2*n];     int2[[{1,-1}]]=0.5;     (* Calculating ptsT is slow. However, it could be pre-calculated once ... *)     ptsT=Transpose[Outer[{Sin[#]*Cos[#2],Sin[#]*Sin[#2],Cos[#]}&, theta, phi], {3,2,1}];          (       lv = Transpose @         Fold[#1*UnitStep[Total[(ptsT - #2[[1]])^2] - #2[[2]]^2] &,              ConstantArray[1., {2 n, n}], c];       int1.((lv.int2)*Sin[theta]) *Pi/(n - 1) * 2*Pi/(2 n - 1)     ) // AbsoluteTiming      How can this calculation be sped up? I am also interested in increasing the number of surrounding spheres to approximately 50. The following code snippet will generate $n$ spheres, which might be useful in comparing the performance of different approaches:               coords[n_] := Transpose@{        1.1 * Table[           With[{y = (2*i + 1)/n - 1, phi = i*(Pi*(3 - Sqrt[5]))},                {Cos[phi]*#, y, Sin[phi]*#} &[Sqrt[1 - y*y]]           ],            {i, 0, n - 1}],        ConstantArray[0.3, n]}
