I'll hold a little presentation about C-Pointers in a small group of people with beginners programming skills, with no CS background. Just people who would like to learn something about coding and prefer a practical hands-on approach. In fact, they are using the C-Language to do so. We are about to introduce pointers and I am very careful about the scope for the first introduction, since pointers can be quite overwhelming and confusing for the uninitiated. So I am wondering, how would you approach this topic to make it fun and interesting? Do you have great examples that really help people to understand the concept of pointers? Hint: The audience doesn't know about strings and arrays yet. Scope-wise, here is what I've got so far:   * Example: A problem that shows the limitation C without pointers and why we need something more elaborate.     * Call by reference vs Call by value example?   * Very short introduction what a pointer is and how it is denoted in C. (* and & operators )   * The difficult part: How does a pointer work? Or: How to explain a technical problem to non-technical people?     * Looking for a real work example for a referencing system. Is a library a good example?     * What is memory and how does it interact with our code and variables?     * How does a variable look like in memory? (memory allocation)     * How is this variable accessed? (address referencing)     * How can I use a pointer to access memory?   * In dire hope, people can follow this train of thought:      * Live example and practice Things I would like to omit for a part2:   * Null-Pointer   * Pointer on Pointers   * Pointer arithmetic   * Adresses vs. Pointers   * Structs   * Arrays
