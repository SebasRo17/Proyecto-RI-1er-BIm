I'm developing an ASP.NET MVC Web Api with C#. I have the following two resources. Group:               public class Group     {         public int GroupId { get; set; }         public string GroupName { get; set; }              public User Owner { get; set; }              public List<User> Members { get; set; }              public List<Message> Messages { get; set; }     }      Message:               public class Message     {         public int MessageId { get; set; }         public string Body { get; set; }         public DateTime DateSent { get; set; }         public Group ToGroup { get; set; }              public User Sender { get; set; }         public User Recipient { get; set; }              public List<Link> Links { get; set; }     }      And I also have these two URIs. This one to expose `Message` resource:               "api/messages/{id}"      And this one to expose Group's Messages:               "api/groups/{groupId}/messages/{messageId}"      I use the second one to access directly to a group's message (I don't know if it is a good design). Now, I'm thinking which URI do I have to use to add a new message for a group. I think that I have to use the second URI to get a group's messages. And the first URI to add new messages. What do you think?
