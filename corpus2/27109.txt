I've programmed drawing tools for graph images and am experiencing a problem with the coordinates of **an Ellipse on a graph with a Log Y axis**. It's quite easy to work out the Y Axis coordinates for other primitive objects such as Line, Rectangle & etc:               y1 = ((viewHeight - stPoint.Y + topMargin) / (viewHeight) * (maxY - minY) + minY);     y2 = ((viewHeight - endPoint.Y + topMargin) / (viewHeight) * (maxY - minY) + minY);          if (isLogYAxis)     {        y1 = Math.Exp(y1);        y2 = Math.Exp(y2);     }      Here is an example showing the Epilog generated for a Circle and a Rectangle I've drawn: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fE0ec.png)               Epilog -> {{RGBColor[1,0.2196,1], Circle[{AbsoluteTime@{1991,03,09} + ((AbsoluteTime@{1996,04,28} - AbsoluteTime@{1991,03,09}) / 2),Log@40},         {(AbsoluteTime@{1996,04,28} - AbsoluteTime@{1991,03,09}) / 2,Log@60}]},          {EdgeForm[Directive[Thick, RGBColor[0.6157,0.6,0.7922]]], Transparent, Rectangle[{AbsoluteTime@{1986,03,26},Log@60},{AbsoluteTime@{1990,12,15},Log@40}]}}      When I execute this command the Ellipse's Y axis is out of proportion, see: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rLAtz.png) I want to be able to plug in Log@40 and Log@60 for both the Rectangle and Circle and get the same results. I've made a basic example to demonstrate this.               LogPlot[x^x, {x, 1, 5},       Epilog -> {{RGBColor[0, 0, 0],          Circle[{2, Log@46.20}, {1, Log@50.9972}]}}]      Seeing the radius from the ellipse's centre to its top (2000) will be a different size from its centre to its bottom (approx 50), is it even possible to draw a Ellipse on a LogY Graph as I've described? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VoxpV.png) **Edit:** @Artes thank you for pointing me in the right direction, I've tried all sorts of things using this formula `Plot[Exp[y /. Solve[x^2 + y^2 == 1, y]], {x, -1, 1}]` without luck. In the last screenshot I've put red squares around the `Log@46.20` and `Log@50.9972` **does anybody know what formula's I would have to change these too in order to get a circle with Log Height of about 5?** _If it makes any difference I have the MinY and MaxY Log scale:_ _MinY = 3.6888794541139363_   _MaxY = 4.941642422609304_
