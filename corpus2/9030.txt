I am trying to put nice LaTeX labels on my Mathematica plots. I can do this manually, or by introducing an extra GNUPlot step into my workflow, but it would streamline the process considerably if everything could be done within Mathematica--yielding a publication ready figure, ideally one that is resolution independent. My solution so far has been to put a call to sciencesoft's LaTeX CGI routine as follows:               Import["http://sciencesoft.at/image/latexurl/?dev=png&template=math&src=\gamma_2"]      which yields a nicely typeset gamma like so: $$\gamma_2.$$ However, this produces a png and my preference would be to use a PDF version that is resolution independent so that I don't have to fiddle with getting the resolution on the PNG correct to match my output. Entering the URL http://sciencesoft.at/image/latexurl/?dev=pdfwrite&template=math&src=\gamma_2 into my browser produces the kind of PDF that I am looking for and I can view said PDF in Acrobat and check that it has the fonts embedded. However, when I try to import this into Mathematica with               Import["http://sciencesoft.at/image/latexurl/?dev=pdfwrite&template=math&src=\gamma_2"][[1]]      I get something that looks like this (sorry for the ASCII rendition: as a new user I can't post images)               #         #     #         #     #         #  ##     #         #   #     #         #   #     #         #   #     ###########   #                   #                   #      which appears to be the product of some kind of missing font problem. Does anyone know if/how I can get the PDF properly imported into Mathematica?
