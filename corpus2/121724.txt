I'm looking to add push notifications to one of my iOS apps. The app is a client for a website which doesn't offer push notifications. What I've come up with so far:   * App sends a message to home server when transitioning to background, asking the server to start polling the website for the logged in user.    * The home server starts a new process to poll for that user. Polling happens every so many seconds / minutes.   * When the user returns to the iOS app, the app sends a message to the home server to stop polling.   * The home server kills the process polling for the user.   * Repeat. The problem is that this soon becomes stupid: 100s of users means 100s of different processes. It's just not scalable in the slighest. What I've written so far is in PHP, using CURL to do the polling and I started with PHP a few days ago, so maybe I'm missing something obvious that could help me with this. Some advice would be great.
