I have a problem in evaluating a sum using values from data I input. Suppose I have `data = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}` If I want to evaluate the sum of my data (1+3+5+6+8), I can use the following command:               Sum[x, {x, data}]      And it will give me 23, which is correct. However, I found difficulty if I want to evaluate the sum of Log of each value, such that I have: Log(1) + Log(3) + Log(5) + Log(6) + Log(8). This can be done manually if I type the function one by one, but then it is not efficient if I have 100 values to be calculated. Can anyone help me in solving this problem?
