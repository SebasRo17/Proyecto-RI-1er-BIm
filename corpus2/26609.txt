How do you go about teaching Delegates to new programmers? Any examples outside the programming concept that you would use to teach them? For instance, with inheritance, you teach it as follows. Cat is an Animal. Dog is an Animal too. So, we can put the common features that all Animals have in the Animal group (read as class) and then put the specific features that Cats have in the Cat group (read as class). In a similar way (or a different way), how would you teach Delegates?
