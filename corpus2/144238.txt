I want to save the configuration of my project which includes   1. Screen size   2. Screen position   3. Folder paths   4. Users settings and so on. The standard places where you can save these are configuration values are:   1. Registry   2. INI files   3. Personal files (like *.cfg) How do you choose between these places? Also, are there any **pros and cons** of using any of them?
