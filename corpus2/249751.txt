This is a doubt I had for a really long time. I'm currently learning the basics of AI, mostly from Peter Norvig's book. I already know that you can use several AI techniques in Data Mining and Business Intelligence, but I wonder if there aren't more "normal" scenarios where you can apply AI. Could a scenario where an application can be improved by using AI? Books really don't specify more than a few select business cases. Thanks in advance **EDIT** Based on comments i'll be more specific. How can an application be improved by usig AI thechniques? And I don't mean adding search capabilities (when there are tools for that already) or BI stuff (I already know that to be AI based). What I want to know, is if it is possible to take a regular application (take a shipment scheduling application) and apply some AI techniques to improve its results, or to make recommendations to the user.
