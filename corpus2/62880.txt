I currently work for a large-ish manufacturing company that has a variety of pay grade levels. I've put some serious time and effort into my work over the past 4 years and I've managed to make a significant enough impact that they moved me into a new branch of the company to start an in-house software development branch dedicated to serving our international interests. This has implied a ton of traveling and working at night due to time zone differences. While this is a great opportunity and sounds impressive to my friends/family, I'm still working at the lowest possible pay grade level. I assumed with all the additional job responsibilities that I'd also receive some kind of promotion. Is this common? Do I need to speak up in order to get a promotion? Do I even deserve one? Should I just wait it out? I'm lost...
