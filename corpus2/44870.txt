I am gathering questions and responses in math, science, and technology for a "Family Feud" style game for high school students. I am having trouble finding and thinking of questions, especially in the technology realm. Technology (programming or general tech) questions are preferred. If you have never seen the game show, "Family Feud" involves two teams trying to guess the most popular responses to questions asked to a group of 100 respondents. The team must guess all the popular responses to get the points for the question. For example, if the question is, "What are the major tags in HTML 4.0?", the responses might be:   1. P (64 votes)   2. DIV (16 votes)   3. TABLE (8 votes)   4. BLINK (4 votes)
