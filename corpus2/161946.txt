For an upcoming XCode iOS project I'm planning on writing my views and view controllers in Objective-C. My model will be provided to me in C++. I am aware of 2 ways of using C++ in an objective-c project. They are described below. What are the pros and cons of each method. Is there any other recommended way, and what are its pros and cons? -In C++ header files, use extern "C" declaration as described in Wikipedia. -Wrapping C++ with an Objective-C++ as described by Rob Napier.
