I have this piecewise continuous function which is also continuously differentiable over time :               psi[t_] := Piecewise[{{(1 + t)^3 (-3 t^2 + t), -1 <= t <= 0},                           {(1 - t)^3 (3 t^2 + t), 0 <= t <= 1}}];      Now, for starters, when I `Plot` it, a discontinuity appears. This can easily be solved with a simple `Exclusions -> None` option in the `Plot`command. But then, when I calculate its first derivative over time using `D`, I obtain the following:               D[psi[t], t]      ![Mathematica session](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j239i.png) And then when I try to plot it : ![plot of the function](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SozG2.png)   * Is there something wrong with my original `psi[t_]`function? (Is it not continuous for _Mathematica_?)   * Why are the limits of definition of the first derivative modified?   * Why is the first derivative discontinuous? Now, the _easy_ solution would be to construct the first derivative using the results proposed by the `D` function and re-defining the definition domain... But I really want to understand this issue (if there is one).
