I'm trying to learn node.js and create a web application, and although I'm doing my best to just use only node.js to create it, I'm having a very difficult time finding resources and examples that describe the process without using other frameworks or libraries. Specifically, how can I serve HTML and CSS content without using hard-coded string variables, but serving up HTML and CSS files dynamically using just node.js?
