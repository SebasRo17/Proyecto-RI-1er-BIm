As my profile will tell you, I am in my second year of a 4-year Software Engineering program. (Long post, skip to the end for the short version) * * * First, a little background. I started coding in C++ about 5 years ago. Ever since then, I was sure that I wanted a life in code :) In my last 2 semesters, I wrote quite a bit of code which included about 30-40 algorithmic problems along with some basic AI code each semester, all of this other than my coursework which also was somewhat code intensive. For the past 2-3 months though, I have not written any code. I have been reading others' code, reading about code, finding bugs in code, exploring libraries, going through documentation, exploring different languages and spending considerable time on SO, but i have _not written any code_. Either due to a lack of motivation or gasp, _interest_ , I am not sure. Now, I am feeling even worse, as none of this is stuff that I can write on a CV (internship season is round the corner in my college, which is critical for getting a job next year). Plus, I also think I havent developed my skills as much as i should have in the past few years. * * *   * So, essentially, is reading about code rather than coding actually helping me develop ?    * Is there any way it can help me in my current short-term career prospects ?
