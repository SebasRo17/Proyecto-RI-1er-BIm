I have an android app idea, I want to make the app along with a few batch- mates in my collage. (1) How do I make sure that these guys will not compromise the intellectual properties involved? In the sense that they will not leak out confidential information, new theories, new ideas, new features descriptions either freely on any medium or to some other company developing similar software. Also, these people will most likely have access to the entire source code (with comments) of the project, how do I make sure that in the future they will co- operate with me, (2) will not release any part of the code, (3) Will not freely release alpha versions containing features meant only for premium users. Also, (4) is there way to effectively work without granting them access to the entire source code? I am open to all kinds of answers: trust, technical, managerial - leadership, good friendship - relationship with collegues. UPDATE: We all live in India.
