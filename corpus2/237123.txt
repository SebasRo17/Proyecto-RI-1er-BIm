I'm in senior year in high school. I enjoy programming (Java) very much and aspire to do it as a career in the future. However this isn't the topic of this question. My question is: how can I start making **consistent progress towards the goal** of becoming a great programmer? What I mean is this: I work on my own projects, enjoy doing so and feel like I'm slightly improving with every project I finish. However, I don't feel like I'm consistently moving towards 'the goal of becoming a great programmer'. I want to have a sense of 'working towards the goal'. What I feel right now is more like "I'm coding stuff which is a lot of fun and I'm improving, but I don't feel like I'm **'making progress towards my goal'** ". "Slightly improving over time because I'm coding stuff" doesn't really feel like "making progress towards a goal". To those of you who are experienced developers: **what advice can you give me on making consistent progress towards the goal of becoming great at programming,** as opposed to just coding stuff for fun?
