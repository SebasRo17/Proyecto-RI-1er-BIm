I need to replace `Do` loops by something else because it takes forever with big programs. I have been hinted towards `Inner`, but even though I tried, I did not manage to get what I need. Here's a toy example of my actual problem: Input:               u = {{u1a, u1b}, {u2a, u2b}, {u3a, u3b}, {u4a, u4b}};     v = {{v1a, v1b}, {v2a, v2b}, {v3a, v3b}, {v4a, v4b}};     f = {f1, f2, f3, f4};      The output I am looking for:               d = {{u1a*v1a*f1 + u2a*v2a*f2 + u3a*v3a*f3 +u4a*v4a*f4},         {u1b*v1b*f1 + u2b*v2b*f2 + u3b*v3b*f3 + u4b*v4b*f4}}      It is important not to have any loop constructs; only `Inner`, `Table`, etc. which are generally faster than loops
