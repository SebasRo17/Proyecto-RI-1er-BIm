I know that there should be a kind of standard for developing software but in the organization where I work for (30,000+ employees), we have a very strict framework for Java development. In my opinion such a framework is prehistoric as we are therefor running at least 10 years behind (Standard is Java 1.5 but with support 'til java 1.2). Further the framework slows down performance, user satisfaction drops and I'm writing more boilerplate code than is good for my health :-). Any suggestions on the advantages of such a framework? What are good practices for such a framework for not running behind the facts?
