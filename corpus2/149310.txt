I have a list of temperature levels (0 - 30 degrees) in different parts of a city. I would like to visualize the different temperature levels in the different parts of the city. Hot places should be displayed in red and cold ones blue. If the user zoom out he will get the avarage temperature color of the city and if zoomed in he will get the average color of the temperate color of that place. I think that what I need is referred to as _heatmaps_. Is that the correct? I am not too expert in visualization techniques and would appreciate explanatory pseudocode to illustrate the internal workings and main building blocks for heatmap algorithms, and how I could handle the zooming.
