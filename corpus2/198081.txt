I was looking for an answer to the question of what a DAO should return when a search ends up to be for an entity that does not exist. There are some generic previous questions related to returning null, but I am looking for an answer specifically in the context of the DAO retrieve scenario.       To be clear, when I say _Null Object_ I am referring to the Null Object pattern. In the Java space, Josh Bloch recommends an empty collection solution in the book _Effective Java_ (See Item 43) which provides an very good introduction to the problem/solution.    Despite being aware of Bloch's advice when I first wrote this question I considered returning null appropriate in a read/retrieval scenario. I'm in good company making a mistake with nulls.
