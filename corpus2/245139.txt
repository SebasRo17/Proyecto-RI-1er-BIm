In our group we usually don't ponder too much about what kind of design or implementation decisions caused a bug, we just fix it. Of course if some module constantly produces bugs people start to notice it, and sometimes this leads to major refactoring. But we don't have a process where bugs are routinely analyzed for their root causes. My question is whether a formal process of bug root cause analysis is common in software development, and if not why not.
