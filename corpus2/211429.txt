Recently my team has programmed a custom developer console in a video game which can easily be hidden or displayed, because it's more comfortable and less of a hassle. The Console class contains a log(string) function which should be easily accessible from anywhere outside of it, without having to reference it everywhere. How could we design a method that can be easily accessed from the outside of the class? For example printing a message to the console in C++ is as simple as:               cout << "Message";      Well we want something similar at best, maybe Console::log(), but we are clueless how to achieve a _proper_ way of doing it. Cheers.
