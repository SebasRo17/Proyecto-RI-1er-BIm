In the ideas shared in my answer to this post Struct equivalent in Mathematica? at the end I propose a solution that changes the way Set works in a particular case that can be expressed in plain words If I see something like x[u][key]=value where u is a symbol then assign value to u[key] (DownValues of u) instead of assigning value as a SubValues of x. The corresponding code               ObjectSet[(_[symbol_Symbol]|symbol_),key_,value_]:=symbol[key]=value;          Unprotect[Set];     Set[symbol_[key_],value_]:=        Block[{$inObjectSet=True},           ObjectSet[symbol,key,value]        ]/;!TrueQ[$inObjectSet];     Protect[Set];      This is needed for what I want to do as Set has a HoldFirst attribute, so I pass the left hand side to a function that will evaluate it. An example after having executed the code above               x[u]["key"]=3     DownValues[u]      Leonid expressed his concerns to this solution of modifying Set in case it becomes widespread. What could be alternatives to this way of doing ?
