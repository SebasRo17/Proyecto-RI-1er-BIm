I am having trouble setting up a remote kernel connection between my two Mac computers. The kernel on my iMac runs much faster than on my MacBook Pro, so I would like to run computations through my iMac when I am out of town. I have set up ssh on my iMac and have no problem connecting to it via ssh in a Terminal window from my MacBook. I can even run the remote kernel from the command line by entering "/Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel" without any problems. However I cannot set up a remote kernel from my front end despite putting this exact same command for "Kernel Program." Mathematica displays the "cannot connect to remote kernel" error before even asking me for a password to log into my remote machine. I am really at a loss as to what is wrong (I am not very familiar with computers at all) and any help would be appreciated.
