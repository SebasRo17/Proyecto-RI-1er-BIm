Are elements returned by Linq-to-Entities query streamed from the database one at the time ( as they are requested ) or are they retrieved all at once:                   SampleContext context = new SampleContext(); // SampleContext derives from ObjectContext         var search = context.Contacts;              foreach (var contact in search)         {            Console.WriteLine(contact.ContactID); // is each Contact retrieved from the DB                                                   // only when foreach requests it?         }      thank you in advance
