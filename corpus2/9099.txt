As a programmer, do you see any professional or other advantage in using your real name in online discourse, versus an invented handle? I've always gone by a single username and had my real name displayed whenever possible, for a few reasons:   * My interests online are almost exclusively professional and aboveboard.   * It constructs a search-friendly public log of all of my work, everywhere.   * If someone wants to contact me, there are many ways to do it.   * My portfolio of work is all tied to me personally. Possible cons to full disclosure include:   * If you feel like becoming involved in something untoward, it could be harder.   * The psychopath who inherits your project can more easily find out where you live.   * You might be spammed by people who are not worth the precious time that could be better spent writing more of the brilliant software you're famous for.   * Your portfolio of work is all tied to you personally. It seems, anyway, that a vast majority of StackOverflow users go by invented handles rather than real names. Notable exceptions include the best-known users, who are typically well established in the industry. But how could we ever become legendary rockstar programmers if we didn't get our names out there? Discuss.
