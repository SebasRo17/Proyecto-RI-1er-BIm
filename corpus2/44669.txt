I want to compute the exact solution of the heat equation but I got an error. u(x,t) (equation of transmition of heat) is the solution of this differential equation: $$du/dt - \alpha d^2u/dx^2 = 0$$ $$u(x,0) = g(x) = 1/(1+x^2)^{0.25}$$ $$ u(-10,t) = u(10,t) = 0$$ $\alpha = 2/10$ I computed:               pde = D[u[x, t], t] - 0.2 D[u[x, t], {x, 2}] == 0     DSolve[pde, u[x, 0] == 1/(1 + x^2)^0.25`, u[-10, t] == 0, u[10, t] == 0, u[x, t], {x, t}]      However, I got an error: DSolve::dsvar: u[-10,t]==0 cannot be used as a variable. >> What am I doing wrong? Thanks for your help.
