For a couple of months now I have been wanting to learn Javascript and PHP but the lack of time didn't give me that opportunity. I'm in a position that have enough time to learn only one language and practice it or both in a row without doing any practice for about 1-2 months except the code in the books. I have a bit of Java programming background and have built 3 applications in Java , so I'm not totaly new when it comes to programming, but I can't say I'm at an intermediate level. I also have some experience with jQuery, which by the way I recently realised it was a mistake to learn jQuery before Javascript and XHTML/CSS. These are the recources that I am planning to read for both of them: Javascript:   1. Getting Good with JavaScript   2. Professional JavaScript for Web Developers 3rd Edition   3. JavaScript 24-Hour Trainer   4. Javascript Patterns   5. JavaScript: The Good Parts PHP:   1. PHP Solutions Dynamic Web Design Made Easy 2nd.Edition   2. PHP and MySQL Web Development 4th Edition   3. Oreilly PHP Cookbook 2nd Edition These were the resources that were recommended to me by a friend to fully grasp these two technologies exactly in that order and these are the ones I plan to read in the time that I have in the summer. If there is anything you would like to add please feel free to tell me. I am committed to learning them both to their full potential. So what I want to ask if it is appropriate to try and learn PHP immediately after learning Javascript or should I stick just to one of them until I learn it better and move to the other after?
