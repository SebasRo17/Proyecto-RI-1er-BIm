How are objects organized in memory? For instance, I know that a function is a piece of code in memory, that expects parameters via the stack and/or the registers and handles it's own stack frame. But objects are a much more complicated structure. How are they organized? Does each object have "links" to methods and passes address to itself to that method? It would be great to see a good explanation of this topic. UPD. I made the question more exact, and I'm mainly interested in statically typing languages.
