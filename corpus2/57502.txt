Please look at               Show[DiscretizeGraphics[Graphics3D[{Cone[]}]], Axes -> True, Boxed -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BZl52.jpg) Well, there are some `Ticks`, but others are missing or (on the Z-axis) cut- off. Now it becomes even worse:               dg = DiscretizeGraphics[Normal @ Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}]] // Quiet          Show[dg, Axes -> True, Boxed -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZkqxL.jpg) The `Ticks` are completely missing. Is this a bug or do I overlook something? **EDIT** Thanks to hieron's answer:               Show[dg,      Axes -> True,      Boxed -> True,      SphericalRegion -> True,      PlotRange -> {{-3.2, 3.2}, {-2.4, 2.4}, {-2., 2.}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JRW8D.jpg) However, we don't need this work-around with               Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WVp58.jpg)
