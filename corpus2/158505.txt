I have to extract around 3 million records from two different databases for further processing. Currently, I execute the queries via SQL*Plus and spool the results to a plain text file. This queries take around 10 minutes each (it's faster on one of the databases) but im looking to improve those times. I found this tool: http://www.iri.com/products/FACT that's supposed to do exactly what I need. Do you know about any other open source tool that I can use to help me improve the extraction times, or maybe a better technique than just spooling to a text file?
