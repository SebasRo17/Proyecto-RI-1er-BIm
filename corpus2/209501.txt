I'm writing a database management software. It has a client-server architecture where the server has the piece of code to store and retrieve. The client has to get the input from the user, connects to the server and queries it. Now I have a parser that can parse SQL like queries. My question is which is the best place to embed this parser? ### Option 1-Embedding it in the Server: Get the queries from the client, pass it untouched to the Server and then parse it and do the needful. (OR) ### Option 2-Embedding it in the Client: Get the queries from the Client, parse it then and there and then pass a command object that has specific fields set reflecting the queries to the server and the server acts upon the data in the command object. Which is the right way to do?
