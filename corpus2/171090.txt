OK, say I have a data class for a user:               public class User {     private String firstName;     private String lastName;     private long personCode;     private Date birthDate;     private Gender gender;     private String email;     private String password;      Now let's say I want to validate email, whether names are not empty, whether birth date is in normal range, etc. Can I put that validation method in this class together with data? Or should it be in UserManager which in my case handles the lists of these users?
