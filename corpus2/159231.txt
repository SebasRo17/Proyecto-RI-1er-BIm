I've been working on a kind of CRM for the sales guys in our office - not as a job role but as a spare time task type of thing - I don't claim to be a developer or anything like that, but I would definitely like to pursue a career as a web developer down the line, I just think I need a much stronger understanding of OOP principles and design patterns such as MVC before I could even consider it. Basically the way I've developed it each section of the App is a html page, that uses jQuery to listen for events, which then sends ajax requests to the server, which are then redirected to class methods that will perform usually simple CRUD tasks, and send back a JSON response to the client which will then be reflected on the page - would that constitute mvc even in a loose sense, as presentation is completely seperate from things like database interaction and theres a go-between to interact between the two? Like I say i'm in the very early stages of grappling the comprehension of MVC as a whole so any thoughts would be appreciated, thanks.
