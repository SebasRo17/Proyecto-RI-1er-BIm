I just started at a company and one of the style comments at my first code review was that the return type and method name should be on different lines. For example, this               void foo() {     }      should be this               void     foo() {     }      I've always used the first style, and I was wondering if there is any reason other than personal preference why people use the second style? I don't think the first one hurts readability at all. Is one more common than the other with C programmers and large open source projects?
