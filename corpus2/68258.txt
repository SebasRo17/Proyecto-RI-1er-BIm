Sometimes you get busy and delegate small tasks to junior programmers. But if you don't pay close enough attention you find yourself with this kind of code in production:               class DivtoggleController extends Zend_Controller_Action {              public function closeAction() {             /* ... code removed for brevity ... */                  $req = $this->getRequest();             $formData = $req->getPost();                  $d = $formData['div'];             $i = $formData['id'];                  $dm = new Model_DivtoggleManager();             $rs = $dm->setDivToggleById($d, $i);              }          }               class Model_DivtoggleManager extends Zend_Db_Table {              public function setDivToggleById($div, $id) {             $result = $this->getAdapter()->query(                "update div_toggle set " . $div . "=1 where id=" . $id             );         }          }      So, given that I have removed the authentication / session management logic for brevity, who can tell me what possible problem there might be with this sample?
