I am attempting to make a small interactive plot that displays the plot of `Cos` iterated `its` times. Whenever I try to evaluate my cell, however, I get a `Nest:intnm` error, something like:               Nest::intnm: Non-negative machine-sized integer expected at position 3 in Nest[Cos,0.000128356,100].      As you can see, the 3rd argument for `Nest` is an integer, but Mathematica is not happy with it. Here is my code:               DynamicModule[{its=100},Column[{Plot[Nest[Cos,x,Dynamic[its]],{x,0,2\[Pi]}],Slider[Dynamic[its],{1,500,1}]}]]      I've tried changing `Nest[Cos,x,Dynamic[its]]` to `Nest[Cos,x,IntegerPart[Dynamic[its]]]` (so as to catch any sort of glitch where `100` was not seen as an integer) with no avail. This is my first time dealing with anything dynamic, or even sliders, so any help is appreciated.
