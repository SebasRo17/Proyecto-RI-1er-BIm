By running the code               n = 5;     U[t_] := Table[Subscript[u, i][t], {i, 0, n}];     lines = NDSolve[{eqns, initc}, U[t], {t, 0, T}]      I get the output               {{u_0[t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.`,5.`}},"<>"][t],        u_1[t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.`,5.`}},"<>"][t],       u_2[t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.`,5.`}},"<>"][t],        u_3[t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.`,5.`}},"<>"][t],        u_4[t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.`,5.`}},"<>"][t],        u_5[t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.`,5.`}},"<>"][t]}}      (it's the solution of a system of ODEs that I obtain by discretizing a PDE with the method of lines). Now I would like to extract a particular value for each function, for example `u_2[0.5]` but I'm not managing to do that. Can someone help me? Thank you so much!
