I have a very large data set (around 3000) that looks like:               {{1749.08, 580.}, {1749.17, 626.}, {1749.25, 700.}, {1749.33,        557.}, {1749.42, 850.}, {1749.5, 835.}, {1749.58, 948.}, {1749.67,        663.}....      The first number is the year plus the month/12. So I want to iterate over all the list adding the second part for each year So example using data above: `For year 1749: 580+626+700+557+850+835+948+663` I know I have to use a for loop but I can't figure out the syntax. Can anyone lend a helping hand?
