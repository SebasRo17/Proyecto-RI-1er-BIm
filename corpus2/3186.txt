`Sphere` is one of the three-dimensional graphics primitives available in Mathematica and can be easily used to created very useful images. For instance, in the figure below I created three images of an ellipsoidal object that is lit from a fixed direction and it is then just rotated around the z-axis.               GraphicsRow[         Table[             Graphics3D[             Rotate[Scale[{GrayLevel[.7], Sphere[]}, {1, 1.5, 1}, {0, 0, 0}],              i Degree, {0, 0, 1}], PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}, {-2, 2}},              AspectRatio -> 1, Background -> Black, Boxed -> False,              ViewPoint -> Front, SphericalRegion -> True,              Lighting -> {{"Directional", White, ImageScaled[{0, 0, 1}]}}         ], {i, {0, 45, 90}}]]      ![ellipsoidalObject](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qSTdb.png) Suppose that instead of using the ellipsoidal object I would like to use an object like this bump:               Plot3D[Exp[-(x^2 + y^2)], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]      ![bump](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hjfn5.png) Is there a way to create a "graphics primitive" object of the bump, so as to just use it instead of `Sphere` in the above example? I suppose there should be a way to extract all the polygons specifying the shape of the bump, but I couldn't find a way to do it. Any other approach is also more than welcome.
