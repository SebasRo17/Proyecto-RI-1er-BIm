Sometimes I find myself in situations when the part of code that I am writing is (or _seems to be_ ) so self-evident that its name would be basically repeated as a comment:               class Example     {         /// <summary>         /// The location of the update.         /// </summary>         public Uri UpdateLocation { get; set; };     }      (C# example, but please refer to the question as language-agnostic). A comment like that is useless; what am I doing wrong? Is it the choice of the name that is wrong? How could I comment parts like this better? Should I just skip the comment for things like this?
