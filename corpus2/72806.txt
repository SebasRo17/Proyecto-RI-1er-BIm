All programmers have their style of programming. But some of the styles are let’s say... let’s not say. So you have code review to try to impose certain rules for good design and good programming techniques. But most of the programmers don’t like code review. They don’t like other people criticizing their work. _Who do they think they are to consider themselves better than me and tell me that this is bad design, this could be done in another way. It works right? What is the problem?_ This is something they might say (or think but not say which is just as bad if not worse). So how do you make people accept code review without starting a war? How can you convince them this is a good thing; that will only improve their programming skills and avoid a lot of work later to fix and patch a zillion times a thing that hey... "it works"? People will tell you how to make code review (peer-programming, formal inspections etc) what to look for in a code review, studies have been made to show the number of defects that can be discovered before the software hits production etc. But how do you convince programmers to accept a code review?
