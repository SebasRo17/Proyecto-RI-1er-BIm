So, I'm in a big geographically-distributed company, we use perforce and I'm starting to make the case for a DVCS with a whitepaper I was requested to write. I was thinking that one of the arguments I could use is the bandwidth saved using a DVCS, and technically if there were binaries to download (there are, but they're not sync'ed every day) and enough developers downloading them one could see a substantial difference. Unfortunately that's an edge case and its all that I can think of (other than individual developers being able to work faster when diffing, committing locally, and all those other DVCS perks). So, **would there be an actual noticeable bandwidth save?, in what other cases?**. Free cookie to anyone with actual empirical evidence (confirming or refuting). **Edit:** It is just one of the arguments I'm trying to support and it's not at all the main one, I got at least 10 others... this is one of the "side- benefits" but I want to find out how real it is. Plus, I want to win over the IT guys =)
