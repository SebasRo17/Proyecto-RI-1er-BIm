I find my usage of jQuery scaling in proportion with user expectations and RIA app. development. Problem is, I'm no jQuery Guru. I am looking for some nice practices that also do not require a deep knowledge of js/jquery. An article I ran across today inspired me to ask this question. Is there such a simple set of general guidelines for jQuery? I have not read "javascript the good parts" as of yet, so looking for some basic stuff.
