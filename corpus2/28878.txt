First off, I want to say that this is **purely hypothetical** ; it's just a scenario that came to mind. I am not looking for personal legal advice, but rather, I'm trying to gain a better understanding of software licensing in general. Suppose somebody open-sources code relating to a botnet (either the code to infect a zombie, control the zombies, or both) under some license, let's say GPL. A few questions.   * First off, are botnets illegal? I don't know if it differs from country to country. I ask because if it isn't, then my question would make no sense whatsoever.   * Can a software license be applied to "illegal" software?   * If a person decides to take that code and violates the license terms, could the original creator take action against said person?   * Even if they could, _should they_? What happens if somebody openly admits they are the creator of code that does illegal things?
