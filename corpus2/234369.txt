I'm currently writing a project that is using a few separate virtual machines for the database, API and front-end website (currently 1 of each). I'm writing my code in PHP, and all of these virtual machines are running within the same virtual network. What are the best practices (if any) for accessing a 'local' API like this in the front-end? Would you still use something like curl? Are there alternatives to doing so?
