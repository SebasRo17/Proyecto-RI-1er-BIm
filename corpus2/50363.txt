![What to do](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pTuzi.png) I have a binary matrix. My objective is to connect every close (without "jump") elements with value equal to 1, but I must keep the point positions, just like it's shown at the image. Can somebody help me with it, please? Test input thanks to @hftf:               {{0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0},      {0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0},      {0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0},      {0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0},      {0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0},      {0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0}}
