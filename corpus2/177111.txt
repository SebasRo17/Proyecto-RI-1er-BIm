I've been writing a website in PHP. As the code becomes more complex, I keep finding problems that can be solved using the factory design pattern. For example: I've a got a class `Page` which has subclasses `HTMLPage`, `XMLPage`, etc. Depending on some input I need to return an object of either one of these classes. I use the factory design pattern to do this. But as I encounter this problem in more classes, I keep having to change code which still initiates an object using its constructor. So now I'm wondering: is it a good idea to change all code so that it uses the factory design pattern? Or are there big drawbacks? I'm currently in a position to change this, so your answers would be really helpful.
