How do I use a custom CDF that I defined for a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. I have one input vector of data whose CDF I claim to have derived but want to check whether it agrees with my closed form result. In order to do so, I am wondering whether there is a way to feed the command not just two data vectors but one data vector and one CDF. In http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/KolmogorovSmirnovTest.html, one can only specify the distributions by name but mine is a new one that has no name (yet;-)). Thanks! Hirek
