There are functions like `Join[ ]` that accept a variable number of arguments. `Join` is a flat function, as the order of arguments matters, but `Join[a,b,c]` equals `Join[a,Join[a,c]]`. I want to create a module that has the same behavior. It's no problem to create a function with two variables. In this example nested lists are joined horizontally: `JoinH[f_,g_] := Transpose[Join[Transpose[f],Transpose[g]]];` How do I rewrite this function/module so that I can pass a variable number of arguments to this function, like `JoinH[a,b,c]`?
