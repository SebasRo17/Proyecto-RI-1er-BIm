Greetings I am currently studying pathfinding and I came across A* algorithm from this site https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js I tried to test A* with bi-directional and it is working great. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H9fz7.png) What I wanna do now is increase the path that it can make without adding more nodes in the openlist. For example is that the algorithm was able to find a path but as you look at the results it can still generate one more path without touching the other path. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bDeSj.png) Any ideas? Thank you so much
