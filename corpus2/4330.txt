I have a fundamental region in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined solely by inequalities (i.e. the region is the intersection of 5 half-spaces and is a kind of square pyramid), and a function which is only well-defined inside that region. I would like to plot that function's level surfaces inside the region using `ContourPlot3D`. However there is no easy way to stipulate the region simply in the form of `{a,a_min,a_max}`-type declarations as Mathematica seems to require. Does anyone know how to do this please?
