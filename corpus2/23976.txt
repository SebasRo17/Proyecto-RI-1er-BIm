In an older version NoteBook, I was able to specify some options for `TableForm`, which enabled the printing of an expression in a simple fashion:               MyExpression//TableForm      I used this:               optsinit1 := SetOptions[TableForm,       TableHeadings -> {rowHeadings, columnHeadings},       TableAlignments -> Left,       TableSpacing -> 1]      where rowHeadings and columnHeadings were defined. Before using `TableForm` I would evaluate optsinit1:               optsinit1;          MyExpression//TableForm      would print the array (MyExpression) with the headings defined by rowHeadings and columnHeadings. In V9Ii have to issue               TableForm[MyExpression,optsinit1]       to get the previous behavior. I prefer the old behavior. Any hints on how this is done? Note that when I issue `Options[TableForm]` the return is               {TableAlignments -> Left, TableDepth -> \[Infinity],       TableDirections -> Column,       TableHeadings -> {rowHeadings, colHeadings}, TableSpacing -> 1}
