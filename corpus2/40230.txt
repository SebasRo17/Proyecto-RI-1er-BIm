I do not know how to plot a `TransformedDistribution` of the named Polya- Aeppli distribution and do not know if the transformation can be handled after reading: Just what kind of transformations can TransformedDistribution handle?. I'm having trouble understanding the format of the plotting transformed distributions but hope that I can keep `TransformedDistribution` as part of the command.
