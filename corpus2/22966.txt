I have an Excel sheet of the form:                   " "  a  b  c          1   R  S  T          2   U  V  W          3   X  Y  Z      Where every entry is a number (except the blank quotes, which is just a blank cell). These are supposed to be `{x,y,z}` coords but Mathematica imports them as `{" ",a,b,c},{1,R,S,T},...`. I get that I need to transpose them but I'm not sure how. Essentially for this example the end result should be `{a,1,R},{b,1,S},{c,1,T},{a,2,U}...`. This is similar but without the extra lines which is kind of the issue I'm having: Import Excel sheet into 3D array?
