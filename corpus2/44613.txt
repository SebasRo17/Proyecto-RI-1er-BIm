I have a do loop in which I "Put" a ListPlot of a list in every iteration by doing               Put[ListPlot[list],"file"]      While the process is running and is still not finished, I get the desired plots in "file", but once the process is finished, I do not get the plot but the numerical values of the list with something like               {"      0.0134559544171447}", " {298.", " 0.013484438740159787}",        " {299.", " "}, {"      0.013512496857553435}", " {300.",      " 0.013540123145712023}}]}", " {}}}",      " "}, {"  {AspectRatio -> GoldenRatio^(-1)", " Axes -> True",      " AxesOrigin -> {0", " 0.0098}", " "}, {"   PlotRange -> {{0.",      " 300.}", " {0.00977737893161915", " 0.016994445972500355}}",      " "}, {"   PlotRangeClipping -> True",      " PlotRangePadding -> "}, {"    {Scaled[0.02]",      " Scaled[0.02]}}]}"}}      this is just a small piece of the output. I am working in the background by using "nohup" and running an .m file (in case it might have something to do with my issue). What do I have to do so that I always get the ListPlots as output? Thanks
