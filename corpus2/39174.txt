I have a very long nested list. Here is a short example:               list = {{1.2, {1, 1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2}}, {0.9, {3, 3, 3, 3}, {4, 4, 4}}, {1.4, {4, 4, 4, 4}, {5, 5, 5}}}      Now I want to cancel all entries if the first entry of each part of the list (`list[[i]]`) is > 1. So that the new list would only consist of the second part of list (`list[[2]]`)               newlist = {0.9, {3, 3, 3, 3}, {4, 4, 4}}      I have already tried my luck with `Position` and `Delete`, but with no success. Thanks a lot for your help!
