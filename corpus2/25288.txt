For example, I have the equation               x^2 + y^2 == x*y      and I want to apply the rule               y -> s*x      I can do it easily by               x^2 + y^2 == x*y //. y -> s*x       But it seems to me it would be possible to use only `Map` to change everything. How can I do it that way? In other words, I think `Replace` is just a kind of syntactic sugar, and want to know how to express `Replace` by `Map`.
