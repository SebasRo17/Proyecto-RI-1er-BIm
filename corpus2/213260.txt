I have a PHP program running right now that is processing database rows of over 6 million. Considering the speed at which number of records have been processed so far, it looks like the whole process might take few days to complete (due to hardware limitations). I was thinking if I could make changes in the program to remove unnecessary logging and other things that may be consuming time. Can I do this with the current program still running so that further processing would speed up, or will this cause the PHP script to break ?
