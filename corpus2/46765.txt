I'm trying to (as a simple starter) find the solution to Helmholtz equation in polar coordinates -- I already know what it is and can derive it by hand, but just want to start here before asking _Mathematica_ to do it in more complex coordinates. Sample derivation from Wikipedia. My code:               pde2 = D[A[r, θ], {r, 2}] + D[A[r, θ], r]/r  + D[A[r, θ], {θ, 2}] / r^2 + k^2 A[r, θ] == 0          soln = DSolve[{pde2, A[a, θ] == 0}, A[r, θ], {r, θ}]      which I believe corresponds to: $$ A_{rr} + \frac{A_{r}}{r} + \frac{A_{\theta\theta}}{r^2} + k^2 A = 0 $$ with boundary condition $$ A(a, \theta) = 0 $$ One thing I'm wondering is that I'm not specifying $r \leq a$, but I can't work out how to do that. Any help, including links to documentation I've missed or misread will be greatly appreciated.
