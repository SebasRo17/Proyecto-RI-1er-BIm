I've been asked to reproduce a bar chart generated in Excel in _Mathematica_. The original Excel chart looks like this; ![Excel chart](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nfxs8.png) My _Mathematica_ version looks like this; ![Mathematica chart](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S90Mr.png) There are a couple of things wrong that I'd like to fix;   1. The `BarChart` and `ListPlot` overlay doesn't seem to match up.    2. The `ChartLabels` seem to have disappeared on the `BarChart`.   3. Is there a nice way to make the ticks on the left and right sides match up (like when the Excel chart matches 9 % on the left to 90 % on the right)?   4. I can't get the box and line to center align to the text in the legend. Questions 1 and 2 are what I really need to fix, but 3 and 4 would be nice to have. Any help would be appreciated. Here's the code I used to generate my chart;               purple = RGBColor[97/255, 16/255, 106/255];     orange = RGBColor[245/255, 132/255, 31/255];     labels =        {         "FY15 Q1/2", "FY15 Q3/4", "FY16 Q1/2", "FY16 Q3/4",          "FY17 Q1/Q2", "FY17 Q3/Q4", "FY18 Q1/2", "FY18 Q3/4"       };     starvedTime = {7.55, 11.23, 8.58333, 6.88833, 4.65167, 1.89, 6.49833, 1.95};     satTime = {70.1483, 81.1467, 81.115, 86.5483, 84.6833, 90.685, 79.6017, 91.0133};          plot1 = BarChart[starvedTime,        PlotRange -> {0, 12},        ChartStyle -> purple,        BaseStyle -> "Text",        Frame -> {True, True, True, False},       FrameTicks -> {False, True},        FrameLabel -> {None, Style["Smelter Starved Time (%)", "Text"], None, None},        PlotLabel -> "Smelter Starved Time by 6 Month Period: Base Case",        ImageSize -> Large,        ChartLabels -> {Placed[Style[#, "Text"] & /@ labels, Below], None},       AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},        PlotRangePadding -> {0, 0},        BarSpacing -> 1];          plot2 = ListPlot[satTime,       Joined -> True,       PlotRange -> {60, 100},       PlotStyle -> orange,       Frame -> {False, False, False, True},       FrameTicks -> {None, None, None, All},       FrameLabel ->        {None, None, None, Style["Smelter Operating at Constraint Rate (%)", "Text"]},       BaseStyle -> "Text",       GridLines -> {None, Automatic},       GridLinesStyle -> Directive[Gray, Dashed],      ImageSize -> Large];          box = Graphics[{purple, Rectangle[]}, ImageSize -> 12];     text = Style["   Smelter Starved (%)   ", "Text"];     line = Graphics[{orange, Line[{{0, 0.5}, {1, 0.5}}]}, ImageSize -> {30, Automatic}];     text2 = Text[Style["    % Time Smelter at Constraint Rate (%)       ", "Text"]];     legend = Row[{box, text, line, text2}];          Column[{Overlay[{plot1, plot2}], legend}, Alignment -> {Center, Center}]
