Let's say we have a company and we release our project under LGPL && GPLv3, as you know the only thing here is about contribution. People commit bug- fixes/features to the project, it's fine and we are GPL fans. Basically company makes money by this project. So what about contributors ? I know they commit code and software get better and it is actual repay to them, But how we can get contributors assign copyright for copyright holder?
