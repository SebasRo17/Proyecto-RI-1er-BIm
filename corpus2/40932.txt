I have a table: `p1 = Table[(Binomial[2000, k]*StirlingS2[1386, k]*k!)/(2000^1386), {k, 1, 1386, 1}];` I used `ListPlot[p1]` to draw a plot of this values. This is the plot, where on `Y` I have values of `p1` and on `X` I have values of `k`. But when I draw my plot, I see only points which are starting from $k \approx 560$. Why I can't see points for all values of `k`? Is this because of that values for small `k` are too small? How can I fix that?
