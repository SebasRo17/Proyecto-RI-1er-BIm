I am working on an application that heavily depends on asynchronous data operations. I am dealing with those through promises. However, while my code works, I have the feel that it is getting chaotic and hard to maintain in the future. Assume this:               validate().then(          // success     function(promise){         $http.post('stuff.php',data).then(                function(p){                },           function(){                }         )      },          // failure     function(reason){         // Assume another promise-depending operation     },          // notification     function(update){          }     );      As you can see, promise calls are heavily nested. Furthermore, I have to deal with resolve/reject methods in each and every step. What am I missing; how can I improve my technique?
