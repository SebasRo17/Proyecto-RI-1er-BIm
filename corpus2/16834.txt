Using the following code, I downloaded an image from the web and adjusted the image to obtain the "negation" of the image: > >     im1 = Import["http://www.furnituremaker.com/images/Craftsman.gif"] >   >     im2 = ColorConvert[ >      ImageAdjust[ >       ColorQuantize[ColorNegate[im1], 20, Dithering -> False], 1], >      "Grayscale" >      ] >   > > ![Furniture 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mNGxs.gif) > > ![Furniture 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OzCkU.gif) Now, I would like to convert this to an image that is "nearly" black and white. By "nearly," I mean that the resulting image may have a small amount of gray at the interface of the black and white, so as to keep the resulting image smooth. (It seems like simply rasterizing an image can sometimes look bad.) How can I accomplish this? I tried using `Darker`, but it just makes the background gray again: > >     im3 = Darker[im2] >   > > ![Furniture 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IVXLQ.gif) Instead I would like to somehow adjust the saturation so that the line art and text appears black. `ColorConvert` seems like a possibility, but in the documentation I do not see how to specify a black and white color space. Can you please help me?
