> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Java dev learning Python: what concepts do I need to wrap my head around? I was a Java developer in the early 2000s, switched to Python in 2008 and now I am working in Java again. How has Java changed since the early 2000s? What are the major updates besides generics? Is there anything special you think I should keep in mind when going back to a Java environment? I used to work with EJB 1.0, I didn't work with EJB 2.0 and now we have JPA instead. I'm comfortable programming in Java and my new job with Java is much better than my Python job even though Python is my favorite language the tools and others things about my Java job makes it much better. I found when I searched jobs that demand for Java developer was much greater than demand for Python programmers - do you have a similar experience?
