How to explain DistributionChart function in mathematica, For example: if I have               nd1 = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], 25];     nd2 = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[2, 10], 25];          DistributionChart[nd1, BarOrigin -> Right]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/29fQG.png)               DistributionChart[nd2, BarOrigin -> Right]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/teWv2.png) 1) what is the importance or application of representing data as distribution chart as compare to Normal distribution 2) How to quantify it? or differentiate from 2nd chart in quantitative way or can i estimate probability of middle fatter region
