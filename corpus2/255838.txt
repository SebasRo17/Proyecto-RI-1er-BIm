I'm willing, with some friends, to make a developers guide for an open source point of sale written in Java. The thing is I have never written anyone and so I don't know exactly what to put in there to meet standards. I'm thinking about putting UML, and using Java doc but still I don't know what are the expectations of developers towards a developers guide. How can we say a developer's guide is truly worth?
