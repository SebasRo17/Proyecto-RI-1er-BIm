I am trying to get `CUDAFunctionLoad` to work with _Mathematica 9.0_. I installed the latest clang and the _Nvidia Tools 6.0_. but I keep getting the error message: > >     CUDAFunctionLoad::cmperr: "-- Message text not found -- >                                  "clang: error: unsupported option > -dumpspecs" " >   I note that others have the same problem. i asked _NVIDIA_ and _Wolfram Reaserch_ for help and they have not come up with any solution so far, although they suspect the problem is that clang in latest version is not compatible with _Mathematica 9.0_. Any help, insights or leads would be very much appreciated.
