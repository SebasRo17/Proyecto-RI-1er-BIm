I need to use lots of assumptions in my code. Therefore I put them into the `$Assumptions` variable. When I do it like this, all is well:               $Assumptions = {x > 0, y > 0}     Simplify[Sqrt[x^2]] (* returns "x" *)      But as my code got longer, I wanted to break my `$Assumptions` definition into parts by appending to `$Assumptions` whenever a new assumption comes up. This works great - except when I first run the `AppendTo` command (when `$Assumptions` only contains `True`)               AppendTo[$Assumptions, x>0]         --> AppendTo::normal: "Nonatomic expression expected at position 1 in AppendTo[$Assumptions,x>0]"      Once I already have an assumption, the code works fine:               $Assumptions = {True, x>0}  (* included True just for fun *)         AppendTo[$Assumptions, y > 0]  (* works *)      Why does it not work the first time?
