I want to solve the ode and plot the solution `v[x]` for different values of parameter `a` where `x=2000` (for just any fixed position x or event at x). By looking at examples of `EventLocator` available online i tried to write the code as:               data = Table[Reap[         soln =           NDSolve[{I D[v[x], x] == (0.4 + a)*v[x], v[0] == 1}, {v[x]}, {x, 0, 2000},           Method -> {"EventLocator",              "Event"          -> Abs[v[x]]^2,              "EventCondition" -> x == 1000,             "EventAction"    :> Sow[{a, Evaluate[Abs[v[x]]]^2 /. soln}]}]][[2, 1]],       {a, -1, 0, 0.3}]      But it does not give data file i wanted to grab as`{a,[Abs[v[x]]^2}`. instead it shows: > Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist. >>   >  Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist. >>   >  Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist. >>   >  General::stop: Further output of Part::partw will be suppressed during this > calculation. >> > > {{{{v[x]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,2000.}},<>][x]}},{}}[[2,1]],   >  {{{v[x]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,2000.}},<>][x]}},{}}[[2,1]],   >  {{{v[x]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,2000.}},<>][x]}},{}}[[2,1]],   >  {{{v[x]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,2000.}},<>][x]}},{}}[[2,1]]} Any kind of help or suggestion will great .Even if you can help using other method like using for loop and logical condition that will be great too.
