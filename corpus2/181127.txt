I'm trying to figure out the best way to handle custom errors in my application. Option 1:               if(expr) {     } else {         $_SESSION['error'] = "Some message describing the error";     }      Option 2:               if(expr) {     } else {         $_SESSION['error'] = 2;     }      In option 1, the same error might be recycled in multiple situations. If I ever decide to change the message then I'll have to dig through my code and find every occurrence. In option 2, I give a numerical value which could reference a master list of errors. This seems to solve the problem associated with option 1 but makes the code harder to read. What should I do?
