I don't want to know which IDE is best, because that's subjective. I'd like to know how to evaluate an IDE. I'm primarily a `vim` user, and realistically happy there, but occasionally look at languages that have powerful IDE's and I consider using them. The problem I run into is that they mostly seem the same to me. Certainly any of them will work, but when trying to decide which IDE to invest time in how do I decide? What features should I be testing to see if I like the way A or B works better? Obviously some IDE's are specifically tailored to a language, but given a choice between say Netbeans, Eclipse, and Intellij IDEA, how would I decide? as a novice they seem the same. When evaluating I generally try the editor, a few configuration options, file browser. I think my colleagues all basically the same as me and don't use IDE. I also doubt I'd end up using the IDE for work, because Perl shop, and I'm happy with vim for that, I'm simply trying to figure out how to use them in the context of languages that aren't day job and have solid IDE support.
