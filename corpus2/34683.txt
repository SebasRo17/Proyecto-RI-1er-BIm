I'm starting to study the behavior of some PDEs and I would like to run simulations in mathematica to help me visualize solutions. For example, a prime example that I would like to study is $$ \left\\{ \begin{array}{cc} -\Delta\phi + u\cdot\nabla\phi=1 & \text{in }\Omega\\\ \phi=0& \text{on }\partial\Omega \end{array}\right. $$ for a fixed (smooth enough) $u$ which is divergence free and flows tangentially to the boundary. For one dimensional problems, inputting boundary conditions is easy since there are typically only two bounary points at most. But I would like to study this PDE (in 2-d) with a variety of different $\Omega$'s. I can't find anything in the mathematica documentation about how to input arbitrary boundary conditions. To make things simpler, I will restrict myself to reasonably nice $\Omega$'s which have nice boundaries. Suppose that $\partial\Omega$ is given implicitly by $F(x,y)=0$, e.g. $x^2+y^2-1=0$. What would be the easiest/best/most efficient way to input the boundary condition $\phi(x,y)=0$ when $F(x,y)=0$? Edit: Feel free to use any reasonable discretization technique, or to assume that you have a function like `isInRegion[x,y]` if you need it.
