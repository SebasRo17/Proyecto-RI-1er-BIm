SELECT                        *    #Case 1                 cp.* #Case 2                  FROM crawl_page AS cp             LEFT JOIN artist AS a                 ON cp.cpURL LIKE CONCAT('%',a.artistPageID,'/',a.artistPageURL,'%')                  WHERE cpPageType = 'SONGS'                 AND cpPageAdded < (                     SELECT cpCrawlDate                      FROM crawl_page                      WHERE cpURL = 'http://www.example.com/page-52/'                 )                      AND a.artistID IS NULL                    LIMIT 1      In this query when I use 1st case (selecting everything from both tables) time taken for query is fine about 0.468 sec. But if I do case 2 (selecting only from main table) it takes hell much time 26 second. It's not problem just to use case 1, but I can't get the idea how does it work and why? Thanks
