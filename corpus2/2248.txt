`OverVector` can be used to make a symbol look like a vector in text sections of documents. I happen to like bold symbols for vectors better, as in latex `\mathbf{x}` output. I've found that I can do, say, `Style[x, Bold]`, but this is actually a very subtle seeming change, and I find it hard to actually notice the difference. Perhaps this is because the default font picked for variables is something quite different from what one gets with `\mathbf`. If this is just a font issue, what's a good font for this sort of output (i.e. like `\mathbf{x}`), and how would it be selected? Also, the `Style` function applies to expressions, whereas I want it to apply to just particular variables (i.e. leaving scalars in regular font), so that when they are used in input, the output comes out in the desired way. Is there a mechanism to declare a variable, and have specific style settings associated with it, so that it is displayed in the desired way?
