I live in Australia, and I am currently looking at some of the remote job offerings in countries like US/UK. However I have very little understanding of what needs to be done to report that kind of income - i.e. do I need to get an ABN, pay payroll tax myself etc. If you had any experience in this area I would like you to share that.
