For my system of equations, the procedure described in Solving complex equations of using `Reduce` works no more. How can I separate the real and imaginary part of the equations? Because then I could use `Solve[equations, vars, Reals]`. Nevertheless I hope for a simpler way to overcome this issue. **Example**               Vector = {v1, v2, v3, v4};     Matrix = {{c11, c12, c13, c14},                {c21, c22, c23, c24},                {c31, c32, c33, c34},                {c41, c42, c43, c44}};     Reduce[Table[0 == Sum[Matrix[[r, k]] Vector[[k]], {k, 4}], {r, 4}] &&       Element[{v1Real, v1Complex, v2Real, v2Complex, v3Real, v3Complex, v4Real, v4Complex}, Reals],      {v1Real, v1Complex, v2Real, v2Complex, v3Real, v3Complex, v4Real, v4Complex}] /.       {v1 -> v1Real + I v1Complex, v2 -> v2Real + I v2Complex, v3 -> v3Real + I v3Complex, v4 -> v4Real + I v4Complex}
