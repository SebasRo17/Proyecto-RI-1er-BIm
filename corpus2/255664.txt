If a software license prevents you from modifying a program (i.e "You may not modifyâ€¦") is renaming the program (e.g. changing it from a.exe to b.exe) considered modification legally of the software if the software remains binary identical since all that has really changed is the path to the program? Edit. I am not asking for legal assistance here I am asking what is the case law in this area. What modification is must have been dealt with at some point.
