In order to handle several possible errors that shouldn't halt execution, I have an `error` variable that clients can check and use to throw exceptions. Is this an Anti-Pattern? Is there a better way to handle this? For an example of this in action you can see PHP's mysqli API. Assume that visibility problems (accessors, public and private scope, is the variable in a class or global?) are handled correctly.
