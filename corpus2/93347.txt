I have built many web sites and I would like put them in my portfolio. But now when I am checking I see that most of them are changed as they switched to another company. Now I am confused what should I do   1. Do I put old thumnail or screenshot of site or new one? (I have old screenshots)   2. If interviewer checks the site and ask me what part I have done, what should I say?   3. Does the interviewer or company contact the site owner to confirm that?
