For functions that can produce multiple "style-able" entities, _Mathematica_ by default will give each such entity a different style. Similar conventions apply to other features, either by default, or when `Automatic` is specified as their setting. For example, in `ListPlot`, if multiple curves are being displayed, then specifying`PlotMarker->Automatic` results in a different choice of plot marker for each curve. Very often I want to disable this behavior. E.g., I want _all_ the curves produced by a single call to a plotting function to be shown with the same style, same plot marker, etc. How can I do this? NOTE that what I want to do _is not the same thing_ as setting an _explicit_ style, plot marker, etc., to be applied to all the entities. I specifically want to _avoid_ having to choose some style, plot marker, etc! I just want Mathematica to use the same _default_ style, plot marker, etc. ( _whatever those are_ ) for all entities.
