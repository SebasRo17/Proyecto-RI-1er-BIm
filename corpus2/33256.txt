It is easy to define a background color for the SetterBar buttons, so that all the buttons that are not pressed have the specified color, while the pressed one is gray. Here is the example:               SetterBar[2, Range[5], Background -> LightBlue]      in which the buttons that are not pressed are LightBlue. How to make another way around? That is, how to make all buttons gray except the pressed one, which should take a specified color?
