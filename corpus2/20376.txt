I have following code:                 Table[LogLogPlot[         a + 0.017*k + (-0.014*k)*Tanh[(k - 0.25)*b], {k, 0.1, 10}],           {b, {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}}, {a, {1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3}}]      I get then a table of plots and I can click on each of them to save them. But how do I save them all at once into a single PDF? If I instead do:                  GraphicsGrid[          Table[LogLogPlot[            a + 0.017*k + (-0.014*k)*Tanh[(k - 0.25)*b], {k, 0.1, 10}],              {b, {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}}, {a, {1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3}}]]      I cannot right click on the figure to save as some image, but rather have to export it. And I am really not satisfied by the result.               Export["grid1", %, "PDF"]      All axes and fonts are completely squeezed, big and unreadable. ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aiH7P.png) How do I set borders and fonts and all that in an easy manner? The best way would be really being able to right click on the table of plots and save it as it looks like.
