I'm struggling to find the right function in mathematica to isolate specific characters in a string. I have got a formula as string (I imported it from an excelfile) like this: **y = 0.97*x1 + 0.521*x2 - 30.21 - 0.07431*x3 - 0.126*x4 - 0.1939*x5 - 0.361*x6** Now I want to isolate the coefficients, e.g. 0.97,0.521 from the x's and maybe store it seperately, so that I know which coefficients were for which x. I thought this would be easily done and I browsed through the help of mathematica, but I couln't find any example which helps me so far. Maybe some of you can help me out which functions is best for this task?
