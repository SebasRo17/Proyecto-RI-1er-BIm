Being a freelancer, I don't have a luxury of corporate training and a circle of professional employees. Even though I have been programming for the last few years and developed professional projects, but at times I find myself in a place where there is no help. Not even StackOverflow and other related sites can help. Take for instance, Crystal Reports. I am using it for the last few years in my projects. I learned it all by myself, but still I struggle with many issues. I am still not able to improve the performance of reports, not able to design fast and still I am able to use only 30% of the Crystal Report's power. I reside in a city where I can't find freelancers like New York or San Francisco, to hire them for learning. A handful of experts available online are not in my budget. I face the same problem with C# and other technologies. At StackOverflow, you can't keep an expert engaged. After two-or-three comments, he will loose focus of your question and jump to a new question out there. Few people suggested me to look into code written by others to learn fast. But again, how to get my queries answered. There are some aspects where you just can't write it down. You need personal assistance. I think freelancers in US have better choices and flexibility as compared to other countries.
