How can one apply DDD to a EAV database model? Consider this EAV database model: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yVT7q.png) How am I supposed to build a domain model if all my entities and their attributes will be stored in the database? **UPDATE** To help clarify the question I'll give an example. If I'm building a **Store** that is going to sell some **Products** then I'll have 2 entities in my domain model corresponding to them. Now my `Product` entity will normally have a fixed number of attributes (ex: `Product_name`, `sku`, `weight`, etc...). However, in a EAV model entities have a variable number of attributes. How should I write a model for `Product` if each concrete instance of it will have a different number of attributes?
