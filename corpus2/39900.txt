In the last few days, I've heard the term "fast follower" mentioned several times. It's used in the context of an unresolved bug/issue that (supposedly) will be quickly fixed and implemented. Is this some new corporate jargon? I'm aware of a fast follower strategy, or second mover strategy (as described in this wikipedia article), but that doesn't apply in the context.
