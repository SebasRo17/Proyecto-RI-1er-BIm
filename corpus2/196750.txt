Let's say I have 4 (A,B,C,D) parameters with 3 possible values, also 81 unique combinations. With e.g. orthogonal array, I will end up with 9 test cases, each combining 3 pairs. But that means that if one test case fails, I do not know which combination in the test case is faulty, right? Whether values of A,B or A,C or BC. Just wanted to be sure I understood it well. edit: Corrected (thanks GlenH7).
