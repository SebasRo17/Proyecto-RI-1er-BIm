I am trying to solve $\dfrac{\rho\ ((1-b)\ \lambda _f\ \lambda _s\ P _A)^{\rho }}{b-1}+\dfrac{\rho \left(\dfrac{b\ \text{ps}\ x}{1-\text{ps}}\right)^{\rho }}{b}=0$ in terms of $b$, I entered                  Solve[((((b ps x)/(1 - ps))^ρ ρ)/          b + ((-(-1 + b) PA λf λs)^ρ ρ)/(-1 + b)) == 0, b] // Simplify      but `Solve` function results to this message > `!Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve. >>{1]` How can I solve this equation?
