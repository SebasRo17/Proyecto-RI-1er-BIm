I have always had this question in my mind and I would really be happy to get an explanation for this. Is it only me or do you also feel the same way that it's hard to find anything on MS site. For example, every time I need to download .NET framework I have to Google it. You never know what you can download, no category for downloads. You are simply left to a search field. You never know if you downloaded the latest version of the file. The tragically true is that you have to rely on their competitor Google to find anything on their site. I know that they are a big company.   * **But is it really that hard to have an organized way to publish information?**
