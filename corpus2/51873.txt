We have noticed importing data from an Excel spreadsheet doesnâ€™t update links. The problem with this is if you import a spreadsheet that comprises of linked workbooks data and those workbooks have been updated then stale data is retrieved. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SFHa6.png) Opening workbooks using the Excel Object Model does support a parameter to UpdateLinks. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kpJUf.png) Is there an undocumented way to force Mathematica to open spreadsheets and update the links?               Import["c:\\temp\\Exercises.xlsx",{"Sheets","Sheet1"}][[1;;18;;1, 1;;16;;1]];
