When using Rasterize on a Graphics expression composed of many differently coloured Graphics objects memory is allocated in the frontend which is then not released or reused when a similar graphic object is created. Rasterize (or its underlying machinery) is used underneath Export when a graphic object is exported using Export, for instance when creating a jpg file. In the example given 4 MB of memory is allocated each cycle but not freed. Eventually the frontend will crash.               Do[Sleep[3]; img = Rasterize[Graphics[Table[       { ColorData["TemperatureMap"][RandomReal[]], Circle[{RandomReal[], RandomReal[]}, 1.0] },        {1000}]]], {1000}];       Does anyone know if this is a known bug and if there are any workarounds pending a fix from Wolfram?
