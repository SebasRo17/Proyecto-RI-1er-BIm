I got a matrix which looks the following and should be seen as a list of pairs with (x,y) coordinates:               test = {{0, 1, 2, 3}, {11000, 23940., 36880., 49820.}};      I'm trying to plot them with the following command:               ListLinePlot[test, PlotRange -> {{0, 4}, {0, 50000}}]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h4hQj.png) My problem: with the above commands I always get a plot that starts with 1 for the first x-coordinate instead of 0, then takes 2 instead of 1 for the second x-coordinate and so on. All I want is to plot the points exactly as listed in `test`. As if I had a entered a list like `{{1,2,3,4},{11000,23940,36880,49820}}`, which I obviously didn't. Can someone help me?
