What's the coding standard for naming a private method in a language which does not have the private modifier? Specifically, I am talking about Javascript. Below I've placed an underscore at the end of my private method's name, but a colleague told me that underscore is usually for class fields.               var MyClass = Class.create({         initialize: function() {             alert('constructor');         },         publicMethod: function() {             alert('i am public');         },         privateMethod_: function() {             alert('i am private');         }     });
