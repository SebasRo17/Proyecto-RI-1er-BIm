In a similar vein as the Why do many open source projects have no documentation about their design or architecture? question, I'm curious: Why are so many libraries so lacking in end user documentation? My view is this:   1. Most everyone agrees that reading source code is more difficult than writing source code.   2. Without documentation, one must read the library's source code in order to use that library.   3. Therefore, using the undocumented library is more work than just recreating the library from scratch.   4. As a result, if you want to have people use your library, you'd damn well better make sure it's documented. I know lots of developers don't like writing docs, and I'll agree it can be tedious work. But it's essential work. I'd even say it's more important that a library have good documentation than have the best programmer's interface in the world. (People use shitty libraries all the time; few use undocumented libraries) Oh, note that when I say documentation, I mean real documentation. Not Sandcastle/Javadoc/Doxygen boilerplate.
