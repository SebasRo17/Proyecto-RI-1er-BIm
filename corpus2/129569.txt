We use JSF over Tomcat along with a backing proprietary DB. I want to know how the addition of new database fields or/and stored procedures should be handled when we deploy a new version of the application. We deploy by sending a WAR file to the hosting Team, as such our WAR should be able to setup the stored procedure when it starts. What are the possible appropriate strategies to be able to incrementally update the database?
