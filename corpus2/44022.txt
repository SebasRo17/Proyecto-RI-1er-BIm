I have been trying to customize the frame ticks and frame label around a certain contour plot and am running into very strange behavior where the graphics will get cut off by `ImageSize` rather than being resized. In the following example code (more or less minimal), note that all I have changed is a `0` to `0.` in the frametick specification. What's going on here? Minimal example:               ContourPlot[θ1 + θ2 == 0, {θ1, -3 π/2, π/2}, {θ2, -π/2, 3 π/2},      FrameTicks -> {{{0, π}, None}, {{-π, 0.}, None}},       FrameLabel -> {"\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(θ\), \(1\)]\)", "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(θ\), \(2\)]\)"},       BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 20}, ImageSize -> 200]          ContourPlot[θ1 + θ2 == 0, {θ1, -3 π/2, π/2}, {θ2, -π/2, 3 π/2},      FrameTicks -> {{{0, π}, None}, {{-π, 0}, None}},       FrameLabel -> {"\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(θ\), \(1\)]\)", "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(θ\), \(2\)]\)"},       BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 20}, ImageSize -> 200]      ![input and output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gue4h.png)
