I have an external program saving files to some directory on my hard disc. I'd like to run a script that imports and runs a script on each file as it is added to the directory. Is there a simple way to do this using `Dynamic`? Is it necessary to use `Refresh`? For example, I'd like to be able to save a series of text files to a directory (with arbitrary names) and then print the contents in near real-time.
