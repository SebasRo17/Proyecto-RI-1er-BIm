Suppose I define               f[x] := Piecewise[{{1.7*10^-6, 150 <= x <= 200}}, 0]      and then plot               Plot[Evaluate[f[x]], {x, 0, 1000}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Thick},          ExclusionsStyle -> {Dashed, Red}]      I get an interrupted dashed vertical line on left ![Plot of Piecewise function with Exclusion dashed line missing](http://i.stack.imgur.com/B7SlY.png) Anyone know why this happens and how to draw the entire dashed line?
