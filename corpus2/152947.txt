I'm developing an iOS app, which is a prototype for a customer. They're expecting it to not be of production standard and are happy for a few rough edges here and there. Since this is my first commercial venture into iOS / Objective C (I'm an android developer that is trying to cross-train into iOS), my primary focus has been learning the Objective C language and how to develop the app, and I have not invested any time into learning how TDD can be applied in this environment. My question is, even for prototypes, should you still try to apply TDD and create unit tests?
