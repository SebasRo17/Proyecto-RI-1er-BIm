I built a prototype ("one to throw away") a while ago, and I'm rebuilding it now as an alpha. My goodness, it's been worth it. I reused some of the prototype code by copy-pasting then modifying it, but I've fallen into a pattern of looking at the prototype for guidance, but writing the new code from scratch. This doesn't take too long for me because I'm a pretty fast touch-typist. Right now I'm rebuilding a complex function, and I'm actually reading it line- by-line and typing equivalent code into my alpha version. I find it's better than copy-paste-refactor because I get reacquainted with the logic, and I don't miss parts of the code when I'm reading it. Is there a name for this kind of reuse? Any authoritative commentary on its benefits/drawbacks?
