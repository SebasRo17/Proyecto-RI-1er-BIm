Rails, to me, seems like a perfect level of abstraction for most types of web development. However, having watched some seasoned Rails consultants build an application, I'm finding that they use Gems to an extent that it's often pretty difficult to figure out what's going on in the code. As an intermediate-level Rails developer, I've had a pretty hard time digging through their code to figure out how things work, and I'm really struggling to see the payoff of this approach. So is it me, or does Rails, by dint of the fact that it has such a vibrant community of contributors, kind of encourage over-abstraction?
