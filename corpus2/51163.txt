I was recently reading the following paper on visualization techniques using ellipses to gain statistical insights. Elliptical visualization for looking at correlations has briefly been touched on this board as well. Elliptical Insights: Understanding Statistical Methods through Elliptical Geometry. There are a couple of plots in the paper on quickly plotting correlations between complex data that I found quite useful and would like to replicate them. Having a function to visualize complex correlations would be useful to a lot of folksâ€¦ However, my skills in MMA are lacking a bit... ![Scatterplot Matrices showing data, 68% data ellipses and regression lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XJz6R.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lnsY4.png)
