I asked this question in different form and because I couldn't receive the proper answer so I have to change my question.I know that was my fault sorry.I need to change the Matrix Data of nodes and edges in the graph. How can I do that on the graph itself by clicking on each node?               Graph[{"Uppsala" -> "Marsta", "Marsta" -> "Uppsala", "UpplandsVasby" -> "Sollentuna", "Sollentuna" -> "UpplandsVasby",        "UpplandsVasby" -> "Marsta", "Marsta" -> "UpplandsVasby",        "Stockholm" -> "Boo", "Boo" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Lidingo", "Lidingo" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Sollentuna", "Sollentuna" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Taby", "Taby" -> "Stockholm"},EdgeWeight -> RandomInteger[{10, 100}, 14]       VertexLabels -> "Name"]
