I know that a plugin for Visual Studio exists. However i can't afford VS so i'm looking for a free alternative which can be used to code TypeScript and aware of the .d.ts definition files and can do code completion based on them. I know that Sublime Text and VIM can do syntax highlighting with the correct language definition file. However the biggest advantage of Typescript for me is that ability to give code assistance while coding. Are you aware of any editor which can do this? I'm interested even if it's in an experimental state.
