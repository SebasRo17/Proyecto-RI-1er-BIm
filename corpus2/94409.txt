I just completed a B.S. in Computer Science from a less-than-reputable college, and I am having trouble finding a job. Looking around for ways to find a job, I came across an institute that teaches system administration. Their claim is that, after finishing the course, I will be in a much better position than "normal" Java programmers and my salary will grow "exponentially". I don't buy that claim, but additionally, he kept saying that this course will help me choose jobs in country of my choice as there are very less people available in this particular domain. When asked why the salary grows "exponentially", he drew an analogy where he said it was "for the same reasons heart specialists are paid more than orthodontists". This is because the job profile will be maintaining important data and make sure that availability of the systems which is very critical in fields like health care and Banking (I am not sure about this claim). My whole point is, I am very interested in programming. Will taking a course in systems administration help me at all? Are any of the claims he's made reflective of reality?
