Can you guys recommends which books are best, to learn what's taught at most undergraduate and graduate computer science programs. Specially by the specific areas (like AI, Software Engineering, etc). I'm very interested in learning everything i can. And i hope this help other people that are interested like me. Thanks for any help you can give - i really appreciate it.
