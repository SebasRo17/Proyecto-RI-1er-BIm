I am still learning python and I started with Python 3. This question not Python 2 vs 3 or difference between them like print() is a function and not language construct and 3/2 = 1.5 My question is even if it is still python, what was the need of introduce something new which is not backward compatible, when -   1. Syntax is the same   2. Language philosophy is the same (import this) Uh .. To confuse millions developers out there, no definitely not. I know switching between two will not be that difficult, but as I don't understand internals, Python 3 is definitely have to do with Python's future. **Edit** \- Lets say all the popular packages are ported to Python 3, does that mean we no longer need Python 2
