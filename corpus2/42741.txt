I have defined the following function in _Mathematica_ to get a SET OF `m` SETS (these sets are the codes `{p,q,d,e,n}` for the encryption system `RSA`.):               RSA[m_] :=        Table[          Module[{prime, p, q, k, factors, d, e, n,ans},                 prime = RandomPrime[{2, 10^2}, 2]; p = prime[[1]]; q = prime[[2]];                k = (p - 1)*(q - 1) + 1; factors = FactorInteger[k];                 d = RandomChoice[factors][[1]]; e = k/d; n = p*q;                 ans = {p, q, d, e, n}; ans],         {i, 1, m}];      The problem is that although it is not very probable, these sets can be repeated, and I would like to avoid this case, but I have no idea. I have tried using the _Mathematica_ function `Union`, in which reapeted sets wouldn't be included, but I don't know how to add more in order to get just m elements (sets).
