Running PiecewiseExpand[expr, assum] does not work with all kind of assumptions. For example, the following line will not split the expression with absolute values in the chambers, considering m1=m2. Why is it so? How can I allow arbitrary asumptions, in particular setting some of the entries equal to others, and some greater than others?               PiecewiseExpand[-Abs[m1 - m2] - Abs[m2 - m3] - Abs[m1 - m3] +         n/2*(Abs[m1] + Abs[m2] + Abs[m3]), {m1 \[Element] Reals,         m2 \[Element] Reals, m3 \[Element] Reals,         m1 == m2 >= m3}] // FullSimplify      Thank you.
