I noticed that overtime with experience that the curve of learning shifts from trying to learn a language or technology (the way it works) to how to develop applications faster and with less code. I am very interested to see how other developers have minimized the time it takes to get applications to market. I know for a fact that by learning just one thing it can save you a ton of time. For example I started learning lambda expressions and code that normally took 3 lines now only takes 1 and is alot faster to type. Another angle is shortcuts and tools in an IDE itself. For instance I can't believe I didn't know how to remove unused using statements from my source code so I used to do it manually until I found out there was a tool in VS for removing them. Are there any resources for learing faster ways of developing applications? Keyboard Shortcuts, tools, programs, references? Is there like a reference where one can learn these things? If not can you please share how you learned some of these tips? **NOTE:** This question is geared towards .NET, C# and the Visual Studio IDE
