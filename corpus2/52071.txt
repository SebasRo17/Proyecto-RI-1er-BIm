Sometimes I end up writing unit test cases for the code other developers have written .There are occasions when I really didn't know what the developer was trying to do (the business part) and just manipulated the test case to get the green line . Are these things normal in the industry ? What is the normal trend ? Are the developers who wrote the code supposed to write the unit test cases ?
