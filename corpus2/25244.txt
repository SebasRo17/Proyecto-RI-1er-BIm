The following is a well-known Bessel function identity: $$J_{-n}(z)=(-1)^n J_n(z),\qquad n\in\mathbb Z$$ To check this, I used the following code and the result is as what I expected.               In[2]:= FullSimplify[(-1)^n*BesselJ[n, z] == BesselJ[-n, z], n ∈ Integers]     Out[2]= True      The problem is that _Mathematica_ does not return zero when I try to simplify the following expression: $$(-1)^n J_{n}(z)-J_{-n}(z),\qquad n\in\mathbb Z$$ I tried the following code, but the output is as complex as the input:               In[3]:= FullSimplify[(-1)^n*BesselJ[n, z] - BesselJ[-n, z], n ∈ Integers]     Out[3]= -BesselJ[-n, z] + (-1)^n BesselJ[n, z]    (*result I expected : 0*)      My goal is to command _Mathematica_ to reduce the expression to zero, and I need some advice.
