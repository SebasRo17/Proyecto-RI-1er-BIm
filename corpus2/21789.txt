I am quite new to _Mathematica_ and not completely familiar with functional programming. I am currently working with a function (call it foo) and wish to change its behaviour, for example, by adding 1 to its output. Obviously writing               foo = (foo[#]+1)&;      or               foo[x_] := foo[x] + 1;      leads to an infinite recursion as soon as I try to evaluate the function. To be more explicit, if at the beginning `foo[1]` returns 1 and `foo[2]` returns 3, I would like the output to be 2 and 4 respectively after the change. Is there any way to easily obtain this behaviour with _Mathematica_? I apologize if the question is a duplicate, but I did not find anything similar already posted.
