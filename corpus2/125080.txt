The importance of TDD needs to be propagated but there's always a gap in the project timeline and time needed for developing a TDD project. Customers usually do not understand the importance of code maintenance or TDD and want the project to be finished as soon as possible. The result would be a Test After Development which would be very basic minimal tests to please the coverage tools and let the project analyzers have a great Graph. Do projects developed using TDD take longer, or is that just an unfounded fear?
