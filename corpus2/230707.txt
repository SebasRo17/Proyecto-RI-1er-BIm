I'm trying to run some code though Valgrind. The code depends on OpenSSL, and OpenSSL is making Valgrind useless due to uninitialised values. I know where the use lies in OpenSSL's PRNG, but I'm getting hundreds more at the moment. I'd like to try an run a tool over the OpenSSL sources that initializes values. So:               int* p;     int n;      is changed to:               int* p = NULL;     int n = 0;      **Question** : Is anyone aware of a tool to perform bulk initialization on declarations of primitives? I'm more than happy to perform an un-needed initialization and have the optimizer remove it later. That's the optimizers job. For completeness, "speed" has never been a top concern for me. I'm more interested in "correctness" and assuring it. To me, it does not matter how fast someone arrives at the answer if its wrong.
