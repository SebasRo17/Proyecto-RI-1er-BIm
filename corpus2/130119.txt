The following principles of Agile development makes it look like Agile is mostly suited for services companies:   * Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software   * Welcome changing requirements, even late in development   * Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)   * Working closely with the client. Often this involves a client representative to be a part of the development team.    * Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location) My question is: Is Agile exclusively suited for service oriented companies or do even product development companies (including web based companies) benefit from Agile techniques?
