Suppose I have a service which requires to _seek_ the database for different data once and in a while. For this I have 2 or 3 SSE, each one with a different _retry_ basetime (20000 miliseconds, 1000 miliseconds...). **What I'd like to know is if websockets can handle different "data type" accordingly to the request** , for example, could I create **one** websocket to handle a notification system, a chat system, a group system instead of separated **_SSEs_** and treat data differently with javascript? And if so, would it be of higher interest (performance) than actually performing different queries to the server through different _SSEs_? If this is possible then would it be bad design to create multiple sockets for each service here?
