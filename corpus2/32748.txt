data = Sort[RandomReal[{0, 1}, {100, 2}]];     Manipulate[pt, {pt, data}, ControlType -> Slider2D]      I get a error message: > Manipulate::vstype: ControlType -> Slider2D is not supported for the > variable specification Is there a workaround? What I'm trying to achieve is something like this               {Slider2D[Dynamic[pt1], {{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {0.5, 0.5}}], Dynamic[pt1]}      here pt1 can take from               {{0, 0}, {0, 0.5}, {0, 1}, {0.5, 0}, {0.5, 0.5}, {0.5, 1}, {1, 0}, {1,0.5}, {1, 1}}      . Now I want to use my own `data`, which may contain points that are not equally space.
