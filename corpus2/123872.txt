I know it's a very big question to ask :), I'm just asking out of curiosity. Is it possible for someone to build a phone OS? Can someone guide me through this please. For example, how to choose a H/W and how should you test your code, is it possible buy some device (eg HTC) and just try the code with it? The good thing here is Linux Kernel is there so one won't start from scratch.
