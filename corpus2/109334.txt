I work in an organization which creates many integrated systems products - i.e. it is complete products with mechanical/system/electronics/software being designed and manufactured. At the moment most teams are organized around projects in a cross functional way. The advantage of an organization like this is that people who are working closely together for a common goal are close. The disadvantages come from the isolation of engineers from their peers. Typically a project is assigned only one software engineer. This means that the projects have a high truck factor, minimal knowledge sharing and best practices, and technical development is limited. So my question is: are there any studies comparing the cost/benefits of these two approaches?
