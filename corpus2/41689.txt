Here's a math problem that I would like to solve. This is also my first time posting on the Mathematica stackexchange website so please excuse me if this looks messy. Let               a = {{a11, a12, a13}, {0, a22, a23}, {0, 0, a33}};     b = {{b11, b12, b13}, {0, b22, b23}, {0, 0, b33}};     c = {{c11, c12, c13}, {0, c22, c23}, {0, 0, c33}};     d = {{d11, d12, d13}, {0, d22, d23}, {0, 0, d33}};     r = {{r11, r12, r13}, {0, r22, r23}, {0, 0, r33}};     s = {{s11, s12, s13}, {0, s22, s23}, {0, 0, s33}};     u = {{1, u12, u13}, {0, 1, u23}, {0, 0, 1}};       Consider               MatrixForm[Expand[u.a.Inverse[u]]]     MatrixForm[Expand[u.b.Inverse[u]]]     MatrixForm[Expand[u.c.Inverse[u]]]     MatrixForm[Expand[u.d.Inverse[u]]]     MatrixForm[Expand[u.r.Inverse[u]]]     MatrixForm[Expand[u.s.Inverse[u]]]      I would like to find an invariant polynomial in the entries of $a,b,c,d,r$, and/or $s$ such that at least one of its monomials is divisible by the $(1,3)$-entry of $a,b,c,d,r$ and/or $s$. For example, consider the polynomial $(a11-a22)c12-(c11-c22)a12$. Then under the u-action, this polynomial becomes $(a11-a22)(c12 + (c22 - c11) u12) - (c11-c22)(a12 + (a22 - a11) u12)$, which simplifies to $(a11-a22)c12-(c11-c22)a12. So (a11-a22)c12-(c11-c22)a12$ is a polynomial in the entries of $a$ and $c$ such that at least one of its monomials is divisible by the $(1,2)$-entry of $a$ or $c$. By the way, I tried:               Simplify[(c11 - c33) (a13) - (a11 - a33) (c13) + c12 a23 - a12 c23 ]       by guessing and checking (which is not an invariant polynomial) but is there a systematic way to use mathematica to help me find such polynomials?
