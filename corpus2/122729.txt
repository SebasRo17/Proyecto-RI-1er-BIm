Our shop has a TeamCity server that produces deployment packages. The packages are either ASP.NET web apps, Windows services, or miscellaneous binaries (that just get copied to the network somewhere). The packages are all simple zip files. This is all working fine but right now the act of deploying involves a developer manually unzipping the package and copying it to the right place, starting/stopping Windows services if necessary, dealing with synchronization processes to push files to all servers in a web farm, etc. I'm working on figuring out the best way to automate all this. There is a new tool called Octopus which looks to be exactly what we need. However, for various reasons (cost, immaturity of product), we can't use it. At the other end of the spectrum, obviously I could script all this out with MSBuild. But what are my other options? Are there tools similar to Octopus out there? Are there open source equivalents? How are other shops solving this?
