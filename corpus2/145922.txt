I was wondering if I can use a Python script to test a C program automatically. Suppose I have a very simple C program which reads data (numbers as test cases) from the console, calculates them, then outputs it to the console. Now I want to read data from a file then output whatever the program outputs into a file. Suppose in the original C program I use `while` loop and`scanf` to read two numbers into two variables `a` and `b` for several times and do different calculations according to the values of `a` and `b`, like this:               if(a>4 && a<10){...}     else if(a>=10){...}      Now can I use a Python script to test the program automatically? And do I need to modify my C program? How? EDIT: If any method is permitted, then what is the best way to test the C program automatically without using frameworks?
