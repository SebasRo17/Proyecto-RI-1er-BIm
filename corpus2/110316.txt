The SQL92 and SQL99 standards define `CREATE DOMAIN` DDL constructs. Not all databases support this, or have a different name for it (SQL Server has User Defined Types, for example). These allow one to define a constrained data-type to be used in their database, to simplify and enforce rules pertaining to the allowed values. Such a data-type could be used in column declarations, in inputs and outputs to stored procedures and functions etc... I would like to know:   * Do people actually use domains in their database designs?   * If so to what extent?   * How useful are they?    * What pitfalls have you encountered? I am trying to asses the viability of using these in future database development.
