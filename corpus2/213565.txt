There is a simple system, that allows users to do 4 things: ADD, EDIT, DELETE, PRINT data. I am due to model it (I'm entirely new to UML activity diagrams) and from notation, I dont understand whether a decision node can have more than 3 inputs? It should be, otherwise how would I do that. Anyway, the user can perform the action and do it again, so there is a loop needed. But the merge node is said to have only one output, which would not be the case. The picture should be clear what I mean. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7FqtI.png)
