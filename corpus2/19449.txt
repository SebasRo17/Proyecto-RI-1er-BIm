I have been developing Windows GUI applications since many years and jumped into .NET in early 2005. .NET is a undoubtedly a remarkable platform and I am still using it, but with a variety of technologies out there, I don't want to remain dedicated to this camp. I want to learn new languages with which I can develop GUI applications. I am learning Ruby and just installed Python. I read about WxRuby, a framework for developing Windows GUI app. in Ruby. I am searching for a similar framework for Python. Apart from that I want to know which language is more suitable for a production-level GUI app. I doubt that Ruby is more focused on Web platform with it's glamor, Ruby on Rails. I know that I may not get those rich .NET classes and that impressive Visual Studio IDE, but still I want to follow the road less traveled. I don't want to go with IronPython and IronRuby, however sometime later, I may dip hands to explore them.
