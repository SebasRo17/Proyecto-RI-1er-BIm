I have been programming java for like a year or more, and i have always used the `this` and `super` keywords. And yesterday my mate read one source of mine, and told me not to over use it unless you are overriding the method.               class A extends JPanel {          public A {              super.setSize(400, 400);// instead of not using super keyword          }     }      But what he meant on how to use it, is this:               class A extends JPanel {         public A {             super.setSize(4,4);         }              public void setSize(int a, int b) {}     }      So the language will know that your constructor calls the parent method and not local. Should i only use the the keywords in this situation only or use the keywords everywhere for better readibly? I know that `this` keyword is returning the whole local instance including the parent and all of its parents and interfaces. And the `super` keyword returns the instance of the parent class and all of its instances (parents and interfaces). But my question is, should you always use these keywords?
