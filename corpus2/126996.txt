I'm a bit of a neat freak and tend to keep my projects by cleaning references and using in each class to keep only what's actually used. What other argument could I make (besides calming my OCD nerve) of keeping to the essentials? I'm thinking mostly system references, any reference to custom work will bring its lot of backward compatibility issues. Is the release footprint bigger? Compile time longer?
