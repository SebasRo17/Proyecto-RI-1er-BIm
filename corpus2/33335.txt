I've got data of the type:               list = {"Class","MW","10 - 11"}      which I would like to split into a number of lists based on the number of characters in the second list element. In the above case, the desired output would be:               newlists = {{"Class","M","10-11"},{"Class","W","10-11"}}      `StringSplit[list[[2]],""]` gets me in the right direction (the string I want to split will always be in the same position in the list); however, I don't know how to thread this new sublist through the original list.
