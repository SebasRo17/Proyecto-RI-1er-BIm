I've been contracting for about 3 years now. I am currently a contractor for a web firm. This is a hourly position. I want to find larger projects. I had read that some people are able to only do one or two jobs a year and be set on that. I want those types of jobs, and I want to hire people to take on these jobs as well, but I have no idea where to start. I highly doubt places like odesk post these types of contracts. Where can I find them? How can I make good money and live comfortably while working for myself?
