Could someone please explain quite clearly the difference between a port and a socket. I know that a port serves as a door into the network for an application process and that the application process uses a socket connection to the given port number to handle network communication but when you have multiple processes listening on a single port number, I am finding it difficult to understand the difference between the socket and the port and how they all fit together.
