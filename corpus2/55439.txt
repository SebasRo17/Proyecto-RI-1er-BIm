I am trying to solve a nonlinear programming problem using FindMinimum solver on Mathematica. When I execute, it is printing FindMinimum::eit: "The algorithm does not converge to the tolerance of 4.806217383937354`*^-6 in 500 iterations. The best estimated solution, with feasibility residual, KKT residual, or complementary residual of {0.00499384,0.00461499,2.68875*10^-6}, is returned" Can we still use this solution for when I calculate one of the constraints using printed data, it is outside the defined range?
