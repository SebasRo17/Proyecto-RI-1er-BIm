I want to align my plots like I did with `Gird[]`. But you cracks here are using these short forms all the time. So, is there a way to achive this result in a better way? Here 's my code:               plots = DateListPlot[CountryData[#, {"Population", {1800, 2020}}],           PlotLabel -> "population of " <> #,ImageSize->250] & /@ {"Poland", "Austria",          "Switzerland", "India"};          GraphicsGrid[{{plots[[1]], plots[[2]]}, {plots[[3]], plots[[4]]}},       ImageSize -> 500]      With this I'll get ![The result I get with <code>Grid\[\]</code>](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uZhcJ.png) But I want to do something like this               GraphicsColumn@plots      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SsKYH.png) I don't like the column but I hope there's a way my code could look like this. Thanks to Kuba's comment this part of my question is answered: "And btw, is there a way to change the `ImageSize` here?"
