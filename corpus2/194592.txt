We have a function that modifies a JS object, by adding some custom properties to it. The function doesn't return antyhing               addTransaction: function (obj) {          obj.transactionId = this.getTransactionId;          obj.id = this.recordId;     },      Somebody said they preferred that `addTransaction` return the `obj`. Here's what I thought   * If I don't return anything (and document that the object is going to be modified), it's kind of clear that the object is going to be modified, as if the name were addTransactionToObj   * If I do want to add a return value, I shouldn't modify the incoming object, I should clone the given object, add my properties to the clone and return the clone.   * Having a return value that just returns one of the (modified) parameter just sounds wrong Does anybody have a preference in this matter?
