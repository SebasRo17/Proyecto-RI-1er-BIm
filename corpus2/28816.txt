Robert Raguet-Schofield in the Mathematica Blog introduced a way to import tweets from Twitter into _Mathematica_. I attempted to use this method. I started with this line of code:               xml = Import["https://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline.xml?screen_name=WolframResearch"]      and received this message: > FetchURL::httperr: The request to URL > https://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline.xml?screen_name=WolframResearch > was not successful. The server returned the HTTP status code 404 ("Not > Found"). Then I tried this               xml = Import["https://twitter.com/WolframResearch"]a      and this time I got some output. But when I continue the procedure to extract the tweets with this line               tweets = Cases[xml, XMLElement["text", _, {s_String}] :> s, âˆž]      I get an empty set. How can I import tweets into _Mathematica_ in an effective way, given I am not a familiar with Apachi?
