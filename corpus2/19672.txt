The Stirling number of the second kind is the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ objects into $k$ non-empty subsets. In Mathematica, this is implemented as `StirlingS2`. How can I enumerate all the sets? Ideally I would like to get a list of lists, where each list contains $k$ lists. The question Partition a set into subsets of size k seems relevant.
