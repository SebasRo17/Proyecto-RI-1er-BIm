I was researching on how is the "Shuffle mode" in music players implemented and what is the algorithm behind this. How it makes sure that any songs won't repeat? What's the most efficient algorithm for doing this?   * **Added on 2014-Apr-23:** The Fischer-Yates Shuffle Algorithm is the simplest algorithm for Shuffling. This blogpost titled "The Art of Shuffling Music" explains another algorithm with illustrations.
