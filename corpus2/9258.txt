`Graphics3D[]` objects created with BSpline functions will not export to 3DS format, which only supports the more basic primitives. Is there any straightforward way to get at an underlying polygon representation of the `BSplineSurface[]` graphics "primitive" (in quotes because its not very primitive)? An example is the final 'pipe' example in the documentation ref/BSplineSurface. If you try `Export["Pipe.3ds", %]`, you get an error. In my particular case I'm creating arbitrary 'surface of revolution' objects as per the "Potter's Wheel" demonstration, where the cross section is determined by a BSpline with dynamic control points. That works fine, but then I need export the resulting objects to another program.
