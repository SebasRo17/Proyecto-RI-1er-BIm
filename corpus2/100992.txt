I have a following problem i want to solve efficiently : Input: Set s of {Pass,Fail}^k vectors, m - minimum percent of vectors Output : Set of Sets of indexes: Where each set Contains indexes of Pass word in given vectors, and number of vectors that contains Pass in those indexes is over m percent from total vectors. Example: {(Pass,Fail,Pass,Fail),(Pass,Fail,Pass,Pass)} where k is 4 and number of set elements is 2 and m 60% , output will be {{0,2},{0},{2}} The output is group of sets where every set contains vector indexes that for at least 60% of vectors value was Pass
