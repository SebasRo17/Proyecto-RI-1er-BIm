We know some signature/checksum methods for text, like md5,sha. Now, I want to compute a checksum for a matrix, to represent the exact matrix. Say, two matrixes with different sizes, or with different values, have different checksum. And slightly different matrixes(same size) result in slightly different checksum. So, both layout and values should be considered. Although the most intuitive method is to compare two matrixes directly, however, sometimes it's inconvenient to get the two matrixes in the same environment. Maybe I should check the md5 algorithm, and adapt a similar method. Just post it here for better advices.
