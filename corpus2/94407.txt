Some mobile applications leverage the fact that smart phones have motion sensitivity to provide a "shake" feature. For example, I believe Urban Spoon has an app with which you can view a recommendation for a nearby restaurant; if you don't like the recommendation then you can shake your phone and it will immediately come up with another one. Is there a **word** for this new interface pattern/idiom/convention (or whatever you want to call it)?
