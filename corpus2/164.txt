Is there any way in Mathematica to find out the currently free memory on the system Mathematica runs on (like the utility `free` shows on the command line)? I've found out functions to show the memory occupied by Mathematica itself, but of course there are also other programs running on the system, taking their share of memory, so that number is not sufficient to estimate the free memory. The background is that currently if I do something which might fill up my memory (and I don't forget to do it), I call `free` by hand, subtract a safety margin, and then use `MemoryConstrained` in order to prevent the memory to get completely filled up (with quite unpleasant consequences). I'd like to automate that. While I certainly could call `free` from Mathematica and parse its output for the number, I'd like to avoid that if I can (who knows if the next system update makes subtle changes to `free` and then the parsing fails to give the correct number).
