When I read a book or article about something new, I have two main concerns:   1. Retaining the new knowledge I just acquired   2. Being able to access the new knowledge efficiently later on What are some methods you folks use to annotate what you learn? I recently read _Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ and one of the things I'm trying out is making notes from books in mind-map format. Another method I'm trying out is tagging important passages in books with labels such as: definition, feature, remember, usage, caveat... It's too early to tell how these will work for me, but I'd like to know what works for you and how you use it. There are other questions asking what tools people use, but I think process is more important than the tool, so that's what I'd like to learn about.
