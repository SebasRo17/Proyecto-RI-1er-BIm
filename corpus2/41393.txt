**Note: This is a version 9.0.0 problem that is fixed in 9.0.1.** * * * I want to generate a simple 3D view of some frequencies for two variables. I have the counts in a 4x3 matrix, say. This is my bar chart code:               BarChart3D[      Map[Labeled[#, Text[Style[#, Black, Opacity[1.], Bold, 20]],          Above] &, {{1, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 2}, {2, 1, 0}, {0, 2, 1}}, {2}],      ChartLayout -> "Grid",      BarSpacing -> Large,      ChartElements -> Graphics3D[Cylinder[]],      ChartStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.3]],      AxesLabel -> {None, None, None},      Ticks -> {{{1/2, "Del"}, {2, "Nor"}, {2 + 3/2, "Amp"}},        {{1/2, "Osteo"}, {1.75, "Ewing"}, {3, "Rhabdo"}, {4.25,           "Neuro"}}, {0, 1, 2}},      ViewPoint -> {1.3`, -2.4`, 2.`}      ]      And this is what I got with _Mathematica_ 9.0 (more precisely, 9.0.0.0 Mac OS X.) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JfX39.png)   * First, for readability, I want to place a label in each column. But as you can see, zeroes are not displayed. How can I get BarChart3D to plot my zeros? Or probably better, to draw a flat disk in corresponding place.   * (Not as important) Notice how I placed the ticks for the _x_ and _y_ axes. The matrix is 4x3, so I don't understand where those positions come from (the ones I had to use to put the labels - see `Ticks` above). My guess is that my positions are probably wrong, although visually seem ok for now. Help would be much appreciated. **Update** As workaround for zeros, I put a `If[#==0,0.01,Labeled[...]]` in `Map` and displays ok. Still, I am intrigued on how to position tick labels correctly, with `Ticks` or some other option.
