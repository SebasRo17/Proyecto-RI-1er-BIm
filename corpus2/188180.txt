First off, I know this is a question asked by MANY other programmers before me. But I couldn't find any useable resource that could help me. Well, I'm creating an programming language called "Light" the syntax is comparable to python but it has an strict object-orientated concept. I have made an interpreter ( in C++ ) for this language yet, my problem is how to turn this into an executeable. ( Or simply: how do I make an compiler ? ) Thanks for your attention P.S.: I've found some links to a very old tutorial but it is in Pascal... EDIT: Well, well. Now I have found a suitable tutorial for C++. About the project: There have been some changes. Now the language is called "Q." ( kju Dot ).
