When applying for a position such as a software developer for a company, what does an interviewer notice **most** on my resume concerning the work i have done? Is he/she concerned with the amount of work i do with others(Open source projects), The specific accomplishments I've made in my field(programs, apps) or the amount of time i spend helping others(forums, mentoring)? For those of you who have applied and work/worked in a position similar to a software developer,In your personal experience, what do you think helped you the most in landing the job? P.s. if 'software developer' is to broad a term, i would specifically enjoy working with teams to create large applications such as dropbox / google / skype etc...
