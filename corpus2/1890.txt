What is the best practice, most commonly accepted naming conventions for private variables in C#?   1. `private int myInteger;`   2. `private int MyInteger;`   3. `private int mMyInteger;`   4. `private int _myInteger;`   5. `private int _MyInteger;`   6. Mysterious other option Which do you use and why? (My company is fairly new to C# and I would like to pick the most "industry accepted" method to try and get into our coding standard.)
