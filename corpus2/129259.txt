I really enjoy watching live code demos, especially when time is focused on what the code is doing instead of what the presenter is typing. Many seem to be using apps to manage their clipboard to paste code into the IDE. What apps are out there for skillfully managing your clipboard to seamlessly do a code demo? UPDATE: I found this app that Apple engineers use called _DemoMonkey_. It's actually an OS X app demo for, ironically enough, the clipboard and system services. The link includes the source so creating a PC equivalent would be easy, is there really nothing out there?
