I have this expression               -0.433284-0.758719 x+0.00289158 x^2-0.443672 y+0.00149027 y^2      I want to express it in terms of $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2}$$. Using Solve gave me a big mess:               Solve[-0.433284-0.758719 xP+0.00289158 xP^2-0.443672 yP+0.00149027 yP^2==(xP-h)^2/b^2+(yP-k)^2/a^2,{a,b,h,k}]      ![Solve](http://i.stack.imgur.com/s4VFs.png) What can I do to get it in the form I wanted?
