I defined a function `funloglogplot` to make a loglogplot of a function (`function1`) depending on several variables               funloglogplot[function1_, xmin_, xmax_, numpoints_] :=        Module[{list1, listRe, listIm},              list1 = {#1, function1[eps1, 1, #1, R1ideal, R2, ordre]}& /@               logspace[xmin, xmax, numpoints];              listRe = {#1[[1]], Re[#1[[2]]]}& /@ list1;              listIm = {#1[[1]], -Im[#1[[2]]]}& /@ list1;              ListLogLogPlot[{listRe, listIm}, Joined -> True]              ]      Nevertheless I would like to be able to choose the variables I am using for the plot (in this case I plot `function1` as a function of its 3rd argument and I would like to be able to select the argument).   Can anyone see a solution?
