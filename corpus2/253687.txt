I have a class `SuperClass` with two subclasses `SubClassA` and `SubClassB`. I have a method in a different class which takes a `SuperClass` parameter. The method should do different things depending on the type of the object it receives. To illustrate:               public void doStuff(SuperClass object){         // if the object is of type SubClassA, do something.         // if it's of type SubClassB, do something else.     }      I want to avoid type-checking (i.e. `instanceof`) because it doesn't feel like proper OO design. But I can't figure out how to employ Polymorphism to elegantly solve this problem. How can I solve this problem elegantly?
