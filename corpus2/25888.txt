I thought I did okay in the interviews but apparently the interviewers didn't think so. Is it appropriate to ask for a reason after I have received the rejection email? After all I don't want to annoy the HR person. I am a student, so not so much job hunting experience so far. Bear with me if this question sounds stupid.
