Suppose you are a programmer in your mid-20's who has had several years industrial experience working for both big tech and a few internet startups but now you'd like to try contracting in the hope you'll be able to choose more interesting and varied work and be able to have a few months off between jobs to focus on things like open source, travelling and developing your own startup ideas. Now this is possibly one of those 'grass is greener' daydreams.. Even if in the workplace you manage to have the enthusiasm and skill to work equally alongside much more experienced co-workers, how realistic do you think it would be for someone with too few years of experience to appear 'specialist' or 'experienced' to compete for contracts and afford to live this lifestyle?
