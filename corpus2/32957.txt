I know it's possible to programmatically change options on the selection in a notebook. I'd like to create a button that lets me change the style of a cell. It's a style that doesn't have a keyboard shortcut, "ItemParagraph" Something like               SetOptions[NotebookSelection[SelectedNotebook[]], CellStyle->"ItemParagraph"]      but CellStyle is for NotebookFind. Is there some way to do this? I just couldn't find the cell option I needed. I checked the Options for Cell but there are hundreds and I couldn't see anything that looked right...
