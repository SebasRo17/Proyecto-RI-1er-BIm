I have decent knowledge of php, i.e., I can take a framework, read its code and if the docs are adequate, understand what its doing. Main reason for that is that php is actually a very easy language which is literally made for web- dev.   I have been trying to learn django for a week now, can knock up a basic app with it, but there are just too many things which go over my head, i.e, look like magic, reason for that , i think is that the whole interaction with the server thing is part of django, which is all handled by your server in php, I want to read more about this part, i.e. what all topics should i cover to 'get' this. please suggest some books too
