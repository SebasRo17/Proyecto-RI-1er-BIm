I am creating a pair of apps, one to run preferably on tablets, but also laptops and PCs, and the other for WP8. These apps are complementary - having one is of no use without the other. I know there is a Windows Store, and a Windows Phone store, so one would be released on one, and one on the other. My question is: as these apps are useless by themselves (although in most cases it won't be the same people running both apps), will there be a problem with offering these useless-when-used-alone apps? IOW: Person A will use the Windows 8 app to interact with some people that have the WP8 app installed; those with the WP8 app will interact with a person or people who have the Windows 8 app installed. What I'm worried about is if these apps go through a certification process where they must be useful "standalone" - is that the case?
