I am currently working with a weighted adjacency matrix for a directed graph, and it contains several 0 columns and rows. With the unaltered matrix, I am able to monitor the relations between vertices with,               TableForm[Normal @ WeightedAdjacencyMatrix[graph],          TableHeadings -> {a = VertexList[graph], a}]      This outputs a table with the corresponding vertex list labeling the rows and columns. I want to delete the 0 rows and columns while altering the labels to reflect the change. My matrix is currently $85\times 85$, and eliminating the necessary rows and columns reduces the size to $77\times 38$. I could theoretically go through by hand and track the eliminated entries, but that sounds way too time consuming for something that I'm sure has a simple solution. Any help is appreciated.
