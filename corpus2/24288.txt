Mathematica doesn't want to solve my exact system with 3 equations and 3 variables.               AdjustPar20[x_] := a x^b Exp[c x]     Solve[AdjustPar20[0.05] == 9.37126 && AdjustPar20'[0.05] == 0 &&        AdjustPar20[0] == 0, {a, b, c}]      As an explanations why this cannot be solved the program replies:               {}     Solve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Solve, so some solutions may not be found;                   use Reduce for complete solution information. >>      Any ideas?
