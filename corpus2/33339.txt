I have those few lines of code causing a crash and I can't figure out why:               DynamicModule[{openNothing},      EventHandler[       Panel@Row@{          Button["Built In Funct", openNothing[]]}, {}],           Initialization :> (openNothing[] := (Input["bla", 1];))]      _Mathematica_ freezes for a few seconds and then says: > The kernel is not responding to a Dynamic Evaluation. [...] **WARNING:** It did make _Mathematica_ not responding at all. After the **force quit** the list of the recently opened notebooks were removed (I assume that the `~/.Mathematica/FrontEnd/init.m` has been removed.) I'm on _Fedora 19_ , _Mathematica_ 8.0.4. The same issue has been noticed under _Windows 7_ , _Mathematica_ 9.
