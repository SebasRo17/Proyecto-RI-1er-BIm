Every day, after the stand-up, my team and I update our estimates for each story. I have a feeling that there is something wrong with the way we do it, so I need your help. This is how we do: Story A estimate: 24 hours (8 hours per day - we use "ideal days" as the measure)   * Day N: developer starts working on Story A in the morning (8 hours of work completed by the end of the day)    * Day N+1: Story A re-estimation = 16 hours (one workday taken out of Story A, from day N)   * Day N+2: Story A re-estimation = 8 hours (one workday taken out of Story A, from day N+1)   * Day N+3: Story A should be done by now. But it's not. The developer reckons it will take another 3 hours to finish. We update the story on the whiteboard and burndown accordingly.   * Day N+4: Story A took the whole day to be finished instead of only 3 hours! Now it's done. The difference, 5 hours, is completely unaccounted for in our planning. How should we be daily re-estimating our stories?
