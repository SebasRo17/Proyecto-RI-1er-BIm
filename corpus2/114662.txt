I meant alternative languages not in sense **if not Java use C#**. But I meant **if not Java use Groovy, Jruby etc, if not HTML use HAML** and so on. Yes, there are many alternative languages available, which makes coding fun and reduce the developers works. Trying these languages is good or bad? Well learning new things never going to hurt, these alternative languages are pretty easy to read and write them. As a student for example, using Groovy I can create a Swing based application easily and it would take very less lines of code when compared to Java. When I enter into a IT company where they use Java to build the Swing applications, will it be tough for me to build in Java(because I have used alternative languages a lot in my college days)? ### Note: Example is given with Java and Groovy, but I need an answer that is common. Hope my question is clear enough!
