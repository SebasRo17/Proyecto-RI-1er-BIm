I have a list, `myList`, of let's say 20 (different) objects               myList = Table["object", {20}]      I know would like to export every single element of `myList` to its own PDF page in a 20-paged PDF document; i.e., `myList[[1]]` comes on page 1, ..., myList[[20]] comes on page 20. Is this possible in _Mathematica_? I have heard of the `Export` function, of course, but have not seen any way of combining 20 exports in one single document.
