When one writes an open-source project and uses Google Code or GitHub, and wants to use a library like Lua, how should one do this?   * Should the dependency be included in the repository?   * Should the dependency be built from within the same build script as the rest of the project, or from a separate build script? Given that the library doesn't need installation before compilation.
