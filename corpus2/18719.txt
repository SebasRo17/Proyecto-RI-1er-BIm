I decided to learn XML from a professional book instead of reading tutorials online, after some research i decided to read "Beginning XML, 4th Ed" book and it was very interesting book and i recommend it to anyone want to learn XML, my question is: does reading & learning these chapters:   1. XQuery, the XML Query Language   2. XML and Databases really required for someone who is doing mainly: Hibernate/JPA for object/relational persistence? or in other words does learning XQuery & XML databases really required by the current industry standards skills ? Thanks in advance
