I am using the deploy command to embed a CDF file in an HTML page. I am using the annoying but currently necessary `fullscreen:'true'` trick to reveal the "Enable Dynamics" button. Regardless of what size arguments I use in the cdf.embed function, I get an unnecessary vertical scroll bar in the result rendered in the web page. How can I get rid of this? Are there other undocumented arguments to cdf.embed?
