Some time ago I came up with an idea for a library for database inspection. I started developing it and got some very basic functionality, just to check if that's possible. Recently however, I get second thoughts, whether such project would really be useful. I am actually planning to develop following software suite:   * library for `python`, that would provide easy interface to inspect database structure,   * desktop application in `PyQt` that would use the interface to provide graphical database inspection,   * web application in `Django` that would use the interface to provide database inspection through the browser. Do you think such suite would be useful for other developers/database administrators/analysts? I know, that there is pgadmin for `PostgreSQL` and some tool for `sqlite3` and that there is `Java` tool called `DBInspect`. Usually I would be against creating new tool and rather join existing project, but I am not `Java` programmer (and I would rather stick to `python` or `C`, which I like) and none of these projects provide a library for database inspection. Anyway I would like to hear some opinions from fellow developers, whether such project make sense or I should try to spend my free time on developing something else.
