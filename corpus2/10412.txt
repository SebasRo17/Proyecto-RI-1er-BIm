For example, here is a histogram with colliding frame tick labels:               BarChart[{Labeled[{196}, Row[{"Jan", "Feb 23"}, "-"], Below],        Labeled[{349}, Row[{"Feb 23", "Apr 15"}, "-"], Below],        Labeled[{333}, Row[{"Apr 15", "Jun 6"}, "-"], Below],        Labeled[{308}, Row[{"Jun 6", "Jul 28"}, "-"], Below],        Labeled[{308}, Row[{"Jul 28", "Sep 19"}, "-"], Below],        Labeled[{344}, Row[{"Sep 19", "Nov 10"}, "-"], Below],        Labeled[{162}, Row[{"Nov 10", "Jan"}, "-"], Below]},       GridLines -> {Automatic, None},       BaseStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Bitstream Charter", 10],       BarSpacing -> 0, Ticks -> None, GridLines -> None,       Frame -> {{True, False}, {False, False}}, PlotRange -> All,       BarOrigin -> Bottom, BarSpacing -> None, ChartLayout -> "Stacked",       PerformanceGoal -> "Speed",       ChartStyle -> {Directive[         EdgeForm[{Opacity[1.`], Thickness[Medium], Blue}], Opacity[1.`],          FaceForm[LightBlue]]}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GXhd9.png) So the question has two parts:   1. How to detect collisions in frame tick labels in general.   2. How to rearrange labels to minimize collisions and optimize for aesthetics. I'm not sure how to do part 1, but part 2 should involve either rotations or columns I guess. I would rather not assume a specific font or size of text, but perhaps this is unavoidable.
