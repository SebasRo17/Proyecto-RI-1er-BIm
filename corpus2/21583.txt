I'm using `ListLinePlot` inside a `Manipulate` function to display some data. I've seen that _Mathematica_ allows zooming and panning but it's either only for 3D plots or it just doesn't work with `ListLinePlot`. I've also seen a thread here on Stackexchange for a custom function to zoom and pan but it doesn't seem to work when I apply it to `ListLinePlot` (error message "... is not a graphics primitive or directive"). So is there a solution I've missed to be able to zoom and pan a `ListLinePlot`?
