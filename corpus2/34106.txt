I would like to organise a graph's vertices in levels. Consider               g = {       0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 0 -> 4, 0 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 2 -> 7, 8 -> 3, 4 -> 9, 5 -> 9,        6 -> 9, 6 -> 10, 7 -> 10, 8 -> 10, 9 -> 11, 9 -> 12, 10 -> 11, 10 -> 12 };     Graph[g]      Using nested list of vertices such as `{{0, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10}, {11, 12}}`, I would like to see graph with 4 levels wherein vertices 0, 1, 2, 3 placed in line on the top level, vertices 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in line on the level below and so on. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZoubU.png)
