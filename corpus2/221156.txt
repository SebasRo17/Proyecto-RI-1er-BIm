A new project has an amount. It is always related to a client. One client can have many projects. And he may pay in steps for a particular project. In order to keep track of client payments, I've created a table namely `client_ledger` which contains information about date, time, amount, mode of payment & related project. But then in one of the software screens, I have to reports pertaining to a client's debit & credit. So there are 2 things that can be done :   1. Either I can get the total amount of all projects of that client and his total payments & then can show how much balance is left to be paid.   2. Or if I'd created an entry in the `client_ledger` table for `DR`, then as soon as a project is created, an entry is made in the table for `DR` and subsequent payments received will be `CR`ed into the data-base. In this case, if a project's amount is modified/edited later, then either the original `DR` entry has to be modified, or a new `CR` entry followed by the new project amount's `DR` entry should be made. Which of these processes should be followed ?
