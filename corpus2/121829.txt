I have developed a desktop application called "Institute Management System" which has modules like Class manager, Subject manager, Topics manager, Student inquiry manager Student admission manager, Fees manager, Exam manager etc. using C# for the front end and MS Access for the back end. The main problem is that I want to sell it and earn some money but I heard that my application needs to be registered at Microsoft, and I would have to get a license from them for selling, and have to pay them money too. I have spent four months developing it at my own expense, and worked very hard to develop it. So I want some tips, advice, any suggestion for the same. Please also tell me the procedure for all of the required registrations and payment issues. And I also want to ask you if you **Can you suggest any other technology where I develop my application and sell it without worrying about licencing and related issues?** I am now more confused about that "MS technology is open source or not? "
