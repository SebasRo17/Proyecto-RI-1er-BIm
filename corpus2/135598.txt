I'm about to create an open source desktop application. I'm primarily a .NET developer , with experience in ASP.NET and SharePoint. I've created basic Windows Forms applications before, but I have never developed using WPF or Silverlight before. I want a compelling, highly interactive UI for my desktop application. What are my technology choices for doing this, using .NET? In particular, is HTML5 something I should be considering?
