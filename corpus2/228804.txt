I have to make the report for one of the client. There are three sources from I will get all raw data, so eventually I will have to marry those all data from different sources and make one report. This is the first I am making database design from scratch so need some basic as well as advance help. Question is: All 3 sources that contain raw data doesn't have any unique column, do I need to put PRIMARY KEY on that or I can make report without PRIMARY KEY and Foreign KEY? In addition to this I don't have DIMTIME or DIMDATE table also. Do i need all this stuff to create database? NOTE:I have already merge these three sources based in date and country field and without Primary key. Thanks in Advance.
