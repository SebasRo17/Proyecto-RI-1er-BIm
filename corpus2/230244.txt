Memoization is definitely a powerful technique. But Dynamic Programming is slightly better IMO, since it does not involve the memory strain (in a recursive program, the parameters occupy memory and this memory increases as we go deeper into the recursion). But speed-wise, both are pretty equal. But definitely memoization is a lot more straight-forward than Dynamic Programming. My question: Is it somehow possible to use memoization without the memory constraint ?
