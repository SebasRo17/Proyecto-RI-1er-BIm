I want a function that will interpret a string as a strictly unsigned integer, failing when the string overflows, represents a negative number, or does not represent a number. `strtoull()` does set errno to ERANGE on overflow or EINVAL for a string that does not begin with a number, but accepts negative numbers as valid. `strtoumax()` is the same as `strtoull()` `atoll()` and `strtonum()` are ruled out because they are strictly for signed integers. `sscanf()` sets errno to ERANGE on overflow and stops processing the string if it does not begin with a number (reflected in sscanf's return value), but also accepts negative numbers as valid. Is there another option that I'm missing?
