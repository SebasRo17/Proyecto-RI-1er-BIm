The following examples only work for the first character of the whole string, but not of words.               s = "words are lowercase";     StringJoin[MapAt[ToUpperCase, Characters[s], 1]]   (* ==> "Words are lowercase" *)     StringReplacePart[#, ToUpperCase[StringTake[#, 1]], 1]&@s  (* ==> "Words are lowercase" *)      Is there any method along these lines to produce correct **title case** strings of the form:               "Words Are Lowercase"
