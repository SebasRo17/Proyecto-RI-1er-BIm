Background: I want all numbers in `InputField`'s displayed as `NumberForm[num,2]`; Now, consider the following the snippet of code:                latsy = 1.1;      latparshx = 32;      piet = NumberForm[latsy*Tan[latparshx*Pi/180], 2];      InputField[Dynamic[piet], FieldSize -> 3]      This code produces an inputfield with a number between double quotes, which is not what I expected. I basically want 0.69 displayed. **Question: How can I ( what is the best way to ) control the display format of a number in an InputField ?** EDIT: The InputField resizes itself on the Panel it is positioned on and thus messes up the other GUI elements.
