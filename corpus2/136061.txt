I have got good grades and ~ 10 years of professional embedded s/w development. However I have come to realize that and also been pointed out in performance appraisals that although I have good theoretical knowledge and have even read lots of programming books - Code complete, pragmatic programmer etc.. , my hands on practical knowledge is weak and I am unable to translate my theoretical ability into practical expertise. I need to figure out a plan on how to do this. Any ideas in this regard? EDIT : I take too long in understanding specs and in developing code and and miss some aspects in development particularly domain knowledge.
