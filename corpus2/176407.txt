While writing some predicates for collection filtering I have stumbled over the choice of the right words for the relation of the subject and the predicate (English is a foreign language for me). What I ended up writing was "Subjects **matching** this predicate..." This seems to be incorrect, since predicates are functions and not regular expressions. But saying "Subjects for which this predicate returns true..." sounds awkward to me as well.. So what would be the correct term?
