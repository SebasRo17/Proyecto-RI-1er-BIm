This is a very broad question, and I'm just looking for a pointer in the right direction more than a specific answer, but it's something I've always wondered and never known. Lets say I have a program that I wrote, and I put it on a server. Then, I write an android app that I want to use to control that program (give it inputs, basically) To boil it down even further, what I want to do is have a program that sits on a server, and basically make an android app that is just a gui for that program, and it can be controlled from anywhere, I guess sort of like a remote printing over Wi-Fi type of thing. I really know nothing about this or even where to begin. I'd appreciate even some vocab words that point me in the right direction.
