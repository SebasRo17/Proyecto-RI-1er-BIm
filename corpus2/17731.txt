I have two lists: `list1`and `list2`, which are financial time series with only 2 variablesâ€”date and price. The problem is: these financial time series occur in 2 different countries, which have holidays on different days. For instance, if the first list is related to an asset in the US, there will be no data for this asset on July 4th (due to the American national holiday).   So the **first** need here is to FILL this missing (price-)values with the price of the previous date.   The **second** need is to COMPARE these lists, which have different dimensions due to different national holidays occurring on different dates for each country. In this case, some dates (with corresponding price values) must be _included_ in the lists. Let me give an example. Consider:               list1 = {{{2007, 1, 2}, 12.04}, {{2007, 1, 4}, 11.51}, {{2007, 1, 5}, 12.14}}     list2 = {{{2007, 1, 2}, 20.91}, {{2007, 1, 3}, 24.34}, {{2007, 1, 4}, 24.67},              {{2007, 1, 5}, 20.97}}      In this case it will be necessary to include in `list1` the observation `{{2007, 1, 3}, 12.04}`. Any idea of how can I do this in _Mathematica_? * * * ## Edited Please consider the following real time series:               list1 = FinancialData["PETR4.SA", {"2007"}];     list2 = FinancialData["XOM", {"2007"}];      Now consider the Dimensions of both lists:               Dimensions[list1]     {245, 2}          Dimensions[list2]     {251, 2}      I need to create `Modlist1` and `Modlist2`, so that both have `Dimensions[]` of order {257, 2}. This means: I need to include 12 observations in `list1` and 6 observations in `list2` to obtain the modified lists, both of same `Dimensions[]`.
