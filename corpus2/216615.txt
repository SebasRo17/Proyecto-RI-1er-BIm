_This question might be more suited to math.stackexchange.com, but here goes:_ ## Their Version Reconciliation takes two parts-- first the exchange of digests, and then an exchange of updates. I'll first paraphrase the paper's description of each step. To exchange digests, two peers send one another a set of pairs-- (`peer`, `max_version`) for each peer in the network, and then each one responds with a set of deltas. The deltas look like: `(peer, key, value, version)`, for all tuples for which `peer`'s state maps the `key` to the given `value` and `version`, and the version number is greater than the maximum version number `peer` has seen. This seems to require that each node remember the state of each other node, and the highest version number and ID each node has seen. ## Question Why must we iterate through all peers to exchange information between p and q?
