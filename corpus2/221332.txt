I was reading the Bootstrap Getting Started docs, and I came across "Pre- Compiled Source" as a feature. Upon downloading the package, I just found `.js`, `.css`, and some image files. What is there to be "pre-compiled"? Doesn't it all compile in the browser upon page load? I'm guessing this means that it was compiled and tested before shipping, but I don't understand why this would need to be advertised.
