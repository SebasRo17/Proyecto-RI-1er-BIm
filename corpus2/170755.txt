I am designing an application that allow users to highlight areas of a geographical map using a tool that is like brush or a pen. The tool basically draw a circle with a single click and continue drawing those circles with mouse move. Here is an example of drawing made by moving the tool. It is pretty much same as Microsoft Paint. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aXG9T.png) Regardless of programming language what is best approach (most inexpensive approach) for saving this kind of data?
