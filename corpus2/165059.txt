Based on a multitude of questions related to temporarily disabling ReSharper, and also on certain research data, I can see that a considerable share of ReSharper users have it disabled most of the time. They tend to enable it for a limited period of time (say, several hours), do whatever they need to do using its functionality, and disable it back until the next time they feel they need to use it. If you're using ReSharper (or other similar VS extensions, to that matter) in such occasional manner, can you clarify why you're doing this? Is your behavior based on performance, or other considerations? What kinds of tasks do you enable ReSharper for in this scenario?
