I have recently started working for a pretty big bank writing internal apps. I am being subcontracted out by the company I work for (who I have also recently started working for). This bank **has recently** upgraded to Windows XP, they previously used Windows 2000. I have been tasked with re-writing a report viewing application, which I am currently doing in MVC4 (Windows XP == Visual Studio 2010). The original app was written in .net 2 with webfoms, and is a bit of a mess. The whole application seems to rely on state, where MVC is all about embracing the stateless nature of the web, as in the data you input to form A, affects the options you see in form B, options you select in form B affect form C etc etc (I love MVC and think that it is an awesome thing in the right context). The whole maintaining models between states thing is starting to get pretty messy, and I can't help but thinking that I am either doing it wrong, or not using the right tool for the job. My thoughts are that WPF would be perfect for this but the Computers are controlled by an external agency and are pretty locked down. We have slightly more control over the servers hosting the applications. The obvious next option is Silverlight(I think, maybe I'm horribly wrong!) A couple of questions. First: Is MVC ASP actually the best option here, or am I doing it wrong? Second: What argument would you present to management if you agreed with me and thought a Silverlight based application was the way to go? Using non MS based technologies is a no go. MVC4 is controversial.
