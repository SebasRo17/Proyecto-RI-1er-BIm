Say I have two trigonometric expressions which are a bit complicated. Is there a quick way to check if they reduce to the same thing (that they are equal) using Mathematica? I was solving this: $y'' + y = \cos 4x,$ $y(0) = 6, y'(0) = 11$ using Laplace transformation technique, and I get this: $y = \frac{-1}{15}\cos(4x) + \left(\frac{1}{15} + 6\right) \cos(x) + 11 \sin(x)$.   I wanted to check if my answer is correct and Mathematica gave me this:               1/30 (182 Cos[x] - 5 Cos[x] Cos[3 x] + 3 Cos[x] Cos[5 x]           + 330 Sin[x] + 5 Sin[x] Sin[3 x] + 3 Sin[x] Sin[5 x])
