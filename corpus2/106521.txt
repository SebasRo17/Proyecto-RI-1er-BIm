I'm having problems naming my classes and services correctly when utils and other help classes are involved. How would you structure the following:               EventService.cs     EventServiceUtils.cs     EventServiceValidators.cs     EventServiceCoordinator.cs      etc... I have multiple services with the same needs as the above service. One thought is to separate all of this into a suitable namespace, making it look something like this:               Services.EventService.EventService.cs //(the actual service)     Services.EventService.Validators.DateValidator.cs     Services.EventService.Validators.ParticipantValidator.cs     Services.EventService.Coordinators.ParticipantCoordinator.cs     Services.EventService.ExtensionMethods.Extensions.cs      and so on. Every namespace is of course a separate folder. But this doesn't feel 100%, since there are probably more `DateValidators` in the other services, which can easily lead to an unwanted reference. And also the `Services.EventService.EventService.cs` includes the class name in the namespace, which is no good either. You could use `Services.Event.EventService.cs`, but there is of course already an entity with that name. This is the domain model.
