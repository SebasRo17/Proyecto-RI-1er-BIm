SiegelTheta often returns error messages when I give it arguments that should be of the correct form. For instance, I have a numerical matrix like               M = N[{{1 + π/2, -1, 1 - π/2}, {-1, 1 + π/2, -1}, {1 - π/2, -1, 1 + π/2}}];      and I want to evaluate `SiegelTheta[Ω[0.01], s]`, where               Ω[r_] := I*Inverse[M]/r          s = {0, 0, 0};      but I get the following error message:               SiegelTheta::invmat:     "{{0. + 56.831I,0. + 31.831I,0. + 25.I},{0. + 31.831I,0. + 63.662I,0. +31.831I},     {0. + 25.I,0. + 31.831I,0. + 56.831I}} must be a symmetric matrix with a positive definite      imaginary part."      However, `Ω[0.01]` does satisfy those conditions, even according to Mathematica:               PositiveDefiniteMatrixQ[Im[Ω[0.01]]]     (* True *)          SymmetricMatrixQ[Ω[0.01]]     (* True *)      I would appreciate any help resolving this issue. I am using Mathematica version 9.0.1.
