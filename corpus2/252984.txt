I understand what dynamic and static type systems are, and what duck typing is. But I don't understand how you can have a static language that supports duck typing. To my understanding only a dynamically typed language can support duck typing. This answer from StackOverflow explains that _"Duck typing is something that is completely orthogonal to static, dynamic, weak, or strong typing."_ It gives an example from C++ for duck typing in a statically typed language, but I'm not a C++ programmer and I don't understand it. I'd like an explanation of how it's possible for a static language to support duck typing.
