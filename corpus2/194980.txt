Is it possible to host a long-running worker inside ASP.NET application? The worker (for it's a windows service) is reading from a queue sending messages to a WCF service. Would it be possible to run this "light long-running worker" inside an ASP.NET application? I read about setting pool start mode to "always running" and then using an AppStart class, which starts the worker. I would like to get rid of the windows service (deployments and debugging problems) and embed this work inside IIS. Any suggestion?
