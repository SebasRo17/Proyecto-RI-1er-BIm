My firewall (the "Application Firewall" in OS X 10.8.2) detects that _Mathematica_ (9.0.1.0) and "MathKernel" both request incoming connections. My configuration expects all incoming connections to be blocked, so I wonder what the consequences of denying these connections is. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0FBzT.png) Why do _Mathematica_ and "MathKernel" request incoming connections? What are these connections used for and what, specifically, will be the consequences of denying them? When I allow connections, and take a quick look at them, I see that both have opened several incoming/outgoing paris of connections to "localhost", which suggests that the connections are being used for local communication between each other, as suggested in Szabolcs's answer ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7TePT.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BY64W.png) but closer examination shows an additional connection for each that I'm not sure how to interpret ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ikoyn.png) Blocking incoming connections seems to have no effect, and I wonder of that's really true (e.g., am I paying a performance price). Allowing would seem to be innocent, of all the connections are local; but I know of no way to guarantee that.
