I am looking on the website but the difference between the two isn't explained. To complicate matters a Google search tells me that developers should focus on the MCPD qualifications but an examination of the MCPD section of the site is telling me that the Web Application exams will expire in July 2013! It seems out of date. Meanwhile the MCSD exam seems to be a lot more up to date with references to HTML5/ASP.net 4.5 MVC applications! What's the difference? Are the MCPD certifications going to be updated after July?
