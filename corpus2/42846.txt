{{{x11, 31}, {1, {{x10, 19}}}, {0, {{x9, 12}}}}} /. {___,         s : {{a_, b_}, {c_, {{d_, e_}}}, {f_, {{g_, h_}}}}, ___} ->        Graph[{a \[UndirectedEdge] d, a \[UndirectedEdge] g},         VertexLabels -> {a -> a, d -> d, g -> g}, EdgeWeight -> {c, f},         ImagePadding -> 10, EdgeLabels -> {{a \[UndirectedEdge] d ->             c}, {a \[UndirectedEdge] g -> f}}]      It generates a graph but it doesn't replace the variables as is expected,variables stay same without replacement. I am also facing problem with labeling vertices using patterns. Does someone know how to achieve this replacement ?
