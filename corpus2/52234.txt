This has a connection to the previous post here: puzzled with a color function Also, a recent post of mine appeared here: Create a color bar plot legend but I should have solved the problem with the color function before asking the question about color bar. If opening a new thread goes against the forums policies I apologize. Thanks to the answers I got, I have now what I wanted               h = ParametricPlot3D[lst, {u, 0, 2*Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}, Mesh -> False,          ColorFunction -> (Function[{x, y, z, u, v}, Hue[Rescale[dam, {0, 1}]]]),          ColorFunctionScaling -> False, ImageSize -> 800];     g = Plot3D[Rescale[dam, {0, 1}], {u, 0, 2*Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}, Mesh -> False,          ColorFunction -> (Function[{u, v, z}, Hue[Rescale[dam, {0, 1}]]]),          ColorFunctionScaling -> False, PlotRange -> All];     Row[{h, Show[g, ImageSize -> 400]}]      What I further want is to add a color bar to each plot. Something like               Legended[h, BarLegend[{colFun,{min,max}}]] (*version 9*)      which does not give the requested color bar. Also,               colourBar =        DensityPlot[y, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, AspectRatio -> 5,         PlotRangePadding -> 0,         FrameTicks -> {{None, Range[0, 1, 0.1]}, {None, None}},         ColorFunction -> colFun];     Row[{Show[gr1, ImageSize -> Large],        Show[colourBar, ImageSize -> Small]}] (*vesrion 8 alternative*)      does not work as well. Thanks in advance for any advice. Dimitris
