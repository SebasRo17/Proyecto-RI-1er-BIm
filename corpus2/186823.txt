In an agile project -   1. I assume user requirements are captured in terms of user story. Is this correct?   2. How are system requirements encompassing all the constituent applications documented (in case of a large project)?   3. Are there any specific tools used?    4. Is it a good idea to capture system requirements as child user stories under a main user story?    5. Should individual component teams produce SRS document containing requirements specific to the component team?    6. Should there be a low level design document or will it be part of SRS document?
