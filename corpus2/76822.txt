I need a way to get non-deterministic random numbers on demand for my application. However i do not wish/have the capabilities to build the hardware myself, thus I'm looking for a web service which does just that. Basically I'm looking for a non-deterministic random number generator for my application. Apparently my requirements is that it definitely have to take the analog world as input. I've found one at http://random.org. It is good enough for me, However it has a cap of 200k bits (only 6250 32-bit integers!) on each IP per day. 6250 integers per day is definitely not enough for my app. So I'm searching for one that gives a better quota. I don't mind paying to use the service (but obviously a free one would be better). I'm not asking a useless question. In fact, applications like online Casinos will need many non-deterministic random numbers on demand. In my situation, my economics/investment game requires a true random number for good simulation. A pseudo-random number is just "not good" enough for a "good" simulation you see. Btw please do not tell me that a pseudo-random number generator would "be good enough" for my application. It apparently isn't good enough for my situation here, which is the first, last, and only reason why I'll need a non- deterministic random number generator. Anyway, I'm aware that any data sent through HTTP/HTTPS has risks of being eavesdropped. I'm perfectly fine with that. I need a true random number. After I've gotten the number, I'm happy. A spy can eavesdrop all he wants and I won't mind a bit.
