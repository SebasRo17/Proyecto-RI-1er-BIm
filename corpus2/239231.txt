One day I was using Git (I'm still using it) and the electricity went down while I was committing. When I (actually, the electricity) came back, the git repo was corrupt. I don't remember the exact name, but it was something like "invalid refs" or something like that. It's easy to guess that the commit was broken in the middle of the operation (I was committing through IntelliJ, which does the index additions automatically). It was also easy to guess that, actually, 'commit' is not as ACID as the DBMS operation with the same name. **Q** : Is there a way to ensure repo-altering operations respect atomicity? i.e. if the electricity goes down again, and I'm committing, I'd like my filesystem to not be in a corrupt state.
