I have a lot of files in a folder that needs to be process through a function that I have written in Mathematica. I need help writing a code that would process all the files automatically.               TestData = Import["file.xls"];          function[input_] :=       Module[{CellsKey, Datalist, Lastcap, Pdata, filename},       Datalist = {};       CellsKey = TestData[[1]][[1]][[1]];       a = Last[TestData[[1]]];       Lastcap = a[[4]];       (*Print[Lastcap]*)       Pdata = Append[CellsKey, Lastcap]         (*Print[CellsKey]*)         Print[Pdata]     ]      This is what I have so far. With this code, I could only import one file at a time.
