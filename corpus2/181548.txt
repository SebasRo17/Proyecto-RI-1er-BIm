Edit *We have a heart monitor hooked up to to an msp430 with a roving networks wifi module. I would like to connect send some type of a datastream to a webserver so that someone could watch it offsite. I would like to have a datastreaming connection or something to the webserver because I was thinking it is more natural than trying to do a post request every .5 seconds. (I know this isn't super specific but this is the level I am at right now.) I'm trying to figure out how to stream data (not video or anything big) from a microcontroller to a webserver and forward it to an iOS app. My buddy has a wifi module for our MCU and he claims we just write UART and the wifi module broadcasts our UART signal. So I want to stream that data to a webserver (php). Is there any type of wifi protocol for sending a stream of data to the server? What is the protocol for establishing a datastream connection on the MCU end? What kind of server side code do I need to recieve the datastream?
