I have generated a dataset which seems to fine according to the help page of Mathematica for a ListVectorPlot3D but, it says it is not a valid set. I have given the data set below, could someone please tell me what is wrong here? In each element the first list containing three elements is the position and the next list containing three elements is the vector components.               In[170]:= FullData1          Out[170]= {{{-0.027267, -0.0278571,         0.1}, {0.710454, -0.695403, -0.108031}}, {{-0.0380811, -0.00808106,         0.1}, {0.206099, -0.971216, 0.119427}}, {{-0.0359774, 0.0154511,         0.1}, {-0.394081, -0.917603, 0.0520121}}, {{-0.020237, 0.0330941,         0.1}, {-0.844052, -0.516136, -0.145537}}, {{-0.000633865,         0.0392053, 0.1}, {-0.999843, -0.0161653, -0.00730729}}, {{0.020237,         0.0330941, 0.1}, {-0.844052, 0.516136, 0.145537}}, {{0.0342857,         0.0190214, 0.1}, {-0.485118,         0.874415, -0.0077212}}, {{0.0379892, -0.00857143, 0.1}, {0.218605,         0.968876, -0.116149}}, {{0.0228341, -0.0314056, 0.1}, {0.800943,         0.582344, 0.139165}}, {{0.00214286, -0.0391452, 0.1}, {0.998203,         0.0546429, 0.0246024}}}          In[168]:= ListVectorPlot3D[FullData1]          During evaluation of In[168]:= Visualization`Core`ListVectorPlot3D::vfldata: {{{-0.027267,-0.0278571,0.1},{0.710454,-0.695403,-0.108031}},<<8>>,{{0.00214286,-0.0391452,0.1},{0.998203,0.0546429,0.0246024}}} is not a valid vector field dataset or a valid list of datasets.
