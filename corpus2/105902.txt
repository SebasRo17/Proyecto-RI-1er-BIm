Why did the C master Dennis Ritchie introduce pointers in C? And why did the other programming languages like VB.NET or Java or C# eliminate them? I have found some points in Google, and I want to listen your comments too. Why are they eliminating pointer concepts in modern languages? People say C is the basic language and pointers is the concept that makes C powerful and outstanding and makes C still to compete with more modern languages. Then why did they eliminate pointers in more modern languages? Do you think knowledge of pointers is still important for new programmers? People are using VB.NET or Java these days, which supports more highly advanced features than C (and does not use any pointer concepts) and many people as I see now (my friends) choose these languages ignoring C as they support advanced features. I tell them to start with C. They say it's a waste to learn the concepts of pointers when you're doing the advanced things in VB.NET or Java which are not possible in C. What do you think? **Updated** : The comments I read on Google are:   1. The earlier computers were too slow and not optimized.   2. Using pointers makes it possible to access an address directly and this saves time instead of making a copy of it in function calls.   3. Security is significantly worse using pointers, and that's why Java and C# did not include them. These and some more what I found. I still need some valuable answers. That would be greatly appreciated.
