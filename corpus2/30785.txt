I've tried to export a list to a CSV file. I shut it down after about 20 minutes of processing. The list has 261,000 rows and 30 columns. I finally exported it to a txt file and its size was 111 MB. txt went slowly but was acceptable. However the format is not nearly as good to work with. Is there a way to output a table that runs faster than Export? The data has integers, doubles, dates and strings. I did a test using the last 2 cols and output that. I learned a few things that help a lot. The last two columns look like:               Dimensions[aOutput]     aOutput[[1 ;; 2]]     {261136, 2}     {{14., "Casualty Treaty XS CM"}, {13., "Casualty Treaty XS Working"}}.      They're all pairs of an integer followed by a string. The 2 column test timed at 17 seconds, but took 6 minutes of "wall" time. I was outputting to a network share at a remote data center with a 100Mb connection. When I output the test to my C drive it took 8 seconds and about 10 seconds of wall time.
