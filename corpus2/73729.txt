I have studied Java for quite a while and written a lot of small SE programs. I have a good grasp on the language at this stage but unfortunately I do not work in the area of Java programming (as of yet). I would like to develop a portfolio of Java programs for the purposes of moving into this area. This is also vital in most interviews. I also would like to develop this portfolio to further my learning (maybe in the area of Java EE). Can anybody recommend a starting point? GF
