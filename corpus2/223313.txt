Right now I am using Google C++ Style Guide in my C++ code and I was pretty happy with it. Recently I was told that this guide is very bad: it is used internally by Google (I knew that), is outdated, and promotes some very bad practices. So I want to use another coding style. What good and fairly used C++ style guides are there? I write code for both gcc and Visual Studio, and I use a lot of the C++11 features. What I liked very much about Google C++ Style Guide was the indentation, the whitespace and the naming conventions (specially naming all classes, types - including typedefs, type aliases and template aliases - with capital first letter). I know any answer is subjective (I hope this is ok on this site) and I would appreciate any opinion, but I am interested which guides are used these days.
