I recently sent in an application for a position that I am qualified for and received this response: "We regret to inform you that your current qualifications do not match those needed for our current openings. We will retain your resume and if a position opens that closely matches your skill set, we will contact you at that time." The position listed required technical skills A, B, C, D, and E with nice-to-haves of X and Y. I listed in my resume and cover letter that I had experience with A through E as well as X. I don't have any experience with Y. This leads me to believe that I am qualified for the position and the Human Resources representative (who does not appear to be a part of the company) is wrong. I asked for a clarification of what qualifications I was missing, but have yet to receive a response. I did a good bit of research about the company and the developers I would be working with and I think it would be a great place to work. I don't want to take no for an answer so easily. I am thinking about directly contacting the development lead (via Twitter) at the company and asking him to look at my resume. He does not know who I am. Is this a good idea?
