I have an output which I want to hide if there is an error otherwise display it. The output is a Dynamic[output] so I can't simply use something like               If[IntegerQ[output],output,""]      or               If[Head[output]==Integer,output,""]      becasue it seems that although this method would work for other items such as integers, text and so on, a dynamic object stays a dynamic object whether there is an error or not. What I am looking for is something that does the following               If there is an error occuring when I display this dynamic object, display nothing otherwise display the dynamic object.      I have tried the Check and Quiet functions together and what I get is below. I don't care about the typed error messages but I'm talking about the output cells that look like red blocks with writing inside of them. I hope this explains things better. I have put a picture instead of code becasue there are a lot of background definitions for all the things in the grid that would be too long to put here. ![Check and Quiet](http://i.stack.imgur.com/K8p8o.jpg)
