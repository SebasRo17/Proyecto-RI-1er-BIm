Imagine you'll have always a button labeled "Continue" in the same position in your app's GUI. Would you rather make a single button instance that takes different actions depending on the current state?               private State currentState = State.Step1;          private ContinueButton_Click()     {         switch(currentState)         {             case State.Step1:                 DoThis();                 currentState = State.Step2;                 break;             case State.Step2:                 DoThat();                 break;         }     }      Or would you rather have something like this?               public Form()     {         this.ContinueStep2Button.Visible = false;     }          private ContinueStep1Button_Click()     {         DoThis();         this.ContinueStep1Button.Visible = false;         this.ContinueStep2Button.Visible = true;     }          private ContinueStep2Button_Click()     {         DoThat();     }
