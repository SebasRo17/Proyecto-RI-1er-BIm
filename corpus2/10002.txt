I often come across a class which has a single reference to another library and was wondering if its better to include the library or to reference the object by it's full name. Is one better then the other? Is one more of a standard then another? For example using System.Windows.Messagebox: Option A:               using System.Windows;          public class MyClass     {         SomeMethod()         {             MessageBox.Show("Something");         }     }      Option B:               public class MyClass     {         SomeMethod()         {             System.Windows.MessageBox.Show("Something");         }     }      If B, how many references do you need before you decide to add the entire library?
