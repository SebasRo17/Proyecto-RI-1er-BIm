I will be implementing Event Sourcing for the first time on a hobby project and I have what could be a really simple question: should the event store be the only storage area if you have a denormalized read store? Or do many systems keep their normal relational table structure _in addition to_ the event store (and read store)? I understand there may be hybrids in a brownfields application.. but what about greenfields? I ask because all event sourcing articles / questions relate directly to the event store. Not a single one refers to any relational table structure. I am concerned that Eventual Consistency now effects the Read Store and one half of the Write store if I was to fire off messages to have the event data persisted to relational tables after the event store had been written to. This assumes that I were to allow for distributed messages at the point where the event store has been written to and the relational tables are updated. Can anyone clarify this for me? I have read this question but it doesn't quite address what I am asking.
