I have two problems with printing in version 10. First, I can't print correctly with a setting of printing scale For example, I have some plots in a notebook,               Grid@Table[       Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Ï€}, ImageSize -> Medium], {4}, {4}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wh9jF.png) when I print with scale 70%, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U3t6v.png) I get something like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LcdHq.png) I always get a big blank at the top of the page, no matter what I set the margins in the printing options dialog. Second, the curve seems to be stretched after print. Here is compare between screen shot of the figure in the notebook and after print ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C0ocG.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nxpvv.png) You can that the curve in the printed version stretches out beyond the frame. Are there ways around these problems? Currently I have to switch to older version once I need to print something. The example notebook is here I'm using 10.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) (June 29, 2014) on OS X 10.9.4.
