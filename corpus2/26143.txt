My client is looking to standardize on its "helper" tools suite of applications to aid developers of a very large .NET project in debugging, profiling, finding memory leaks and performance bottlenecks, etc. kinds of issues All developers use VS2010, target .NET 4.0, and support a large distributed system: Winform UI client (CAB framework), SQL2008 Backened, CSLA app-tier with Dataportal & remoting, and there is a large job-processing layer with Compute cluster pack (CCP) as well as a few dozen other peripheral technologies. To give you an idea of the size, the system is probably north of 5M lines of code, has about 100 developers around the world and has been in development & production support for the last 5 years with this same team size. Over the years, client did not have a single strategy that revolved around profiling tools of kinds. Client bought the tools when programmers said: "oh, this looks nice to trouble-shoot this particular problem I'm having".. So, now the client wants to standardize on a suite of tools. What has worked so far: Ants for memory profiling. dotTrace for performance profiling. There is currently a serious consideration being given to CA Wiley for production monitoring. VS2010 profiling has been deemed not good enough and not working well enough within the current system. Can anyone recommend a single suite of tools that would be a good substitute for ALL the tools mentioned above? Integration with VS2010 is a must. All sorts of bells & whistles and ease-of-use and ability to drill-down into deepest levels to find the weirdest problems is required. Thank you for your suggestions
