I frequently find myself wanting to use some small function from another library but end up not doing because it's not worth pulling another dependency. Considering BSD/MIT licenses, if I just copy/paste a function from another package, what would be the legal requirement when licensing my code? Also, as matter of _netiquette_ , what would be the preferable way to give credit to the original author? I understand this depends on the specific circumstances of each situation. The safe way would be to always ask the upstream author what does he want, but, sometimes, this happens so frequently that having a a default proposition for the upstream author can make the interaction smoother.
