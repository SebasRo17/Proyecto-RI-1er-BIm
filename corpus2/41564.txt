I want to do this:   * When `10 <= t < 130`, give `t -> 1`;   * When `130 <= t<300`, give `t->3`;   * When `300 <= t< 1000`, give `t -> 4`;   * When `1000 <= t < 2000`, give `t -> 5`; My code is this:               data = {10, 130, 300, 1000, 2000};     fun[t_] := Part[data, t];     comf[s_] := For[t = 1, t <= 4, t++, If[fun[t] <= s < fun[t+1], Print[t]]];      I could get this:               comf[110]      > >     1 >                 comf[1300]      > >     4 >   But when I evaluate this               comf[110] + 100      I didnâ€™t get the right result, rather I got this: > >     100 + Null >   I would like to know how I could fix this problem.
