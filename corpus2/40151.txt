# Edit: Initially in my question I asked how I could search the database of `AstronomicalData["Exoplanets"]` and return 2 filtered values that only contained valued cases, which would be placed into a `ListLogPlot`. The necessity was to achieve 3 lists that had 2 sets of data, however my method required having to manually copy the results into their lists that didn't contain _Missing data. The lists required categorization of the radii of exoplanets in relation to Jupiter and Neptune;   * Exoplanets that are larger than Jupiter, **exoplanet > Jupiter**   * Exoplanets that are larger than Neptune but smaller than Jupiter, **Neptune < exoplanet < Jupiter**   * Exoplanets that are smaller than Neptune, **exoplanet < Neptune** As an example, I sorted the radii by value to make finding correlating sizes easier, my search method was;               Sort[{AstronomicalData[#, "Radius"],AstronomicalData[#,"SemimajorAxis"]}->#&/@AstronomicalData["Exoplanet"]]      An extract from the example returns;               {3.63*10^6, 2.25*10^9} -> "KOI961d", {4.65*10^6, 8.75*10^8} -> "KOI961c"...      I found no concept which allowed me to use `DeleteCases` that allowed me to keep the syntax for naming using `#`
