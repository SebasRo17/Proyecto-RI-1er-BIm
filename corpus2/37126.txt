What are the usual career paths from a Systems Architecture role? Do people ever move from architecture roles into management and work towards CIO/CTO or do they generally just head towards Enterprise Architecture? What would you suggest to learn/do to aid in positioning to move into management and eventually CIO/CTO roles? Experiences?
