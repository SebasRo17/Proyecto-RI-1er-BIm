I was reading this excellent blog article regarding speeding up the badge page and in the last comment the author waffles (a.k.a Sam Saffron) mentions these tools: > dapper and a bunch of custom helpers like rainbow, sql builder etc Dapper and sql builder was easy to look up but rainbow keeps pointing me to a CMS, can someone please point me to the real source? Thanks. _Obviously the architecture of these [SE] sites is uber cool and ultra fast so no comments on that thanks._
