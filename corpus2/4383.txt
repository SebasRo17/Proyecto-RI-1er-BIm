I'm trying to draw a `Grid` of characters where some of the characters have `Frame` lines on 3 sides. For example:                 +   +     x | x | x       +---+      x   x   x          x   x   x      That's something like a `Grid[item = Table[x,{3},{3}]]`, except with `item[[1,2]] = Item[x,FrameStyle->{{White,Black},{Black,Black}}]`, except that produces a complete box around the `x` for me. When the documentation says: > `FrameStyle->{{left,right},{bottom,top}}` specifies that different sides of > a graphics frame should be drawn with different styles. I fear that the "...of a graphics frame..." part means that this will work for a `Plot`, but not for a `Grid`. Is there a way to style a frame such that I only draw three edges of it? It doesn't have to be pretty--I'm planning on generating the `Grid` from some data that I have lying around.
