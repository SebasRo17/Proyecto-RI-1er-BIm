In real world usage you often want to use real world labels with long strings (say 15-20 characters) in 3D pie charts. Here is a toy example :               Clear[labeler];     labeler[datax_][v_, {1, c_}, ___] :=        Placed[Column[{datax[[c]], v}, Alignment -> Center,          BaseStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Arial", 11]],         "VerticalCallout"];     data = Transpose[{"This is label " <> ToString[#] & /@ Range[14],          Range[14]}];          PieChart3D[{data[[All, 2]]},      ChartElementFunction ->        ChartElementDataFunction["ProfileSector3D", "Profile" -> 4],      ChartStyle -> 54,      ImageSize -> 400,      LabelingFunction -> labeler[data[[All, 1]]],      PerformanceGoal -> "Speed",      PlotRange -> All,      SectorOrigin -> {Pi, 0},      SectorSpacing -> 0.2]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WLUDT.png) We see that the plot area seems to have been determined without reference to the labels that will be placed around the chart. Consequently the labels are cut off. Q. Is this an `Image Padding` issue? A. no (note that `All` gives the same output as `Full`) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nixbd.png) Q. So why not expand the margins around the image to give the labels enough space to be rendered? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5ooGc.jpg) So increasing the image margins merely creates another graphics area around the original image. This looks like a bug or design flaw to me. Does anyone have any ideas about how to get `VerticalCallout` labels working in `PieChart3D`?
