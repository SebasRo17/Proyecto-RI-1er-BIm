m = {{2, 6, 4}, {2, 6, 5}, {-3, 6, 6}};      Consider I'm doing calculation by hand. I want to collect the multiple 6 of second column, how to do that? I'd like the result something like the following. The main purpose is to show the solution steps(in Notebook or Latex) $$\begin{align*}det(m)=6~det\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 2& 1 & 4 \\ 2 & 1 & 5 \\ -3 & 1 & 6 \\\end{array}\right);\end{align*}$$ Maybe something `collect[m]` function, and generate all possible results? or $$\begin{align*}det(m)=2~det\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 3& 2\\ 2 & 6& 5 \\ -3 & 6& 6 \\\end{array}\right);\end{align*}$$
