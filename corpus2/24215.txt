I am able to connect to a specific MS Access Database when it is on the same Windows computer as _Mathematica_ via the command               << DatabaseLink`;     conn = OpenSQLConnection[JDBC["odbc", "Databasename"]];      However, I cannot figure out how to connect to this database over a local area network -- disregarding trivial network problems (the computers can ping eachother), is this even possible?
