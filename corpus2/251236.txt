Python is my first programming language, and I'm learning it from "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist". In Chapter 5 the author gives the following example on recursion:               def factorial(n):        if n == 0:          return 1        else:          recurse = factorial(n-1)          result = n * recurse          return result       I understand that if n = 3, then the function will execute the second branch. But what I don't understand is what happens when the function enters the second branch. Can someone explain it to me?
