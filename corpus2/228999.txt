We are redesigning our corporate website with the following functions:   * we want to give the marketing users flexibility and freedom to add new static pages, change the static pages or contents of static pages without the developer(s)/deployment team getting involved.   * we want developers to work on the dynamic portion of the website.  How to architect the website to make sure that the layout/look and feel of the website stays same across all the pages and achieve the above mentioned work? Any experience? Suggestions?
