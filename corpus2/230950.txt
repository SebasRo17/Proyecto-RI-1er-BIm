So, the last 2 weeks I have been fighting with `indexedDB` and one of two recurring questions that keep popping up is why `indexedDB` has to use/present it's entire versioning system? I do understand that in certain very specific cases it's a nice thing to have, but in those cases an `if(localstorage.dbversion <= ...)` would do, so is there some reason in respect to browser implementations/optimalizations that require this roundabout1 system? Or does it make indexedDB far more efficient or something? 1 Roundabout because **for example** in `onupgradeneeded` you get the transaction from `event.target.transaction` whereas in `onsuccess` you get it from the `result.transaction()`. And there are countless of other more complex examples. (Such as cases where `createStore` is called in response to various huge (too big to keep it all in memory) ajax calls)) * * * If this does not belong on Programmers, but after all on SO then my sincere apologies and I will re-ask it there. (Will remove this note in a bit if it turns out that this is the right place).
