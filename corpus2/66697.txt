I'm just wondering because the `.js` (JavaScript source files) on my computer have an icon from Windows Scripting Host which looks so Windows 95. I tried to look into `devenv.exe` but there aren't any differently colored icons for different languages' source files in it. Even better, of course, would be icons where the extension or something language specific (`++` or so) is featured in the icon. Do any of the DLLs or EXE files in the Visual Studio 2010 installation contain good icons or do you know of any other good source?
