While this may be a very subjective question I was wondering if there's a place (or many places) on the web where one can read up about good coding and performance tips for different languages and how they may compare with others? For example in AS3 it's faster to multiply rather than to divide, is this the same for JS? What other tips are there to really make our code run lightening fast? And where are these tips?
