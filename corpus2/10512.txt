I started, like many others, with console-based (as in terminal, not Playstation) programming. But sooner or later, one needs to touch upon GUI- based programming, whether you want to or not. This transition holds many changes in how you need to think about the frontend (and possibly also the backend). So, what are the major differences when moving from console-based programming to GUI-based programming?
