This is a real newbie question, so apologies in advance for may seem a very dumb question ... I'm trying to understand the various ways in which information can be retained in a notebook between sessions, using `DynamicModule[]` etc. Understanding how a good MMA user would solve the following simple task would be really helpful: Say I want to load a video file and then create a simple slider to scroll through the frames. This works:               frames = Import["myvideofile.avi", {"Frames", All}];      Manipulate[frames[[f]], {f, 1, Length[frames],1}]      But, say I want to remember which frame the slider was left at between Mathematica sessions, how would I do that elegantly? If I re-open the code above, there's an error because 'frames' isn't defined until the video is imported. In other words, upon re-opening the notebook, the first thing I'd like to happen is for 'frames' to be imported. I'm speculating that I need `DynamicModule`, with `Initialization` but have tried many different ways and can't get it to work.
