I think great technology is invisible. Besides the usual suspects (GHC, Xmonad, proprietary trading software) what great examples are there of end-user software written in Haskell? I think good examples are FreeArc, Hledger and "Nikki And The Robots". Do you have more examples (full blown GUI apps, small CLI tools, etc)? **Edit:** For example, I am fascinated by Wings3D, because, while it's written in Erlang, users cannot tell that. It just works. Among Haskell's weak spots are cross-platform GUIs. There are not many GUI apps written in Haskell in general and most of them are not easy to use, install or even compile. What are good examples to learn from how to make hard things look easy?
