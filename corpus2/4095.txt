How can one import the coordinates stored in a binary CHARMM/NAMD DCD file? This is the structure of the file:               HDR     NSET    ISTRT   NSAVC   5-ZEROS NATOM-NFREAT    DELTA   9-ZEROS     `CORD'  #files  step 1  step    zeroes  (zero)          timestep  (zeroes)                             interval     C*4     INT     INT     INT     5INT    INT             DOUBLE  9INT     ==========================================================================     NTITLE          TITLE     INT (=2)        C*MAXTITL                     (=32)     ==========================================================================     NATOM     #atoms     INT     ==========================================================================     X(I), I=1,NATOM         (DOUBLE)     Y(I), I=1,NATOM              Z(I), I=1,NATOM              ==========================================================================      A sample pdb and dcd file is here. A C plugin for reading the DCD can be found here. As with any file format without a rigid formal specification there is a lot of variation and different edge cases... * * * Surprisingly googling did not turn up any ready made recipes. I'm hoping somebody has something on the shelf:) Of course this is trivial to implement using `BinaryReadList`, so if nobody else answers, I will answer this question myself, there by still making it useful to the community.
