Are there any recommendations for book(s) that are largely agnostic (with examples of MQ implementations is fine) on vendor but go to great details on the architecture, management, nomenclature, atomicity, durability, patterns, and logical deployments on Message Queue systems? Surely there are enough shared concepts between MQ Series, MSMQ, SysV IPC (OK, that might be stretching it), RabbitMQ, &c &c?
