I have a data set where I really care mainly about visualizing the highest and lowest areas. DensityPlot suits my needs well, but ideally the maxima and minima would pop more from the rest of the data. I know that DensityPlot scales the data from your function to between zero and one before coloring it accordingly. I'd like to use a scaling that has more meat in the middle than theirs. So I was thinking I could take their scaling, and use it as an input to for example                (x-0.5)^3/8,       which has the properties `f[0]=0` and `f[1]=1`, but is better distributed for my purpose. Then I'd pass these values to the colorizer. Can't really figure out how to do this though. Any thoughts?
