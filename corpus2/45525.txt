Just curious about this, I'm about to leave this job for a variety of reasons but one thing is that the office I work in is a full open office with a few non-programmer employees in close proximity talking nearly all day on the phone, making sales calls etc. This is obviously terrible for concentration and in my opinion laughable that someone thinks this is a proper way to run a business where the core aspect of the business is software development. I'm just curious how common this would be, if anyone else has had a situation like this. It seems to me this is an obvious sign of a bad employer, I should have probably realized this earlier but I needed a job right away so I took it. I understand that programmers may have a shared room or space, but I would think that it would be the norm to keep things separated as far as people who talk on the phone for a living vs those who have to concentrate on a programming task.
