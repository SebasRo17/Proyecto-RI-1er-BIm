Consider the graph given by               graph = Graph[{2 <-> 1, 3 <-> 1, 7 <-> 1, 5 <-> 1, 6 <-> 1, 3 <-> 2, 4 <-> 3,         4 <-> 7, 4 <-> 5, 7 <-> 5, 6 <-> 5, 2 <-> 6}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YSTlc.png) Via Steinitz's theorem, this is the vertex graph of a convex polyhedron:               KVertexConnectedGraphQ[graph, 3] && PlanarGraphQ[graph]     -> True      **How can one construct that polyhedron (i.e. a spatial representation of it) from the graph?** Embedding the graph in 3-space using `GraphPlot3D` comes close, but does not actually build a polyhedron as the side view reveals:               GraphPlot3D[graph, Boxed -> False,          EdgeRenderingFunction -> (Cylinder[#1, .05] &),          VertexRenderingFunction -> (Sphere[#1, .1] &)]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G8FKC.png) (Note how the quadrilateral face is "bent".) I have experimented with various embeddings such as `"SpringEmbedding"`, `"SpringElectricalEmbedding"` etc. but none of them seem to produce a true polyhedron even from this simple graph. I am aware that the polyhedron representation of a polyhedral graph is not unique (maybe not even _topologically_ unique(?)) but any embedding that is a polyhedron would suffice. The polyhedral graphs supplied in Mathematica's graph database all come with such embeddings, so I am confident this must be possible.
