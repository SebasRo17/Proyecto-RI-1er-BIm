I have some Mathematica code that analyzes data in a database and uses `Message` to report when expected data is missing. By default, Mathematica will allow this message to appear only three times before it gets shut off, but I'd like this message to appear as often as the errors do. The solutions I can think of are               Off[General::stop];      but this kills limits for all error messages, not just this one, or just to switch to `Print`, which seems inelegant. Is there some way to allow this one message to appear more than three times, while leaving behavior unchanged for the rest?
