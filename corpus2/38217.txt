I looked at all the other questions related to mine before posting this, and they didn't solve my problem. I have a large data set which can be downloaded from here. I'm using the following code to plot the DFT:               data = ToExpression @ Import["http://ge.tt/api/1/files/3dvZMs61/0/blob?download"];     ListPlot[Abs[Fourier[data]], Joined -> True, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/apHNw.gif) As far as I can tell, there is no pronounced single or countable number of frequencies in this data set. However, if I just plot the data, I get:               ListPlot[data, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3CPpJ.gif) Here it is evident that there is a subtle periodic character, whose frequency is what I want. Why am I not getting that frequency as a peak in the first plot?
