For even `n >= 10 && n <= 98` I want to write `n` as the product of its two largest divisors (excluding `n` itself, i.e. `1 * 60 == 60` is not permitted). **EDIT** (to account for rasher's criticism) I have tried:               First@Reverse@Take[Transpose[{#, Reverse@#}], Length[#/2]/2] &[        Rest@Most@Divisors@#] & /@ {10, 12, 52, 60, 66, 70, 72, 98}      giving > {{2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 13}, {6, 10}, {6, 11}, {7, 10}, {8, 9}, {7, 14}} but this fails, f.e., on `16`, which should give `{4, 4}`
