I have been reading up on the seminal and excellent book _Code Complete_. It discusses about the various kinds of couplings that can happen between modules(which may be classes as well as methods):   1. _Simple-data-parameter-coupling_   2. _Simple-object-coupling_   3. _Object-parameter-coupling_   4. _Semantic coupling_ The book has to say this about _object-parameter coupling_ : > Two modules are object -parameter coupled to each other if `Object1` > requires `Object2` to pass it an `Object3`. This kind of coupling is tighter > than `Object1` requiring `Object2` to pass it only primitive data types > because it requires `Object2` to know about `Object3`. What is the author trying to mean here?
