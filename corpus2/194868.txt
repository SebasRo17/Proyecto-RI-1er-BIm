I plan to get a PhD in CS, concentrating in some subfield of artificial intelligence, not sure which one at the moment. I'm looking into R&D departments in industry, but there don't seem to be too many. For example, I have literally found hundreds of labs for the basic sciences and other engineering fields, but for CS I've found: Google, IBM Research, Microsoft Research, Yahoo Research, AT&T Research and GE Research. Are there not tons of companies like there are in other disciplines?
