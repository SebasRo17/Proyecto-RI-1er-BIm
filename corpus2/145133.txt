I have worked as a junior help desk sys admin, and in those days the only option for "monitoring" what other people was doing was by "shadowing" their screen , like windows remote desktop, RDP. Now I'm working as a mobile developer[iOS Android], and in the contract I saw a clause, where I accept to be monitored. So my question is what software is out there to monitor silently [with out the developer (me) knowing]. Would they see my screen?, or take snapshots? It's not that I waste time or do "illegal" activities, I'm just wondering if this is normal? and how to notice it? I'm using a Mac - if that makes any difference.
