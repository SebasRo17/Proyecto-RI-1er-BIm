I have a list of values of the form `{{a_1,b_1,c_1},{a_2,b_2,c_2}...}` where `a` goes from 0 to 30, `b` goes from 0 to 30, and `c` goes from 0 to .05. For some reason, when I plot this using `ListPlot3D` I get ranges of 1 to 4, 0 to 40, and 0 to 500 respectively (the number of data points that I am plotting. The exact command that I am using is: `ListPlot3D[data,PlotRange->{Full,Full,Full},AxesLabel->{"Length","Distance","Time"}]` Does anyone know what might be the issue? Note: If anyone wants to look at the actual data, I posted it here.
