I'm a writing a small webserver for personal use in c (not c++). I want to allow user input in the console like "shutdown server" or "restart server". In order to allow this kind of input the server is running in a seperate thread (pthreads), so the console isn't blocked. I also want this thread to print output in the console like "a new client connected" or "client requestet 'home.html'". > The problem is: If I'm typing something like "shutdown server" and at the > same time the thread prints something like "a new client connected" > everthing mixes up and I get something like "shuta new client connectedown > server" Is there an elegant way to print the output of the thread and at the same time allow the user to enter commands without both interfering? Or is this a stupid idea to begin with? If yes: Is there a standard way to handle things like that (i.e. to control server).
