Hi I'm absolutely newbie in Mathematica and have following problem: My list looks like `{{50, 0.75}, {51, 0.76}, ...`, and I want to choose a range out of my x-values (I don't want so say: _from point 150 to ..._ , I want to choose with values like _from x value 50 to 60_ ), with only these points a linear regression has to be done. I tried with `LinearModelFit[data, x, x]`, and Mathematica made a linear regression with all values, now I want to choose a range but I can't find a solution =( Has somebody an idea?
