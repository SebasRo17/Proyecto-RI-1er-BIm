I'm a beginner in programming. I am learning Python as a hobby. However, after reading some things in what concerns, for example, its speed, I asked again myself if I should really learn Python or learn other more difficult language. I am in sciences at school, and have interest in physics and microcontrollers, so a performance-wise language would be needed for, for example, computational calculations, and that. So probably a language like C or C++ would be more handy in terms of future university degree. So, my questions are:   * I saw that Python is an interpreted language, therefore slower (up to 100 times from C++, from what I read at Stack Overflow, which is a lot). Can't it be compiled so that no interpreter is needed and it has high speed? (like C is) I mean, it's what the interpreter does, isn't it?   * Does Python have any chance of being useful for science? How could it surpass it's speed lack?   * Isn't there the possibility of writing a program in Python, and translate it to C++ in order to compile? Therefore having the simple writing of Python and the speed of C++? Are there any Python-to-C++ translators?
