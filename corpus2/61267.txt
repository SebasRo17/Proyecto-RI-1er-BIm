I know "hi's" and such are not wanted on questions, but in this case an exception may be made (IMHO). Hi! I am a 16 years old and in my 4/6th year of pre-university education. Programming, math and algorithmics is my hobby and I enjoy it so much I have no doubt I will make it my job. In fact, I enjoy it so much that I spend pretty much all my free time one it, learning fast. However, I stumble upon one big problem: I have no teacher. On my school we have what we call "Informatica" (dutch), computer science in english. The level of this class is very low though, to the point I know more than the teacher. I occasionally buy books on programming, but english is not my mother tongue and sometimes I just waste hours or a day because I'm not familiar with a word (I wasted weeks before I understood the verb "to iterate over", something we don't have in dutch). Another thing is I have to learn everything myself. I had to teach myself what compiling, linking, libraries, including, etc, etc is. That took me **a lot** of time. Thank god there is stackoverflow. When I was completely stuck on something I could ask there and it would usually be solved within an hour. But I get stuck like every hour on something small every proffesional would sigh and shake it's head and explain it within 5 seconds. Now I would love it if there exists some free student-tutor program that assigns you with a _mentor_ or someone that you occasionally can chat/email with (on IRC, MSN, I don't care) asking your questions. So my question, do you know such program? (Or perhaps if you'd like to do it, who knows?) I'm sorry for my english if you spot any mistakes, I learned it all by myself too :) (once again the level of the english class at school is really basic)
