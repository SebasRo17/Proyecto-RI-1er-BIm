Got my first job at a startup in my final year, was with them for 2.5 years then started my own business. So far everything is going great, lots of clients and stead work etc, but coming right out of uni and into a start up I never had any form or senior software engineer guiding my work or suggesting improvements etc... Whats the best way for me to improve & learn more? Books? MS Exams? Other? I develop in C#, ASP.NET/MVC. **Update** The problem isn't really with releasing products, I've released quite a few which are up and running with customers happy. It's more with quality of code, best practices, how do I know something I am code is correct, it may work but there may be ways of coding it much more efficiently or by adhering to some kind of standard Cheers for any responses!
