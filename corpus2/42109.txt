Assuming[Element[n, Integers], Integrate[Sin[x]*Sin[n*x],{x,0,Pi}]]      returns 0, which is obviously wrong for n=1.               Assuming[n==1, Integrate[Sin[x]*Sin[n*x],{x,0,Pi}]]      does return Pi/2 (so in particular not 0). Just evaluating the integral yields               -Sin[n*Pi]/(-1+n^2)      which is indetermined for n=1. Can someone explain to me what Mathematica is doing and how to obtain a correct result?
