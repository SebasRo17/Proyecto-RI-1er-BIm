Just to give some context, my motivation for this programming question is to understand the derivation of the CSHS inequality and basically entails maximizing the following function:               Abs[c1 Cos[2(a1-b1)]+ c2 Cos[2(a1-b2)] + c3 Cos[2(a2-b1)] + c4 Cos[2(a2-b2)]]      where a1,b1,b2,and a2 are arbitrary angles and c1,c2,c3,c4 = $\pm 1$ ONLY. I want to be able to determine the maximum value of this function along with the combination of angles that lead to this maximum. Also NO angles can be equal to each other and ONLY an odd number of terms can have negative coefficients. Eventually, I also want to repeat the calculation for a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3 (which will have a total of nine cosine terms) When I tried putting the following code in Mathematica, it simply spat the input back at me and did not perform any computation, can someone help me out? (note my code didn't include the c1,c2,c3,c4 parameters, I wasn't quite sure how to incorporate them)               Maximize[{Abs[Cos[2 (a1 - b1)] - Cos[2 (a1 - b2)] + Cos[2 (a2 - b1)] + Cos[2 (a2 - b2)]],               0 <= a1 <= 2 Pi , 0 <= b1 <= 2 Pi,               0 <= a2 <= 2 Pi, 0 <= b2   <= 2 Pi}, {a1, b2, a2, b1}]
