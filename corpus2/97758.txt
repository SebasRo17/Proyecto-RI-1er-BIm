I have resigned my old employer to start a new job, and I need to prepare a handover [documentation to be taken by some new employee that haven't arrived yet, and would be some weeks from when I go to when they fill the position again]. So what important points should I make sure to cover, I was making some iOS apps, [90% completed], and a web portal [60% completed] the other IT engineer is here so he can update on passwords etc. Should I use some system like a wiki to leave things there for access? or just a normal doc? what other things should I consider?
