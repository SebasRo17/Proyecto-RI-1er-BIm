I will be extracting certain bits from log files using regular expressions to filter out bit of data. Initially I was going to do this with Python. I later started to think about the fastest way I can perform this task. This lead me to parallel programming. I remember hearing somewhere that Python can't be truly parallel. I'm by far an expert programmer. I have been playing with Java for a bit and I was considering parallel programming in Java to perform this task. I was wondering what would be the fastest way to perform this task?
