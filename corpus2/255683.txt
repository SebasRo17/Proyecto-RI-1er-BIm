I have an enterprise Java web application deployed in tomcat. I am looking for ways to integrate a HTML & JS UI with the mid tier java code. So far, looking around I have found that there are two ways good ways to do this which fit my requirements : 1) DWR - Direct web remoting 2) Use REST web services. I am not sure which approach to use. Edit: What is the advantage of using DWR over a rest WS design? Edit 2: I will most likely be using dojo for the UI development(Works well with REST/DWR??), and I want to keep the java code chages minimal. I understand that by using web services, I would have to write an additional WS client layer on top of the existing java code. Also, the usual enterprise needs, performance, scalability, etc.
