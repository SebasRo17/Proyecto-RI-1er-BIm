A question that I have been asking myself and really confused which path to take. So I need your guys help as to the pros and cons of these 2 professions in today's world. I love web applications development as the Web is the best thing to happen in this age and nearly everyone gets by on the World Wide Web. And also tend to keep learning about new technologies and about web services.      On the other hand I like software engineering also for the desktop applications as I have had experience with development small scale softwares in VB.Net, Java, C++, etc.      Which path has more scope and better future? Whats your view?
