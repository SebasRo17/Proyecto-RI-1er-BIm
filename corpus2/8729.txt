I'd like to write output in TraditionalForm into external text files `ofile.txt`. I tried to use               s = OpenWrite["/home/tigerhead/log/ofile.txt", FormatType -> TraditionalForm];     $Output = s;     <run various Mathematica programs>     Close[s];      but get errors:               Intersection::normal:         Nonatomic expression expected at position 2 in          Intersection[{StandardForm, TraditionalForm}, FormatType].     Options::optnf:         FormatType is not a known option for          Intersection[OutputStream[/home/tigerhead/log/ofile.txt, 21], {OutputStream[/home/tigerhead/log/ofile.txt, 20], OutputStream[stdout, 1],            OutputStream[stderr, 2], OutputStream[/home/tigerhead/<<38>>.txt,             21], stdout, stderr}].      Any one has a clue?
