I recently found the `PhysicalConstants`` package. First I thought this was nice, since I didn't have to look up some quantities all the time and copy them into the worksheet. But then I noticed the carried units. This is not automatically a bad thing, but it seems to me that they do not go together well, because Wolfram didn't just use base units. Consequently, if I use a quantity in `Newton` and divide it by a quantity in `Meter/Second^2`, the result will be `Newton*Second^2/Meter`, and not `Kilogram`. In my first try this made a huge mess in the result. Is there a way to work with these in a useful way?
