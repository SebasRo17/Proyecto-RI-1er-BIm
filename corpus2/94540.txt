Lets say a team member is on an annual leave. He won't be attending sprint planning but he will be back by mid of iteration/sprint. Lets say he has 50% capacity i.e. as he will be available for later half of the iteration, should we:   1. have a planning session with him after he is back.   2. have a planning session with him before he goes on annual leave i.e. before sprint planning.   3. don't schedule him for any task and assign him on non sprint tasks e.g. spikes etc   4. have his peers plan on his behalf during sprint planning and absent person can then add tasks when he is back and if he cannot do all the work he can descope.   5. have him sit with another developer and do pair programming for a while.   6. anything else.. i am interested to know what you are doing.. Note: We are doing (1) and it doesn't feel right.
