I would like to add a trusted a path in the global preferences of Mathematica for **Mac**. When I go to `NotebookSecurityOptions`, click the tool button for `TrustedPath`, and click 'Add', a dialog box appears and asks for a path. After reading the official documentation on Notebook Security, I still have no idea how to enter a simple, specific path (eg `~/Desktop`) into that box. I can't find a documentation for the `Filename` function as well, so I'm left with just guesswork. I have tried several guesses in vain.
