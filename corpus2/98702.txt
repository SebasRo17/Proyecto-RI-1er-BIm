Because of a change in technologies, we are doing a major version change in our in-house enterprise software. I am going to be doing the usual of interviews, observations and brainstorming sessions. What general (and fun!) questions do you recommend/use in a first pass to elicit the discovery or remembrance of new functionality or changes to existing functionality? (Too much literature on requirements gathering tells you the easy part: how to get details on functionality. Nobody seems to have much on actually eliciting the function at first!) Examples:   1. You have a magic wand. You can wave it and change one thing about General Software v1.0. What would you change, how and why?   2. Have you used any software where you wished something in it was also in General Software v2.0?   3. What functionality is too complicated in General Software v1.0?
