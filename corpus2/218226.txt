I am creating an application from legacy code using AngularJS. I wonder what parts of my code should be moved into a directive. For example, iI had thought of moving a table which is used multiple times across the application into a directive. The tables alter from headings and size. Is it worth the effort or even a good practice to turn such things into their own directives or should I create each table in a unique way?
