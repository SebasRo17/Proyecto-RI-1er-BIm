**edit** : I'm asking for samples an intern would want to show, please don't answer soft-skills that get this marked as a dupe, it is NOT. To be more specific, what sample apps and background, is minimum expectations for an intern? Yes, I pass the FAQ tests with this and it is related, let me narrow it down a bit though. So, when I went professional from hobbyist, I had to know C++ like english (a language), have the iOS manuals read, and at least be smart enough to learn libraries even if I haven't used them before. Besides algebra, the bar wasn't much higher than that. As an intern, I was not expected to architect, only to fix apps. Right now, I am tutoring someone. I am his only rubric, so I need help from others on this so he knows when he's "hirable", in the programming field. I realize a definite this/that is impossible, but a rough estimate on what your company expects of interns or learning people is all I need. For example, I would expect sample apps that 1) Consume a web service. 2) Transition between view controllers. 3) Show a simple game, cards or board, that show off basic state transitions and iOS workflows. We do not need to debate the philosophy of learning attitudes and other soft skills, just what sample apps we look for. Soft skills questions get closed, this is programming-specific. We can infer the rest based on the samples one would look for. Specifically iOS apps. If you have a design pattern addition to an app, feel free. Thank you for answering. This question is hard to word, I saw so many relevant ones get closed, but as far as I can tell I match the topics
