By day, I'm a PowerBuilder developer. By night, I dream of being a .NET developer. Sure, I can self-teach mostly everything I need, but I also love classroom learning and 'earning' my education. I am considering 'attending' the SetFocus course for .NET development. My hesitations? It's expensive. Anyone? Feel free to tell me its a crazy idea, regardless of the money. I'm interested in your opinions.
