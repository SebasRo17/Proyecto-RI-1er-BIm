We have a large web site written in `WebForms` and have begun implementing some new modules in MVC. We have a custom CMS in place. I put the data structure to hold CMS data in a `BaseModel` class. Now I`m wondering where would be the best palce to put the logic which calls the CMS data manager to get data relevant to the page. On one hand, I can create a `BaseModel`, which in its constructor receives a page Id, and calls the CMS manager. Then build all models on that model. On the other hand, I can do the same in a `BaseController`. I can't decide which is more correct, since I cannot think of any advantage one will have over the other. Most of my experience is in `WebForms`, so I am wondering what would be the more ASP.NET MVC way of placing this logic.
