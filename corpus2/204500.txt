While getting my code reviewed here the issue of using the `const` keyword came up. I understand that it is used for implementing read-only behaviour on variables. I am confused about what are the various situations when it can be useful.   * Should it be used for the sake of clarity in function prototypes?   * Should it be used as a security measure during code development?   * Should it be used in the scope of various functions for declaring run-time constants?   * Should it be used at all? These question are just examples of the confusion that I am facing. The general confusion is   * When should be the `const` keyword used in C programming?    * What are the various types of benefits that can be gained by using this keyword in C?   * Are there any cons of using `const` keyword? * * * It has been pointed that this question may be too broad due to all these questions in the detail of my question. I just wanted to clarify that these questions are just to clarify the confusion regarding the main question. > When and for what purposes should the const keyword be used in C for > variables? It can also be rephrased as > The proper use of `const` keyword in C` with the pros and cons of the same.
