Suppose a class allows some kind of configuration that has some well-known default values but also has the option of defining a custom value. For example, suppose you want to let users configure a person's title. They can choose from a set of standard values (Mr., Mrs., Ms., etc.) but they can also specify a custom (Dr.). What is the most elegant way to put this in an API? Some examples in Java:               public class Person {       public enum Title {MR, MRS, MS, CUSTOM};            setTitle(Title title, String customTitle);     }      This one is quite bad because whenever you specify anything else than Title.CUSTOM the second argument is silently ignored. So maybe:               public class Person {       public enum Title { MR, MRS, MS, CUSTOM};            setTitle(Title title);       setCustomTitle(String title);     }      I don't really like this one either, because it's not immediately clear that calling one will overwrite the effects of the other method. Is there a more elegant interface that I'm overlooking?
