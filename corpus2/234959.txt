I am considering going back to college to get a computer science degree so that I can become a software developer. (I'm only 23, by the way.) The main reason that I am reluctant to study CS is that I have read that because technology changes so fast software developers have to spend a lot of time learning new material. For example, somebody on this website stated that everything college students learn will be obsolete by the time they graduate. Somebody else stated that half of everything a computer scientist knows will be obsolete in 18-24 months. Anyway, how much time outside of work do software developers have to spend learning new technology? I would appreciate any advice.
