I am given a certain function $f(k_1)$ that I would like to minimize. Asking Mathematica to do it (and supplying the given bounds of other parameters in the expression) I get the following result:               f[k1,k2] = (k2 * r + k1)/(r + (k2*r + k1 -1)*d) + (k1 * r + k2)/(r + (k1*r + k2 -1)*d)     k2 = 2*n/(r+1)-k1       Minimize[f, {k1 >= 0, r >= 2, n >= 2,k1 <= 2*n/(1+r),  d >= 2, d <= r}, {k1}]      > >      {Piecewise[{{f, d >= 2 && r >= d && n >= 2}}, Infinity], >          {k1 -> Piecewise[{{n/(r+1), d >= 2 && r >= d && n >= 2}}, > Indeterminate]}} >   My question now is: What is this result supposed to mean? Somehow I am not able to understand what the output tells me about the minimum of the function I am trying to minimize.
