Obviouslyï¼Œthe equation $x^2-3 y^2=2 z^2$ doesn't have positive integer solutions. I tried               Exists[{x, y, z}, x > 0 && y > 0 && z > 0 && x^2 - 3 y^2 == 2 z^2]     Resolve[%, Integers]      and               Exists[{x, y, z}, Element[{x, y, z}, Integers],       x > 0 && y > 0 && z > 0 && x^2 - 3 y^2 == 2 z^2]     Resolve[%]      but I don't get any useful result. Am I using these functions incorrectly?
