Is there a language with something like the following construct?               var_type(TYPE_1, TYPE_2,..., TYPE_N) obj;      and now its possible to:               TYPE_17 staticTypeVariable17;     obj = staticTypeVariable17;          TYPE_3 staticTypeVariable3;     obj = staticTypeVariable3;      without `obj` being a pointer of some base class and with no need for casting if the types used are from the predefined set. So basically an object that can switch it's type amongst a predefined set of types.
