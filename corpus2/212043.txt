If I am loading a whole load of items (un-ordered words from a file or something) would it be more efficient to load them all to a Ruby array, and then use the built in `sort!` method or to do a binary lookup for the place of each item in the list as I load it, and add it in that position. Basic code:               array = []     lines.each do |line|         array.push line     end     array.sort!      vs               array = []     lines.each do |line|         array.insert(find_index(line), line)     end      `find_index()` would lookup the correct index for the item in the array using a binary search.
