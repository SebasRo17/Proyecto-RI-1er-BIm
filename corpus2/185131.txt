Recently my Scrum team has received several requests for optimizing certain parts of our code. Looking at the software with a profiler found some spots where the code could be improved. We agreed to plan mostly based on user stories to ensure that everything we do has actual benefit for an end user, but how would this story be phrased? I can't come up with a good wording for them. How would we best plan such effort? is there a good way of talking about performance optimizations in terms of user stories?
