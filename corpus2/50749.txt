So...my recruiter just called me to confirm my interview on Thurs. He also mentioned that I am going to be asked to answer for two analytic questions. He gave me a little bit about those questions.   1. There are eight balls. One of them is defective.    2. There are three incandescent light bulbs inside a room, but switches are placed outside. These are all he said. I think that these are not completed question. Anyone knows what questions these are?? Does my question belong to programmer.stackexchange.com? I thought it would because it is related to interview questions.
