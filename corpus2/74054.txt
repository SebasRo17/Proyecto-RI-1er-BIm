Right now, I use Python for my quick scripts and prototypes (e.g. algorithms, my pseudocode is very Python-like as well). The oher languages that I am familiar with include Java, C, x86 Assembly and Scheme, and Python is pretty much the best for this among these in my opinion. Perl gets a lot of rep for this over and over again, and I have heard that Ruby isn't bad either, and the Python community praises Python for this too. What language (could be another one than these 3) do you think is the best programming language for:   * Creating quick prototypes of applications or algorithms   * Creating simple scripts for small, repetitive tasks Important features for such languages include:   * Little boilerplate code, not too verbose   * (Very) high-level   * Interpreted   * Good and comprehensive standard library
