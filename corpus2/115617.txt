I was looking for a good C# book for beginners to learn the language fundamentals and OOP fundamentals, however, every book I have looked at seems to start quickly and does not touch the fundamentals in a professional learning way or maybe the authors are good at programming but not so good at how to teach the subject to others. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information about C#? What about that book makes it special?
