I need to export some (2D) graphs from mathematica in eps format (only, unfortunately). The graphs are of similar nature (plotted from our different functions), and I have used the `PlotRange` option to make all the graphs of equal size (in both `x` and `y` direction). However, while exporting, we get the exported files of slightly unequal size. This creates a problem while putting in some document, as when we scale it to the same size, the font size looks different (which, needless to say are same for everyone). I tried to use the `ImageSize` option, but definitely I am making some mistakes, as I am not getting the graphics ( or to be precise getting a small part of the graphics). So my question is, what is the best way to export all of them in a fixed size, say of 5cm x 4cm? I use version 7. Advanced thanks for any help.
