_Mathematica_ computes for n = 1,2,...:               (-1)^n (LegendreP[n, -1, -3]/Sqrt[2])      > >     -I, -3 I, -11 I, -45 I, -197 I, ... >   _Maple_ computes for n = 1,2,...:               (-1)^n*LegendreP(n, -1, -3)/sqrt(2)      > >     1, 3, 11, 45, 197, ...   >   Question: Is there a bug or just different definitions? **Edit:** Which one conforms with the (standard) definition in the _Handbook of Mathematical Functions_ respectively with the definition in DLMF?
