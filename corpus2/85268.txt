I have an iPhone app out that stores data on the device. I want to create an app with user accounts like Instagram, Path, Foursquare, Gowalla, etc. What would you recommend for the quickest and easiest way to get an app of this nature (social, iPhone) going? I'm deciding between RoR or PHP still. Will the final stack come down to: iPhone --> RestKit --> RoR/PHP --> MYSQL? I have a solid background in iOS development, but not the rest.
