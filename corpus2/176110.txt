I want to write a test for a method that accesses a database such as following.               public class MyClass{         public String getAddress(Int id){             String query = "Select * from Address where id="+id;             //some additional statements                        resultSet = statement.executeQuery();             return result.getString(ADDRESS);                 }     }      How can I test this method? I am using Java.
