I'm working on a small team that will begin working on a large new project with another small team. The other team is currently working on a legacy system that they have been working on for years. The manager has decided that the developers from my team will be rotating every few months to replace developers working on the legacy system. That way the other team will have a chance to work on the new project and have a better understanding of the new system. **I want to know the benefits and drawbacks (if any) of rotating the developers from the project every 2-3 months.** I know that this is a similar question to "Is rotating the lead developer a good or bad idea?", but that question focuses on a lead developer. This question is about rotating the entire team on and off the project (tech. lead for the new project may or may not be rotated -- I don't know yet).
