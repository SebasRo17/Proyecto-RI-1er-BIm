Is it possible to find a function if first few terms of the expansion is known. For example if I have this series $f(x)=\frac{k^3 x^2}{6}-\frac{k^5 x^4}{120}+\frac{k^7 x^6}{5040}-\frac{k^9 x^8}{362880}+\frac{k^{11} x^{10}}{39916800}+\cdots$, is it possible to find what would be the full function? (answer: $k- \sin(kx)/x$). One suggestion I find for a problem close to this is to use `GeneratingFunction`, but for that It is necessary to know the form the $n^\text{th}$ term in terms of the exponent of different variable which is often quite difficult. What I am looking for is an algorithm which can guess a possible form of the full function if first few terms are given.
