I have a `DateListPlot`, much the same as below, that I want to overlay text onto. I'd like the text to be wrapped in a frame much the same way as the legend box is, but I can't figure out how to do it. I've tried the cheaters way of putting a rectangle beneath the text, but then I can't get the rounded corners to match the legend box. I am also unable to changed the thickness of the legend frame. Any help would be greatly appreciated.               DateListPlot[{FinancialData["IBM", "Jan. 1, 2008"],        FinancialData["GOOG", "Jan. 1, 2008"]}, Joined -> False,       ImageSize -> Large, AspectRatio -> .3, FrameLabel -> {None, "Price"},       Epilog -> {Text[Style["Several\nLines\nof Text", 12],          Scaled[{0.02, .5}], {-1, 0},          Background -> RGBColor[1, 1, 1, .8]]},       PlotLegends ->        Placed[PointLegend[{"IBM", "GOOGLE"}, LabelStyle -> 12,          LegendFunction -> (Framed[#,              FrameStyle -> Directive[Thickness[.05]], RoundingRadius -> 4,              Background -> RGBColor[1, 1, 1, .8]] &)], {{.98, .95}, {1,           1}}]]      ![CurrentPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TSd0F.png)
