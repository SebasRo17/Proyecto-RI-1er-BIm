Is it ok to use a localized encoding (i.e. ISO-8859-15) instead of ANSI/UTF-8/some standard for code? What when you have names that do not translate very well into english code? Or when your company and your customers are (and always will be) local and not international, like governments? And what about using special characters like people in almost all countries have? What do you think, what encodings do you use?
