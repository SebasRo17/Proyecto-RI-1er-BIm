I'm consistently being asked by a colleague to shorten my identifiers (class names, mostly). We use CamelCase and rarely if ever use 4 words in a name, but I often get requests to shorten from 3 to 2 or even from 2 to 1. I favor the most descriptive name and am able to find one of acceptable length, 95% of the time that is 3 words or less. **Would you try to go shorter?** Recently it occurred to me that he may not have auto-completion, but would not ask him this because I wouldn't like to offend him. He's a vi/vim guy which made me thinking....
