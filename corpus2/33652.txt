What's the right way to generate a random probability vector $p={p_1,\ldots,p_n} \in {(0,1)}^n$ where $\sum_i p_i=1$, uniformly distributed over the $(n-1)$-dimensional simplex? What I have is               Intervals = Table[{0, 1}, {i, n}]     RandomPoint := Block[{a},         a = RandomVariate[UniformDistribution[Intervals]];         a/Total[a]];      But I am unsure that this is correct. In particular, I'm unsure that it's any different from:               RandomPoint := Block[{a},         a = Table[Random[], {i, n}];         a/Total[a]];      And the latter clearly will not distribute vectors uniformly. Is the first code the right one?
