My employer is still in the dark ages when it comes to software development, test, build and deploy. Our development to deployment application lifecycle is:   1. Once development/changes are done we build an msi package using a visual studio setup and deployment project.   2. Msi is placed in a network folder   3. instructions are given to relevant team to deploy package.  A deploy for a windows application can consist of an msi, Sql scripts and application configuration changes, and the deployment of these is all manual. We are now looking to automate the build and deployment process for our Windows and Web applications. Most of our apps don't have unit tests which can be run automatically but going forward we will. What is the best way to do this?
