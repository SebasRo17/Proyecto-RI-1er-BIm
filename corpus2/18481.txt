For a little project I need to calculate the period of a Fibonacci sequence modulo p, for which p is a prime number. For example, the Fibonacci sequence modulo 19 would be: $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 2, 15, 17, 13, 11, 5, 16, 2, 18, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2...$$ As you can see, the sequence repeats after 18 numbers. The formula for a Fibonacci sequence is given by: $f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)$. In my attempt at making a program, I came up with the following:               newrow[a_, b_, c_] := Module[{f, g},       f[n_] := f[n] = f[n - 1] + f[n - 2];       f[0] = a;       f[1] = b;       g[n_] := Mod[f[n], Prime[c]];       L = Table[g[n], {n, 0, Prime[c]^2} ];       number1 = Flatten[Position[L, g[0]]];       number2 = Flatten[Position[L, g[1]]];       number3 = Select[number1, (MemberQ[number2, # + 1] ) &];       period = number3[[2]] - 1;       Return[         period       ]     ]      However, if I want to calculate it for quite some prime numbers at once like this:               Table[newrow[0, 1, i], {i, 1, 50}]      the computer can't handle it. Might there be an easier algorithm for this? I also tried this, but this seems to be even harder for the computer:               anderrijtje[a_, b_, c_] := Module[{f, g},       f[n_] := f[n] = f[n - 1] + f[n - 2];       f[0] = a;       f[1] = b;       g[n_] := Mod[f[n], c];       Return[         For[           k = 1, Not[{g[0], g[1]} == {g[k], g[k + 1]}], k++, {}         ];       k       ]     ]      Thanks in advance for any help.
