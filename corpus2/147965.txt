I went through a line somewhat like this "PHP has no native support for Unicode". Also i read that Python has native support for Unicode. Now you can call a function `utf8_encode()` in PHP to encode a string into Unicode and you can use a function `unicode()` in Python to convert a string to unicode. So what does it mean to support Unicode natively? _Also some languages have native support for concurrency while some dont have a native support._ So what is meant by > X language natively supports feature Y
