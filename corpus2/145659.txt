Many apps have a Free version and a Full version. How is it compared to, installing a single version, and use an in-app purchase of $0.99 or $1.99 to unlock to the program to make it a full version? It does have the advantage that the user doesn't have to go to the App Store and install the program one more time and thus making it easier for the users to purchase.
