I have been tasked with becoming the Administrator for a large enterprise software system that consists of several shrink wrapped applications and some home grown 'glue' and has a couple of hundered users across three continents. What do you think are the aspects / points I need to address? At the moment the best I can come up with is a quote from Kathy Sierra's Creating Passionate Users blog post: > How does this help the users kick ass? which seems helpful as a mantra, but not very concrete.
