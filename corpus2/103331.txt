I've been at my first job for about 2 months and I've started to notice that there is a delicate balance between workload and helping new-hires. Since there is a lot of pressure from managmanet to fix bugs and resolve as many customer issues as possible everyone on the team seems to be very focused on their backlog of work instead of helping the new-hires get up to speed. The new-hires can ask questions and occaisonally we'll get a developer to sit down and help us but often we'll get an obscure answer that only a veteran of the product would understand because they are too busy with their task. I understand the the new-hire must also maintain a balance. Sometimes it will take a new-hire 3 days to investigate and fix something where a veteran could have done it in 20 minutes. New-hires need to show effort toward learning the product and the codebase. With out simply reducing the workload of the veterans, how can you balance between helping new-hires and continuing to work on your backlog at a reasonable rate?
