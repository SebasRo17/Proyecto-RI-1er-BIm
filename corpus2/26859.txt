`BarChart` is aggravating. Why don't the following correctly display both percentages and labels? (1)               BarChart[{{1,2,3}},       ChartLayout -> "Stacked",        ChartLabels ->          {Placed[{"17%", "33%", "50%"}, Center, Style[#, FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 11]&],          Placed[{"aa", "bbb", "cccc"}, After, Style[#, FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 14]&]},       AspectRatio -> 2,       ImageSize -> 100]      The text labels are rendered correctly (based on an A to a similar Q by Pinguin Dirk here, turns out that the `After` option left-justifies the text, while numerical parameters don't, even with `TextAlignment -> Left` set in `Style`): ![chart with incorrect label display](http://i.stack.imgur.com/REJXa.jpg) I have also tried using `LabelingFunction`: (2)               BarChart[{{1, 2, 3}}, ChartLayout -> "Stacked",      ChartLabels ->        Placed[{"aa", "bbb", "cccc"}, After,         Style[#, FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 14] &],      LabelingFunction -> Placed[{"17%", "33%", "50%"}, Center],      AspectRatio -> 2, ImageSize -> 100]      But it doesn't display _any_ numbers: ![the labels don't work here, either](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rDFm9.jpg) Finally, this works: (3)               BarChart[{{1, 2, 3}}, ChartLayout -> "Stacked", ChartLabels -> {        Placed[{Style[#, FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 10] & /@ {"17%", "33%",             "50%"},          Style[#, FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 14] & /@ {"aa", "bbb",             "cccc"}}, {Center, After}]},      AspectRatio -> 2, ImageSize -> 100]      ![finally, a proper chart!](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bkTNr.jpg) Is the syntax in (1) and (2) incorrect, or are those bugs? Also note that `FontSize` doesn't match. If it is set to the same value for both numerical and text labels, the numerical values look larger. What's going on there?
