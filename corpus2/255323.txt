I have read a TDD book by Kent Beck as well as other Unit Testing tutorials. Most of the tutorials explain how to use a tool or give simple/silly examples. Here on stackoverflow there are a bunch of questions on _HOW_ to test for iOS, but I want to know _WHAT_ should be tested on iOS/mobile apps in general. Specifically:   1. What type of tests should you write for network/API calls? (Do you actually hit the endpoint or just mock up JSON? Do you test error handling?)   2. What type of tests should you write for data persistence (esp Core Data)   3. It is easy to write tests for the Model layer (and any model functions), but what should you test on the Controller layer?   4. What other mobile-specific tests might you write? For sake of greater clarity, what Unit Test might you write if you were building a Netflix app which contains features such as streaming video, image caching, local persistence, network calls,etc?
