I'm writing my CV, and having trouble explaining about the software for enterprise I developed in my previous job. Now I'm thinking of writing following 4 things for each software.   * Abstract explanation about what the software is used for   * How much was the software sold   * About how many data does the software usually handle   * About how many DB tables does the software have Are there any inappropriate ones in these? Or, anything I should add?
