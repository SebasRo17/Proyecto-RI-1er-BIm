I'm using multiple third party javascript libraries in my website, and right now I'm keeping each third party library as a separate .js file, with its own `<script>` tag. But I would like to use the Closure Compiler with Advanced Optimizations. This requires that I either concatenate all the javascript in my website together or make a lot of modifications to my code. Obviously, I would prefer to simply concatenate all the javascript together then run it through Closure Compiler, but then where would I put the licenses and attribution for this code? Not only that, but the actual 3rd party code will be modified as it runs through the Compiler. All the third party libraries either use MIT, BSD, or CC0 1.0 Universal.
