I have a main template like website I have made that will allow me to quickly roll out and make new websites on demand when I need them, for my personal use. I'm wondering what is the best practice when using a Git repo is for this practice. My goal is that if for example down the road I'd like to make a change to all the sites at once, I can simply change the master (Repo) and have this change applied to all other versions of the template. Currently I have my template hosted privately on BitBucket. I'm assuming it is best to git clone the repo, and then makes changes on the clone. Then when I make changes to the template I do a git pull on the sites. Is this is the ideal approach, or are there better methods to do this?
