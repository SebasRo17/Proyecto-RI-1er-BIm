Being a young and fairly inexperienced developer recently employed by a "real" software company I'd like some opinions and pointers on how to do the following: **Approaches on how to get familiar with a companies products , especially when you've no idea how it all works**. The company I'm at now has one HUGE product , continually evolving and having been here for 2 weeks I've still no idea how it all sticks together apart from a special kind of glue made from the tears and frustration of young developers, it's incredibly fragmented and only 4 people in the office know the inner workings, all of them constantly busy **Give useful input on the product :** Now, I know I'm just a kid in the company and I can't be expected to deliver anything ground-breaking in my first months, but you have to give as much as you're paid. I'm getting around twice as much as at my previous job but objectively speaking I've not done anything to deserve it yet. Just sat around staring at my laptop screen trying to decipher code. Now you might say that this is what I'm here for , to start off with at least, but at my previous job I was something of a go-to-guy, making decisions and contributing to almost every aspect of the company's daily running. While that was a lot of work I enjoyed the feeling of being 'connected' in the inner workings of the company I have a stake in (a symbiotic relationship if you will). _please edit this point down, I'll leave it up to you guys to decide what's important_ _I'll post more things as I think of them, have to get back to reading and writing something only vaguely resembling C#_
