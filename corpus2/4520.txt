My heart soared to discover that Mathematica 8 offers support for specifying a weighted adjacency matrix in WeightedAdjacencyGraph. But it seems that, regardless of the weights between edges, the plotted layouts of the graphs are the same. For instance, the graphs produced here are the same:               adjMat1 = {{Infinity, 1, 1, 1, 1},     {1, Infinity, 1, 1, 1},     {1, 1, Infinity, 1, 1},     {1, 1, 1, Infinity, 1},     {1, 1, 1, 1, Infinity}};          adjMat2 = {{Infinity, 8, 6, 3, 7},     {1, Infinity, 1, 1, 1},     {2, 5, Infinity, 9, 4},     {1, 1, 1, Infinity, 1},     {1, 1, 1, 1, Infinity}};          WeightedAdjacencyGraph[adjMat1, DirectedEdges -> True]     WeightedAdjacencyGraph[adjMat2, DirectedEdges -> True]      I've tried specifying different layouts, but can't get them to display differently. Is there any way to get graphs with different edge weights but the same connectivity to render with the edge weights interpreted as distance between the nodes?
