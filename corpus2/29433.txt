I'd like to invoke `RowReduce` on some matrices with a time parameter. For example consider               A = {{1, 0}, {0, t}}      If `t = 0`, we have               RowReduce[A /. t -> 0] = {{1, 0}, {0, 0}}      but `RowReduce[A]` always returns the identity matrix. How can I tell _Mathematica_ to distinguish cases where there might be division by zero? **Edit** : Maybe I need to clarify my problem a bit more. I don't know much about the matrices, except that they contain some time dependence. Now, whatever form the given matrix has, I want to perform some operation to attain a (time-depending) row-echelon form of my matrix that is valid for all $t \in I\subseteq\mathbb{R}$.
