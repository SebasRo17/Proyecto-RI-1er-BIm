I have a pre-processed image, from which I have to get coordinates of some components. ![sample image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xg4lA.png) There are 7 green components (pigs actually) that I have already isolated from an angry bird screen shot. So what I want is to locate those six components on the image. I tried               ImageValuePositions[u, RGBColor[1, 0, 0], .1]     { Mean[#1], Mean[#2]}& @@@ Transpose /@ FindClusters[%];     LocatorPane[ %, sample image]      But it doesn't work at all. Could anyone help me out? ![sample2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZZyLq.png) How should I figure this out?
