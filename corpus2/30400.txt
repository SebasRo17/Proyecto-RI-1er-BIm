I have seen NDSolve and ParamtericPlot3D used for things like the Lorenz Attractor, but was wondering if there is a way to draw a 3D phase portrait for a system. Something akin to this: http://www.mapleprimes.com/questions/35774-Phase- Portrait-In-3D Does MMA have something built-in to do this and I have just discovered Trekker, but have not explored it and a search did not turn anything up readily. Thanks for any insights.
