I would like to know how to plot when I have a large number of points (arround 600) in a specific format:               X          Y     1.000E-03 1.251E+01      1.500E-03 1.201E+01      2.000E-03 1.144E+01      2.484E-03 1.088E+01      2.484E-03 1.088E+01      2.534E-03 1.082E+01      2.586E-03 1.076E+01      2.586E-03 1.076E+01      3.000E-03 1.027E+01      3.066E-03 1.019E+01      3.066E-03 1.019E+01       All I need is to draw a line trought those points, but it would be anoying to write points in format `(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ...`. It would be tedious if I had to insert the commas and braces by hand for every pair of points coordinates. I'm totaly new in _Mathematica_ and I would appreciate help.
