I don't know if this issue has been discussed before, if anyone know any related post, please let me know, thank you :) `Unprotect` the function `Sin` and create a new definition for it:               Unprotect[Sin];     Sin[x_] := x^2;      Because `x_` matches any expression, then I think (naively) the system definition of `Sin` would never be applied.               {Sin[2], Sin[1.2], Sin[Sin]}     (*        {4, 1.44, Sin^2}     *)      Every thing works as expected except for `Plot`:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, Pi}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6XmSH.jpg) I think it's related to the internal computation of `Plot`, I checked the mass output of `Trace` and found nothing useful. I know it's stupid to modify a system symbol this way, but could you please give me some explanation? Thanks in advance.
