It's understandable that after a big development effort, some OSS authors deem reasonable that the project users should make an effort too in order to get started. Can the source code effectively be the project's documentation? Does it need to be structured in a particular way in order to achieve this? And how often is this approach taken? Of course this only would be feasible if the project is aimed to developers, and written in the same targeted language of the application (e.g. you can't understand the V8 engine only knowing JavaScript).
