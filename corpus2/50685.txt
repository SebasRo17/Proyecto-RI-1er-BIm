I am trying to use `Button` as a controller in `Manipulate`. I have done some thing like this:               Manipulate[       p = Column[{Plot[Sin[x - n], {x, 0, 12.4}, ImageSize -> 500]}],        {n, 0, 1},        Button["Export", Export["test.jpg", p]]]      Is there any better way to do this? I am thinking of making something like this:               Manipulate[       Column[{p = Plot[Sin[x - n], {x, 0, 12.4}, ImageSize -> 500],        If[x, Export["test.jpg", p]]}],        {n, 0, 1},        {x, {False, True}}]      in which the controller `x` is represented by `Button` instead of a `Checkbox`. How can I do that?
