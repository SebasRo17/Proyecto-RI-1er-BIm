Why does `DiscretizeGraphics` seems to work on one `GraphicsComplex` and not the other? Here is an example that works:               v = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};     p1 = Graphics[GraphicsComplex[v, Polygon[{1, 2, 3, 4}]]];     DiscretizeGraphics[p1]      But this does not               p2 = Graphics3D[First@ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[t],  Sin[u], c Sin[t]},         {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}]];     DiscretizeGraphics[p2]          (*The function DiscretizeGraphics is not implemented for \      GraphicsComplex[{{0.9999999999998993`,4.487989505128125`*^-7,*)      But `p2` is a GraphicsComplex? Looking at `FullForm[p2]` ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UmA56.png) Here is the `FullForm` for `p1` ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C8qcA.png) Are not `p1` and `p2` both `GraphicsComplex` ? `p1` is `2D` and `p2` is `3D`, but are they not both considered `GraphicsComplex`? ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mOlfR.png) It will good to know exactly what can and what can not be discretized. I tried to find this, but could not. All what I see are examples of usages so far. reference: http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-10/data-and-mesh- regions/discretizing-graphics.html http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DiscretizeGraphics.html?q=DiscretizeGraphics ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x61d6.png) I also looked at possible issues, and did not notice anything about this. Only one that came close is this `multiple volume primitives is not supported`. Is this the case here?
