Let's say I have a model that has 'purchase' method. The purchase method should take care of purchasing a product. Signature of purchase               public function purchase($token, Model_Member $member, Model_Product $product, Model_Recipient $recipient);      To call this method, I need to make $member, $product, and $recipient in my controller. Is it considered a better approach to pass an array of values to the **purchase** so that purchase can make those required objects like below?               public function purchase($token, $member_id, $product_id, array $recipient);      in this case, **purchase** should pull up a member record from the database and make a model of it. What's the better approach?
