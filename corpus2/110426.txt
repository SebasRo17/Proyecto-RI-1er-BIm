What licensing issues arise if I install and use Microsoft Office software (in this case Visio) as part of my web service backend? My company's flagship piece of software can convert Microsoft Visio files for use in their environment, but of course requires a local install of Visio to decode the files. The system I'm to create is to offer a sort of web service where people can upload their Visio files, and then we can show off one of the benefits of buying our full price software. In order to do this I'd need an install of our software on the server, as well as Visio. What I'm a little concerned about is technically any visitor to the site is technically using Visio. I can't really find any other examples when searching online so any advice would be greatly appreciated!
