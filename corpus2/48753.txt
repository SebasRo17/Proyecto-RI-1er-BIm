I am trying to do something very simple in Mathematica 9. I want to play around with option pricing and for that I thought it best to use the new stochastic process functionality. So, first of all I simulate one instance of a geometric brownian motion: $$ \frac{dX_t}{X_t} = \mu dt + \sigma dW_t\\\ dW_t \sim N(0, 1) $$ Which in Mathematica is:               proc = ItoProcess[        \[DifferentialD]x[t]/         x[t] == \[Sigma] \[DifferentialD]w[t] + \[Mu] \[DifferentialD]t,         x[t],         {x, x0},        t,        w \[Distributed] WienerProcess[]];      And here's an example of what I get, when I plot it, assuming $X_0 = 100$. ![Example of a GBM](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UFebR.png) So, okay, when I create a plot of a `RandomFunction` of the process, then I actually plot the `TemporalData` for $X_t$ and not $dX_t$. Cool, whatever. But now I want to plot, say $f(dX_t)$ or $f(X_t)$, where I would like to define $f$ as I see fit. And this is where I hit a brick wall. I have tried looking for hints in the docs or for answers here, but there are no definitive ones or the ones that seem to work. I also feel, that I'm missing something fundamental here. Could somebody kindly suggest an answer or the venue of inquiry?
