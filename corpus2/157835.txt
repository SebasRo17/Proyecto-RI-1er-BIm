I am a Computer Technician without a computer science background and planning to become a Java programmer. My question is, if I pass a Java certification, would that be enough to for me to get a job since I don't have Bachelor's degree in computer science? More generally, can programmer certifications substitute for a specific degree requirement in a job posting?
