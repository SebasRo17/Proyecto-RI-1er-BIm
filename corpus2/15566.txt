I am trying to aquire data through Mathematica's WebServices and this example works just fine:               <<WebServices`     InstallService["http://www.webservicex.net/CurrencyConvertor.asmx?WSDL"]     ConversionRate["USD","RUB"]      However, when I try to install this service:               InstallService["http://cbr.ru/secinfo/secinfo.asmx?WSDL"]      Mathematica returns with error messages:               LoadSchema::unsupported: any is not supported in sequence.     LoadSchema::elementschema: The element schema cannot be found for {http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema, schema}.      I'm not very well versed in XML however it seems that there's an "any" tag present in the code of the service, is that a provider's mistake?
