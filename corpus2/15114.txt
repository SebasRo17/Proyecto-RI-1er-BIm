String manipulation takes a dive when characters beyond `\:FFFF` are used e.g. Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols. The characters display fine but doing string manipulation is very unpredictable:               ToCharacterCode[""] (* Actually is \U0001d56c *)     StringLength[""]     (* {55349, 56684} *)     (* 2 *)      Compare with python               >>> len(u'')      1      `$CharacterEncoding = "Unicode"` or `$CharacterEncoding = "UTF8"` does not help, is there some way to set string encoding properly?
