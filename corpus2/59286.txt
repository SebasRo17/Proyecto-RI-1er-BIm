Is it possible to show a fixed text such as _"updating..."_ instead of the last result shown, when `Manipulate` is re-evaluating an expression (in a slow evaluation context)? How to do it? More precisely, I have a `Button` element in the set of controls, and it is the action triggered by the button the one that slows down the process, and _not_ the results shown in the `Manipulate` sentence themselves. This could be a MWE for what I mean:               Manipulate[result,      {{x, 5}, 0, 10, 1, Appearance -> {"Labeled"}, AppearanceElements -> None},      {{y, 5}, 0, 10, 1, Appearance -> {"Labeled"}, AppearanceElements -> None},      Button["Calculate", Pause[2]; result = x + y],      TrackedSymbols :> {result},      Initialization -> Clear[result, x, y]]      In this example, the values for two integer numbers `x` and `y` are selected using their respective slider controls, and then a button is used to perform some calculations based on them. Finally, results based on those calculations are shown using `Manipulate`. So, regarding this example, my question is: how can I show the text _"updating..."_ while the button is _thinking_? If you think there would be an easier solution in case it was not the button but the expression to be shown by `Manipulate` the one that takes some long time to be executed, I think I could also modify my real problem to be like that. The MWE could be like this:               Manipulate[Pause[2]; parameters[[1]] + parameters[[2]],      {{a, 5}, 0, 10, 1, Appearance -> {"Labeled"}, AppearanceElements -> None},      {{b, 5}, 0, 10, 1, Appearance -> {"Labeled"}, AppearanceElements -> None},      Button["Calculate", parameters = {a, b}],       TrackedSymbols :> {parameters},       Initialization -> (Clear[a, b, parameters]; parameters = {5, 5})]      It would be also OK if the text _"updating..."_ appeared _in the button_ , temporarily replacing the _"Calculate"_ text. It would be a little bit strange, but also valid. I look forward to your solutions.
