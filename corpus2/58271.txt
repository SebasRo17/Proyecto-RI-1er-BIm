I hope I am not to redundant with my questions. As part of solving a physical problem, I want to assume once and for all that all my variables and parameters are real, positive and finite. Is it possible make such assumptions for all _Mathematica_ functions? I tried this piece of code I found on the forum:               $Assumptions = Element[_, Reals] && {_ âˆˆ Reals} && {_} > 0;      But still, `Sign` does not aways return 1, `Minimize` does not treat all parameters as negative, etc.
