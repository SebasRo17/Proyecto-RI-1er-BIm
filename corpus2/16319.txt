I want to extract two separate lists of coefficients of derivatives. If I have, for example,               cl= A1*D[P[x, y], {x, 1}] + A2*D[P[x, y], {x, 2}] +          A3*D[Q[x, y], {y, 3}] + A4*D[Q[x, y], {y, 1}];      I want to extract the lists `{A1, A2}` and `{A3, A4}` but do not want to type all the derivative expressions into command `CoefficientList`. I want to extract these lists programmatically because of I have a very long list of derivatives in my actual problem, which I thought was too long to post here. The following seems to work, but how can I do it without typing in the list of derivatives?               Coefficient[cl, {D[P[x, y], {x, 1}], D[P[x, y], {x, 2}]}]     Coefficient[cl, {D[Q[x, y], {y, 3}], D[Q[x, y], {y, 1}]}]      Longer example                cl2=B1*Derivative[0, 1, 0][R][x, y, z] +       B2*Derivative[2, 0, 0][R][x, y, z] +       B4*Derivative[2, 1, 3][V][x, y, z] +       B3*Derivative[3, 2, 1][R][x, y, z] + B5*Derivative[4, 1, 5][V][x, y, z] + B0*V[x, y, z]  + B00*R[x, y, z];      I need list of coefficients and list of derivatives parallel to know for which derivative is appropriate coefficient. But if I have zero derivatives, they don't appear in the list?
