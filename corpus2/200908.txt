In the interest of keeping my Controller's skinny, I put a `headline` method in a Model.               # My Model     class Property       def headline          "#{name} | #{address}"       end     end      _(Then, Property Controller for context...)_               # My Controller         class PropertyController       def show         @property = Property.find(params[:id])        end     end      Question: As far as MVC is concerned, is it okay to call that Model method from my View, like so?               # My View     <h1><%= @property.headline %></h1>
