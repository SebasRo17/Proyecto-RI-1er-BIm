I have just completed a course on computability and logic which was an interesting course. The lecturer recommend a few books on his slides, which include "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach". I can see the book is quite famous, and looks very interesting. But I have a few questions to ask regarding its content.   1. Is the content still valid today? I guess most theoretical stuff doesn't change over night, but are there any major points which no longer hold today that I should be aware of?   2. I assume we actually HAVE made some progress in the last 30 years or so. Can any of you recommend a book on the subject which includes this progress (logic, AI, computability)? _Another question:_ Do I have to know about Escher and Bach?
