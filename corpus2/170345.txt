So I mainly use Mercurial for my projects and I decided to sit down and learn all Git's shenanigans to discover if I'm in the right side (at least for me). I'm learning that git uses namespaces for branches and I would like to know (in your experience) what is the point of namespaces?. In Mercurial I could just set the convention of naming branches like so:               <branch name> //for "origin" branches     <username>/<branch name> //for user branches      I imagine that there is more to it than just the name (aside from avoiding naming conflicts), but what do I get out of this seemingly more complicated (not necessarily bad) model?
