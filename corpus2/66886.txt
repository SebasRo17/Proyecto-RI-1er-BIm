I find that when I am trying to learn say Python for example I end up worrying about problems that are out of scope like how does Python implement this thing etc. For example say I am learning twisted framework , I end up thinking how can Python define things in such a manner and stuff - this leads be to worry mostly about internals of language insted of problem at hand ! However I can take another approach where I accept the abstraction and say ok ... TCP does this ...I need not know more and accept TCP connections are handled when I give this command ... and carry on with my work and then worry about these things later on . What exactly do you guys follow ? I am perlexed to see many of them so good at both these things while I just seem to be having a hard time there :) Do you really sometimes learn topics with abstraction or do you go find under the hoods stuff as much as possible ? Mayve you could say I am facing a problem of overdesign which is a big problem and need some help to solve this :)
