I've getting some information about this, but I still can find a proper answer, I was asked recently in my company for this : "run a fxcop analysis on that code and tell me the results". Ok, I have VS2010 Ultimate which has code analysis, but before making any comment, I browse it on the internet cause I want to implement the best choice... So, let's say I'm gonna use the same rules on both analyzers:   * Should I recommend using one above the other?   * Should I say "hey, thats kinda old, let's use code analysis!"   * Should I get the same results on different computers? (for what I undersand, fxcop gives you some "points" and for what I've read, sometimes it gives you diff points on diff computers, I don't know about this with code analysis Thanks, any help would be appreciated
