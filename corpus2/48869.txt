I'm a developer in a small department and have been using Delphi for the last 10 years. Whilst I've tried to keep up-to-date with movements there are a lot of changes that have occurred between Delphi 7 and (current for us) 2010. Stack Exchange and here have been great for answering the "how do you" questions, but what I'd like is a resource that shows great examples of larger scale programming. For example is there anywhere that hosts examples of well written, multi form applications? Something that can be looked at as a whole to illustrate why things should be done a certain way?
