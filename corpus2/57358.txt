Suppose `p` is a some point in the plane. The function `f[q]` defined as               f[q_]:= Block[{d = Norm[p-q]}, RGBColor[1 - d/(1 + d), 0, d/(1 + d)]]      Continuously colors points in the plane by thier distance from `p`. What is the easiest way to plot this in 2D? I tried DensityPlot but that's not exactly what I'm looking for. Basically I want to specify some color function for points in the plane and plot it. Contours would be a bonus. Apologies if this exact question has been asked before.
