_At the time this question was asked, version 10 was not out yet. The Front End of Mathematica 10 does have multiple undo, see the answer by John Fultz._      The Mathematica Front End's built-in Undo command can only undo a single editing step. **Has anyone implemented or seen implemented an efficient and comfortable multiple undo?** I have in mind ideas such as, `CellEventActions` that keeps a stack in the cell context pushing the cell state every time a key among a list (brackets, @, operators) is pressed. Some other shortcut to recover older states (or a palette, or perhaps tweaking the front end's .tr files??) I am not familiar at all with typical text based implementations and their issues. I guess it wouldn't be a practical problem to lose the undo state between sessions, would it? So, has this been done, or is it doable or practical? What are your thoughts?
