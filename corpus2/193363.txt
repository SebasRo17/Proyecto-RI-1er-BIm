Distributed issue tracking seems like a belting idea to me, but it has never really taken off in a big way. Is there a good reason for that? ## I am aware of:   * bugz everywhere      * too complex to set up     * too many requirements     * reasonably successful, used by some large projects   * fossil      * tries to integrate too many things, and ends up being a slightly worse version of all of them - except maybe for the distributed issue tracking part, which is decent (probably best I have seen)   * several other smaller projects      * none of which have gained any traction I am thinking about making my own, but before I begin, I would like to know why none of the others have taken off in a big way. ## Anticipated issues: (I think they can all be overcome)   * merging distributed issues as they are updated is complex, as is merging any code files   * conversation continuity can be destroyed, as comments can come in at any time, perhaps not in the correct flow   * expectation of central server with issues up-to-date
