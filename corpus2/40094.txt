I have a table form as:               table = {{a, 6}, {b, ff}, {c, 2}}      I want to associate the first element of each pair from the table to the second element of the pair as in:               a=6, b=ff, c=2.      I want the parameters a,b,c to be recognized throughout the program with assigned values. Doing as below, everything is perfect:               a := 6;     a^2 + 5     Clear[a]     Out[2] 41      But in the example below, I failed:               Clear[table, a, b, c]     table = {{a, 6}, {b, ff}, {c, 2}}     z = table[[1, 1]]     z := table[[1, 2]]     a^2 + 5          Out[4]  {{a, 6}, {b, ff}, {c, 2}}     Out[5]  a     Out[6]  5 + a^2      Why this fail?
