Using matrix algebra I can calculate loadings and scores from the covariance matrix (data matrix is column centered):               covariancematrix=Covariance[data];     loadings=Eigenvectors[N[covariancematrix]];     scores1=data.Transpose[loadings];      I can obtain exactly the same scores using PrincipalComponents:               scores2=PrincipalComponents[data];        1. my problem is about the signs of the scores values. The absolute values are the same but scores1 and scores2 can differ in the signs. Why?   2. how can I apply the Varimax and Oblimin methods in Mathematica?
