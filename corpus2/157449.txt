I am writing a utility that runs on RHEL5 command line. I need my command line options to be simple but powerful. I looked at the various UNIX utilities to get an idea of how simple command line utilities have to be. Do you guys suggest any documents/links that talk about command line etiquette? I am modelling my utility on top of LVM (that's all the info I can give for now). I know it's a software engineering question, but I thought it would be appropriate to post here. Please advise.... PS: I am not asking for details about getopt or command line utility parsers.....
