This is just a consideration for a site am creating and for other big sites out there. I am using Identity Column to store the ID of some of my tables and I have classes whose Id are decorated with `Int32` to hold the value of the ID retrieved from database. My worry is that as the site grows bigger, some tables that grows exponentially e.g `QuestionComments` might exceed the `Int32` limit in future. So I change my class to use `long`.               public class Question     {        public long QuestionID { get; set; }        ...     }      //Converting database value to .Net type                Question q = new Question();      q.QuestionID = Convert.ToInt32(myDataRow["QuestionID"]);      How true is my assumption? Would using a UniqueIdentifier be better? Are there other way to address this? **UPDATE:** But for the sake of learning, how would site like FaceBook, Google, StackOverflow etc. handle Visit table assuming they have VisitID as Identity Column
