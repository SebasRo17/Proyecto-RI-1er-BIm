Coming from a "standalone" programmer job, which methods or tools do you use when the time has come to have to drive a team of programmers as project manager (but still coding with the crew) to explain, prepare and distribute the work to be done by the team ? So a big project is coming, you're chosen as Lead Programmer, what do you use as method and tools to have the job done by the team ?
