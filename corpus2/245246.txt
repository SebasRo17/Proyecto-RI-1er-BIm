Sorry in advance if this question is so trivial. ## The situation There is a `Customer` entity whose ID is limited to two letters (A to Z) in the database. Also, a user can enter the `ID` value from a Windows form. I think that the best option is that this form will validate (using the controller) with a regular expression like this `^[a-zA-Z0-9]{2}$` whether the value is valid. ## The question(s)   * Does the `Customer` entity should also do the validation when I set the value of the ID property?   * Should this validation be outsourced if, for example, there is also similar validation in other properties of the entity? I think that the answer is that it depends if the property value is a requirement of the user or it is a design decision on the database, but I appreciate your knowledge and experience to guide me on the correct way. Thanks in advance.
