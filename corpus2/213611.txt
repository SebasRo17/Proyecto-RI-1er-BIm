I am trying to make sense of the depicted BASIC (old school) “spaghetti” code, but I’m lacking the knowledge. The result should reveal a set of coordinates to be used for my next task. Is there anyone with right skills who can help me? Or maybe direct me towards an online test site where I can do the input myself.               01 GOTO 50     02 B$="program "     03 C$=A$+B$     04 PRINT C$     05 RANDOMIZE TIMER     06 R%=1     08 R%=R%+INT(RND*10)     10 REM      12 GOTO 860     14 A$="random "     16 B$="number "     18 C$=A$+B$     20 PRINT C$     22 GOTO 27     24 REM     26 REM     27 PRINT R%     28 GOTO 212     30 REM     50 A$="This "     60 GOTO 02     210 REM     212 A$="and terminates "     214 B$=":-) !"     216 C$=A$+B$     218 PRINT C$     220 END     850 REM     860 A$="only "     870 B$="prints "     880 C$=A$+B$     890 PRINT C$     900 GOTO 14
