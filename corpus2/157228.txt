Last year I tried establishing a programming section at my alma mater. We started with a clear document detailing our plans and goals and a solid attendance (around 20 students). I ran into following problems:   * I found it hard to manage such a large team   * the majority of students had little or no programming experience other than `C` starting courses I tried splitting the section into 4 teams of approximately 5 students each, with more experienced programmers at the head of each team. We defined some real world problems to solve to make it more interesting for students and got to work. However, with upcoming exams attendance dwindled and then finally stopped. At the time I felt that the students were not willing to put in the effort to learn something new. Later, I believe that they felt the task was too hard for them, and motivation suffered as a result. My question is therefore: how would you motivate students?
