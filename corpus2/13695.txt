I am trying to solve a linear ODE with a variable coefficient which is given in terms of an integral I can only do numerically. That is, I have an equation of the form $$ u'(t)=u(t)\int_0^t\sqrt{1+e^{-\tau^2}\sin(\tau)}d\tau, $$ where the integrand could be pretty much any well-behaved function - but which in general will cause _Mathematica_ to choke when given to `Integrate` and eventually say it can't do it. I know that such a lack of an analytic handle on the coefficients in the equation essentially disqualifies me from an analytic solution of the equation. However, given that I am, or should be, perfectly able to numerically compute this coefficient, _Mathematica_ ought to be able to numerically solve the equation. My initial guess as to how to do this would be to simply indicate the integral should be done numerically:               NDSolve[{D[u[t], t] == NIntegrate[          Sqrt[1 + E^tt^2 Sin[tt^2]], {tt, 0, t}] u[t], u[0] == 1}, u, {t, 0, 1}]      but this simply outputs the error `NIntegrate::nlim: tt = t is not a valid limit of integration. >>`. I've also tried with plain `Integrate` and setting `GenerateConditions->False`, but none of them work and they also take a long time to return their errors, which I assume is because they're trying to symbolically solve the integral - and I specifically _don't_ want that. Can someone provide a way to make _Mathematica_ understand it just needs to buckle down and calculate?
