public interface IMyInputProviderPlugin     {         IMyOutput Provide(IMyInput data);     }      This is an interface I need to provide so that I can dynamically load the dlls and not have them bound to my implementation. However, upon reading this, it seems like this is an anti-pattern? http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/04/27/Providerisnotapattern/ I'm confused, how does one do this if not this way?
