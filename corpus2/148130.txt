I am reading about a start-up company that works with online surveys: > Fulcrum is the worldâ€™s first complete project management suite to give > clients the power to seamlessly integrate multiple suppliers, increase > productivity and reduce costs. Ranging from vertically integrated research > firms to sample suppliers, clients who license Fulcrum enjoy increased > efficiency and with minimal technology development costs. This simplified > survey management platform boasts white-labeled routing and improved > respondent experience all while giving clients exceptional control and > sample quality. I am a little confused about what's going on. What is " white-labeled routing" ? OK, I found out a "panel" company is a surveying company.
