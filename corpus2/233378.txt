I have ported libsodium and NaCl to .NET. NaCl is the original project that is in the public domain while libsodium is a derived work from NACL and is using the ISC license. I looked at both projects to port the code to .NET. For my project I prefer to use MPL v2, but I'm not sure I'm allowed to change the original license. I know ISC is a permissive but it's not clear if I can use another license for my work. Any help would be appreciated.
