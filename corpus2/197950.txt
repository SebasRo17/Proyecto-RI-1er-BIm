Recently I've been browsing source code of large applications written in C++ to learn a bit but I couldn't help but notice that most if not all use a lot of IFDEFs and class-less functions (where they could have been class members/methods). An example is Qt Creator IDE source code: http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/qt-creator/blobs/master/src/app/main.cpp If you notice, it has a bunch of functions around the main() function; one of them, for example, is:               static inline void toHtml(QString &t)      the above method is defined outside while I think it could have been part of some utility class maybe. Also, I think IFDEFs make the programs messy (again my opinion). **My question is** : _is it just an accepted practice in C++ world to mix procedural and OO code like that?_
