I have to create a flowchart to a C# programm and I am not very familiar with it. My problem is that I do not know if one should represent variables initialization in a flowchart and if so how should I do it. Second problem is that I am not sure about the correctness of my for loop. Here is the flowchart I created tot a part of the programm. It would be very nice if you can tell me if that is correct and if not what should I correct. Thank you! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hey0G.png)
