Here is a plugin I wish to redistribute: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/TextAreaResizer I've written a Jquery plugin that needs the text resizer as a prerequisite. The license type says:               License type: Simplified BSD License/FreeBSD License      I did a bit of googling and it said you have to retain all license info, but this plugin doesn't come with any! Can I package a modified version of this (I changed one number in the source) and distribute it with my plugin? Thanks for any insight
