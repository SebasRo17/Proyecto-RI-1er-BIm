I currently have a Mathematica code similar to:               ParallelDo[      Quiet@Check[        Print[var1, "\t", var2, "\t", integral1[var1,var2], "\t",              integral2[var1, var2]],         err      ],       {var1, 10, 50, 2}, {var2, 10, 100,1}     ]      And, I get the results I want in the GUI. However, I can't seem to figure out the best way to export the data I want, while keeping the `ParallelDo` loop. Ideally I would like a comma separated format, similar to what the above outputs. Any ideas? Many thanks in advance!
