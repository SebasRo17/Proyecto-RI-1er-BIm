Generally speaking, what type of optimizations do you typically slant yourself towards when designing software? Are you the type that prefers to optimize your design for   * Development time (i.e., quick to write and/or easier to maintain)?   * Processing time    * Storage (either RAM, DB, Disc, etc) space Of course this is highly subjective to the type of problems being solved, and the deadlines involved, so I'd like to hear about the reasons that would make you choose one form of optimization over another.
