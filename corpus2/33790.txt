I would like to compute the integral $$q_n(x)=\int_{B}^A q_{n-1} (\omega)f(x-\omega)\mathrm{d} \omega,\quad q_1=f,\quad n\geq 1.$$ for a given density function $f$. Basically it is the convolution of a pdf with itself for $n$ times in the range $A$ and $B$. when $n=1$, I simply plot the original pdf $f$, if $n=2$, then I convolve it with itself only once and plot etc.. Eventually I would like to plot the densities $q_n$ for $n=1,2,3..,7$ in the same figure. My code with the help of some people from this forum is               f0[x_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[-2, 2], x]     f1[x_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[2, 2], x]          q[1, B_, A_, f_] := f          q[n_ /; n > 1, B_, A_, f_][x_] := Module[{\[Omega]},      tempIntegrate[Evaluate[q[n - 1, B,A, f]][\[Omega]] f[x - \[Omega]], {\[Omega],B, A}]]          p[n_, B_, A_, f_] :=      tempIntegrate[q[n, B, A, f][x], {x, -\[Infinity], B}]+tempIntegrate[q[n, B, A, f][x], {x,A, \[Infinity]}] //.      {s_ tempIntegrate[b_, a__] :>tempIntegrate[s b, a],      tempIntegrate[tempIntegrate[b_, a__], c__] :>tempIntegrate[b, a, c]} /.      tempIntegrate -> NIntegrate      I can not               Plot[q[2, -2, 2, f0][x],{x,-10,10}]       correctly and I cannot see the analytical formulation when I type               q[2, B, A, f0][x]      Could you please help me? Thank you very much. EDIT : My eventual intention was to calculate $$P[n]=\int_{(-\infty,B)\cup (A,\infty)} q_n (x) \mathrm{d}x$$ and p[2, -2, 2, f0] provides me a numerical value but I am also interested in some analytical values. To do this I tried to change ->NIntegrate to Integrate but then the code didnt function properly.
