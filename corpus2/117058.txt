I wanted to know the experiences others have about doing the Agile way of "Release Early, Release Often" with iPhone and Android Apps. Its not a problem with webapps as the update happens at the server and user does not have to do anything specific for updates It may not be a big problem with Android, as the approval process is smooth compared to iPhone app store. Can someone share the experiences/suggestions/examples they've for releasing early and often to Android and iPhone markets?
