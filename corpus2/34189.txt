So now it's 2011, and as I carry on coding on our active projects it's time to update some copyright notices. eg. Copyright Widgets Ltd 2010 to Copyright Widgets Ltd 2010, 2011 My question is when do you update the copyright notices?   * Do you change the notice in the head of a file the first time you work on that file?    * Since a module is one piece of code consisting of many files that work together, do you update all notices in that module when you change a single file in that module?    * Since a program is one piece of code (maybe consisting of many modules), do you update all notices in that program when you change a single file in that program?    * Or do you just go through and change en-mass over your morning coffee on the grounds your about to start programming and updateing things?
