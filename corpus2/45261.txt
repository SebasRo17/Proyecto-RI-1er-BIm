I'm unsure as to the definition of knowing a programming language, so I'm picking C++ as an example. How much does it take to someone to be qualified as knowing C++?   * Should they just know the basic syntax?   * Template and generic-programming?   * Compiler flags and their purposes (Wall, the difference between O1, O2 and O3)?   * STL?   * Garbage collection strategies?   * Boost?   * Common libraries like zlib, curl, and libxml2?
