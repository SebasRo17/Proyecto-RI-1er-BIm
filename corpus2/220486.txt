Some friends and me wish to develop a 2D game just for the experience of learning this paradigm. We are all software engineers with experience in business apps, but we are unsure if the typical design patterns and architectures (MVC, 3-layer, etc) apply as well, and we are totally unknown about the techniques that are typically used in Game development (Scenegraphs, key bindings implementation, event management, sound/texture banks...) We plan on developing with C# and XNA/Monogame, and I would be grateful if someone could point out any useful bibliography that could be helpful for us to plan an architecture and deal with any day-by-day game development issues. Thank you
