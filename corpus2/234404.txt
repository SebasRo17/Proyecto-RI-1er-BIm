I'm a web developer and I'm currently once again in a situation where a partly clueless ops department requires a "complete" documentation required for technical support of our application by a third-party, including "every possible error situation". Since there is no common ground on what this third- party should be capable of (ops constantly talk about "a person from the street should be able to do it"), I consider such documentation impossible and my experience tells me that every documentation is obsolete and incomplete, even if just a bit. I can't help to wonder: has there been any study or maybe even a proof that this is actually the case? Maybe even GÃ¶del's incompletness theorems could be applied here?
