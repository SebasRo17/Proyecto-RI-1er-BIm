I have the following grid, which is a partial table for the linear function f[x]:               f[x_] := 2 x + 3     Grid[Join[{{x, y}}, Table[{i, f[i]}, {i, 0, 4}]],       Dividers -> {{2 -> Directive[Red, Thin]}, {2 ->       Directive[Red, Thin]}}, Alignment -> {Right, Center}]      What I'd like to do is annotate this grid, to indicate the slope and y-intercept of f[x], as the following graphic shows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mLB4s.png) I can figure out how to draw the dashed ellipse and colored arrows on my own. What I can't figure out is how to add these graphical annotations to the grid. Is this possible? (Note that f[x] will be defined "on the fly", and so including a static image is not a possible solution.)
