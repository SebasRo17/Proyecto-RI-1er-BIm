In my experience, being familiar with anti-patterns is as vital as knowing patterns themselves. Despite an abundance of literature on patterns, there is a surprising lack of literature on anti-patterns. Browsing the web usually reveals advises that are either too vague (e.g. " _do not use global variables_ "), too specific (e.g. " _java.lang.Boolean.getBoolean doesn't do what you think it does_ ") or obviously wrong to begin with (e.g. _God object_ ). What I am looking for are anti-patterns that appear to be good solutions at first glance, but tend to lead to issues further down the line. Do you know any good source of such anti-patterns? (the only good example I know is SQL Antipatterns)
