I've created a keyboard-free panning system within Mathematica. The code does the job, but I continually get errors in relation to it, and I cannot seem to get it to perform within a CDF because of it. The main line of code that seems to be problematic is               ViewCenter -> {{1/2, 1/2, 1/2},                     {Dynamic[x = CurrentPosition[[1]] + panvalue[[1]]],                      Dynamic[y = CurrentPosition[[2]] - panvalue[[2]]]}}      It may look messy, but basically it maps the center of a graphic, `(1/2,1/2,1/2)`, to a new two-dimensional point based on the click and drag of the mouse. This seems fairly logical to me, but some may notice the seemingly unnecessary use of `Dynamic` in the above. These are created because the code only works until I manually interact with the craft through the use of `Shift` or `Ctrl`. Meaning, I can freely pan with my right-click and drag function until I decide to use the built in Mathematica interactons. I think I may have discovered part of the error, in that the errors that I mentioned before say that I am calling `ListQ` with 0 arguments, but this function appears nowhere in my code. Furthermore, I was originally getting errors saying that `CurrentPosition[[2]]` and the other references to list elements were longer than the depth of their objects. However, with these all being references to points, shouldn't they have as many elements as I'm referencing? Any ideas on what could be the source of my issue? I did my best to simplify the code, but it's still quite extensive. Feel free to ask for clarification and I will do my best. Looking at the Initialization should help a little. Without the `Dynamic` around the Position updating,               Manipulate[     EventHandler[     Dynamic[Show[graphic,      ViewCenter -> {{1/2, 1/2,         1/2}, {x = CurrentPosition[[1]] + panvalue[[1]],         y = CurrentPosition[[2]] - panvalue[[2]]}}]],     If[CurrentValue["AltKey"],     {{"MouseDown",        1} :> (a = CurrentValue[MousePosition]), {"MouseDragged",        1} :> {b = CurrentValue[MousePosition], drag = b - a,        panvalue = {drag[[1]]/(pt[[1]]),          drag[[2]]/(pt[[2]])}}, {"MouseUp", 1} :> {drag = {0, 0},        panvalue = {0, 0}, CurrentPosition[[1]] = x,        CurrentPosition[[2]] = y}}]], SynchronousUpdating -> True,      Initialization :> (CurrentPosition = {1/2, 1/2}; panvalue = {0, 0};      pt = CurrentValue[ImageSize]; drag = {0, 0}; a = {0, 0};      b = {0, 0})]      Feel free to try this, but it will likely allow you to pan by clicking and dragging when the `Alt` key is depressed, but only until you manually interact with the graphic. Adding `Dynamic` around the `ViewCenter` argument fixes the problem, but gives errors.
