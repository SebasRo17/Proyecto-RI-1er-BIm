I'm in the middle of co-producing a "development approach" document for off- shore resources as they ramp up onto our project. The most recent (similar) document our company has used is over 80 pages, and that does not include coding standards/conventions documents. My concern is that this document will not be consumable and will therefore fail. What _should_ be in a development approach document? Are there any decent guidelines on this topic? EDIT: The development approach document should detail the practices and techniques that will be used by software developers while software is designed, built, and tested.
