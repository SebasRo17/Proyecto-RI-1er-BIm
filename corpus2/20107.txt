I want to be able to expand $\log(x^n e^x) = n \log(x) +x$:               FullSimplify[Log[x^n Exp[x]], x > 0 && Element[n, Integers] && n > 1]      yields               Log[E^x x^n]      whereas               -1 +FullSimplify[Log[x^n Exp[x]] + 1,  x > 0 && Element[n, Integers] && n > 1]      yields               x + n Log[x]      what gives? Maybe it recognizes that I want to do arithmetic outside the log, so it then simplifies the expression; if that's the case, how can I force it to do that without hacking it by adding and subtracting 1? thanks!
