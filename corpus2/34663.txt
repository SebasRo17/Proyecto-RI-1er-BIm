I am an extremely limited user of _Mathematica_. Could someone tell me how to set the following nonlinear regression problem :               Y = Sum[a[i] F[i,X] , i = 1,4]          in which                F[i,x] = X^b[i] (b[i] LerchPhi[X,1,b[i]] - 1 / (1-X))        the parameters to be adjusted being the `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Preliminary work provides me reasonable estimates of all parameters. How can I use them at the input level to make Mma's life easier ?
