I would like to ask you some questions about dirty code. There are some beginners who coded on a medium project. The code is a very huge ball of mud. They are not advanced programmers. They just know how to use keyboard an a little about java. They just wrote code with 12 000 lines in their main class, though, 6 000 lines belongs to NetBeans itself. My job is to analyze the code and suggest a good way to maintain the code. My idea is to scrap the project and start a new one with OOP methodology. Recently I collected some notes and ideas about the problem, from this site and some others. Now, I have the followings questions:   1. Should we repair the code, and change it to a OOP? We are now debugging it.   2. The code has no comments, no documentation, no particular style of programming, and so forth. Changing it is really expensive and time consuming. What do we can do about this?   3. How can I teach them to follow all the rules (commenting, OOP, good code quality, etc.)?   4. The code is erroneous and error prone. What can we do? Testing? We almost write two or three A4 papers for correction, but it seems endless. I should have to say that I am new with them. I think I have broken the rules about adding people too late to the project, as well. Do you think I have to leave them?
