This is un updated version of a previous (now deleted) post of mine. I need to marginalize a distribution. I was suggested to use the code in this thread. This works just fine, but the problem is that the construction of tab (see below) is very slow: I tried with a pTab[i] with 100 elements and it took 2 days on my dual core 2GHz laptop to build it, and my actual pTab[i] are 180000 elements long. I guess you understand why I am worried. Does anyone have any idea about how to speed it up? Or a different code, maybe? Here is the code I am using (only the slow part):               dat = (*Import data from dat.txt*)     mat = (*Import matrix from matrix.txt*)     nosys = Inverse[mat];     z = dat[[All, 1]];     mu = dat[[All, 2]];     H = ConstantArray[1, 580];     chi[{a_, b_, c_,         e_}] = (5/           Log[10]*(Log[z] + 0.5*z*(3 - b) +              1/24*z^2*(21 + 9*b^2 - 2*b - 4*c)) -           mu).nosys.(5/           Log[10]*(Log[z] + 0.5*z*(3 - b) +              1/24*z^2*(21 + 9*b^2 - 2*b - 4*c)) -           mu) - (H.nosys.(5/              Log[10]*(Log[z] + 0.5*z*(3 - b) +                 1/24*z^2*(21 + 9*b^2 - 2*b - 4*c)) -              mu))^2/(H.nosys.H) + ((a - 0.742)/0.024)^2 + ((e - 0.315)/          0.017)^2;          ClearAll[pTab];          val = (*Import values needed for Ptab from ptab_values.txt*)          d = 4;(*number of parameters*)     Do[pTab[i] = val[[All, i + 1]], {i, d}];     tab = Module[{T, n},         With[{F = chi},          Replace[Hold[            Array[Append[T, F[T]] &, Length[pTab[#]] & /@ Range[d]]] /.            T -> Table[Hold[pTab[n][[Slot[n]]]] /. n -> i, {i, d}],           Hold[x_] :> x, {0, Infinity}, Heads -> True]]];     Print["packing array"]     tab // Developer`PackedArrayQ;      The needed files are: for ptab (these are the numbers needed for building pTab (skip the first column: that is needed for another work)) matrix (a 580 x 580 matrix) for dat (only the first 2 columns are needed in this code) Those are rapidshare links: I hope you allow it because the matrix is 580 X 580, and dat is 580 rows long: I can't write them in a post. **EDIT:** I was thinking can `Parallelize` be of any help in this case?
