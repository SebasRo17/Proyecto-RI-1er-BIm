I want to write something that takes a sentence and identifies each word it contains and defines what part of speech each word is. For example > Hello World, I am a sentence would return this               verb noun, pronoun verb adjective noun      Ideally, I'd like to eventually take it one step further and take a sentence and programmatically have it understand what it is trying to interpret and maybe do something about it. So my question is, has someone heard of something like this?
