I would like to hear some”real life experience” suggestions if foreign key restrictions are good or bad thing to enforce in DB.   I would kindly ask students/beginners to refrain from jumping and answering quickly and without thinking.   At the beginning of my career I thought that stupidest thing you can do is disregard the referential integrity. Today, after "few" projects I'm thinking different. Quite different. What do you think: Should we enforce foreign key restrictions or not?   *Please explain your answer.
