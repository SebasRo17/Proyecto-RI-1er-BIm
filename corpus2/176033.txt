I was referred here from stackoverflow as my question was apparently too broad. I'm working on a template, and I know using CSS is preferred over HTML tables for positioning... But, is it acceptable to get the best of both worlds and use table-like styles on my divs? For example:               display: table;      This not only helps solve the sticky footer problem, but it also avoids the pains associated with using floats. Somehow it feels dirty, but I can't logically explain why because it works without any "tricks" or ugly hacks, which is how it should be, right? Is this technically incorrect, or does it ultimately boil down to just a matter of opinion? ...Thoughts?
