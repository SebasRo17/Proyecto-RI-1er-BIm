I'm trying to implement smooth approximations of Max and Abs functions. Moreover I want the functions to map element-wise on tensors. Here's my code.               $Assumptions = {        Element[A, Arrays[{i, j, k}, Reals]],        Element[Nlarge, Reals] (* Nlarge tends to infinity *)        };     Hyper[x_] := Map[Exp[Nlarge #1] &, x, -1]     Hypo[x_] := Map[Log[#1]/Nlarge &, x, -1]     SMax[x__] := Hypo[Plus @@ (Map[Hyper, {x}])]     SAbs[x_] := SMax[x, -x]     SAbs[A] // TensorDimensions      I'm expecting it to return {i, j, k}, but instead I get {}. What's wrong with it?
