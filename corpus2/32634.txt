I am trying to create a stacked `BarChart` where each `BarChart` has different `ChartLabels`. Consider the following example:               BarChart[{{5, 6, 7, 5, 7}, {8, 5, 6, 7, 8}}, ChartLayout -> "Stacked",       ChartLabels -> {Placed[{"One", "Two"}, Above],         Placed[{5, 6, 7, 5, 7}, Center]}]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GMxNE.png) But what I would like to have is separate labels for the segments in the two chart elements. The following image illustrates this: > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NFgzU.png) I can't figure out how to do that using `ChartLabels`. When I try providing multiple lists for the chart labels it doesn't work.
