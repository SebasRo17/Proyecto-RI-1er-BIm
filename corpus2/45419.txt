Please let me first emphasize that I am not looking for flame wars. I just want advice from people who have real experiences. I started learning JAVA EE 6 as real newbie and am having a difficult time choosing what tools to use. The first question I have is - what are the advantages of using Scala vs. Groovy with Java EE 6 apps over Java? I've seen on some blogs people mentioning Scala can mean writing less code but as a newbie I don't know what other advantages and disadvantages there are. The second question is whether I'm better off choosing Netbeans 6.9 or Helios 3.6.1? I realized that with eclipse I can easily mix EE 6 applications with Groovy or Scala without any problems (I only did this by displaying a String message from Scala and Groovy classes.). With Netbeans the only advantage I can think of is having separate Java project libraries and using the jars in my web app. But I also realize to the extent of my little knowledge Netbeans has better support for Java EE 6. Please need your expert advice. Thanks.
