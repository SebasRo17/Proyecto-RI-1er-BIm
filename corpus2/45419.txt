For some non-linear ODEs there is only implicit form of solution using DSolve. For example               DSolve[(y[x] + x - 1)*y'[x] - y[x] + 2 x + 3 == 0, y[x], x]      gives implicit solution               Solve[2/3 (Sqrt[2]ArcTan[(-2 + (2 (2 + 3 x))/(-1 + x + y[x]))/(2 Sqrt[2])]-Log[((-1 + x +y[x])^2 (3 + ((2 + 3 x) (-2 + (2 + 3 x)/(-1 + x +y[x])))/(-1 + x + y[x])))/(2 + 3 x)^2]) == C[1] + 4/3 Log[2 + 3 x], y[x]]      I'm solving a non-linear second-order ODE that has 4 explicit solutions. The formulas for these solutions are gigantic so I would like to see it in the implicit form because I hope it might be simpler. Is there a way how to show the implicit form of solution of ODE even though the equation has the explicit solution? (Just to be specific - the equation I'm solving reads               DSolve[(1 + G (A + y[x])^3) y''[x] + 3*G (A + y[x])^2 (y'[x])^2 + R == 0, y[x], x]      where $A,G,R \in \mathbb{R}$.) Thank you for any kind of help.
