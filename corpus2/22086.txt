How can I define a `ColorFunction` for my `ContourPlot` using `Piecewise`? For example after making a `ContourPlot` for such this function:               p[x_,y_]:=1-Sin[x]^2*Sin[y]^2;      I want to define my `ColorFunction` in a way that for example for `0<p<0.1` the plot have a different color than `0.1<p<0.2`. An example of what I need is in the following plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/c3hUs.png) Which the color column at the right shows that each color corresponds to what value of `p`.
