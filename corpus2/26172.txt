Documentation on `ComplexityFunction` says: > With the default setting `ComplexityFunction->Automatic`, forms are ranked > primarily according to their `LeafCount`, with corrections to treat integers > with more digits as more complex. I need to use this default function on its own, not in `Simplify` or `FullSimplify`. Can I invoke it from my code? If no, could you give me a custom function that behaves as close to the default function as possible? Thanks!
