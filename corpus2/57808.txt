Why do the `"Return"` and `"Volume"` outputs of `FinancialData` differ? Consider the following input for `"Return"`               FinancialData["APL","Return",{{2014,8,14},{2014,8,19}}]      with output               {{{2014,8,15},0.00202899},{{2014,8,18},0.00578536}, {{2014,8,19},-0.00517688}}      versus this input for `"Volume"`               FinancialData["APL","Volume",{{2014,8,14},{2014,8,19}}]       with output               {{{2014,8,14},348800},{{2014,8,15},610700},{{2014,8,18},247200},{{2014,8,19},290500}}      **Notice** : Each function takes the same period, yet the Return input yields one less date. The output dates match if I make the following modification for the Return input               FinancialData["APL","Return",{{2014,8,13},{2014,8,19}}]      which outputs               {{{2014,8,14},0.0102489},{{2014,8,15},0.00202899},{{2014,8,18},0.00578536},{2014,8,19},-0.00517688}}      Now, the dates for Return and Volume match up and the crisis is averted. However, this seems an inelegant fix. Is there something that I am just missing in the aforementioned example? Additionally, I have tested this on multiple stocks, so it is not an artifact of "APL" which I chose at random.
