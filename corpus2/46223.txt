The _Mathematica_ 9 installation on my laptop has developed an odd feature. Just underneath the grey line indicating the input area for a new cell, the expression `$Failed` appears in small type at the left hand end. This occurs even before I type anything in a fresh notebook created at start- up. I tried deleting both the `Kernel`'s and `FrontEnd`'s init.m files but that did not help. As soon as I start to type an input, it disappears. It doesn't seem to interfere with kernel evaluations but is just annoying. ![This is how it looks in a new notebook created at start- up.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TlvDv.png)
