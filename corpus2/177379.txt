We have a Visual SourceSafe installation that 4 developers collaborate on. Inside that there are 30 or so independent projects in different top level folders. Is it necessary for us to create a new TFS "Project" for each of those 30 items, or can we simply place them in the same overarching project folder... possibly assigning permissions to each? The reason I ask is because I'm demo-ing the migration now and it takes a long time to migrate and create the "New Team Project" within Visual Studio in order to create a 1:1 correlation. What are the other benefits I may get from using separate projects in TFS?
