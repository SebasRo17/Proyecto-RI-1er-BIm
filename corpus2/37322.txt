I'm using `ParallelTable` to evaluate a function that involves `NIntegrate`. There are a lot of `NIntegrate::slwcon` warning messages. In fact, every kernel prints the same messages. I am aware that Mathematica is printing these warnings and now want to suppress them. I tried `Quiet[]` and `Off[NIntegrate::slwcon`. But they seem to have no effect whatsoever when using `ParallelTable`. How can I turn off (any) warning message when using `ParallelTable`?
