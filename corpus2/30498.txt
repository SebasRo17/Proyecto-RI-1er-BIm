I want to create a function that when a string is entered it will turn it into a list of numbers, these numbers are the numerical form of the characters in the string. e.g. a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4 and space = 27 (other punctuation may be needed). So if I had the string "hello", my result would be: {8, 5, 12, 12, 15} I had a look at StringReplace, StringSplit and Characters, but not sure what is optimal. How would I go about doing this?
