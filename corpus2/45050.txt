I have a special function given as: $${\rm f}\left(r\right) ={1 \over \beta\lambda}\,2^{r/\beta} \exp\left({\left[2^{r/\beta} - 1\right]K \over \lambda}\right)$$ I should find the Expectation of the random variable $r$. Mathematica was not able to solve the associated Integral function. So it returns: $$ \int_0^{\infty}\left\\{{1 \over \beta\lambda}\,2^{r/\beta} \exp\left({\left[2^{r/\beta} - 1\right]K \over \lambda}\right)\right\\}\ r\,{\rm d}r $$ Does anyone recognize how I can reduce this function so I can solve it further? ==== Edit ===== This is the code I tried:               Integrate[ r*fr, {r, 0, \Infinity}, Assumptions->{K>=1, \lambda >=0, \beta >=0}]
