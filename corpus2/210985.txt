If I'm a senior project manager, should I still keep learning new technology? For example, every month every year, most language updates themselves, and a lot of new programming concepts become popular. Many new frameworks and patterns are created and make things easily. But you have to spend a lot of time to keep up with. If there's language which is proved more efficient and you aren't familiar with it, will you plan to learn it and let team members take this language to develop the project? If there's new framework, most people say that it's helpful to our project, but you know nothing about it, would you learn it and decide it? But as a PM, you should be a senior level or maybe busier than before. Are you willing to learn something 'not so senior'??
