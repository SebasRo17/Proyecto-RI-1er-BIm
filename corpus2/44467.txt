I would like to plot the following function               Plot[(1/x (0.01/(0.01 + x^2) - (10/(10 + x^2))^2)), {x, 0, 10},       Frame -> True, PlotRange -> All]      which is very peaked at 0.01 in log scale, to show it up to higher values, i.e.:               LogPlot[-(1/x (0.01/(0.01 + x^2) - (10/(10 + x^2))^2)), {x, 0, 100},       Frame -> True, PlotRange -> {10^-9, 10}]      However, since function is negative, I must add a minus sign to the function. I would like to get something like the log plot above, but with the y-axis going downwards and with negative values, looking similar to the plot below               LogPlot[-(1/x (0.01/(0.01 + x^2) - (10/(10 + x^2))^2))^-1, {x, 0, 10},       Frame -> True, PlotRange -> {0.1, 10^3}]      but with the right scaling for log axis and negative value sin stead of positive ones, is it possible? Thanks in advance
