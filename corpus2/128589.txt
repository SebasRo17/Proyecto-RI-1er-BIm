Well, I've just started doing puzzles and it's so annoying to see puzzles which are easy to do but also need to handle very large numbers. That's the problem. Say I have to deal with numbers like 10 ^ 6 / 2147483647 / etc. Need to do arithmetic operations on! However, I feel that these shouldn't be handled in brute force way but the math theorems/ statements just don't click in my mind at times. How could I possible handle such puzzles (shouldn't use external lib)
