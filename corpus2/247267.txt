Maybe a little tongue-in-cheek, but as I can't find this answer anywhere through Google, so to ensure Programmers Stackexchange has the answer: **What is a helper?** I see the name being used everywhere (module names, class names, method names), as if the semantics were deep and meaningful, but in the context of Computer Science (although I don't have a degree in it), I've never seen a description or definition anywhere! Is it a design pattern? Is it an algorithm? I once worked on a program in which the module and class were both called _somethingsomethinghelper_ (where _somethingsomething_ was fairly generic too) and I promptly renamed it to something that made sense to me, but I feel like I'm missing something here!
