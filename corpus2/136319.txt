In Visual Studio I can right-click on an interface and choose to Implement Interface, or Implement Interface Explicitly. ![Visual Studio Screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x4Rx6.png)               public class Test : ITest     {         public string Id // Generated by Implement Interface         {             get { throw new NotImplementedException(); }         }              string ITest.Id // Generated by Implement Interface Explicitly         {             get { throw new NotImplementedException(); }         }     }      The only difference I see between the two is that the Interface name is added to the interface properties and methods when they're created if you choose to Implement Interface Explicitly. I find it makes the code a bit more readable since I can see where that method/property comes from, however does this make any difference in how the class is used or compiled? And does it really matter if I implement my interfaces implicitly or explicitly?
