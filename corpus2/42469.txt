I have a function f and its downvalues. I want to code an extra downvalue for arguments of the form "part1:part2" I don't understand why               f[a__~~":"~~b__] := {a,b}      does not work. I can only think of               f[string_String] /; StringMatchQ[string,__~~":"~~__] := StringCases[string, a__~~":"~~b__ :> {a,b}][[1]]      but this doesn't seem very smart as the string structure is examined two times.
