I have just read this blog post from Jimmy Bogard and was drawn to this comment. > Where this falls down is when a component doesnâ€™t support a given > layering/architecture. But even with NHibernate, I just use the ISession > directly in the controller action these days. Why make things complicated? I then commented on the post and ask this question:- ![my question to jimmy](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BCr01.jpg) My question here is what options would you have testing the controller logic **IF** you do not mock out the NHibernate ISession. I am curious what options we have if we utilise the ISession directly on the controller?
