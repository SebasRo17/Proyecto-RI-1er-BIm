Firstly let me clarify that I know C and am learning Python. So my OOPS is kind of bad. I was reading the official tutorial and found this > Although scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any > time during execution, there are at least three nested scopes whose > namespaces are directly accessible: > >   * the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names >   * the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with > the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names >   * the next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names the > outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names > I understand namespaces. I think scopes are the same thing. But I couldn't figure out what does the sentence about scopes mean? What is the advantage of such an arrangement? I understand the sentence but couldn't visualize that. So please don't say that this is problem with my English.
