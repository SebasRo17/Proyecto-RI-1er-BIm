I really enjoy working with C# however one of its biggest drawbacks is that it is kind of split-brained between MSFT .NET and Mono. In practice its not a big deal most of the time but it is one of those things that makes the language 'stink' a little. It would get a lot more uptake, I suspect, if one could answer " _If I compile it, will it work on every [desktop] platform?_ " with " _Yes._ ". Right now its " _Yes. But you have to compile it under Mono first. And some areas of code may need to be rewritten a little._ ". My question is " **Does the recent open sourcing of MSFT's C# compiler mean it can be made cross-platform?** ". That is to say, could C# .NET be made to work cross platform without Mono with the newly release open source components? Or is there more to this I am not seeing? Further exposition on what the future may hold for C# in light of the open sourced components is not required to answer this question however it is encouraged.
