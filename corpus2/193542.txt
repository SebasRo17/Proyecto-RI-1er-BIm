I have some classes that are composed with ORM generated Models. example1: For example the Report.php (Model) is using a Document.php Model generated with ORM. Based on the document object a report is created. I would like to know some name suggestions for the Report.php folder path. It clearly belongs to the /Model folder but in what subfolder? example2: The CustomTagFilter.php will remove some html tags from a html string. I wish to find a clear path name for this kind of Models. Any suggestions ?               /Models/[SUGGESTION]
