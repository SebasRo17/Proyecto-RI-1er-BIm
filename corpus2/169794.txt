Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID) are a grouped string with a specific format which I assume has a security reason. > A GUID is most commonly written in text as a sequence of hexadecimal digits > separated into five groups, such as: > > 3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301 Why aren't GUID/UUID strings just random bytes encoded using hexadecimal of X length? > This text notation contains the following fields, separated by hyphens: >   >   >     | Hex digits | Description >     |------------------------- >     | 8            | Data1 >     | 4            | Data2 >     | 4            | Data3 >     | 4            | Initial two bytes from Data4 >     | 12           | Remaining six bytes from Data4 >   There are also several versions of the UUID standards. > Version 4 UUIDs are generally internally stored as a raw array of 128 bits, > and typically displayed in a format something like: > > uuid:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
