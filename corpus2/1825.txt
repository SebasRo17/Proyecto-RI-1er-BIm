I would like to create a mapping from a list and I am wondering if there is a slick way of doing it. For example, consider the list               ls = WaveletFilterCoefficients[DaubechiesWavelet[2], "PrimalHighpass"]          {{-2, -0.0915064},{-1, -0.158494},{0, 0.591506},{1, -0.341506}}      I would like to define a function that maps                -2 -> -0.0915064      -1 -> -0.158494       0 ->  0.591506       1 -> -0.341506      and all other integers to zero. Any suggestions?
