I am trying to solve a time-dependent linear system with a singular system matrix, $A$, thus an infinite number of solutions, ${\bf x}$(t), exist that satisfy the linear system. The solution I am looking for is one that minimizes the maximum value of the functions x(t). The problem can therefore be phrased as minimizing the square of L2-norm of the maximum of x(t) subject to the Ax=b equality constraints: $$ \text{Minimize}~~\vert~\text{Max}[{\bf x}(t),t]~\vert_2^2 $$ $$ \text{such that}~~{\bf Ax}(t)={\bf b}(t) $$ I can solve this system at one point in time ($t=t_0$), but am looking for a solution ${\bf x}(t)$. My current code is:               (*provide base values*)     n1 = 1;     n2 = 1;     n3 = 1;     i1 = Cos[ω*t];     i2 = Cos[ω*t - (2 π/3)];     i3 = Cos[ω*t - (-2 π/3)];          (* Clear base values and use symbolic representations *)     nbase = {n1, n2, n3};     ibase = {i1, i2, i3};     Clear[i1, i2, i3, n1, n2, n3];          (*values used to form 'A' and 'b' *)     coilList =       {        {1, 19, i1, n1},        {2, 20, i1, n1},        {3, 21, i1, n1},        {4, 22, i1, n1},        {5, 23, i1, n1},        {6, 24, i1, n1},             {7, 25, -i3, n3},        {8, 26, -i3, n3},        {9, 27, -i3, n3},        {10, 28, -i3, n3},        {11, 29, -i3, n3},        {12, 30, -i3, n3},             {13, 31, i2, n2},        {14, 32, i2, n2},        {15, 33, i2, n2},        {16, 34, i2, n2},        {17, 35, i2, n2},        {18, 36, i2, n2}        };          qs = 36;          (*create b vector*)     bVec = ConstantArray[0, {qs, 1}];     For[j = 1, j <= Dimensions[coilList][[1]], j++,      bVec[[coilList[[j, 1]], 1]] += coilList[[j, 3]]*coilList[[j, 4]];      bVec[[coilList[[j, 2]], 1]] += -coilList[[j, 3]]*coilList[[j, 4]];      ]          (*form A matrix*)     aMat = DiagonalMatrix[Table[-1, {j, 1, qs - 1}], -1];     For[j = 1, j <= qs, j++,       aMat[[j, j]] = 1;       ];     aMat[[1, qs]] = -1;          (* create symbolic unknown vector*)     xVec = Table[Symbol["x" <> ToString[j]], {j, 1, qs, 1}];          (* introduce Ax=b as a list of equality constraints *)     constraints = Table[Sum[aMat[[j, k]]*xVec[[k]], {k, 1, Length[xVec]}]         == bVec[[j, 1]], {j, 1, Length[bVec], 1}];          (* find unconstrainted solution by minimizing the squared 2-norm of \     the slot MMFs *)     Block[{i1 = ibase[[1]], i2 = ibase[[2]],i3 = ibase[[3]],             n1 = nbase[[1]], n2 = nbase[[2]], n3 = nbase[[3]]},      solMin = FindMinimum[         {Norm[Table[MaxValue[xVec[[j]], t], {j, 1, Length[xVec]}], 2]^2,           And @@ Thread[constraints]}, xVec];      ]     xSol = xVec /. solMin[[2]];      Any help would be Greatly appreciated!
