I am currently creating a (very simple) Objective-C client to send basic statistical data to my server for an iPhone app - just things like the state of the app (first-launch or launch, error, etc), along with the make/model/version (i.e.: "iPod touch 4.2"). No personally identifiable information or location data is sent. Is there anything, in the Apple Developer agreement or otherwise, that states that I must notify the user if I am doing this? I'm not interested in selling the data or anything, I just want to use the data to make my apps better. I am not adverse to telling the user I am doing this if it is required, I just don't want to scare the users (the paranoid "oooh, they're tracking me, they know exactly where I am" crowd) if I don't have to. Thanks for any advice.
