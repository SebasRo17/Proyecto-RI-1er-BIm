Looking at the code of Joomla I see that in the first line of the index, it defines the base path of installation with `dirname(__FILE__)`. Is this a possible risk for the site? If a non controlled error message show the internal path of the Joomla directory, because of, for example a failed include, can it be used to perform some kind of attack to the site? If yes, is it convenient to use this function?
