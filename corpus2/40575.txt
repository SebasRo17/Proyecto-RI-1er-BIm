I know how to create parallelepiped and combine them to form a parallelepiped tiling, but the tiles overlap... I started with this code:               P1 = Graphics3D[{GeometricTransformation[{Opacity[.85], Red,           Cuboid[]}, ShearingMatrix[Pi/4, {1, 0, 0}, {-1, 1, 0}]]},        Boxed -> False]             P2 = Graphics3D[{GeometricTransformation[{Opacity[.85], Red,           Cuboid[]}, ShearingMatrix[Pi/4, {1, 0, 0}, {-1, 1, 0}]]},        Boxed -> False]          P3 = Graphics3D[{GeometricTransformation[{Opacity[.85], Red,           Cuboid[]}, ShearingMatrix[Pi/4, {1, 0, 0}, {-1, 1, 0}]]},        Boxed -> False]          Show[P1,P2,P3]       ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XSBP9.png) I don't know how to fix the positions of the parallelepipeds (I prefer different shapes) so that they will not overlap and no gaps between them.
