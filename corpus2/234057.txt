I developed some software which I sell / closed souce. There is a GPL executable I would like to call/execute from within my software (and use the data returned by it) _if_ users download the executable themselves and tell my program the path where to find it. (Hence, I do not want to distribute neither source, nor binaries of the GPL tool.) If I understood this correctly, I am therefore not linking in any way. The GPL tool will only constitute a very tiny part of the overall functionality and probably only be useful (and not likely mandatory) to less than a percent of my users. (Rough estimate.) Hence, by my understanding, I should be able to do above without further problem, i.e. I will not need to: \- Mention anything in my readme/similar since user downloads the GPL executable himself form the official site - my software will point to it, so the user can find it there) \- My own software can stay as it is (closed source, commercial) Am I correct in above?
