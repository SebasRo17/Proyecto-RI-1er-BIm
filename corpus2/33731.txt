I would like to compare two arrays:               m = {a,b,c,d,d,f};     n = {b,b,a,d,d,e};      and get:               {0,b,0,d,d,0}      I have tried all kinds of things, like:               m = {a,b,c,d,d,f};     n = {b,b,a,d,d,e};     Transpose[{m, n}];     If[{x_ == y_} :> x, 0]      but clearly, I have no idea what I am doing! I am (obviously) very new to _Mathematica_ , and would greatly appreciate any help.
