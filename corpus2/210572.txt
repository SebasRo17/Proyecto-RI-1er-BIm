How do you deal with a senior developer who does not think that the company standard way of developing software applies to them ? For instance:   1. Will ask other developers to do work by email, rather than assign bugs to them.   2. Will keep copies of documentation and code in their own local area, rather than keeping them in the common area under source control. (and overwrite others changes with theirs) NOTE: This has been flagged to QA people before.
