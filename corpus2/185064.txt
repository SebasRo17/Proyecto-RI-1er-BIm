I don't have a specific context in which I'm asking the question, but while I was reading a beginner book on C++ I noticed the use of both an endl stream manipulator and a newline escape character when dealing with a stream object. The exmaple is as follows:               cout << "Hello World" << endl;     cout << "Hello World\n";      My questions are:   1. Is it more appropriate to use the stream manipulator (endl) in a certain situation and an escape character in a different one?   2. Are there drawbacks efficiency wise to using one of the two?   3. Are they completely interchangeable?   4. I read that an escape sequence is stored in memory as a single character. Does that mean it is more appropriate to use endl if you're going for low memory consumption?    5. Does the stream manipulator endl use up memory in any way, if so is it more than the escape sequence? Thanks, StackExchange Apologies if I posted this in the wrong section, I thought it counted as data structures.
