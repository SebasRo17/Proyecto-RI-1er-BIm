I have not see these links explicitly stated in the Agile literature I have read. So, I was wondering if this approach was correct: Let a story be defined as _"In order to [RESULT], [ROLE] needs to [ACTION]"_ then   1. _RESULT_ generates system tests.   2. _ROLE_ generates acceptance tests.   3. _ACTION_ generates component and unit tests. Where the definitions are the ones used in xUnit Patterns which to be fair are fairly standard. Is this a correct interpretation or did I misunderstand something?
