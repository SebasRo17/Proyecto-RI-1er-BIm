I'm a long time Java developer and finally, after majoring, I have time to study it decently in order to take the certification exam... One thing that has always bothered me is String being "final". I do understand it when a read about the security issues and related stuff... But, seriously, does anyone have a true example of that? For instance, what would happen if String weren't final? Like it's not in Ruby. I haven't heard any complaints coming from the Ruby community... And I'm aware of the StringUtils and related classes that you have to either implement yourself or search over the web to just implement that behavior (4 lines of code) you're willing to.
