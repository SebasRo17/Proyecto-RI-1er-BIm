Why would this work:               Clear[f]     f[a : PatternSequence[b_, c_]] := {a};     f[1, 2]     (* {1, 2} *)      and this also works:               Clear[f]     f[a : PatternSequence[_, _] ..] := {a};     f[1, 2, 3, 4]     (* {1, 2, 3, 4} *)      but this does not work?               Clear[f]     f[a : PatternSequence[b_, c_] ..] := {a};     f[1, 2, 3, 4]     (* f[1, 2, 3, 4] *)      * * * **Edit** : Now that @RunnyKine's answer and @kguler's comment have perfectly answered my original question, I have another related question: is there a pattern-based way that I could extract the first element of the repeated pattern sequence without doing this?               Clear[fNew]     fNew[a : PatternSequence[_, _] ..] := Partition[{a}, 2][[All, 1]]     fNew[1, 2, 3, 4]     (* {1, 3} *)
