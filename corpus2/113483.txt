I want to code my next work project in a language I'm unfamiliar with (python). I can think of plenty of reasons from my point of view why its a good idea (not least of all because it sounds fun). However my manager will probably ask me why. I'm a little stumped on the advantages from his point of view. **EDIT** : I normally code in C# **EDIT2** My reasons for wanting to code in another language;   1. It will make an easy project much harder so I will learn more and it will be more interesting   2. I have just read a book on python. I want the chance to apply it in a business application so I properly understand it   3. It will increase my skill set and make me more employable    4. Python looks fun
