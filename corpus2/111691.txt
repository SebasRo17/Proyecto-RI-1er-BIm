We are starting a new project and the board/stakeholders are asking for metrics to check the team performance. As a junior ScrumMaster I told them:   * about the Velocity and BurndownChart   * that we can chose any type of metrics as long as they are team based and not individual, they do not push people to act awkwardly / counter productive (as you get what you reward) Is there any other thing I can provide them in this regards? Have you got metrics other than velocity?
