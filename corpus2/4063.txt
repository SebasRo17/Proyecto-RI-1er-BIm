I had an interview question once which went... Interviewer: "Could you tell me how many people will eat curry for their dinner this evening" Me: "Er, sorry?" Interviewer: "Not the _actual_ number just an estimate" I actually started to stumble my way through it, when I stopped and questioned what it had to do with anything about the job. The interviewer mumbled something and moved on. I guess the question is, what is the point in the ridiculous questions? I just don't understand why they started coming up with these things.
