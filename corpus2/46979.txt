I'm a 15 year old kid who seems to excel in all of his classes, likes talking in 3rd person, and wants to learn more about programming and a little about html/php stuff. I already know a little python and I'm hoping to eventually learn Java/Javascript and C. I've been looking around and I've found some online lectures like this and some other tutorials that are so mind numbingly boring and difficult to understand. I was wondering if any of you knew of any good books or other resources that would actually teach me everything I'd need to know incrementally?
