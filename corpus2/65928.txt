Leaving aside anything you could do outside of work like OSS or self study, do you think job hopping is a good way of continuously learning new skills. In this context, my definition of job hopping is every 2-3 years, move companies, possibly even domains. By changing to the right jobs you could in theory learn a new language/framework and get exposure to other domains of knowledge. A quick update: This is not my current situation, nor is it an approach I have followed. The thought just struck me and I thought it was a good question.
