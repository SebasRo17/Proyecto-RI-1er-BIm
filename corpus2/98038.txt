I'm in process of selecting some training materials for our team. We mainly focus on C# (Silverlight and ASP.NET) I thought it would be a good idea to get some books (to keep us up to date) but also I ran into some websites that offer webcasts/workshops with annual subscriptions fees. I much prefer following some video and actually trying out some code rather than reading C# bible, hence I liked the idea. **Has anyone had any experience with those video/webcasts/workshop learning? Are there any good ones out there?**
