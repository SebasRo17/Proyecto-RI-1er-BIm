I have some data in the form:                data = {{{d, 0.68}, {g, 0.88}, {h, 0.23}, {e, 0.15}, {b, 0.46}, {a, 0.07}},               {{d, 0.86}, {c, 0.99}, {b, 0.21}},               {{c,0.83}, {h, 0.63}, {f, 0.11}},               {{d, 0.31}, {g, 0.65}, {e, 0.88}, {a, 0.70}},               {{d, 0.58}, {g, 0.09}, {c, 0.66}, {b, 0.18}, {a, 0.15}}}      These data are essentially related to each other in the following way:               {{{d, d1}, {g, g1}, {h, h1}, {e, e1}, {b, b1}, {a, a1}},       {{d, d2}, {c, c2}, {b, b2}},       {{c, c3}, {h, h3}, {f, f3}},       {{d, d4}, {g, g4}, {e, e4}, {a, a4}},       {{d, d5}, {g, g5}, {c, c5}, {b, b5}, {a, a5}}}      The ordering of elements within each second level list is:               order1 = {d, g, c, h, e, f, b, a}      I want to collect the second term of each third level pair and rearrange the elements according to a different order:               order2 = {b, h, d, a, e, f, c, g}      so that I end up with something like:               {{b1, h1, d1, a1, e1, f1, c1, g1},      {b2, h2, d2, a2, e2, f2, c2, g2},      {b3, h3, d3, a3, e3, f3, c3, g3},      {b4, h4, d4, a4, e4, f4, c4, g4},      {b5, h5, d5, a5, e5, f5, c5, g5}}      Where an element is missing I want to replace it with a zero to obtain rows of equal length. Using numbers it would look like:                 {{0.46, 0.23, 0.68, 0.07, 0.15, 0, 0, 0.88},         {0.21, 0, 0.86, 0, 0, 0, 0.99, 0},         {0, 0.63, 0, 0, 0, 0.11, 0.83, 0},         {0, 0, 0.31, 0.7, 0.88, 0, 0, 0.65},         {0.18, 0, 0.58, 0.15, 0, 0, 0.66, 0.09}}      I am currently using                (row = #;         Map[(ordi = #; k = Flatten[Position[row, _?((ordi == #) &)]];                  If[Length[k] == 0, 0, row[[k[[1]], 2]]]) & , order2]) &/@ data      **Edit** The code in the original question is now working... (thanks @partial81 for trying it - and sorry for the confusion). However, I am still interested in discovering different ways to get the result. Any alternative suggestions would be appreciated.
