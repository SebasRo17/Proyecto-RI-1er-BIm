I seem to have a lot of problems in the format of: > Given the sequence $a_n=\frac{n^\alpha+1}{2n^8+5}$, for $\alpha > 0$, find > the values of $\alpha$ such that the sequence converges. However, I can never seem to get _Mathematica_ to solve for a variable in a limit. I have tried               Solve[Limit[(1 + n^a)/(5 + 2 n^8), n -> Infinity, Assumptions :> a > 0] == 0, a]          Reduce[Limit[(1 + n^a)/(5 + 2 n^8), n -> Infinity, Assumptions :> a > 0] == 0, a]      `Solve` gave me no solutions, with a warning about inverse function. `Reduce` gave me the solution is `C[1] ∈ Integers && α == 0`, which also violates the initial assumption ($\alpha > 0$). However, I tried particular cases manually, such as               Limit[(1 + n^3)/(5 + 2 n^8), n -> Infinity, Assumptions :> a > 0] == 0        which gave `True`. Am I going about this in the wrong way?
