Do you have any particular style of organizing projects? For example, currently I'm creating a project for a couple of schools here in Bolivia, this is how I organized it:               TutoMentor (Solution)     TutoMentor.UI   (Winforms project)     TutoMentor.Data (Class library project)      How exactly do you organize your project? Do you have an example of something you organized and are proud of? Can you share a screenshot of the Solution pane? In the UI area of my application, I'm having trouble deciding on a good schema to organize different forms and where they belong. * * * **Edit:** What about organizing different forms in the .UI project? Where/how should I group different form? Putting them all in root level of the project is a bad idea.
