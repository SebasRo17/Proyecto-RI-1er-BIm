I've read through all the Q and A on the CDF plug-in and still am puzzled. I've managed to create some webpages with CDF content, it's working fine except when you reveal the animation menu and use the input field instead of the slider. If you type anything in the input field, the demonstration is no longer viable and you need to refresh the page to get it working again. The demonstrations at the main site don't have this issue. Is there something I can do to prevent this from happening? And is it possible to get numeric input in this way? Here is an example. My skills are limited so maybe this requires lots of checking of input values to insure they match the constraints of the demonstration?
