Does someone mind explaining why Module doesn't seem to work while inside `ToBoxes` or `MakeBoxes`.               SetAttributes[AutoInputField, HoldAllComplete];     AutoInputField /: MakeBoxes[AutoInputField[         list_: {}, displayNum_: 3, imageSize_: 100], form_] :=       ToBoxes@Module[{x = "default"},         x = "default";         Column[{           InputField[Dynamic@x, String, ContinuousAction -> True,             ImageSize -> imageSize],           Dynamic@x           }          ]         ];     AutoInputField[]     AutoInputField[]      Ideally x should be set to `"default"`, but as of right now x isn't taking on any value. Surprisingly `Module` is successful at scoping the different value because the two `InputField`s values don't change interactively. I am looking for a way to modify/set the value of x inside the `Module`.
