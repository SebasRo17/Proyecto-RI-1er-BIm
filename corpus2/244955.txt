There's a cool guitar tabbing application that I've used before where you can use the keyboard to move around a character grid. You can put any digit in any character cell. Here is an image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tIcil.png) This is similar to the VIM editor, where you have a block cursor and you can move around and place characters on the grid. I am using Qt as my GUI application. How would I go about adding this type of single-character editor control in my application? I have not run across this type of widget in any of my exposure to GUI programming; hence, I'm not even sure what to call it or how to describe it succinctly. Thanks.
