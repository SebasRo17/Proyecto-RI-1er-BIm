I have been dealing with programming for several years now (I am still a student but with a lot of internships). Mostly working with C++, Python and MATLAB, I noticed that whenever I download an SDK or a library from Internet/GitHub and look inside, the code is much more complex than mine, using error catches everywhere and other things that would never come to my mind while writing my own code. My question is, how can I learn or practice this kind of things? From my experience, no programming course talked about coding style, when and how to use try/catch efficiently, how to debug faster etc... I am also not thinking about using mutex while accessing one variable from different functions at the same time because my code is simply working without them and I didn't face any problem until now. Currently I am working on a project using Python and Pycharm is helping me a lot keeping a correct coding style but it is limited to the syntax and naming conventions.
