I left a job (to relocate to another country) where I programmed in Javascript and Haskell (some python) most of the time. I really liked it because people were objective, positive, mathematical, and yet got a bunch of stuff done. This was a truly professional shop. Now I work at an Agile/XP shop. While this is good and all I feel that maybe we are unprofessional when it comes to the selection of technologies and libraries. I feel that our approach to writing software is a bit immature and unstructured. I am trying to read the books I have been offered and they seem to encourage this style ( _ugh_ ). A lot of times we just pick libs off of git hub and use it without any type of review. I get forced to work with someone all the time even if it's a small task for one person. There seems to be a little "fast" rule for everything even if the rule can be broken by a trivial counter example (one time I made the mistake of giving that counter example and I was verbally attacked). Is this normal here in the states? How do I handle this dogmatism?
