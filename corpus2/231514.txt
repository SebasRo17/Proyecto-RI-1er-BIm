I was wondering the correct way to format a situation such as this, where I have a def, a foreach and an if clause all nested, requiring braces. Currently I find it hard to read, and there is no obvious place to put the 'x =>' bit. Thank you.               def getAnswer(): String =     {       var sum = 0       (0 until 1000).foreach        { x =>          if (x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0)         {           sum += x         }       }       sum.toString     }
