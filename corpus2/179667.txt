Suppose that you need to implement persistence, I think that you're generally limited to four options (correct me if I'm wrong, please) Each persistant class:   1. Should implement an interface (IPersistent)   2. Contains a 'persist-me' object that is a specialized object (or class) that's made only to be used with the class that contains it.   3. Inherit from Persistent (a base class) Or you can create a gigantic class (or package) called Database and make your persistence logic there. What are the advantages and problems that can come from each of one? In a small (5kloc) and algorithmically (or organisationally) simple app what is probably the best option?
