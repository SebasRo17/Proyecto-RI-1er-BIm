In this talk, Guido van Rossum is talking (27:30) about attempts to write a compiler for Python code, commenting on it saying: > turns out it's not so easy to write a compiler that maintains all the nice > dynamic typing properties and also maintains semantic correctness of your > program, so that it actually does the same thing no matter what kind of > weirdness you do somewhere under the covers and actually runs any faster **What are the (possible) challenges related to typing in writing a compiler for a dynamically typed language like Python?**
