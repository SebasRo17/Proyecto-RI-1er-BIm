I am working on an application which spawns a new thread per request. Sometimes the number of threads active on the machine at one time is in the high hundreds. It's suspected that this is causing all sorts of problems. I would like to experiment with using thread pool instead to see if this improves work throughput. But first, I have to convince the powers that be to allow me the time. As part of my argument, I think a good analogy that compares the brute-force "launch x threads" method to the technique of thread pools would help. Is there a text-book analogy for this?
