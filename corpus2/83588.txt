Other than the following, are there any helpful (to programmers) reasons to track hours/time on a project down to the "accurate number of hours per week" level? Reasons:   * Beneficial to see how estimates vs. actuals came out (to improve estimation)   * Management said so (for contractual or business reasons) This is a bit tongue in cheek, but my personal preference has always been to track at an abstracted level. For example: a person is either "full time" (defined as either 40hrs/week or a less intense 32hrs/week) or part time, or they spend a few hours here and there on the project. It seems (as a manager) that chasing any kind of accurate number for actual hours is much like measuring the length of a coastline. The more accurate you try to get, the more confounding it is. That said, I'd appreciate any insights on benefits to programmers. thanks!
