Could someone explain why Mathematica can't finish computing this limit (this is a limit of an array, when `n -> Infinity` (`n` is an integer), whose elements are area-integrals as shown):                Limit[Integrate[(x^(2n) + y^(2n)) Boole[x^(2n) + y^(2n) < 1], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}], n -> Infinity]      In the case when `n=2`, the integral is `Pi/2`, for `n=4` it is `(2 Gamma[1/4] Gamma[5/4])/(3 Sqrt[\\[Pi]])` Thanx
