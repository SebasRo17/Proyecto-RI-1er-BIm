**What things should be considered in the license etc when you're using some open source projects/ tools** in your application(in my case, specifically a web application/website) ? What are the terms & conditions to look for in the license and in what ways can they impact my future business in technological, financial or any other domains ? In my case I am using several open source tools like some of the Google open source products, some from Apache and several others like that.
