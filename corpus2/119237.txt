I am reading the epilogue of the _Anniversary Edition_ of the _Mythical Man Month_. The author, Frederic Brooks, says > Still vivid in my mind is the wonder and delight with which I - then 13 > years old - read the account of the August 7, 1944, dedication of the > Harvard Mark I computer... Which text is he referring to? I want to be filled with wonder and delight too. Where can get hold of this text so that I can read it too?
