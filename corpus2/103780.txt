I notice that web related code uses setter methods to set class fields instead of setting them directly since they are in scope. I find this to be a bit odd. Using setters is certainly safer, but if unit tests are implemented then bugs will be found. And it's not worth the extra stack call, imo. Does any production code do this or is this just what you see in sample code online? Edit: I have to make clear that I'm only talking about the case whereby the setter consists solely of a single assignment expression and nothing more.
