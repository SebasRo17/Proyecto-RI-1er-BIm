It's common to export graphics from _Mathematica_ that are subsequently scaled to various sizes that cannot (at least not conveniently) be anticipated. This is problematic in cases where (as is common) fonts and line weights need to fixed (e.g. throughout a document or presentation, or simply to prevent a figure from looking ridiculous). For example, if the default options for fonts and line weights are satisfactory, then               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[5 x]}, {x, 0, 2 Pi}]      will produce a figure with correct font sizes an line weights ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OAfFJ.png) and scaling this figure within _Mathematica_ (e.g. by dragging the resize frame) will preserve these font sizes and line weights: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f4hTI.png) However, if I export the original graphic in a resizable format (i.e., choosing "Save Graphic As..." and specifying a PDF "Vector Representation", which, as far as I can tell, is the only form suitable for subsequent resizing), the fonts and line weights scale with the graphic ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5lfdw.png) which is not the desired result. Is there a way to generate and export graphics so that font sizes and line weights are preserved when the exported graphic is resized?
