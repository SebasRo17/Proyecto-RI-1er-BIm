My company has so far been developing a medical device, which is connected via USB to a desktop system (running x64 Windows 7) to run the image analysis and do everything GUI related. I am familiar with both Windows and Linux programming, C, C++, C++11 and C#, but now our new project coming from management would be a handheld, embedded system, and since I am the only software engineer, I have absolutely no idea how embedded systems work. Is it totally different from the "normal" programming job, should I recommend hiring someone with embedded experience, are there good ressources for introduction to embedded computing? I am at a loss here, since I do not know what exactly to expect (it'll be in theory the same as with the desktop systems, a sensor acquiring an image, and the software doing analysis). Can someone help me get an idea what I would have to expect for this? Edit: there is no framework, as to what hardware to use. We can use whatever we want, as long as it is small enough to be handheld. We will be using a third party sensor (either photo-sensor, or acoustic sensor, thats not been established yet), but again, we are pretty much free to decide, so my guess will be that it will have a well established API. I don't even really know what embedded systems are, I have experimented privately with an Arduino, does that count as embedded already?
