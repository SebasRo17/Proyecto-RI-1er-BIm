I'm coming from a Java background and trying to learn Scala. At the moment I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed, there seems to be so much more to learn with Scala, so many different ways of doing the same thing. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on where to start, and how long it took them to feel reasonably competent in the language? Even little things like for loop comprehensions seem really powerful but it's just another piece of syntax you need to remember!
