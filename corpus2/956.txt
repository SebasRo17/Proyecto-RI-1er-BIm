To display the effect of uniform quantization (step size Q) I would like to draw a curve as shown below ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ohlaS.jpg) I tried this using               Plot[Round[n], {n, -3, 3},        Ticks -> {{-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3}, {-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3}},        AspectRatio -> Automatic, ExclusionsStyle -> Opacity[1],        AxesLabel -> {Input, Output}]       but couldn't get it to look perfectly as shown. As shown above tick lebels appear on different sides of the Y-axis. Can this be attained too?
