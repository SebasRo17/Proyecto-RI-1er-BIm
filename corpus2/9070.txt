I want to solve the following equation in mathematica : `DSolve[{X'[t] == A.X[t], X[0] == ( {{0},{0}} )}, X[t], t]` It is a system of 2 ODEs coupled by the matrix A, that I don't want to put in the form `{{a,b},{c,d}}` in order to have the output as a function of matrix exponential. Mathematica understands that but gives a solution strangely expressed as:                {{X[t] ->       InverseFunction[Dot, 2, 2][A,           E^(t A.1)          InverseFunction[InverseFunction[Dot, 2, 2], 2, 2][A, 0]]}}      Where it indeed uses a matrix exponential, but also relies on a strange notation `InverseFunction [...]` My question is how to get rid of this `InverseFunction` notation to have a more readable expression. Do I for example have a manner to postulate that A is a (2,2) matrix, invertible, with inverse B? Or more generally, how to solve vectorial ODE's and make Mathematica write the solution by relying on exponential matrix notation? If I can hope a better result with maxima, please advise. Thanks a lot for help
