Alright, I got a my first 3D print done of a pseudosphere using parametric plot and a deflated sphere using a contour plot, but when I try               ParametricPlot3D[         {Cos[v]*(3 - u) + .25*Sin[4 u],           Sin[v]*(3 - u) + .25 Sin[4 u],           u},        {u, 6, 13}, {v, 6, 13},       PlotStyle -> {Thickness[.3], FaceForm[Yellow, Blue]},        PlotPoints -> {50, 50}, MaxRecursion -> 0, Mesh -> All]       it gives an error about triangulation self-intersects. I do not have the exact error code because I'm not in charge of the MakerBot. It makes the first round and then stops. I noticed that the estimated time was 50 times longer than it took for that first loop. Is there a way to fix that, and maybe a changing plotting order would be more machine friendly?
