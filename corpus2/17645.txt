I have written a function `f[Ne,t,T]`, that gives back a **list** of results when evaluated with numeric values of the variables `Ne`, `t` and `T`. Now I want to make a `ParametricPlot` of the first element of the resulting list against another function `g[t,T]` for different values of the parameter `T`. So I try it for example like this:               TList={0,1,2};     ParametricPlot[ Table[ {Part[f[5,t,T],1] , g[t,T]} , {T,TList}] ,{t,0,10}]      Since I didn't use `Evaluate` inside `ParametricPlot`, all the curves have the same color. But if I do us `Evaluate` inside `ParametricPlot`, for example like this:               TList={0,1,2};     ParametricPlot[ Evaluate@Table[ {Part[f[5,t,T],1] , g[t,T]} , {T,TList}] ,{t,0,10}]      then `Part` is acting too early, and `f[5,t,T]` is evaluated to 5 (which is of course the first part of the expression `f[5,t,T]`), but that's clearly not that what I want. I want the `Table` command to be evaluated, so that `ParametricPlot` can "see" the different curves, but I want the first part of `f[Ne,t,T]` to be taken **after** the function `f[5,t,T]` is evaluated for the actual value of `t`. So what can I do?
