I'm playing with Go and run into something I'm unable to find in Google, although there is certainly something that exists: I'm using the following struct:               type Syntax struct {       name string       extensions *regexp.Regexp     }          type Scanner struct {       classifier * bayesian.Classifier       save_file string       name_to_syntax  map[string] *Syntax       extensions_to_syntax  map[*regexp.Regexp] *Syntax     }      I'd like to perform the following using Go and I'm quoting ruby because it's how I'd do that using ruby:               test_regexpes = my_scanner.extensions_to_syntax.keys      My goal is to get an array of *regexp.Regexp . Any idea on how to do that in a simple way ? Thank you !
