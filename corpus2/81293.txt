How can I encourage my coworkers to track the time they spend resolving issues and implementing features? We have software to do this, but they just don't enter the numbers. I want the team to get better at providing project estimates by comparing our past estimates to actual time spent. I suspect that my coworkers don't see the personal benefit, since they're not often involved in project scheduling.
