I am a self-taught 17 year old who knows Java and C# as well as I can, be learning them for over a year but I have never coded anything so therefor no experience.Me and my friend are working together on a program, I am coding the server and he is coding the client but my mind just goes blank, I have no idea where to start apart from maybe outlining some of the class structures, for example a package of packets that will be sent back and forth. How do I start to get my head around this? My mind just goes blank, I don't know what to do? I am desperate now as I want to get on in developing this but have no idea where to start, any tips will be appreciated!
