I have a simple question: **Slugify via helper or store theslug on database?** I mean, let's suppose that I have `Guilherme Oderdenge` on database and I want to transform it into a human-readable URL such as `http://myapp.com/guilherme- oderdenge/`, what's the best way to perform this? Storing `guilherme- oderdenge` in the database or transforming `Guilherme Oderdenge` in a slug with a helper like `user.name.slugify`? I know there are some ways to reach the expected result, but which one is better? Or at least there is a better way? ### It depends of the technology that you're using -   I'm using Ruby On Rails with MySQL.
