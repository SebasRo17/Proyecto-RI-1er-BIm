My company is exploring the move from Perforce to a DVCS and we currently use lots of Perforce proxies because the **software development teams are spread over Germany, China, USA and Mexico** and sometimes bandwidth from one place to another is not that great. Speaking with IT, we started looking for a way to keep things running smooth from the geographically distributed perspective so that everyone gets the latest and greatest without determining what repo server is the source of truth (i.e. **replicating transparently** ). I thought that **maybe we could emulate the DNS mechanism through pre-push and pre-pull hooks**. For example, consider countries A, B, and C. Upon pulling from blessed A, A itself will pull for changes from B, which in turn will pull for changes in C. If B and C have new changes they will fall towards A. Conversely, when there is a push, it could be propagated to all blessed repositories. I'm aware that **generally you only have one blessed repo, however this may not scale globally** and each blessed repository would just be applicable to the teams from a single country. **My question is** : is the conception of DVCS repo replication something used in practice?, has anyone done it succesfully?, if so, what is the correct way to do it?
