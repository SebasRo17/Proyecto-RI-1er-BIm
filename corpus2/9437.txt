I love the way that Mathematica handles type inn of formulas. It is really easy to type complicated expressions with shortcuts on keyboard. It would be great if I could use Mathematica completely to publish my articles. But why I don't: I cannot find tutorial for styling of notebook for pdf export. How to deal with page numbering, Header, Footer, page breaks, or placing graphs in wanted position, I mean not just to be line by line text. Is this possible? I believe it is, because I'm fascinated with MMA capabilities, but I'm lacking this skills. If someone could write brief tutorials on this, I believe that it would be appreciated by many others. I saw some text where it's emphasized that they are written totally in MMA (and they are really styled well). Thank you for any tips, ways of accomplishing these tasks and for sharing your experience.
