Take this scenario:   * A programmer creates a language to solve some problem.   * He then releases this language to help others solve problems like it.   * Another programmer discovers it's actually much better for some different category of problems.   * By virtue of this new application, the language then becomes popular for that application primarily. **Are there any instances of this actually occurring?** Put another way, does the intended purpose of a language have any bearing on how it's actually used, or whether it becomes popular? Is it even important that a language _have_ an advertised purpose?
