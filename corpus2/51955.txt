I am trying to use the `Manipulate` function in _Mathematica_ and want to plot an expression over a scatterplot of (x,y) data. I can programme the `Manipulate` function, but am unable to do this on the same axes as the scatterplot - any hints much appreciated I want to plot this data and then use `Manipulate` to visually fit a curve to the data... The code I have written for the Manipulate function is:               Manipulate[      Plot[c*k*(x^(c - 1))/((1 + x^c)^(j)), {x, 0, 5},        PlotRange -> {{0, 5}, {0, 10}}], {c, 0, 10}, {k, 0, 10}, {j, 0, 5}]      and I want to include a command so the following plot is included on the axes in the manipulate environment. The following data plot is created with:               ListPlot[ddata, PlotRange -> {{-6, 6}, {0, 0.05}}, AxesOrigin -> {-6, 0}]      ![This is the scatterplot I want in the background...](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HsAs0.jpg) ddata is given by:               ddata = First@ToExpression@Import["http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=KwJSvA2r", "Data"];
