This is the first time that I am working on a web application. I was going through the question What should every programmer know about web development? and noticed one thing that I knew nothing of: > Make sure your database connection information is secured. I am confused about it because as per my knowledge the database info, password, etc will be on my server used in my coding to connect to the db. Then what does this line specifically mean?
