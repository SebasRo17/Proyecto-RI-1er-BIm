I have following requirement and I am trying to design class diagram. This is the first time I am creating class diagram so I would like to get some advice from experts.. :) This is a simple login functionality implementation using mvc. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zssbk.jpg) I have a login controller that take login and logout request from the view. It uses security module class to authenticate users, check if the user already logged in or not and holds the list of logged in users. Would you consider this as a valid approach? and also if you can point out the room for improvement, I would really appreciate. Thanks.. :)
