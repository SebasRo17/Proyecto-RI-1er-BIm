Could someone explain to me how Mathematica evaluates the following integration.               NIntegrate[ ψ[x, y] mask[x,y],                  {x, 0, 25, 35, 65, 75, 100}, {y, 0, 25, 35, 65, 75, 100}]      How would this be expressed analytically?   `ψ` is non-zero and `mask` is zero in the `25 - 35` and `65 - 75` square region defined by               mask[x_, y_] := Piecewise[{{1 , y < 25}, {1, y > 75}, {1, x < 25},                                 {1, x > 75}, {1, 35 < y < 65 && 35 < x < 65}}, 0]      How would this be expressed analytically, and is it any different to               NIntegrate[ ψ[x, y] mask[x,y], {x, 0, 100}, {y, 0, 100}]       I don't have access to _Mathematica_ and am having discrepancies trying to port this to _Matlab_.
