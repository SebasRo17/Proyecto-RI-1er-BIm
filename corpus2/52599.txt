What do you think of Java's GNOME bindings and I was surprised to know that the latest version of the bindings was released this month and they're backed by a company that uses them, which means that there's a considerable amount of activity in the project, and that it's not going to be ditched anytime soon Is this going to be a second chance for Java on the desktop, since GTK+ is cross platform like swing, but less bloated and more responsive Should I be learning how to develop applications using it? or it's not worth the time?
