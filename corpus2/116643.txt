If I understand correctly, there was a huge birth of programming languages during the early decades of computing, but then things have stabilized. Basically, why are many universities and industries still using languages such as C and C++ (which were created decades ago), when there have been plenty of decades since then to improve upon and create more effective (and human- friendly) languages?
