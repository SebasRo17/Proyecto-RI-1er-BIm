Can I get this type of do-loop in _Mathematica_?               Do[Print[j," ",k," ",l], {j,k,l, {a, b,z}, { c, d,y} }]      I want this to work so that, in the first iteration, `j`, `k` and `l` take on the values `{a, b, z}` and then, in the second iteration, the values `{c, d, y}`. So the result should be > >     a b z >     c d y >   I'm interested in any kind of a looping structure which can do this job for me. I don't necessarily need a do-loop.
