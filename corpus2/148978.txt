I was (casually) researching semantic / ontology based approaches to technical documentation, when I stumbled upon this gem: > Literate Programming and the Semantic Web are ideas from different times, > which do have a connection. The linked paper, Literate Programming in XML by Norman Walsh, discusses XML technologies that are central to semantic web, however I fail to see the conceptual connection between literate programming and the semantic web _or_ ontology based documentation. Help?
