I came across the following situation: Evaluating               Sort[{".m", ".a", "co"}]      Results in               {".a", "co", ".m"}      I wondering: What was the criterion that _Mathematica_ use to output this? According to the documentation: > ...Sort orders strings as in a dictionary, with uppercase... After reading this, I expect a dictionary sort like this:               {".a", ".m", "co"}      Or               {"co", ".a", ".m"}      Can anyone explain me what was the criterion used by _Mathematica_ to perform this sort? Thanks in advance.
