How do I create book-like multi-column table formatting for a long, narrow tables in a preferably elegant way? Should I be thinking of stylesheets, instead of formatting? I guess this is a solved problem, after all. Row expression below is my own, feeble attempt to solve the problem. Although output is reasonably OK, I detest many details on the implementation; for instance, the magic constant 1.2 needed to make columns evenly tall.               Row[Pane[           Grid[#, Frame -> All, ItemSize -> {Automatic, 1.2},             ItemStyle -> FontFamily -> "Times",             Alignment -> {{Right, Left}, Center}],           ImageMargins -> 2] &         /@ Partition[#1, #2]] &[      {Round[#[[1]]], CityData[#[[2]], "FullName"]} &       /@ ({GeoDistance[$GeoLocation, CityData[#, "Coordinates"]]/             1000, #} &           /@ CityData[]~Select~(CityData[#, "Population"] >= 100000 &))        ~SortBy~First        ~Take~(3*20),      20]      ![OPs code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/41RPB.png)
