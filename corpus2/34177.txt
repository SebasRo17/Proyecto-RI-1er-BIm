I would like to create a network graph with curved edges. To do this, I wrote this function:               edgeFun[pts_, e_] := Module[{controlPts},          controlPts = pts /. {a_, b_} :> {a, {a[[1]] + .1 b[[1]], a[[2]]},                                              {a[[1]] + 0.1 b[[1]], b[[2]]}, b};            BezierCurve[controlPts]     ];      With no multiedges the `edgeFun` function works fine:               pts = {1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1};     Graph[pts, VertexLabels -> Placed["Name", Center], EdgeShapeFunction -> edgeFun]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NL3rJ.png) But when I want to create a network with multiple edges (note `1 -> 2` and `2 -> 1`, _Mathematica_ complains and the graph is pinked out:               pts1 = {1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 2 -> 1};     Graph[pts1, VertexLabels -> Placed["Name", Center], EdgeShapeFunction -> edgeFun]      > >     Part::partd: "Part specification 0.496922[[1]] is longer than depth of > object" >   Does anyone know how to solve this problem?
