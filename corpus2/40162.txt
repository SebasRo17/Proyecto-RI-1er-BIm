I'm solving systems of equations with a few different functions of time, t, and so I'm getting output with lots of [t] running around. Is there a way to display these functions without the dependences, e.g., to display               a[t] b'[t]      as               a b'      ? I can use a series of replacement rules to do this, e.g.,               /.{a[t]->a,b[t]->b}      but this is pretty cumbersome, and doesn't generalize well (e.g., when more functions are added in).
