I want to plot a 3D graphic and I want facegrids at the ticks that I specify. I've tried several solutions but I cannot get this working. The result with the code provided below is that it does its job except in the x-axis where it only draws a facegrid at the middle coordinate (and not in all ticks). Any advice is most welcome. Here is my code:               Plot3D[exp[R, bn, 50], {R, 2, 100}, {bn, 1, 5},            AxesStyle -> Thickness[0.005],            Ticks -> {{2, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},                       {0.5, 1.0,1.5, 2.0, 2.5}},             Boxed -> False,            Mesh -> {{0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100},                      {1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5}},             PerformanceGoal -> "Quality",            FaceGrids -> All,            AxesLabel -> {"X","Y","Z"}     ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KKEUo.png)
