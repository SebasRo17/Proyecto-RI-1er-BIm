I have a large set of points that are close to manifold which I want to show in a `ListPointPlot3D`. Using part of the data set illustrates this ![plot](http://vollmer.ms/homog3d_0) ![plot](http://vollmer.ms/homog3d_1) there are fewer data points in the middle. But using all the data with               ListPointPlot3D[list[[2 ;; n]]]      results in ![plot](http://vollmer.ms/homog3d_2) Is there a better way to visualize this? Somehow something like 3d contour plot of the density.
