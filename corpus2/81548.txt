I have just graduated from college and have about 2 months time before I start working at the company. I have experience in C, C++, Java and a bit of Android (developed an app last summer, stopped working on that later). I just want to learn something new while improving on my basic C , C++ and Java skills. I really need some advice on what I should start learning so that I will be able to work on whatever is given when I start my job... or in the sense that helps me improve from my present level... or that helps me understand things much better, assists me in getting a good understanding of things, etc.
