I am having a disagreement with someone (a client) about the user identification/authentication process for a system. The nub of it is that they want each user to have a globally unique password (i.e. no two users can have the same password). I have wheeled out all the obvious arguments against this (it's a security vulnerability, it confuses identification with authentication, it's pointless, etc.) but they are insisting that there is nothing wrong with this approach. I have done various google searches looking for authoritative (or semi- authoritative , or even just independent) opinions on this, but can't find any (mainly it's just such an obvious faux pas that it doesn't seem worth warning against, as far as I can tell). Can anybody point me towards any such independent opinion, please? **[EDIT]**   Thanks for all your answers, but I already understand the problems with this proposed approach/requirement, and can even explain them to the client, but the client wont't accept them, hence my request for independent and/or authoritative sources. I'd also found the Daily WTF article, but it suffers from the problem that Jon Hopkins has pointed out - that this is such a self-evident WTF that it doesn't seem worth explaining **why**. And yes, the passwords are going to be salted and hashed. In which case global uniqueness might well be difficult to ensure, but that doesn't solve my problem - it just means that I have a requirement that the client won't budge on, that's not only ill-advised, but is also difficult to implement. And if I was in a position to say "I'm not budging on salting and hashing", then I'd be in a position to say "I'm not implementing globally unique passwords". Any pointers to independent and/or authoritative sources for why this is a **bad** idea still gratefully received...   **[/EDIT]**
