I have a nested matrix `n`:               n = {{a, b}, {c, d}}     a = {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 1, 0, th}, {1, 1, 0, sh}}     b = {{0, t, q, dh}, {1, 0, 0, th}, {1, 0, 0, sh}}          c = {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 1, 0, th}, {1, 0, 0, sh}}     d = {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 0, 0, th}, {0, 1, 0, sh}}      With thanks to Nasser add column and Andy and Mike most efficient for their questions and answers, we can add a vector `m = {rr, kk}` to this nested matrix as a column, for example:               pp = Transpose[Insert[Transpose[n], Flatten@m, 1]]     or     pp=Join[List /@ m, n, 2] // MatrixForm      Finally, after running the above lines we have `pp` as:               {{rr, {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 1, 0, th}, {1, 1, 0, sh}},                  {{0, t, q, dh}, {1, 0, 0, th}, {1, 0, 0, sh}}},       {kk, {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 1,0, th}, {1, 0, 0, sh}},            {{0, t, q, dh}, {0, 0, 0, th}, {0, 1, 0,sh}}}}      and `pp/MatrixForm` as: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GF7Vt.png) The result is correct but I wanted to obtain an obvious and clarified figure of `pp/MatrixForm` same as : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p5ghm.png) Are there any possibility for obtaining the last form instead of the first form for `pp/MatrixForm`.
