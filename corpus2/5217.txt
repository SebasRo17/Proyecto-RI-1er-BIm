I am a little bit confused by the documentation for `Apply` (`@@`). I want to define a list of parameters, for instance:               parameters = {{1/2, 1/2}, {1, 1/3}, {2, 1/4}, {0.5, 1/5}};      Then I have a function:               (b/a)*((a/x)^(b+1))      Now I want to map the pair (a,b) to the values defined in `parameters` and generate a plot for each pair of parameters in the same graph. Now the plot syntax would look something like this:               p = Plot[Evaluate[myfunction /@ parameters], {x, 0, 3},              AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, AxesLabel -> {x, f}, PlotStyle -> styles]      What I struggle with, is getting the syntax right in the following part:               myfunction /@ parameters      How do I need to define this so I get a proper map of (a,b) to my list of parameters? To be honest, I am not very satisfied with the documentation for `Map`. Are there better tutorials?
