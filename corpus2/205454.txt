Very often, when using the command line or just programming, you want to express some kind of combination that you end up using a `for` - which is often verbose.               for (int i = 0; i<10; ++i)         std::cout << "img_" << i << std::endl;          for f in *; do echo "$f"; done      I always wondered if there is some kind of language made to simplify this case? For example:               "mv img_[0~6] imgs"      Would translate to               mv img_0 imgs     mv img_1 imgs     mv img_2 imgs     mv img_3 imgs     mv img_4 imgs     mv img_5 imgs      `img_[0~1][0~1]` could work for `img_00, img_01, img_10, img_11` `img_[x:0~2][x]` could work for `img_00, img_11, img_22` Etc. I'm not asking for this particular syntax, just if there is any kind of language/feature ever implemented with the purpose of expressing such combinations as easy as possible?
