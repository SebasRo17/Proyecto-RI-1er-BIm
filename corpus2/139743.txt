According to TIOBE programming language popularity index for March 2012, Objective-C is now almost as popular as C++. I'm a bit astonished by this fact. I would have expected C++ to be still head and shoulders above Objective-C in popularity, or am I mistaken and the TIOBE popularity index seems correct? Or do the companies like Apple pay them to create hype around their products?
