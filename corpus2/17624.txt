I have labeled the name(A,B,C) of each row on the left and value of each item , is there any way to put the total number(6,7,5) of each row on the right side without changing other labels?               BarChart[{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 4, 1}, {3, 1, 1}}, BarOrigin -> Left,       ChartLayout -> "Stacked", BarSpacing -> 0.5,       ChartLabels -> {Placed[{"A", "B", "C"}, Before], None},       LabelingFunction -> (Placed[#1, Center] &)]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zb8jN.png)
