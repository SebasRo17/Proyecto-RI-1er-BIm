Consider the complete graph on 3 vertices. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DB15Z.png) Then, a method gives me a list of interesting edges, say $\\{(1,2),(2,3)\\}$. I want to get a subgraph of $g$ that corresponds to precisely the given edgelist. How can I do this? If I use `Subgraph[g,e]` with `e = {1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3}`, I get back the original graph. This does preserve the colors, but includes an extra edge, namely $(3,1)$ that I don't want. However, `Subgraph` does have a pattern as an argument. That might do the trick, but perhaps there's an easier way.
