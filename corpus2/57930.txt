Say I have a power series, $f(x,y) \in 1 + x\mathbb{Z}[[x,y]]$ Then it admits a unique expansion $$f(x,y) = \prod_{i=1}^\infty \prod_{j=0}^\infty (1 - x^i y^j)^{n_{i,j}}$$ for some integers, $i, j$. More to the point, the $n_{i,j}$ for $i \le N$ and $j \le M$ are determined uniquely by $$f(x,y) = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=0}^M f_{i,j} x^i y^j = \prod_{i=1}^N \prod_{j=0}^M (1 - x^i y^j)^{n_{i,j}} + O(x^{N+1}, y^{M+1})$$ > How do I solve for the $n_{i,j}$ given the $f_{i,j}$? In principle there is some matrix with integer coefficients that needs to be inverted, but do I have to first generate that matrix (how?) and invert it, or can I just write something like the above in Mathematica and say ``solve'' ?
