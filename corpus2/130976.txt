I'm conducting a programming training for 3 months. Details in this link - Programming Training Details. My question is "How do we quantify benefits from such training?". I think the two important factors to focus on are   - Quality of Code   - Productivity  My current thinking is on the lines of having the group solve a problem on day 1 of the training and compare it with how the group solves a similar problem on the last day of the training. **Edit 1 :** Thanks for the feedback. This is a program which I have plans to extend to other teams if it is successful. And there by the thoughts on how to quantify benefits. I agree that all the replies saying "Its difficult to quantify!" and I had further discussions outside which helped me understand that measuring might even be counter productive.
