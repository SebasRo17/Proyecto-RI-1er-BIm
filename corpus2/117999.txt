I'm looking for advice on the best way to move from software engineering to quality assurance type of jobs. Let's imagine a middle aged developer who is not up to date on all the current technologies and is having hard time finding a software engineering jobs because he's not really senior/principal engineer type and all the non- managerial positions seem to be taken by younger folks. He has some decent scripting background in Perl/Python/Shell. I would think that he might be very useful on a QA team as a QA/scripter. Does this make sense? Is it possible to find a QA job like that with no pure QA experience on the resume? What's a good way to write a cover letter explaining this? Looking for ideas/good sounding phrases for the cover letter/general feedback on the direction I'm thinking about.
