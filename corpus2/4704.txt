While editing on a Mathematica notebook, I often find myself needing to do something else outside of Mathematica for a few hours. After finishing such outside tasks, I resume to work on the notebook. However, it is often difficult to find where the cursor/caret (text insertion point) is because blinking vertical bar is not visually prominent enough. Of course, I can set the cursor at an arbitrary location in the notebook by using mouse and clicking somewhere. The downside of this approach is that I lose context of my previous edits. After several hours, I still remember what I was editing generically, but I can't recall specific edits that I was making. Finding the cursor at the last position helps me to recall details of such specific edits. I want to make the cursor easier to find by making it visually more prominent such as blinking box or using different color. Is there such option? If the answer is yes, how can I set the option globally? Alternatively, can I highlight the current (physical) line? This would also make a point of last edit easy to locate.
