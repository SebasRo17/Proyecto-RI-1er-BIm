I am trying to plot my solution to a Laplace equation on an infinite domain. However, when I try to plot it, _Mathematica_ just runs with nothing happening.               f[x_, y_] = Sinh[u*(5 - y)]/Sinh[u*5]*100/π*Cos[u*(ξ - x)];      DensityPlot[Integrate[f[x, y], {u, 1, 10}, {ξ, -5, 5}], {x, -5, 5}, {y, 0, 5}]      The code I have tried is above. The solution is $$ f(x, y) = \frac{100}{\pi}\int_0^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sinh(u(5-y))}{\sinh(5u)}\cos(u(\xi - x))d\xi du $$
