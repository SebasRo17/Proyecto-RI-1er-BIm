Basically the whole thing can be explained simply: I need to index one or more SQL Server 2005 databases with lucene so I can search the various records. I found a lot of examples and documentation and I started to read it. The result is that I got confused and frustrated. So, as a beginner, what are the steps to implement it along with SQL server to search in the databases? I need some kind of workflow to follow so I can sort out a plan to work out the project. I don't really know where to start. -Bonus question: Is there a way to store the Lucene index directly into the SQL server database instead of a FSDirectory or RAMDirectory? -Last one: Do lucene supports similar word searchs? (I.E.: I search 'lu' and I get all the similar words show like the google suggestions, for example 'luke', 'lucene','lua' etc etc.) Please be as detailed as possible, I can program in C# and I've already wrote some SQL Server CLR assemblies to do various tasks, but Lucene mechanics are quite obscure to me. Thank you!
