Seeing as many, many open source products are offering translations in multiple languages, I decided I may want to design my application around this requirement. I currently have a niche application that has positive reviews - In English. If I wanted to expand the audience to allow users who speak other languages in, I need to find translators who also program. That's not what this question is about. What technique is standard for allowing Joe Developer who speaks English and French, to add in the French language for all the text, and how should I allow them to submit the changes? Is a separate text/language file the way to go?
