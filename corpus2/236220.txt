I'm creating a 2D game in plain ANSI-C using SDL2. I'm planning to let users create their own graphics. So, to achieve this, I'll use an information file which will hold some data such as Width, Height, X and Y position of each frame. But I have two views of this. One is to use a single file which will hold the information of all graphics. The other is to use one file for each graphic. Which one is faster and cleaner? Or it's just the same?
