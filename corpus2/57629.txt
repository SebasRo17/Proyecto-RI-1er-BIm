A more general question would be: How to find logical expressions for 3D-objects described by closed polygon sets? Finally a simple question is more prolific, therefore: ## How to define logical expressions for platonic solids ? I study this question for two days now, and I thought, I found an answer already:               PolyhedronData["Tetrahedron", "RegionFunction"]          (* out *)      Sqrt[2] + 4 Sqrt[3] #3 >= 0 &&        4 Sqrt[3] #3 <= 3 Sqrt[2] + 8 Sqrt[6] #1 &&        4 Sqrt[3] (Sqrt[2] #1 + #3) <= 3 Sqrt[2] (1 + 4 #2) &&        4 (Sqrt[6] #1 + 3 Sqrt[2] #2 + Sqrt[3] #3) <= 3 Sqrt[2] &      So far, so good. But then I discovered ...               PolyhedronData["Octahedron", "RegionFunction"]          Missing["NotAvailable"]      ok, this is not dramatic, I can define this myself. But doing so, I found out, it is better to give up those incomplete and specific `RegionFunction` definitions of Mathematica. This led me back to my question: How to define region functions for the 5 platonic solids in a better way? What are your ideas, your suggestions? At the moment I just want to concentrate on the platonics.               c = constant = Abs@1; (* -1 <= c <=  +1 *)      plotPoints = 100/2; (* half value while testing *)          RegionPlot3D[      And[x + y + z <= c, -x - y + z <= c,        x - y - z <= c, -x + y - z <= c, -x - y - z <= c, x + y - z <= c,        x - y + z <= c, -x + y + z <= c], {x, -c, c}, {y, -c, c}, {z, -c,        c}, PlotPoints -> plotPoints]      ![octahedronRegionFunction](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4MvgF.gif) The octahedron region function could be simplified to: (not sure, if it's really a good idea )               RegionPlot3D[      Abs@x + Abs@y + Abs@z <= c, {x, -c, +c}, {y, -c, +c}, {z, -c, +c},       PlotPoints -> plotPoints]      two region functions for tetrahedrons of interest               RegionPlot3D[      And[x + y - z <= c, +x - y + z <= c, -x + y + z <= c, -x - y - z <=         c], {x, -c, +c}, {y, -c, +c}, {z, -c, +c}, PlotPoints -> plotPoints]          RegionPlot3D[      And[x - y - z <= c, -x - y + z <= c, -x + y - z <= c, +x + y + z <=         c], {x, -c, +c}, {y, -c, +c}, {z, -c, +c}, PlotPoints -> plotPoints]      # What would be `nice` regionFunctions for `Dodecahedron` or `Icosahedron`, to complete the 5 platonics ? You may checkout yourself the definitions for `RegionFunction` done by Mathematica. Especially non-convex polyhedrons have no region functions defined.
