I'm teaming up with a guy who has no programming experience. We're using a tool to make our game (RPG Maker) that has an event-based system that allows you to do pretty much everything you want. They have a GUI and a simple text editor for events. My friend has no programming experience. None. I need him to understand basic stuff, like control flow (if/else, do/while), variables/constants, etc. What can I use to teach him this, bearing in mind that I don't care about specific language syntax? Ideally, I'm looking for a "programming" book that talks about these ideas (perhaps visually) and doesn't care much about code. Does something like this exist? My "google-fu" failed me.
