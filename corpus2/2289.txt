Looking at this question, I am reminded of a problem that I was never able to solve with obtaining a particular plot format. The issue is that `GridLines` sit _behind_ anything in `Prolog`. You can have gridlines with a colored background by giving the background a non-zero `Opacity`.               Framed@Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, Frame -> True,        Prolog -> {LightGray, Opacity[0.5],          Rectangle[Scaled[{0, 0}], Scaled[{1, 1}]]},        GridLines -> {None, Automatic}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OkpGL.png) But if the gridlines are to be white, this isn't feasible, it seems.               Framed@Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, Frame -> True,        Prolog -> {LightGray, Opacity[0.5],          Rectangle[Scaled[{0, 0}], Scaled[{1, 1}]]},        GridLines -> {None, Automatic},        GridLinesStyle -> Directive[AbsoluteThickness[2], White]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3aeVP.png) Yes, you can use the undocumented option `Method -> {"GridLinesInFront" -> True}`, as described in this answer, but then the gridlines go on top of the plot line as well as the background.               Framed@Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, Frame -> True,        Prolog -> {LightGray, Opacity[0.5],          Rectangle[Scaled[{0, 0}], Scaled[{1, 1}]]},        GridLines -> {None, Automatic},        GridLinesStyle -> Directive[AbsoluteThickness[2], White],        Method -> {"GridLinesInFront" -> True}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IREBO.png) Is there a way to reorder the `Prolog` background or the gridlines somehow, so that white gridlines shock, but the gridlines don't go over the plotted function? Try as I might I was never able to replicate this format (the axis numbers _inside_ the frame are a whole other question). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9REBg.png)
