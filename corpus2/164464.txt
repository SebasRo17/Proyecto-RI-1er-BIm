I am reviewing a proposed OO software architecture that looks like this:   * `Base`     * `Foo`       * `Something`     * `Bar`       * `SomethingElse` Where `Base` is a `static` class. My immediate thought was that every object in any class will inherit all the methods in `Base` which would create a _large_ object. Could this cause problems for a large system? The whole architecture is hierarchical.. the 'tree' is much bigger than this really. Does this sort of architecture have a name (hierarchical?!). What are the known pros and cons?
