Is there a way to work around integration over `Boole` being mysteriously flaky like examples show below? Is there a meaningful explanation for this behaviour? First, rather obvious integral stays unevaluated:               Integrate[Boole[u^2 + v^2 < 1], {u,-1,1}, {v,-1,x}, Assumptions -> -1 < x < 1]          (* Integrate[Boole[u^2 + v^2 < 1], {u,-1,1}, {v,-1,x}, Assumptions -> -1 < x < 1] *)      While the following succeeds to produce a meaningful result:               Integrate[Boole[u^2 + v^2 < 1], {u,-1,1}, {v,-1,x}, Assumptions -> -1 < x < 0]          (* Pi + x Sqrt[1 - x^2] - ArcCos[x] *)      Why this succeeds particularly puzzles me, when the first one fails:               Integrate[Boole[u^2 + v^2 < 1], {u,-1,1}, {v,-1,x},       Assumptions -> -1 < x < Infinity] // FullSimplify          (* Pi + x Sqrt[1 - x^2] - ArcCos[x]             x <= 0        Pi                                           x >= 1        x Sqrt[1 - x^2] + ArcCos[x] + 2 ArcSin[x]    True *)
