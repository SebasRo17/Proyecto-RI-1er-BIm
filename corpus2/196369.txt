I'm a wimpy web programmer by trade -- I enjoy programming in JavaScript, CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and Ruby. I have to program in C++ for my computer science degree, and it frustrates me. I don't much like the syntax and I feel that it's more verbose than it could be. I think I've roared "I hate C++" at least once per CS project. I don't need to _love_ C++, but I wonder if someone who adores the language can tell me what I can do to ease my pain. C++11 and Syntastic for Vim have certainly helped, but I'm wondering if there's something more than that -- a specific tool or an abstract philosophy.
