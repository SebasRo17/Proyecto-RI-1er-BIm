I'm a software developer that just switched teams so I shall write code in Java now. Last time I wrote something in the language was in programming 101 at uni (I was already an amateur coder back then). So what is the best book/tutorial to get up to speed with Java? Where's the _Java - the good parts_? Learn you some Java for great good? _Learn Java the hard way_? Or is it too enterprisey for that kind of passion...?
