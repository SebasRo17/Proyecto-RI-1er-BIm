How many of you have ever used (or even know of) the Visual Studio Text Templating Engine? I mean, T4 templates have been around for quite some years now. The where initially included in Visual Studio 2005 SDK, and they where moved to Visual Studio 2008 core just before releasing it. What I want to know is if this is really used out there. I mean, why doesn't the VS team invested in a descent minimal editor for the templates? It doesn't even have syntax couloring! I know there are a couple of good T4 editors out there, but as they don't come built in, I tend to think that this is an unknown feature for most developers. Have you ever used T4 templates in any of your projects? I'm really interested in answers that explain how they created their own T4 to accelerate, automate, or generate artifacts for your project.
