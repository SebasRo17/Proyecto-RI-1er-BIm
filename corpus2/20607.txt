I am currently creating a poster for a conference in Scribus. I have a given space on the poster for a plot that I want to create with Mathematica. I don't want to scale in in Scribus, as this would change the font size. Thus, the image should already have the expected size when I export it to PDF. However, the results I put into `ImageSize` don't match the dimensions of the PDF created. Is there a possibility to create a plot that is trimmed to the actual content (plot and labels) without a white border and matches a given size? Here is an example. I have a 100mm x 200mm slot in my poster, and I would like to fill it with the Plot below. AspectRatio etc. should be adjusted to the given dimensions. As I want to preserve my font size, it is not enough to export the correct AspectRatio, but I need the dimensions.               Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 2}, LabelStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 24},       ImageSize -> {2.835 100, 2.835 200}, AspectRatio -> Full,       RotateLabel -> True, Frame -> True,       FrameLabel -> {{"I [a.u.]", ""}, {"position (mm)", ""}}]      I checked with WolframAlpha that 2.835 is the factor pt->mm, as 72 is for pt->inch. However, if I export this plot to PDF, Acrobat tells me the dimensions are 69.8mm x 140.4mm. Additionally, I am dealing with a white border, that I cannot remove with `ImagePadding->0`, as that just leaves the coordinate system without the labels. This is bad because for example, my caption next to the image now starts above the image.
