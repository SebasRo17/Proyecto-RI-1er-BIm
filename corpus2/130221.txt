Once you escape the realm of electrical signals and are dealing with software, is there really such a thing as a "push" architecture where there isn't periodic polling? I can't think of any design where it's not polling at _some_ level. It seems like it's always just a level or two beneath the actual abstraction/API you are dealing with. Sockets at the receiving end of most "push" connections just poll for incoming requests, etc.
