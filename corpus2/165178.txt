For a project, I have to classify a list of banking transactions based on their description. Supose I have 2 categories: health and entertainment. Initially, the transactions will have basic information: date and time, ammount and a description given by the user. For example:               Transaction 1: 09/17/2012 12:23:02 pm - 45.32$ - "medicine payments"     Transaction 2: 09/18/2012 1:56:54 pm - 8.99$ - "movie ticket"     Transaction 3: 09/18/2012 7:46:37 pm - 299.45$ - "dentist appointment"     Transaction 4: 09/19/2012 6:50:17 am - 45.32$ - "videogame shopping"      The idea is to use that description to classify the transaction. 1 and 3 would go to "health" category while 2 and 4 would go to "entertainment". I want to use the google prediction API to do this. In reality, I have 7 different categories, and for each one, a lot of key words related to that category. I would use some for training and some for testing. Is this even possible? I mean, to determine the category given a few words? Plus, the number of words is not necesarally the same on every transaction. Thanks for any help or guidance!
