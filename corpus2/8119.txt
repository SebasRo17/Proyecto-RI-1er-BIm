In what circumstances should an IT Consultant encrypt their hard drive to protect their code/data of their clients? I am thinking that if it does not add much to your work load you might as well use full disc encryption with a 'weak' password to at least prevent someone from accessing your email files and other documents if your laptop is stolen, even if they will not get access to any database files or other very sensitive data.
