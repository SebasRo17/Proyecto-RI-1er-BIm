What are the best practices for designing a workflow for inviting users to a beta website? This is not for any specific programming language. 2 main requirements are   1. An interested user can request for an invite using her email   2. A signed up user can invite others via email (or social media maybe?). My thoughts:   1. In case#1, on submit, generate a reversible hash of the email and the timestamp of submission.    2. Then, send an email with the hash as a query param. When someone clicks on the URL, the controller/router should decrypt the hash and validate the timestamp. If valid, check if the user already exists, else, forward to the sign up page with the email id field pre-populated (or frozen), and allow the user to enter & confirm password and other details.   3. If the timestamp had expired, send another email to the same user with a new hash.   4. Case#2, should be exactly similar, but instead of the interested user, an existing user fills up the invitation form, and the email sent to the interested user will have the email or name of the existing user. Are there any security concerns in this approach? Are there any approaches that would provide a better UX?
