I have a new Macbook Pro (Retina), running Mavericks. For some reason I cannot access the camera in Mathematica using CurrentImage[] or ImageCapture[]. The result is:               CurrentImage::checkcam: Mathematica was unable to connect to a camera. Check      that a camera is properly connected and that it is not currently in use      by another application. >>      I do note that \$ImagingDevices is {}, and \$DefaultImagingDevice is None. Any ideas?
