I am interested in exploring the new functionality on random processes available in _Mathematica_ 9, but I am not familiar with all of the underlying mathematics. Could you recommend a book that provides a foundation on these topics? I am thinking about a book that favors intuition and breadth over proofs. I have an engineering background (and know probability and statistics decently well) and would like to rapidly take advantage of these functions. I am interested in both modeling and estimation issues.
