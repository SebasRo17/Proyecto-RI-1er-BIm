In my thesis, I want to show the structure of the program, like this: > >     > Menu  ---  Settings ---- Audio ---- ... >     >                     ---- Video >     > >     >       ---  Perform  ---- Calculation >     >                     ---- Video demo >   You know, like a map for a website, I would like to present a tree for the menu. But does this have a fancy name in SW engineering?
