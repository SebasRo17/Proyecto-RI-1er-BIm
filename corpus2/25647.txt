I am using `Inset` to add an `Epilog` to a plot. The position of the images (in my case: framed numbers) can be specified as an option of `Inset`. I would like the y-coordinate to be the same for all `Inset` elements (they are created via `Table`), relative to the plot size. Say, for example, it should be the y-coordinate of `Scaled[*,0.9]`. The x-coordinate should, for each element, be an absolute value, depending on its position in the table. While I know how to specify relative and absolute coordinates, also as functions of the table position, I can't get `Scaled` to work for only one coordinate: specifying my `Inset` coordinates via something like               {*abs. value*, Scaled[.9]}      yields the following error message:               Coordinate {*abs. value*, Scaled[0.9]} should be a pair of numbers, or a Scaled or Offset form.      Any help on this? * * * **Update:** I also tried snippets like `Scaled[*some value*,.9][[2]]` to extract the y-coordinate, but to no avail.
