Is there a good moment to release an app? Is there a bad moment to release an app? For example, maybe Spring/Summer won't get as many sales as the Fall/ Winter. In the sense that kids getting out of school will be spending less time in front of the screen, more time hanging out outside, etc. Any opinions on the matter?
