I'm working with php and sql. I think that my method of implementing functions is better than what my boss proposes. Just now he explained me how to do a check on a list of email addresses, and I do not like his idea. I proposed mine which is better and quicker to implement, but he disagreed. Now I think I will go ahead and implement my idea, because his idea was not clear enough to me. Do you think he will be mad?
