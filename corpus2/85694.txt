I wrote a really cool bookmarklet and now I want to tell everyone. I have absolutely no idea where to go, is there some sort of exchange for these things? In case anyone is curious: I was tired of having to retype URLs from my desktop browser on to my phone browser, with its itsy-bitsy keyboard, so I wrote a bookmarklet that converts the current URL to a QR code, which I can scan in a few seconds.               javascript:window.location="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chs=250x250&cht=qr&chl="+escape(window.location)
