I would like to map my data on Archimedes' spiral and preserve the distance between points on the curve. The test data consists of 20 evenly spaced `{x,y}` coordinates:               data = Table[{i, i}, {i, 20}]      When I map the data to a spiral, the points are not evenly spaced anymore:               Show[ListPlot[{#[[2]] Sin[#[[1]]], #[[2]] Cos[#[[1]]]} & /@ data,        AspectRatio -> 1, PlotRange -> {{-20, 20}, {-20, 20}}],       ParametricPlot[{t Sin[t], t Cos[t]}, {t, 0, 20}]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CEaCg.png) I found this question that links to the algorithm that iteratively generates evenly distributed points on a spiral, but how can I apply this to my set of data points? The final goal that I'm trying to achieve is to create a function that I can use with `ImageTransformation` that will remap an image that roughly resembles a line to an Archimedes' spiral.
