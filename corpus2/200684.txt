In the same way that a `publication` table might relate to a `person` table via `subscriptions`, or a `company` table might relate to a `person` table via `employee`, I'm wondering if there is a descriptive way to relate a `company` table to a `company_type` table. Here are some rough (and simplified) examples of the relevant tables.   **company:**   \- |id|name|   **company_type:**   \- |type|description|   **{name needed}:**   \- |id|company_id|type| Also, I realize that not all relationships can be as succinctly named as `subscriptions` or `employee`, so if that's the case here, what would be a good rule of thumb to avoid a near name-collision with something like `company_types`? _Additional Details:_   Company types, in our current case, are _somewhat_ convoluted. This industry has multiple supply channels and multiple customer channels, so while "vendor" is a valid company_type, a vendor can also be "independent", "authorized", or "franchised" ... or any mix of the three.   Customer types are very similarly multi-faceted, and to further compound the issue, a single company can simultaneously be of some vendor and customer types.
