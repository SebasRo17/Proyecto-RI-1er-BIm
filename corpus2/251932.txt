I want to know if a license exists that is similar to GPL but allows only source distribution (that is no binary distribution). Why do I want this? The idea is that I want fellow programmers to be able to have the benefits of open source software BUT also retain control over the consumer binary distribution. Specifically I want to prevent my software to be picked by organazations like the linux distributors. I want the users of my software to dowlnload binaries only from my site. Is this possible? Thanks
