Sometimes I spend ridiculous amounts of time (hours) agonizing over making code "look pretty". I mean making things look symmetrical. I will actually rapidly scroll through an entire class to see if anything jumps out as not looking "pretty" or "clean". Am I wasting my time? Is there any value in this kind of behavior? Sometimes the functionality or design of the code won't even change, I'll just re- structure it so it looks nicer. Am I just being totally OCD or is there some benefit hidden in this?
