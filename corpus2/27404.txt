Why should we do a `Reverse` on the image data after an `ImageTake` ? For example:               OIcut = ImageTake[OIBW, {80, 160}, {90, 170}]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7tKLC.png)               OIrev = Reverse[ImageData[OIcut]];     ListDensityPlot[OIrev, ColorFunction -> GrayLevel]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tI98g.png) I see the image gets a little smoother and probably brighter. Any idea why this happens after an `ImageTake`?
