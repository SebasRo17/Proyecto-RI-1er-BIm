In the help page `ref/message/FunctionInterpolation/ncvb`, it is mentioned that one should specify `AccuracyGoal` for some (even very simple) functions:               FunctionInterpolation[Sqrt[x], {x, 0, 1}, AccuracyGoal -> 2]      However, when I evaluate it, a lot of error messages are generated, such as > Thread::tdlen: Objects of unequal length in {-(1/8),-(1/24),1/24,1/8}^{} > cannot be combined. FunctionInterpolation::nreal: "Near x = 1/8, the > function did not evaluate to a real number. Also, the precision I got is very bad (as one can check using `Plot[%[x] - Sqrt[x], {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> All]`). The error is about 5% so not usable for realistic work (and the situation does not change when I increase AccuracyGoal). Is it a bug? Perhaps I have to do `Interpolation` or `ListInterpolation` by hand myself.               $Version      > "9.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit) (February 7, 2013)" PS: I found this thread may be related but still different FunctionInterpolation Errors / Question re Evaluation Order and Options
