Does some package exist with a function that takes a parameter $n$ and generates a random 2D $n$-sided **simple polygon** (convex or non-convex), possibly within a certain bounding box? It does not suffice to simply generate $n$ random points as I would have to figure out how to connect the points in a non-intersecting manner. I am sure there are algorithms to solve this particular problem, but I would much rather use a **ready-made function** that would be guaranteed to work, rather than code my own function and introduce more bugs. I am trying to generate a large number of "random" test cases for my algorithm that is supposed to work for all polygons.
