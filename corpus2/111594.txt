I am using a library that returns a JSON object (as a string, but I think that's standard), and I would like to store the contents of this object into a local database. I'm fairly fresh-faced in terms of interfacing with DBs, but I can find my way around. I was using a MySQL database to store the data, but this involved using methods to extract the fields of the raw object, and slicing and dicing. I'm wondering if it would be more efficient to use a NoSQL solution to store the data, as it's already in the right form.
