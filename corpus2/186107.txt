I am working on a product for a client that must be valid and fit for purpose. It's built on a LAMP stack (PHP/Cake), so there's GPL, MIT, PHP, APACHE licenses: > "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express > or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of > TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or **FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR > PURPOSE**. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of > using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your > exercise of permissions under this License. My rationale that my product is valid and fit for purposes:   * The signed UAT doc proves validity and fitness for purpose.    * The stack is so widely used by developers, industry and end users (netcraft, gartner etc. stats), that there is a consensus that it IS fit for purpose. (ie we can disregard the fitness for purpose statement in the warranty disclaimer to an extent) Is this a valid point? Can I make claims that my software is fit for purpose?
