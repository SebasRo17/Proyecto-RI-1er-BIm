In Microsoft Office OneNote 2010, creating and editing tables is easy. There are simple toolbar controls for creating tables: ![Creating a table](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yptMM.png), and editing them once they exist: ![Editing a table](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DelBl.png). My question is, what's an easy way to get the same functionality for a _Mathematica_ notebook? I would like to be able to create tables containing text, images, or inline math writing. Editing a cell in a table should be just like editing the contents of a text cell. Ideally, the appearance of the table would be customizable, e.g. cell border and background colors. Maybe a palette would help.
