Following my other question, is there a general rule of thumb, when we should pass a setting-like value, that controls class' behavior (for example displayed texts) as as class' constant or variable, one-by-one, and when it is better to "pack" them to one associative array? Or is it just a choice of the developer? For example -- is this approach better (PHP code):               class SomeClass     {         public $errorIncorrectProtocol = 'Please, don't use GET protocol in this context!';         public $errorMissingId = 'The ID can't be empty or equal zero...';     }      than this one:               class SomeClass     {         public $errorMessages = array         (             'IncorrectProtocol'=>'Please, don't use GET protocol in this context!',             'MissingId'=>'The ID can't be empty or equal zero...'         );     }      and if yes -- then, why?
