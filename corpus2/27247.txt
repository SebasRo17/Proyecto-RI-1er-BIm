I have the following command:               RegionPlot3D[       Log[p1/(1 + p2)] > 0, {p1, 0, 0.5}, {p2, 0.5, 1}, {C, 0, 1}]      and my _Mathematica_ 9 gave me the following error message: > RegionPlot3D::boolf: "Log[p1/(1+p2)]>0 must be a Boolean function." I have no idea why `Log[p1/(1+p2)]>0` is not a Boolean function. It just looks like an innocent inequality that should work in `RegionPlot3D`. Note: I have simplified the inequality so it does not involve `C`, but in the original version it does contain `C`.
