I've a list of rectangles in the form               {index, {centerX, centerY}, {width, height}}      I want to find intersecting rectangles list. I want to obtain a list on the form               {{indx...indy},{indt...indz}...}      Every element of this list is a list of rectangles that have at least an intersection in common, with transitive property: if rectangle 1 intersects rectangle 2 that intersect rectangle 3, these are a part of the same group. If I've this situation in the image below, my intersecting list should be               {{1,2,10},{6},{7,5},{3},{4,8,9}}      (element order is not important). How can I accomplish this? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iIKTw.png) EDIT: There's a real sample data, with two groups and an isolated rectangle:               obj2 = {        {1, {0, 0}, {1, 1}},        {2, {0.5, 0.5}, {1, 1}},        {3, {3, 2}, {0.5, 0.6}},        {4, {1.2, 0.5}, {0.5, 0.6}},        {5, {2, -0.3}, {0.4, 0.4}},        {6, {2.1, -0.4}, {0.3, 0.4}}        };
