I have a set of data taken on sequential days, but some points are missing. I'd like to make a joined date list plot, where the points are not joined across the missing point.The following example illustrates the desired result.               data1 = {     {{2013, 7, 1}, 1},     {{2013, 7, 2}, 5},     {{2013, 7, 3}, 2},     {{2013, 7, 4}, 4},     {{2013, 7, 6}, 2},     {{2013, 7, 7}, 6}     };     data2 = {     {{2013, 7, 1}, 6},     {{2013, 7, 2}, 2},     {{2013, 7, 3}, 4},     {{2013, 7, 4}, 1},     {{2013, 7, 5}, 7},     {{2013, 7, 6}, 1},     {{2013, 7, 7}, 4}     };     DateListPlot[{     data1[[1 ;; 4]],     data1[[5 ;; 6]],     data2[[ ;; ]]     }, PlotStyle -> {Blue, Blue, Red}, Joined -> True]      Note that `data1` is missing a point on July 5. In practice I'm doing this with multiple data sets, with hundreds of points, so breaking it apart and manually assiging plotstyle like I have here is not viable. How can I make `Joined` skip missing points?
