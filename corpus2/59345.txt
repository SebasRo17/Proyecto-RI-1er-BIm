I would like to rewrite symbolic definite integrals such that the bounds are always positive. For example : $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \mathrm{d} x \rightarrow \int_0^\infty \left[ f(x) + f(-x) \right] \mathrm{d} x$ I know that in mathematica, you can provide a custom complexity function to `Simplify` in order to get a result in a specific form. I was wondering if this could be applied in some way to my problem. Unfortunately, my google search for this kind of problems came up empty. As a first step, it would be really helpful if anyone knew a function that returns the bound of a symbolic integral. Thanks for any help !
