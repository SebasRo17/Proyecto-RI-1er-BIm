I am using the combination of spring, spring-security, struts and iBatis in my application. Now I am looking to migrate the struts UI to GWT. The new combination must be spring, spring-security, GWT and iBatis. I applied a layered approach to develop my application. In Controller/UI layer i am using Struts. I want to replace struts and use GWT in Controller/UI layer. Is is possible to use GWT without affecting another layers DAO/BL/SL?
