Please have a look at following snippet:               public class Foo {     int digit;     String name;          Foo (int d, String n) {         this(d);         // cannot do following.         //compile-time error: Constructor call must be first statement in a Constructor          //this(n);     }          Foo (int p) {         digit = p;     }          Foo (String q) {         name = q;     }      What would be the reason of this restriction? I understand why call to Constructor (both in a Constructor or in a method) has to be first statement - the object should be initialized properly before it is used. What I don't get is compiler not allowing calling multiple constructors of the same class from within a constructor. I don't see any problem with this construct - both regarding initialization and invarients. It'd be great if someone can shed some light on what I am missing here... Thanks!
