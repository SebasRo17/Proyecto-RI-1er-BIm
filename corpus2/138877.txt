Somewhat related to this question, say that I have an object category which, depending on which type of object I have, has different restrictions on what it contains. (if you can reword the previous sentence to make more sense I'd appreciate it) For example               var SomeSchema = new Schema({       _id: ObjectID,       [... large number of common fields ...]       type: //Restricted somehow to members of a fixed array       data: //depending on type, this might be restricted - sometimes an integer, sometimes array, etc...     });      What's the idiosyncratic method for defining this type of schema? Is it appropriate to define a single schema, and handle the types inside of it's members, or am I better off with separate schema for each type?
