I've just begun reading "The Art Of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove, and while I'm mostly finding the material very helpful, he makes a statement about not using messages in your Assert statements. > "Please never, _ever_ , use this parameter. Just make sure your test name > explains what's supposed to happen." My question is, in you experience do you find this advice to be good or bad? If you use assert messages in your unit tests, what information do you use it to capture beyond what a well named unit test could give you in the first place?
