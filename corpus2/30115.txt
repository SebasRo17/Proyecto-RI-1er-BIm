Is it possible to format usage messages (with italic arguments etc) such that Mathematica 9 still parses function templates correctly? For example, plain usage messages work when pressing `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`K`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MEiwC.png) But formatted ones don't: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/P0EZX.png) Note that this does work correctly on Mathematica 8, so I guess this is a bug on Mathematica 9.0.1. Nonetheless, is there a workaround?
