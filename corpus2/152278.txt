I am wondering if I would need to license the Metro style or if I can just freely use it in my own applications. I mean, is it patented or protected in any way that would prevent me from building my own implementation? I effectively would like to copy the visible part of it. I like to idea of being able to:   * Provide an interface which is used somewhere else (as in 1 less to learn)   * Use the interface that has been tested for usability (I personally like it)   * Have the possibility of getting free publicity because of implementing full Metro style web application while not associated with Microsoft, etc.
