I want to make a program that takes a screenshot of the desktop window including overlapping windows and then scans the bitmap for certain pixels at specific locations to identify. I read this is how you do it from: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5051/Various-methods-for-capturing-the- screen               Void CaptureScreen()     {         int nScreenWidth = GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN);         int nScreenHeight = GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSCREEN);         HWND hDesktopWnd = GetDesktopWindow();         HDC hDesktopDC = GetDC(hDesktopWnd);         HDC hCaptureDC = CreateCompatibleDC(hDesktopDC);         HBITMAP hCaptureBitmap =CreateCompatibleBitmap(hDesktopDC,                                  nScreenWidth, nScreenHeight);         SelectObject(hCaptureDC,hCaptureBitmap);          BitBlt(hCaptureDC,0,0,nScreenWidth,nScreenHeight,                hDesktopDC,0,0,SRCCOPY|CAPTUREBLT);          SaveCapturedBitmap(hCaptureBitmap); //Place holder - Put your code                                     //here to save the captured image to disk         ReleaseDC(hDesktopWnd,hDesktopDC);         DeleteDC(hCaptureDC);         DeleteObject(hCaptureBitmap);     }      I dont understand what it means by placeholder at SaveCapturedBitmap and I don't know what SaveCapturedBitmap does, can't find anything searching for it at msdn..
