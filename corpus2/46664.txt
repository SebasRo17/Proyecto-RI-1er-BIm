I have a package which I need to deploy in a client's environment. It has proprietary code and solutions that I need to protect from prying eyes and inquisitive minds. The forum has discussed much of this sort of thing in the past. See: How safe is Encode? How to distribute proprietary Mathematica code Seeking strategies to deploy a function securely without a front end I will utilize `Encode`, `DumpSave`, and attributes: `Locked` and `ReadProtected`. They help but I wonder if I can impose other barriers to access. The package in question will only need to get called from `NET/Link`. This leaves me with three related questions:   * Does any means exist to prevent the package from ever opening in a front end notebook?   * Does any means exist to prevent the package from ever being called from a front end notebook?   * Does any means exist to delete or erase the package's code if someone did open it in a notebook?
