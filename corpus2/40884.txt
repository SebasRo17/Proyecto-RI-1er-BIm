I have only a very basic idea about linux system programming. I have not done any real projects using linux system programming. In my current company i do system admin type work. but i am more interested in Linux System Programming. I want to do some projects on my own, so that i could put those projects in my resume when i apply for joining another companies. Kindly tell me the whether there is any projects where i could learn more linux system programming by doing some real programming stuff. Please Note that i only have experience in C programming and not in Linux System Programming. But i know very basic things in linux system programming. Thanks
