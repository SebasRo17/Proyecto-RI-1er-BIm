I've got something that works, but it seems like it would be "nicer" if I didn't have to use Table (or For, etc.). I've got 3 Excel files, each with multiple sheets. Each file also has a sheet called "Paste Here" that I don't want. Each sheet contains an array. I'm reading in the file names from the folder, then from each file I read in the sheet names. Now, I'd like to read the array from each sheet and store them all in a single (nested) list. I'm currently doing the following, which works fine:               Module[{pmlPath},     pmlPath = ParentDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]] <> pmlFolder;     fileNames = Select[FileNames["*.xlsm", pmlPath], StringCount[#, "~"] == 0 &];     sheetNames = DeleteCases[(Import[#, "Sheets"] & /@ fileNames), "Paste Here", {2}];     pmls = Table[Import[fileNames[[i]],             {"Sheets", sheetNames[[i, j]]}], {i,Length[fileNames]}, {j,Length[sheetNames[[i]]]}];     ];      It seems like I would have to use multiple slots to accomplish that, if it's possible, and I really don't know how to do that.
