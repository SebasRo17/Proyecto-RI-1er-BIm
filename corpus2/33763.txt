I want to know how to get the `HornerForm` of the following expression in terms of `E^(I x)`:                E^(I x) + 2 E^(2 I x) + 3 E^(3 I x) + 4 E^(4 I x) + 5 E^(5 I x) +           6 E^(6 I x) + 7 E^(7 I x) + 8 E^(8 I x) + 9 E^(9 I x) + 10 E^(10 I x)      `HornerForm[ expr, E^(I x)]` doesn't work as well as something like `Collect[ expr, E^(I x]]`.   How can I get the desired form?
