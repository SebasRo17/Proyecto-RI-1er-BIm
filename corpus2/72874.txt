Generally speaking, if a recent Computer Science / Software Engineering grad (bachelors) wants to be project manager in 5 years, what should he or she go for? A. An MBA part-time straight out of graduation (at the same time, working as a programmer) B. Wait three years and go for a masters in Computer Information Systems (which has the 3 year gap requirement) Thank you for the advice. I wanted to make this as applicable to as many gonna-graduate-soon students in our field.
