I'm quite new to working in Agile and with user stories and scenarios in the BDD tool Cucumber and ideally I'll need to go on a course of all of this. I have a set of user stories that need to be edited for an upcoming release. As an example one of the user stories is:               'As a user     I want a visual indicator on entry into the application'      This needs to be changed to:               As a producer, I donâ€™t want a textured background in the application       The Acceptance Criteria (In Gherkin format for those familiar with Cucumber) for the original user story (the first one above) is                   Scenario: Show background image when video is not playing              Given the application restarts      When the home menu is displayed     Then the full-screen textured background should be visible at the correct resolution      For the new user story (second one above), the acceptance criteria that I have written, but not certain of is:               Scenario: Show dark grey background when video is not playing          Given the application restarts      When the home menu is displayed     Then the dark grey background should be visible at the correct resolution      Does this look right? Or am I missing information? I'm, quite new to this, so please bear with me.
