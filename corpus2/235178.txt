Ruby object has method/property:               def tentakles_count       8     end      JavaScript object has key/property:               { justEnough: true }      Now, when JavaScript gets serialised ruby object via XHR or WebSocket, developer has to use alien naming convention to access `tentacles_count`. The same goes for Ruby, when it gets json object POSTed, developer has to use alien naming convention to access `justEnough`. What would you do to deal with this little imperfection without going too crazy?
