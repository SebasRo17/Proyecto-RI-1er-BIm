In the last two years I have worked with a poorly written codebase of nearly 40K lines of code. Over that time I have made many small refactorings to improve it and made some bigger, as time permits. Unfortunately, I still view the codebase as poorly written. What's your experience? Do you think many small fixes can take me somewhere, or I have to stop and allocate a big chunk of time to fix things (of course, management won't be happy if I do this while we're working on the current "very important" new feature).
