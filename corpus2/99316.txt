I have a BSc in Geology. Once I was half-way through my bachelors only, I found where my real talents are. Will my basic degree be a problem for me to progress in the Software field (I feel lot of leading companies are considering the basic degree)? Also what would you recommend to put my self in an equally competent position against a person with a strong BSc in computer science. Thanks in advance.
