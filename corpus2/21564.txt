Consider a big list where all the inner lists length's are the same                list = {{x1, y1, z1, t1}, {x2, y2, z2, t2}, {x3, y3, z3, t3}, ...};      elementNo = {4, 3, 2};      I want output like this,               {{x1}, {x2}, {x3}, ...}      That is, when I specify `elementNo` as `{4, 3, 2}`, I mean the elements at positions 2, 3 and 4 in the sub-lists should be removed -- I want the elements at position 1 only. When I specify `elementNo` as `{2, 3}`, I want                {{x1, t1}, {x2, t2}, {x3, t3}, ...}      How can I do this?
