Years back I did a lot of programming in Delphi (mostly scientific). For the last few years I have been doing development work based on web technologies. I need to turn a couple of applications quickly for the desktop. I have looked at Qt and the learning curve seems a bit steep. Is going back to Delphi (say with Delphi XE) recommended? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Cost is not an issue.
