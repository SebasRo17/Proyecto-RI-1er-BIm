Given a list of strings:               data = {      "2894;Hot Pink;53:09:44;1449714",      "17456;Dark Cyan;19:06:42;6929227",      "5147;Lime;54:11:55;5247632"     }      (Words are separated by `";"`, the number of words in strings are equal. Number of characters in strings are unequal. Number of characterss in words are unequal.) How to extract the $m^{th}$ through $n^{th}$ words, so that e.g. $m=2, n=3$ should return:               {     "Hot Pink;53:09:44",     "Dark Cyan;19:06:42",     "Lime;54:11:55"     }        **UPDATE** Final solution was found for the task.   I like to share it here.               inlist = RandomChoice[     {"7270;Deep Pink;04:14:55;0027354",      "2871;Dark Orchid;54:21:23;1182263",      "4021;Silver;04:00:58;6940040",      "3521;Dark Slate Gray;18:42:43;5828275"},      400000];            delim = ";";     fromWord = 2;     numberOfWords = 2;            from = 2 fromWord - 1;     to = 2 (fromWord + numberOfWords - 1) - 1;     outlist = List /@ StringJoin /@           StringSplit[inlist, delim -> delim][[All, from ;; to]]; // Timing            {0.92, Null}        The honor goes to the very concerned in this task. Every detail of their conception was vital to the solution. Keep'n rocking.
