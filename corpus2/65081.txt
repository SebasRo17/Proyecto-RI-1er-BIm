How did you convince your manager to let you unit test? By "use", I mean being allowed to develop, check-in to source control and maintain the unit tests over time, etc. Typical management objections are:   1. The customer didn't pay for unit tests   2. The project does not allow time for unit testing   3. Technical debt? What technical debt? Do you know other objections? What were your answers? Thanks in advance!
