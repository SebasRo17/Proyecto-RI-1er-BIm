Microsoft recently unveiled Typescript, a new JavaScript-like programming language. Some time ago, I heard about Dart, a new programming language created by Google to solve problems related to Javascript like performance, scalability, etc.. The purpose of both new languages seem the same to me.. What do you think? Are the purposes of the languages the same? What are the real differences about them?
