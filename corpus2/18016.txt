I have a remote kernel on a server that I would like to use to process some data. The connection works, i.e, I'm able to use the local front end and the remote kernel. However, I cannot figure out how should I access from the remote kernel the data that are on my local machine. I thought I could simply use `Import` with the path to my computer and to the file that I want to import, but I didn't succeed. Something like:               Import["computerName@ip_address:/Users/myUserName/Desktop/data.txt","Table"]      > Import::nffil: File not found during Import. >>
