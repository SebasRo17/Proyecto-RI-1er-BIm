Essentially, what I am trying to find out is the limitation of the WSTP/LINK protocols in Enterprise-licensed CDF. Specifically, are any callbacks to the kernel from those protocols allowed in CDF , Enterprise CDF, or Player Pro? Are any methods disabled? This problem is difficult since very few people discuss the issue, and Wolfram documentation makes little mention of disabling specific functionality for CDF/Player Pro (e.g. http://www.wolfram.com/player-pro/how-player-pro- compares.html is not very specific). More importantly, if callbacks were allowed without any restrictions on what `Evaluate` could do, what would stop a person from evaluating arbitrary expressions using a combination of a LINK and IPC (i.e. interprocess communication)? I have been told by Wolfram representatives that version 10 Enterprise CDF should have less LINK restrictions that the previous version (e.g. .NET/LINK is allowed now), but that still doesn't help me understand where Wolfram draws the line. I appreciate any answers or suggestions. If I hear back from Wolfram on the issue, I will update this post.
