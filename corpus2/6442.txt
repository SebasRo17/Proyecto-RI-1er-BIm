I have a function `f` which takes a number as input, and returns a list of numbers (the length of the list is constant). `f` is hard to calculate (each evaluation takes a long time). I want to plot the different components of `f` in _different colors_. If I use this command:               Plot[f[x], {x, -2, 2}]      all the lines are drawn in the same color.   If I use this command:               Plot[{f[x][[1]], f[x][[2]], f[x][[3]]}, {x, -2, 2}]      (assuming the list has three components) the lines are drawn in different colors, but the function is called three times the necessary amount. Note that this is a numeric function, it cannot be evaluated with a symbolic argument (i.e. the function definition begins with `f[x_Real]:=`), so there is no use in using `Evaluate` like in this question.
