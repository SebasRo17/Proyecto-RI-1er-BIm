I have a friend who's managed to pick up comma first (best case might be made here: http://ajaxian.com/archives/is-there-something-to-the-crazy-comma-first- style) but it's 100% against our org's style guide and the Python culture. If you don't want to click the link, he's basically doing this:               a, b, c, d = tuple('abcd') # setup for interpreter demo, if desired     foo = ( a           , b           , c           , d           )      Maybe it's just habit or training, but I do not want to even begin to have the spark of a thought about even starting to think about doing this; much less see others pick it up. But I'm also a bit of a grammar fiend too. How do I communicate to a him that keeping to idiomatic style is better for his career and reputation as a programmer?
