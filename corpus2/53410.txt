Interested in peoples opinions of Cuda vs openCL following NVidia's Cuda4 release. I had originally gone with openCL since cross platform, open standards are a good thing(tm).   I assumed NVidia would fall into line as they had done with openGL. But having talked to some NVidia people, they (naturaly) claim that they will concentrate on CUDA and openCL is hampered by having committees and having to please everyone - like openGL.   And with the new tools and libs in CUDA it's hard to argue with that. -I'm in a fairly technical market so I can require the users to have particular HW.
