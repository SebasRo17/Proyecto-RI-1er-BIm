It's old question. However, I could not find satisfactory answer. Decided to post this question. I have a `.csv` file with column heading. How can I import this `.csv` file into _Mathematica_ assigning column names as list names in short and sweet way. For example, I can use the following codes.               mydata = Import[file, Path -> path];     names = Flatten[mydata[[;; 1]]];      Do[listnames[names[[i]]] =                           mydata[[2 ;;]][[All, i]], {i, 1, Dimensions[mydata[[2 ;;]]][[2]]}];      But I need to write listnames["Col names in .csv file"] to refer to each list. I can not refer `.csv` column names as list names. I need to figure out this because I have over 1000 column headings in my `.csv` data. Please help me to figure out his without long codes.
