I got the idea that basics of fuzzy logic are not that hard to grasp. And I got the feeling that someone might explain it to me in like 30 minutes. Just like I understand neural networks and am able to re-create the famous Xor problem. And go just beyond it and create 3 layer networks of x nodes. I'd like to understand fuzzy till a similar usefully level, in C# language. However the problem is face, I'd like to get concept right however I see many websites who include lots of errors in their basic explaining. Like for example showing pictures and use different numbers as shown in pictures to calculate, as if lots of people just copied stuff without noticing what they write down. While others for me go to deep in their math notation). To me that's very annoying to learn from. For me there is no need to re-invent wheel; Aforge already got a fuzzy logic framework. So what I am looking for are some good examples, good examples like how the neural XOR problem is solved. Is there anyone such a instructional resource out there; do you know a web page, or YouTube where it is shortly explained, what would you recommend me? Note this article comes close; but it just doesn't nail it for me. After that I downloaded a bunch of free PDF's but most are academic and hard to read for me (I'm not English and don't have a special math degree). (I've been looking around a lot for this, good starter material about it is hard to find).
