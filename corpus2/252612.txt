I've got a few non trivial responsive website builds coming up. They are not platforms or apps, but large marketing / brochure websites where eye for detail is important. I've used bootstrap extensively as well as pure.io, as well as my own rules. I'm wondering what is the most efficient way to build these. I am planning on starting with bootstrap and customising, but I chose pure.io in the past, as I had to make so many changes to bootstrap to get a very fiddly design into it (ie it went against bootstrap conventions) Does anyone have any advice on this?
