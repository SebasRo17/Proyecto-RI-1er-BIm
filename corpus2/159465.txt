We have a web service that takes in input different types of messages. The function of the webservice is to merely write in a database the content of the messages. There is about one table (with foreign keys to others) for every kind of message. We have been asked to transform the webservice in a configurable product by using a business rules engine. To have full configurability, a collegue suggested that the best way could be transform the webservice from one that accepts many types of messages to one that accepts one type of message, but in the content of the message there is a field that indicates the type of the content. This way, there would be just one table for the messages (plus other tables for static informations), and it would be more configurable using business rules engines. What is the best way to tackle such situation? **Update:** for the business rules engines we are very likely going to use an implementation of the Rete Algorithm, like Drools
