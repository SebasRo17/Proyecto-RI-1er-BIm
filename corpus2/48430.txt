I'm trying to simplify the following expression $$\frac{n.r \ p.q - (n.p + n.q) (p.r + q.r)}{(n.p + n.q)\ p.q}\to \frac{n.r}{n.p+p.q}-\frac{p.r+q.r}{p.q}$$ When I put it into _Mathematica_ and use `FullSimplify` nothing happens though. For me it would be "simpler" to express this as a sum of "small" fractions. I've tried using `Apart` but that also does nothing. Could anyone recommend a way for me to force _Mathematica_ to simplify an expression like this?
