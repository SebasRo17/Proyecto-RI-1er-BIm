I am building a pair of components that communicates in a one-way fashion:               [ JButton ] --> data...process...process...out --> [ JTextField ]      The JButton allows the user to select a file and the JButton's ActionListener picks up the click and pulls out the file name and directory. I then need that information to be displayed by the JTextField. Such functionality is so basic, it need not ever change. Someone suggested a way to relay the message here, but I am asking another question: **should I skip the MVC?**               [ JButton ]  --> [ JTextField ]      Simple is best, right? That's the simplest and clearest way I can think of of relaying the message. I mean, just modify the the JTextField by JButton's ActionListener. So should I go with this simpler approach or try to apply MVC anyway?
