I can't seem to find any kind of complete reference for jUnit. The only way I've managed to find to know about all the features in jUnit is to check out all the release notes for it. For example there is no mention of @Rules in the official page unless you count the blog posts. But for that you first need to know a feature exists to search for it. Is there a canonical reference for jUnit? What's the best method for learning about jUnit features? What I've tried:   * jUnit Cookbook \- Really basic, very few features covered   * The official FAQ \- Covers more but it doesn't have @Rules or anything covered there. Updated last time in 2006
