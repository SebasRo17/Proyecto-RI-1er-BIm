I have several data files such as this:               {{0, 2.86088, 4.44366, 50.9516, 3.26578, 3.76921, 10.2211}, {0.382102,        0.399499, 0.633217, 0.458334, 0.772598, 1.04943,        0.245786}, {2.17053, 0.753159, 1.57424, 0.378372, 0.82554, 0.651859,        0.571577}, {50.5039, 3.35749, 1.70239, 0.205699, 2.27276, 1.42459,        7.90045}, {1.47175, 0.712629, 0.842982, 0.220806, 0.294048, 0.21267,        0.166509}, {0.814432, 1.12644, 0.729741, 0.788745, 0.183342,        0.248011, 0.180827}, {10.4399, 1.53087, 1.52872, 8.1604, 0.480033,        0.538012, 1.29091}}      These are discrete fourier transform frequency values. When I plot them with `MatrixPlot` on **mathematica 8.0** , I get this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6TgPu.png) Now this is what I would like to do and I got the idea from reading about plotting with tooltips and the ContourLabel option in Mathematica:   1. I would like my `MatrixPlot` to be in black and white/monochrome. This is because I would like to include these plots in journal publications and save money over having color images (It's **$325 per color image** on _Physics of fluids_ for instance). I have tired the `ColorFunction->"Monochrome"` option with `MatrixPlot` and have also tried `ArrayPlot` to get black and white spots instead of the orange and yellow spots that I have.   2. Can I have an option like `ContourLabel` for `MatrixPlot` so that I can entirely circumvent having a color bar?   3. To those of you who have published with plots from Mathematica 8.0, what would you do?   4. I have access to Mathematica 8.0 right now and for convenience I would like to stick to that. I have tried to search around here but didn't find an answer that would suit my needs. Having said that, please feel free to yell at me if I didn't search hard enough!
