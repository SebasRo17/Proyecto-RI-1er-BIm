From my vague understanding of this subject I assumed that if I make an installer for my program and it contains a GPL library my code would have to fall under GPL. However, I noticed yesterday when installing Ubuntu that its installation had checkboxes (selected by default) to install non free software. This question specifies about programming behavior and says that my program wouldn't fall under GPL as long as the library can be seem as separated programs but it does not say anything about making a common installer for the package. I saw this answer saying about common installers in StackOverflow in Portuguese and it does say about a common installer making the code fall under GPL. **If I create an installer for the library and put my non-free program that uses that library there as an option my program wouldn't fall under GPL ?**
