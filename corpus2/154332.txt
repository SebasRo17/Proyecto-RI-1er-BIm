I'm about to create a do-everything dashboard for my team and am still having second thoughts about my project/solution structure. Since this could be a long ongoing project, I want to get the structure right from the beginning. This is what I had in mind:   1. Create a solution named "doEverythingDashboard"   2. Delete the project named "doEverythingDashboard" under the solution "doEverythingDashboard"   3. Create winform project named "interface"   4. Create console applications projects for each functionality of "doEverythingDashboard"   5. Reference each console application in "interface" Does this make any sense? Would it make more sense to just have one project and create a class per functionality instead of an entire project?
