I tried to avoid using the subscript $A_0$ in the Module, and get an error with $A[0]$.                   In[119]:= Module[{A[0] = 1},A[0]]                   During evaluation of In[119]:= Module::lvset: Local variable specification {A[0]=1} contains A[0]=1, which is an assignment to A[0]; only assignments to symbols are allowed. >>                Out[119]= Module[{A[0] = 1}, A[0]]      EDIT: Alternatively, I tried to define "A0, A1, A2", but failed with command                        Sum[Ai, {i, 3}]      I just want a Symbol of combining a letter with a postfix of number, e.g. Ai, A_i, A[i], A(i),... any notation that is treated as a Symbol in MMa would be okay. EDIT2: For example,                   In[130]:= Module[{A0 = 1},Sum[Symbol["A" <> ToString[i]], {i, 0, 3}]]               Out[130]= A0 + A1 + A2 + A3      But I wish to replace $A0$ with $1$, and get `1+ A1 + A2 + A3` This would work when A0 defined globally.                    In[132]:= Sum[Symbol["A" <> ToString[i]], {i, A0 = 1; 0, 3}]               Out[132]= 1 + A1 + A2 + A3
