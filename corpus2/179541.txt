Many times there is the need to load external resources into the program, may they be graphics, audio samples or text strings. Is there a patten for handling the loading and the handling of such resources? For example: should I have a class that loads all the data and then call it everytime I need the data? As in:               GraphicsHandler.instance().loadAllData()     ...//and then later:     draw(x,y, GraphicsHandler.instance().getData(WATER_IMAGE))     //or maybe     draw(x,y, GraphicsHandler.instance().WATER_IMAGE)      Or should I assign each resource to the class where it belongs? As in (for example, in a game):               Graphics g = GraphicsLoader.load(CHAR01);     Character c = new Character(..., g);     ...     c.draw();      Generally speaking which of these two is the more robust solution?               GraphicsHandler.instance().getData(WATER_IMAGE)     //or     GraphicsHandler.instance().WATER_IMAGE //a constant reference
