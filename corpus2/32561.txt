I am having problems minimizing a potential: $\text{V}(h,\eta)=\gamma \left(-h^2\right) \left(\eta ^2 \cos ^2(\theta )+\eta \cos (\delta ) \sqrt{-\eta ^2-h^2+1} \sin (2 \theta )+\left(-\eta ^2-h^2+1\right) \sin ^2(\theta )\right)$ (Input code below)               V = -h^2 γ (η^2 Cos[θ]^2 + (1 - h^2 - η^2) Sin[θ]^2 + η Sqrt[1 - h^2 - η^2] Cos[δ] Sin[2 θ])      I try to minimize simply using:               sol = Solve[{D[V, h] == 0, D[V, η] == 0}, {h, η}]      It seems to solve quickly and with no problems giving me 9 solutions, these solutions depend on the parameters $\theta, \delta, \gamma$. However if for example I try to calculate:               Chop[N[D[V,h] /. sol /. θ -> 1 /. δ -> 1 /. γ -> 1]]      The output it gives is: > >     {0, -0.104069, 0, 0, -0.484451, 0.104069, 0, 0, 0.484451} >   As you can see extrema `2`, `5`, `6` and `9` are not even close to zero! It seems _Mathematica_ is solving this incorrectly, or maybe the solutions are only valid in specific regions (not the full domain)? Does anyone have any ideas? I thought maybe the problem was with the square root in the function (otherwise it's a simple polynomial) but have tried solving it using the Lagrange multiplier method taking a function $V(h,η,s)$ and $s=\sqrt{1-h^2-η^2}$ but it also doesn't seem to give me all zero solutions when I sub it in to the Lagrange equation $\frac{\partial V}{\partial h}+\lambda \frac{\partial g}{\partial g}$, where $g=s-\sqrt{1-h^2-η^2}=0$, the constraint applied to this function. Any ideas what's happening ? Has anyone encountered this problem before?
