This is what I have:               areah[triangle_] :=       (lenbroke[triangle]/2 Product[lenbroke[triangle]/2 -         len (lineseg (triangle[[i]])), {i, 1, 3}])      This is what I get when I test it:               areah[{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}}]      I don't know what is wrong because when I test it, it doesn't work.
