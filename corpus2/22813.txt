Consider the case where I have two $k$-chromatic graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, i.e. two graphs where individual vertices can be colored with one of a set of $k$ total colors, and I would like to determine if the two graphs are equivalent while respecting vertex coloration. Is there a way to do this in Mathematica 8 or 9? If so, is there a known computational complexity for the algorithm being employed?
