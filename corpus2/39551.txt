How can I use _Mathematica_ to equate coefficients in a non-power-series equation? For example, I would like to take an equation like the following: $$af_x+\frac{b}{2}f_xf_y+chf_x=f_x+e^af_x+3f_xf_y+2bhf_x$$ and produce the following system: $$a=1+e^a$$ $$\frac{b}{2}=3$$ $$c=2b$$ **EDIT:** This is a rather small example. If possible, I would prefer a solution that requires minimal human inspection of the original equation. The equations I will be working with will have many, perhaps hundreds of partial derivative terms, and it would be unfeasible to do things like individually pick them out. Ideally, I would like to specify only the unknowns I am interested in (in this case, {a, b, c}) and let _Mathematica_ take it from there.
