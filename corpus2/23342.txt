I have an old Mathematica notebook with an output for a graph structure $G$ I would like to recover. However, the routine for building up the graph is stochastic, so I can't simply rerun the code. Can I recover the vertices and edges of a graph from its output in an old notebook after the kernel has been restarted? * * * More specifically, say I run the command:               G = RandomGraph[{50, 600}]      Which produces and graphical output that clearly can't be reconstructed by eye. I then quit the kernel. Can I recover the vertex and edges of $G$ using the output graphic?
