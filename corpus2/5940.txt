Mathematica has a lot of very useful undocumented features. For example a hash table, a built-in list of compilable functions, additional options to CurrentValue, `{"Raw", n}` histogram bin specification, etc... A natural question that arises is: **Why is this functionality undocumented?** Is it because the feature is under development? Or because the syntax has not been finalized and may be changed? Something else? Also: **Is using this functionality safe in the sense that it will not cause problems when a new version is released?**
