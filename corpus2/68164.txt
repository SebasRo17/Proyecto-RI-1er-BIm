A few days ago I had an interview for a medium company (130 people) for a developer job position, and at some point the interviewer gave me a wild bunch of question regarding TCP, Network flows and many other things that I didn't had clear on my memory. Needless to say, I failed the interview because according to them, I had to understand **in detail** how networking protocols worked to apply as a junior developer. I felt ashamed of my ignorance, and get to it, in one week I managed to refresh all the knowledge of networkings I had and even expanded them, my question is, with this in mind... How possible is to _reapply_ for a job interview, since my only problem in the interview was that part... Thanks in advance... **PS** : I think this is quite hard, but I just wanted to hear from other people with more experience...
