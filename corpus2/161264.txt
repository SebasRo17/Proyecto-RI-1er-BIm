I am taking a networking class(data communication) this coming semester. In many courses in my computer engineering degree, the books lack mathematical content. I am not a math wizard, but I think mathematics has the potential to give a much deeper understanding of different concepts, but it requires more work. Is it a good idea to focus on information theory(found a cool book by a researcher from Bell Labs) and use a more "high level" book like Computer networking, A top down approach as supplementary text?
