i have the following question: Let us assume we have the following list:               list={1.1,1.2,1.0,2.1,2.2,2,0,3.1,3.0,3.2}      I need a function that always takes three values of this list and put the Mean of these three values into a new list so I want to end with:               list2={1.1,2.1,3.1}      How can i do this easily? Thank you in advance Edit: Thank you very much
