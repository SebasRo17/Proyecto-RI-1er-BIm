It seems that newer websites (and API's especially) make use of request formats by adding the expected format to the end of the URL path.               /path/to/resource.html     /path/to/resource.json     /path/to/resource.xml      Are their any problems with this approach? Are there any studies or outlines of the pros and cons of doing this instead of just listing the resource without a file type extension?
