A local business owner wants to hire me (contract) to build custom software for his business and employees. It will likely be a small web app that I'll host on AWS. Who retains IP rights to the system? Do I maintain ownership of the source code and grant him a perpetual license to use it or does the client typically acquire rights? I **know** the agreement can be made to accommodate either strategy but was wondering what industry norms were here.
