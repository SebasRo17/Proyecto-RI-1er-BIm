I want to eliminate `x1, x2, y1, y2` between these 5 equations. I tried               Eliminate[{x1^2/a^2 + y1^2/b^2 == 1, x2^2/a^2 + y2^2/b^2 == 1,        x1 x2 + y1 y2 == 0, y2/(x2 - c) == y1/(x1 - c) == k}, {x1, x2, y1, y2}]      Mathematica takes a long time, I couldn't even wait for it to finish.Can you recommend an efficient method? **Updated:** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics)               ForAll[{a, b}, b d != 0 && b^2 != d^2,       Equivalent[a/b == c/d,        a/b == c/d == (a - c)/(b - d) == (a + c)/(b + d)]]     Resolve[%]     (*True*)            k^2 /. Solve[          Eliminate[{x1^2/a^2 + y1^2/b^2 == 1, x2^2/a^2 + y2^2/b^2 == 1,           x1 x2 + y1 y2 == 0, y2/(x2 - c) == (y1 - y2)/(x1 - x2) == k}, {x1, x2, y1, y2}],         k] // DeleteDuplicates//Tr          (* (a^2 b^2)/(-a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2 + b^2 c^2) *)
