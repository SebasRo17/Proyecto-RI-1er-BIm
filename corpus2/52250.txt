I would like to generate a plot of CPU time vs number of iterations. For example, if I were to calculate the solution of a system of differential equations in state-space form using the summation of e^(A t) (or any series expansion for that matter):               A = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}     sol=Sum[(MatrixPower[A, j] t^j)  /j!, {j, 0, 200}]      I tried:               Table[Timing[N[Sum[(MatrixPower[A, j] t^j)  /j!, {j, 0, i}]]], {i, 0,        200}]      but this outputs the solution of the summation along with the time. I only require the cpu time for each individual iteration and the iteration number. Can someone point me in the right direction here?
