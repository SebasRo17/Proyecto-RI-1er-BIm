The matrix is a real symmetric 4x4:               ({{0, Sin[x + y], Sin[z + y], Sin[x + z]},       {Sin[x + y], 0, Sin[x - z], Sin[z - y]},       {Sin[z + y], Sin[x - z], 0, Sin[y - x]},       {Sin[x + z], Sin[z - y], Sin[y - x], 0}})      Mathematica can find the eigenvalues fine, and they are degenerate for x, y, and/or z equal to zero. No eigenvectors can be found: Eigenvectors::eivec0: Unable to find all eigenvectors. And it seems to me that Mathematica should be able to handle the degeneracy, but I would be interested to know why it is encountering trouble. Is there some obvious property about this matrix that I am not accounting for (such as restricting values of x, y, z for the trigonometric functions) or is there something I can do inside of Mathematica to specify some starting point for an eigenvalue?
