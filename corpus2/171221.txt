I have been wondering if, rather than a more traditional layout like this:               api/Products     GET // gets product(s) by id     PUT // updates product(s) by id     DELETE // deletes (product(s) by id     POST // creates product(s)      Would it be more useful to have a singular and a plural, for example:               api/Product     GET // gets a product by id     PUT // updates a product by id     DELETE // deletes a product by id     POST // creates a product          api/Products     GET // gets a collection of products by id     PUT // updates a collection of products by id     DELETE // deletes a collection of products (not the products themselves)     POST // creates a collection of products based on filter parameters passed      So, to create a collection of products you might do:               POST api/Products {data: filters} // returns api/Products/<id>      And then, to reference it, you might do:               GET api/Products/<id> // returns array of products      In my opinion, the main advantage of doing things this way is that it allows for easy caching of collections of products. One might, for example, put a lifetime of an hour on collections of products, thus drastically reducing the calls on a server. Of course, I currently only see the good side of doing things this way, what's the downside?
