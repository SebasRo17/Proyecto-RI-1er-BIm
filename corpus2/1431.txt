I am interested in threading a compiled function over multiple argument lists of different lengths. I will explain this in two steps: Suppose f is some function. Then one can define another function,               ppost[arg_, context_] := Apply[f[arg, ##] &, context]      which can be used as               In[2]:= ppost[a, {b, c}]          Out[2]= f[a, b, c]      or in a more complex scenario let,               In[3]:= argList = {{a1, b1}, {a2, b2, c2}};          In[4]:= mList = {{m1, n1}, {m2, n2, o2}};          In[5]:= contextList = {mList, y, z}          Out[5]= {{{m1, n1}, {m2, n2, o2}}, y, z}      We can thread the function over the argList and the contextList as follows:               In[6]:= Thread[ppost[argList, contextList]]          Out[6]= {f[{a1, b1}, {m1, n1}, y, z],               f[{a2, b2, c2}, {m2, n2, o2}, y, z]}      The above works, as needed. Question: I need to do the same when f is a compiled function. As an example,               fc = Compile[{{arg, _Real, 1}, {c1, _Real, 1}, {c2, _Real}, {c3, _Real}},       c3*arg + c2*c1       ]          ppost1[arg_, context_] := Apply[fc[arg, ##] &, context]          In[9]:= nargList = {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}} // N;          In[10]:= nmList = {{6, 7}, {8, 9, 10}} // N;          In[11]:= ncontextList = {nmList, 50, 55} // N          Out[11]= {{{6., 7.}, {8., 9., 10.}}, 50., 55.}          In[12]:= ppost1[nargList[[1]], {nmList[[1]], 50, 55}]          Out[12]= {355., 460.}      So far, so good, but then the following does not work properly, and uses the uncompiled version.               In[14]:= Thread[ppost1[nargList, ncontextList]]          During evaluation of      In[14]:= CompiledFunction::cfta: Argument {{1.,2.},{3.,4.,5.}} at position 1      should be a rank 1 tensor of machine-size real numbers. >>          During evaluation of      In[14]:= Thread::tdlen: Objects of unequal length in      {{355.,460.},{565.,670.,775.}} cannot be combined. >>`          Out[14]= {{355., 460.}, {565., 670., 775.}}      So, how can I thread the compiled function over the arguments nargList, ncontextList?
