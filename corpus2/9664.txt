I'd like to compute the response of a `TransferFunctionModel` when driven by a `SquareWave`. Here's a simple example,               or = OutputResponse[TransferFunctionModel[1/(s + 1), s], SquareWave[t], t];      which results in two copies of the error: > Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Reduce. >> Oddly, `or` still gets set to               {(-1 + Piecewise[{{-E^t, Inequality[1/2, LessEqual, Mod[t, 1], Less, 1]}}, E^t])/E^t}      which looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4y4xB.png) and is the correct response of the system to `UnitStep[t]`, but multiplied by `SquareWave[t]`. How can `OutputResponse` be used to find the response of a `TransferFunctionModel` driven by a `SquareWave`?
