Is there any way to run schedulers / schedule programs for example Cron Jobs using Objective-C at iOS Platform? I need to create a schedule update to my ios, lets say for example every five days my app will fetch something to the internet and update the database I also want user to set the interval. I think for this purpose cron jobs can be a vital part. Is there any suggestions or other ways?
