I want to order lexicographically the monomials in a "parametrized polynomial", i.e. polynomials whose "symbolic bits" may be either "variables" or "parameters". For example:               In[1]:= Expand[(x + a y + a^2 z)^3] /. a^n_ -> a^Mod[n, 3]          Out[1]= x^3 + y^3 + 6 x y z + z^3 + 3 x^2 y a + 3 y^2 z a + 3 x z^2 a +  3 x y^2 a^2 +      3 x^2 z a^2 + 3 y z^2 a^2      In the polynomial above `x`, `y`, and `z` are intended as "variables", whereas `a` is intended as a "parameter". The documentation for _Mathematica_ states that monomials in a polynomial are ordered lexicographically by default, but if so, I don't understand why the two terms with `x^2` come after the `y^3` term in the polynomial above, for example. So my question is: how can I force a lexicographic ordering of the monomials with respect to the "variables" (i.e. `x`, `y`, and `z`). (In particular, for the polynomial above, the symbol `a` should be disregarded for the ordering.) For example, the desired ordering for the polynomial above would be               x^3 + 3 x^2 y a + 3 x^2 z a^2 + 3 x y^2 a^2 + 3 x z^2 a + 6 x y z + y^3 + 3 y^2 z a + 3 y z^2 a^2 + z^3
