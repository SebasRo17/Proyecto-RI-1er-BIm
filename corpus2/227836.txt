I'm working with a small team developing a web app. We're using Cloud9 to make collaboration and portability as simple as possible, but it's making it a difficult to determine what would be the best way to integrate that with Cloud9. The way we have it set up at the moment is that there is one owner of the Cloud9 workspace who has granted read/write access to all of the collaborators of the project. This works well for collaboration, but if a collaborator pushes his or her work to the git repository, the commit is credited to the owner of the cloud9 workspace, which isn't ideal. People want credit for their work, and it makes it really difficult to keep track of who's doing what. The other option, as far as I can see, is to have each developer create a clone of the repository in their own cloud9 account and work from there. This solves the git issue, but it would mean not taking as much advantage of cloud9's great collaboration features (line by line authorship credit, file revision history, etc.). It would also mean an extra step to update the workspace for people who aren't very familiar with git. What workflow do you think would be best suited to this situation?
