Trying to work on this question I got distracted by my first naive attempt of copying the data and then typing               dat = ImportString[Paste[], "Table"]      > ImportString::string: First argument Null is not a string. >> >   >   >     ImportString[Null, "Table"] >   I do know that typing `dat = ""` and then pasting within the quotation marks does work. Particularly nice is this other solution that unfortunately is limited to MS Windows .NET. But what I want is to understand what is going on, what is `Paste` giving if not a string, and how can I find out what the object is. As a bonus, making the output of `Paste[]` work within `ImportString` would be nice.
