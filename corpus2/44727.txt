_Mathematica_ gives the solution of the second order differential equation                DSolve[a y''[x] + b*y[x] == 0, y[x], x]      in trigonometric form > >     {{y[x] -> C[1] Cos[(Sqrt[b] x)/Sqrt[a]] + C[2] Sin[(Sqrt[b] > x)/Sqrt[a]]}} >   In the fourth order case, _Mathematica_ gives the solution in exponential form, which I tried to convert into trigonometric form                 ExpToTrig[DSolve[a y''''[x] + b*y[x] == 0, y[x], x]]      > >      {{y[x] -> >           C[1] Cos[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))] + >           C[3] Cos[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))] + >           C[2] Cosh[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))] + >           C[4] Cosh[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))] + >           I C[1] Sin[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))] - >           I C[3] Sin[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))] - >           C[2] Sinh[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))] + >           C[4] Sinh[((1 + I) b^(1/4) x)/(Sqrt[2] a^(1/4))]}} >   The problem is that I get a solution with hyperbolic functions, but I know that solution can be represented in purely trigonometric form. Another problem is that I get an imaginary part from multiplication of the constants `I C[1]` and `I C[3]`, which I wouldn't have a with trigonometric function solution. How can I transform the solution to a form having only trigonometric functions?
