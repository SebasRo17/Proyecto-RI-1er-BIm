I am in the process of implementing a small web application using memcached for caching objects and sql server for database persistence. In all the projects I have done before I have done inserts/updates in the web thread itself. In this project I want to implement asynchronous inserts and updates. I will use memcached http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached to capture changes and an external service (windows service) to persist the changes in db. I understand premature performance tuning is evil but this is just a test project to learn memcached. Has anybody done this before. What are the disadvantages of using this ?
