I want to replace $x^{i+1}$ with $z_i$. EDIT: I have some latex equations, and wish to import them to MMa. How to replace x_i (NOT $x_i$) with $x[i]$ But it seems the underscore "_" has a special meaning (function), can we do such substitution in MMa? **EDIT2:** For example, I want to convert the following two latex equations:                       `{la_3^2=0, la_1la_3-6la_3ps=0}`      into                       `{la[3]^2==0, la[1]*la[3]-6*la[3]*ps==0}`      so that I could apply Simplify or Solve to these equations later. Great thanks.
