Does it make more sense to store and retrieve properties or information directly related to an item in a database, or, say in such a case that a product's ID could describe information about it, should the information be gathered from that? Example: Item SKU -- 4HBU12 4 - is the number of motors   H - the voltage   B - the color, blue   U - the model   12 - the length Should I store those individual attributes as well as the SKU, or should I store only the SKU and build the attributes from it?
