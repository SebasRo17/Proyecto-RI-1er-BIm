I have a do-loop to do the calculations from a set of data and plot the graphs with different results, that was obtained from the calculations. I was able to get multiple graphs but I want to ListPlot the different graphs in one plot. Basically, I just want one graph by the end of do-loop plotting the results. * * * `a = 0; b = 1; Do[a++; b++;``t[a]; t[b];` `Do[temp[i] = Transpose[t[i]]; counter[i] = temp[i][[1]]; totaltime[i] = temp[i][[2]]; id[i] = temp[i][[3]]; edge[i] = temp[i][[4]]; area[i] = temp[i][[5]], {i, a, b}];` `VT = Table[Null, {i, 1, z}]; (*VT={reduced area with time}*)` `Do[j = Flatten[Position[id[a], id[b][[i]]]][[1]]; If[edge[b][[i]] == edge[a][[j]], V = (area[b][[i]] - area[a][[j]])/scale; VT[[i]] = {totaltime[a][[j]], V}], {i, 1, z}];`   `minE = Min[edge[b]]; maxE = Max[edge[b]];` `Table[T[i] = Take[VT], {i, 1, m - 1, 1}]; Print[T[i]] Print[ListPlot[{T[i]}, Frame -> True, PlotRange -> {minE - 6 - 1, maxE - 6 + 1}, Axes -> False, GridLines -> {None, Table[i, {i, minE - 6, maxE - 6}]}, PlotLabel -> StringJoin["Interval = ", ToString[interval]]]] , {i, 1, m - 1, 1}]` I have edited the code. I'm new to this so please forgive me for the mistakes. I know that ListPlot can plot multiple sets in one plot like"ListPlot[{data1,data2,...}, Frame -> True," However I have like hundreds of output data and that's where I can't seems to do. My code above gives multiple plots and I just want one output plot.
