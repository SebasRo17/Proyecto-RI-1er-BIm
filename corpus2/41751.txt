I'm doing a few calculations and would like to keep my units straight. I figured that using the built-in Units functionality could help with this. However, using SI prefixes doesn't seem to give the desired output. I try executing this code:                In[15]:= A = 4 Milli Meter*Pi*3^2 Micro Meter // N      And instead of getting, say, 113E-9 Meter^2, I get:                Out[15]= 113.097 Meter^2 Micro Milli      Milli, Meter, and Micro are all globally defined names. What am I doing wrong?
