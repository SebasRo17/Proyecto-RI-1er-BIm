so OCL is supposed to extend UML when we as a designer/analyst cannot express something with a diagram, is has a full blown specification still, there is not (at least not that i know) any production-ready compiler supported by any major company (Oracle, MS, IBM, Apple, Google for example) that can translate OCL to any intermadiate/machine language, so why would anyone invest in learning such a thing?, why not invest that time in learning an actual programming language instead ? there are a few easy-to-learn fast-to-pick up languages out there (ruby, php, visual basic) and if its only function is to extend UML diagrams why not just write some pseudocode and get done with it?, do we really need to learn a full blown specificacion just for writing a special case of pseudocode ?
