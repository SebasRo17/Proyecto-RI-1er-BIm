A terminology question appeared when I was comparing EJB 3 and Spring. Wikipedia says that > Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is a managed, server-side component architecture > for modular construction of enterprise applications. and also > The Spring Framework is an open source application framework and inversion > of control container for the Java platform. "EJB 3 in Action" suggests that > Together, the components, or EJBs, and the container can be viewed as a > framework that provides valuable services for enterprise application > development. Is any framework an architecture? If not, what is the difference between these terms? Could EJB be considered a framework?
