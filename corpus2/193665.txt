I'm a freelance programmer and recently I finished a website, it all works fine but there was one user that complained to my client that he couldn't log in. This problem was clearly a cookie-restriction/old browser one (I couldn't create the problem myself and hunderds of users are working with the website just fine) Now my client said: I've paid you to make something and somebody complains; so you didn't do your work correctly. What can I do in this situation and how do you guys handle this?
