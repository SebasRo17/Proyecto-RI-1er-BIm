I have a list of 2D vectors defined by `{{x,y},{u,v}}` and would like to smooth or average the vectors. For example here are 2 vector fields, the second has noise added to the orientation of each list item:               f = Sin[2 x + 2 y];     data = Flatten[Table[{{x, y}, {Cos[f], Sin[f]}}, {x, -1, 1, 0.1}, {y, -1, 1, 0.1}], 1];     noisydata = Flatten[ Table[         theRand = RandomReal[{-π/6, π/6}];         {{x, y}, {Cos[f + theRand], Sin[f + theRand]}}         , {x, -1, 1, 0.1}, {y, -1, 1, 0.1}], 1];     {ListVectorPlot[data], ListVectorPlot[noisydata]}     {ListStreamPlot[data], ListStreamPlot[noisydata]}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cj4Mh.png) Any suggestions about smoothing the field in _Mathematica_? I am trying to interpolate the data (creating an interpolating function using `Interpolation`), but the resulting vector fields are very noisy. Any help would be appreciated!
