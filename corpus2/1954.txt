I have a black-box multiargument multiparametric function of the type `SRD[dataPoint_List,params_List]` which accepts experimental data along with the parameters of the model and returns a vector with the first element being the squared relative deviation (SRD) between the computed model value and experimental value for the given data point and the rest of the elements being the gradient of the SRD in the given point with respect to `params`. I wish to minimize the sum `Sum[First[SRD[dataPoint, params]], {dataPoint, dataPoints}]` with respect to `params` using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the computed gradient of `SRD` with respect to `params` (equal to `Sum[Rest[SRD[dataPoint, params]], {dataPoint, dataPoints}]`). What is the best way to do this in _Mathematica_?
