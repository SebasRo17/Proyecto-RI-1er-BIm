I define $Y = a + b*x + e$, and I want to find values for $a,b,$ by least squares, so I minimize $RSS = sum((Y_i - a - b*x_i)^2)$ I then take derivatives, ${d RSS \over da} = 0$ and ${d RSS \over db} = 0$ and solve. Now if I put these formulas into _Mathematica_ ,               f2[a_, b_, y_, x_, n_] = Sum[(y[i] - a - b*x[i])^2, {i, n}]           Solve[{D[f2[a, b, y, x, n], {a}] == 0, D[f2[a, b, y, x, n], {b}] == 0}, {a, b}]      I get the following error. > Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve. The derivatives work, but _Mathematica_ doesn't know how to expand out the summations. Any thoughts? I've tried `Expand`, `Sum`, `Distribute` (as suggested in some different expanding `Sum` questions). I've also seen some thoughts on how to define _Mathematica_ rules for summations (anyone have those?).
