Working with _Mathematica 8_ on _OSX_ here. I have three $1024 \times 1024$ matrices representing the counts from consecutive exposures onto a _CCD_ with $R$, $G$, and $B$ filters on it, and am looking to combine the three matrices to get a nice color picture. My first shot was something of the following sort:               ColorCombine[{     MatrixPlot[m13R - dark - bias, ColorFunction -> (RGBColor[#, 0, 0] &)],     MatrixPlot[m13G - dark - bias, ColorFunction -> (RGBColor[0, #, 0] &)],     MatrixPlot[m13B - dark - bias, ColorFunction -> (RGBColor[0, 0, #] &)]     }]      but it looks like `ColorCombine` messes with the resolution, and so what was originally $1024\times1024$ comes out looking rather pixelated. What I'm thinking now is to do the equivalent of `Transpose` but am unsure as to how to combine my three matrices into a $1024\times1024$ matrix with a $3$-tuple at each entry. From there I think `Image[combined, ColorSpace -> "RGB"]` will work to plot the now-colored image. For those interested, you can find the relevant data here. Any help appreciated!
