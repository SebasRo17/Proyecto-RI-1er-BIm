I need to use some software under the AGPL to populate a database with some data. This software has a web interface, which I shall disable. Then the data will be used "at arms length" with closed-source software by reading the database. I may also use some IPC, like datagram sockets to provide a bridge between the AGPL software and the other software. This closed sourced software will provide a web interface to the user. Am I right that it is not breaking the AGPL to have this software as closed source? If I modify the AGPL software, am I able to hide these modifications, so long that the software doesn't provide any network interface to other users?
