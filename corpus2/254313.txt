So I am interested in Computational Investing and came across this problem on a wiki page: > Write a program to discover the answer to this puzzle:"Let's say men and > women are paid equally (from the same uniform distribution). If women date > randomly and marry the first man with a higher salary, what fraction of the > population will get married?" I don't have much knowledge in probability theory, so I'm not really sure how to implement this in code. My thinking:   1. Populate two arrays(female,male) with random salary values from a uniform distribution.    2. Randomly pair one female and one male array element and see if condition of higher salary is met.   3. If it is, increment a counter.   4. Divide counter by population and get percentage. Is this the correct logic? Do woman continually date until there is no males left with higher salaries than women?
