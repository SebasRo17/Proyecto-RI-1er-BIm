I have been given a huge task of migrating few functionalities from jQuery to AngularJS. I have been pretty good at Angular by now. But I want to dive deep and create futuristic, sound architecture. BAs are seating on my neck, wanting to get my tasks as quickly as possible. I prefer doing something once and right vs keeping on patching existing functionalities. And with this attitude, I always keep working more than necessary. Am I missing something? Am I having right approach or am just not convincing enough BAs my point. What's the best approach, in your opinion Thank You :)
