There have been a couple studies done that showed that white text on a black background increase recall of data. Although this is certainly debatable how might I invert the colors of Notebook font and background in Mathematica. There are likely more then a couple ways to do this(external software vs stylesheet). Currently I think the best solution likely involves using the built in Mathematica stylesheets, but currently(as mentioned in the comments) there doesn't appear to be a great way to do such.
