I've been wanting to learn how to program for years but thus far, every book and video has gotten over head very quickly. I eventually want to learn C# for both Windows software development and game development (Unity3D to be specific - it's a game engine that uses C#). I know absolutely nothing about programming/scripting, other than generally what can be achieved. I've been a web developer for years and know HTML very well, CSS semi-well, and Javascript not at all. I'm a pro at breaking scripts. :) I've sort of shifted away from web development and want to focus on learning programming itself. It's like a vicious cycle for me - every 6 months or so I get into the "Ok I'm prepared to learn" phase, find a tutorial or book, get overwhelmed, then give up. I'm writing this just after I saw a video series about C# fundamentals, but after 3 videos I was completely lost. It's like they all mention a concept like conditional strings, breeze over it, then assume you understand it. Although C# is the end-goal, is it worth learning an easier language like VB as a complete and utter novice at first? I know there's not a ton of difference and learning new languages gets easier and easier as it's mostly about syntax, but I feel like I can't wrap my head around even the most basic of concepts as a foundation. For example, I know exactly what I want a program to do and when I explain it to a programmer they normally code it very quickly. If I could write it in plain English I could do it myself. :) Should I keep trying to learn C# or should I delve into another language to get more of a basic understanding of coding itself then transition to it? Every house needs a foundation but I feel like I can't even grasp how concrete is made when building it.
