I am trying to do the following:               q = Table[i + j, {i, 1, 15}, {j, 1, 10}];     normalize[mat_] := (temp = Transpose[mat[[2 ;;, 5 ;;]]];       temp1 = Transpose[N[Map[Normalize[#] &, temp]]];       mat[[2 ;;, 5 ;;]] = temp1; Return[mat])     q1=normalize[q];      I get the following error:               Set::setps:      {{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11},     {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12},     {4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13},     {5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14},     {6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15},<<5>>,     {12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21},     {13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22},     {14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23},     {15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24},     {16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25}}      in the part assignment is not a symbol. >>      Can you please help me in finding out what is wrong? I am new to _Mathematica_.
