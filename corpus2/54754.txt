In version 10.0, when I leave the Mathematica section idle for some time (of order an hour), the kernel quit automatically. The syntax highlighting is gone and the variables that has defined before lost their values. There is no error message (tried to launch from terminal and still no error message). This behavior has been noticed on my computer for many times. No operation is performed. Simply launch Mathematica 10 and wait (or define a variable and watch it gone). Mathematica 9 is installed side by side and has no such problem. I am using Linux (CentOS 7). Anyone has the same problem, or any suggestions to further debug?               $Version      > 10.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit) (June 29, 2014)               uname -a      > Linux localhost.localdomain 3.10.0-123.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Jun 30 12:09:22 > UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux **Update:** I unchecked `Preference -> Internet Conectivity -> Allow the Wolfram System to access the Internet`. The kernel hasn't crashed since this change is made.
