I am pretty new to the .NET framework so please bare with me. I am writing a time counter in C#, that counts the amount of time that has elapsed since a particular moment in time. That moment in time, as of right now, is hard coded. I would like that to be configurable. That and a couple of other values. So, I have created a windows form and it has two user controls on it: one that is the main screen, and another that is the config screen. The application opens on the main screen and I can then use a button to get to the config screen. What I want to do is to go into the config screen, enter my name and age in a textbox, enter a certain date (possibly with the date-time picker) and click a save button. Those values that I entered should then display in the appropriate places on the main screen, until I go back to the config screen and enter new values and save them. How would I go about doing that?
