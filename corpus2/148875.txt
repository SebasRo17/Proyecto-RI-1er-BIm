I have some .NET projects that are starting to get large enough to merit looking into Dependency Management solutions, so we don't have to copy binaries from one project to another. Here's what I've found so far:   * NPanday is based on a port of Maven. I can't tell how recently it was worked on, but the last release was in May 2011.   * NuGet seems to be under active development, and it appears to have support directly from Microsoft. Some people complained that it "only addresses dependency resolution," but I don't know what else it should address, or whether it has added more features since that point. It does appear to have recently added the ability to import binaries as part of the build process so we don't have to commit them to our repositories.   * Refix appears to still be in Beta, after having received no attention since Sept 2011. Would somebody with recent experience using any of these dependency management tools (or any others that work well) share your experience? Is NuGet mature enough to use it for dependency management? If not, what does it lack?
