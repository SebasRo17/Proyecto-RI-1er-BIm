So for instance I have M X N table. I want to drop any row which has an element larger than, say, one in the second or the third column. I guess I have to do some sort of pattern matching. But not exactly sure how to do it. I can use a table to search for a value and then find its Position and then drop the corresponding row. There must be a easier way to do this without traversing through each element using the Table function. help please :)
