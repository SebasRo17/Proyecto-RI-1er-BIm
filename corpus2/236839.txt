I am in a meeting with a client later on, regarding an ASP.NET web app we are creating for him. The app includes a lot of 'form' style screens with 20-30 textboxes, and of course a 'Save' button that posts back to the server and saves the data. The client really does not like this as he is worried users will forget to click 'Save' and lose their data. While I obviously understand that we can use AJAX to save as the user goes along, I believe this is beyond the scope of the project and is prone to error. Has anyone dealt with clients like this?
