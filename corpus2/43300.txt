I am puzzled by the following behavior of `RandomInteger`.               Table[{k, Histogram[RandomInteger[k, 20000]]}, {k, 10, 100, 10}]      ![tables](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gWhjw.png) It seems to me that `n` is less likely than other integers to be chosen as `n` increases beyond 40. Can anybody explain what is happening? (It is easy to work around this problem, but I am interested in why it occurs in the first place.)
