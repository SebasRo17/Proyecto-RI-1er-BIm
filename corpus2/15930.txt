Where I work there are a few experienced software developers with a software background, but the majority of developers are physicists or chemists with excellent domain knowledge but limited experience when it comes to developing high quality, maintainable software. To address this we have started running regular talks and workshops. **What topics do you think we should discuss to help make these people more effective software developers?** In particular we are struggling to gain enthusiasm for these talks as many developers do not see software as an interesting subject. **How could we make these more interesting to people without a software background?** Thanks
