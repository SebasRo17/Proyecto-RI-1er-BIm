There's a bug in my program. Doesn't really matter what the platform is. Every so often, a row in a ListView is the wrong color. I tried setting a watchpoint for the variable that is supposed to dictate the color of the row, and it doesn't change... I am guessing it means the problem could be in the framework code. I've only witnessed it happen once.. My client has noticed it though, and wants it fixed. No idea where to start. Someone told me to artificially increase the load of the program. What are some methods for hunting down difficult to find bugs?
