If we look at typical implementation of a Class, we usually see the private members defined at the beginning and public( mostly functions and Accessors) defined towards the bottom. Now, is this a Industry standard agreed by a lot of people? How about keeping the private members towards the end as updates and additions are usually done to the Public Members(mostly functions), to fix bug or provide enhancement, so we don't have to scroll down towards the end to get to the function definition section. I understand, good IDEs will allow us to Jump towards a specific attribute, but considering other factors, such as Code Review, it may be convenient to have the Public Definitions towards the beginning. What is the most accepted standard for Class Member Organization?
