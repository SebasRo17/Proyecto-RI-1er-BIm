I am trying to fit data to a Morse potential using `NonlinearModelFit` as follows:               morse[r_] := d (1 - Exp[a (re - r)])^2;     nlm1 = NonlinearModelFit[data1,        d (1 - Exp[a (re - r)])^2, {d, {a, 1.5}, {re, 1.5}}, r]      However upon doing so I get the following error: > `NonlinearModelFit::cvmit:` Failed to converge to the requested accuracy or > precision within 100 iterations. I have tried using different values for my constant and it's puzzling that the data does not fit. Here is the data I am using currently:               {"Internuclear Separation ()", "Potential Energy (eV)"}, {2.2678,        1.44954}, {2.274, 1.41403}, {2.2801, 1.3726}, {2.2864,        1.32543}, {2.2929, 1.27275}, {2.3, 1.2149}, {2.3077,        1.15223}, {2.3163, 1.08509}, {2.3258, 1.01378}, {2.3364,        0.938569}, {2.3482, 0.859714}, {2.3614, 0.777423}, {2.376,        0.691882}, {2.3924, 0.603253}, {2.411, 0.511677}, {2.4324,        0.417273}, {2.4577, 0.320146}, {2.4891, 0.220385}, {2.5321,        0.118071}, {2.6176, 0.0132722}, {2.7173, 0.0132722}, {2.834,        0.118071}, {2.9083, 0.220385}, {2.9715, 0.320146}, {3.0294,        0.417273}, {3.0844, 0.511677}, {3.1379, 0.603253}, {3.1909,        0.691882}, {3.2443, 0.777423}, {3.2987, 0.859714}, {3.3549,        0.938569}, {3.4136, 1.01378}, {3.4758, 1.08509}, {3.5424,        1.15223}, {3.6149, 1.2149}, {3.6949, 1.27275}, {3.7846,        1.32543}, {3.8867, 1.3726}, {4.0049, 1.41403}, {4.144, 1.44954}}      Any ideas?
