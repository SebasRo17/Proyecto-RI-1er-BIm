In a recent project; I used MongoDB with MongoEngine (an ORM/ODM for Python). This allowed me to specify schema in a central "Model". My new project I am hosting on Windows Azure; and there is no non-SQL based ORM/ODM wrapper for it in Python. How would you recommend I proceed:   * Engineer my own Python ORM/ODM for Windows Azure   * Or should I not worry about complicated backend business-logic—to reduce computation and transport overhead—and just write routes like this:              POST /api/u_speced/<noun>/create -d {'type': 'schema', **(JSON_schema)}     → {'created': true}     PUT /api/u_speced/<noun>/add -d {'type': 'data', **(JSON validated against JSON_schema)}     →  {'id': <id>}     GET /api/u_speced/<noun>/<id>     →  {JSON representation of record}
