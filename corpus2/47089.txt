Recently I found the following `TreePlot` issue. For simplicity, I took an example from Mathematica Tree Drawing Tutorial and set `TreePlot` orientation to `Left`:               TreePlot[{1 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 8, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 8, 6 -> 8, 7 -> 8, 7 -> 9}, Left,         VertexRenderingFunction -> ({EdgeForm[Black], Yellow, Disk[#1, 0.2],              Black, Text[#2, #1]} &)]      ![TreePlot with Left orientation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cn0qA.png) But when I specified the root node to `5` (which differs from an automatically selected root node `4`), I recieved an image with stretched verticies:               TreePlot[{1 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 8, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 8, 6 -> 8, 7 -> 8, 7 -> 9}, Left, 5,         VertexRenderingFunction -> ({EdgeForm[Black], Yellow, Disk[#1, 0.2],              Black, Text[#2, #1]} &)]      ![TreePlot with Left orientation and root node 5](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ihcWe.png) Is there a generic solution to this problem? Thanks.
