I work in an environment that has mathematica's internet connectivity turned off under Help > Internet Connectivity. Recently, after installing mathematica 10.0, every time mathematica is loaded it complains about internet connectivity and put up messages saying               PacletInstall::offline: The Wolfram System cannot install paclet WolframAutoUpdate because it is currently configured not to use the Internet for paclet downloads. To allow internet access, use Help > Internet Connectivity....      is there a way to disable such alerts/disable the auto update?
