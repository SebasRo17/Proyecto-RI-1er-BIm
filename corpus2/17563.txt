I am teaching students how to use Mathematica. I want to create a problem set that has cells with a certain style (probably Input or some new style that is a variant of Input) locked down so that the students can not see them at all or just see an unevaluatable placeholder instead. But I also want a cell within the notebook that permits someone with a password (like me) to make these hidden cells visible and evaluatable. Extra credit: it would be cool if I could relock these cells so that they reverted to their hidden form. Concession: Maybe the unlocking cell does not have to be in the notebook but could be a function in an external notebook that worked on the problem set notebook. Right now I accomplish the basic idea by having two notebooks, one with the answers and one without them. But this is ugly and leads to synchronization errors as I change my mind. Ideas welcome. Obviously, simpler is better.
