I spend a lot of time working on projects in which I am the sole developer, project manager, designer, QT person (Yes, I know... Bad!), and sometimes I'm even the client. I've tried just about everything for planning projects and managing myself, from just sitting and working freestyle until the project is done however long it takes, to a single-person version of scrum in which I held a progress meeting with myself over a one-man burn down chart every morning (not kidding). For those of you who spend much time working alone, what is the best way to organize yourself, manage large (for one person) projects, and keep productivity as high as possible?
