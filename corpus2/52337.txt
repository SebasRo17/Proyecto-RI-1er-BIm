Typically when i work on a project i only go back a few days or the last major change when i decide to do something drastic. I sometimes notice i broke a test or a feature and overlooked it for a few weeks so i may go back a month or two and see if the feature or test is broken and trace down the week i broke it. Then find what change did it. On a long term project over the span of a year. Do you actually go back 6+ months and if so why?
