Recently I read the following 5 Types Of Bosses and How To Deal With Them , which describes the attires of the worst boss. I've just started leading a small team of software developers. I would like to know what are the main things a programmer expects from the senior programmer or what are the things we should avoid while managing a team. Also, I would like to know how to keep the programmers satisfied and create a productive & completeness environment for my team.
