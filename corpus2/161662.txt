I am thinking of integrating the openfire chat server with my custom website. Openfire server and the smack client library is licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0. If I decide to use openfire, will it require my website source code to be also made available under the Apache license? Tried going through the licensing terms, but the legal language is a bit confusing. Thanks in advance for any insights! Rohit.
