I am a firmware engineer moved from Electrical background to Embedded Systems. I was till now programming in C and never bothered to apply OO principles in my design. Recently I was forced to implement design in C++. I started liking the OO principles like SOLID, design patterns, etc. I wanted to know more about applying OO design in my firmware design. All the resources on OO, that I found were too much into application programming rather than firmware. I found this book relevant (ordered it). I was curious if there are any other resource that can help me learn OO principles with a focus on embedded systems. I am still new to OO world, so please suggest me if I should learn OO principles first and then learn about applying them for embedded systems or start learning only stuff relevant to embedded system.
