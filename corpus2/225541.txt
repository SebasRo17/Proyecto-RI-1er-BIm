A few days ago, I appeared in an interview in a software company for .net developer. There I was asked the following question: > If we close browser window without getting logout, what will happen when we > provide same URL in the browser? My answer was that user will be able to view the home page with login details instead of being prompted to provide username and password as session of the user has not ended. Login information will actually be retrieved from cookies. But it depends upon the logic we have implemented for Login. But the interviewer didn't seem be satisfied with my answer and didn't accept my answer. I am wondering what might be answer of this question. So, I need your kind guidance regarding correct answers. So please explain what I was supposed to reply.
