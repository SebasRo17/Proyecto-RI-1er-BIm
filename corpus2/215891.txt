I have very little experience working with classes and object. I work in a loosely typed language, PHP. I was working with a SimpleXML object and ran into a problem where I was trying to do math with an element of that object like `$results->ProductDetail->{'Net'.$i};` If I echoed that value, I'd get `0.53` but when I tried to do math with it, it was converted to `0` Is there a reason that a loosely typed language would not recognize that as a float and handle it as such? Why would "echo" handle it as a string but the math fail to convert it? Example:               $xml='<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>';     $xml.='<Test>       <Item>         <Price>0.53</Price>       </Item>     </Test>';          $result=simplexml_load_string($xml);          var_dump($result->Item->Price);     echo '<br>';     echo $result->Item->Price;     echo '<br>';     echo 1+$result->Item->Price;     echo '<br>';     echo 1+(float)$result->Item->Price;      Output:               object(SimpleXMLElement)#4 (1) { [0]=> string(4) "0.53" }      0.53     1     1.53      No object version:               $no='.53';     echo 1+$no;      Output:               1.53      ================================ Side note: PHP `strpos()` does not properly convert an integer needle `$i` into a string.               $x=101; $i=1; if(strpos($x,"$i")===FALSE){echo $i." missing";}      and               $x=101; $i=1; if(strpos($x,$i)===FALSE){echo $i." missing";}      give different results. I don't want to become a php hater, but I'm beginning to lose that loving feeling.
