I was dealing with a virus earlier today which was a .dll file disguised as RUNDLL.dll which is regularly seen in the task manager and launches on startup. I would like to know how much information I could have extracted from that dll before deleting it. I used .NET reflector, and the file was unrecognized (meaning it was not c# code from what I understand.) I used visual studio and attempted to reference it but was greeted by another error. Visual studio handles all of the .net languages so I was surprised to say the least. I expected to find atleast the function names in the object browser if not anything else. Decompiling it was probably a waste of time if it was c++/c since that would just be assembly code. In what ways could a .dll file like this one prevent revealing information (function names, number of functions, etc.)? Are c++/c .dll files basically impossible to investigate for further information? Thanks.
