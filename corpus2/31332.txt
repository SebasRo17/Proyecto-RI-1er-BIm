I have the boolean expression `(a && !b)`. I want to add variables `c`, `d` into the expression and then have _Mathematica_ transform the expression into conjunctive normal form. I would like it to go something like this:               a&&!b       = (a && !b && c) || (a && !b && !c)       = (a && !b && c && d) || (a && !b && c && !d) || (a && !b && !c && d) ||          (a && !b && !c && !d)      Although a human can do this easily, how can can I get _Mathematica_ to do it? What are the commands?
