I've been trying to experiment with coded user interface testing (CUITS) lately and I get the following error whenever I try to create one. > The following package failed to load: C:\Users[File Path Goes > Here]\Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UITest.Extension.IE.dll. Coded UI > Test is now in an inconsistent state. Remove this package and restart Visual > Studio to work with Coded UI Test. I have a question on Stack Overflow about the error, which seems to have no solution, but that made me wonder, what exactly is an inconsistent state? I have never encountered this error before and I have not seen a good explanation of what it means.
