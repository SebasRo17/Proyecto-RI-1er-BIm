I've seen this code referenced in two different places, yet I haven't seen anybody bring this up, but it seems that on line 00339 there is an empty if block and I just copied the code to compile try it out but it won't even compile cause of that.               if (frame_count >= STREAM_NB_FRAMES) {      /* no more frame to compress. The codec has a latency of a few         frames if using B frames, so we get the last frames by         passing the same picture again */     } else {      Any idea or explanation why it is like that. Is it a mistake on the author's part when copying it? What is supposed to be going on in that if block anyways?
