I only want to get all the solutions of this system of the solutions with a value of $k$, we have the same values ​​of $m$               A = {1, 2, 3};     B = {2, 1, 0};     M = {a, b, c};     Solve[{a - b + c + m == 0,        SquaredEuclideanDistance[B, M] == k, (A - M). (B - M) == 0,        k > 0}, {a, b, c, m, k}, Integers]      In this ystem of the solutions, for example, $k = 6$, $m=1$ and $m = 3$.               A = {1, 2, 3};     B = {2, 1, 0};     M = {a, b, c};     Solve[{a - b + c + m == 0,        SquaredEuclideanDistance[B, M] == 6, (A - M). (B - M) == 0}, {a, b,        c, m}, Integers]      I do not how to start. How do I tell _Mathematica_ to do that?
