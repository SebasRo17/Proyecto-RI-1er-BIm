I solved two ODEs, which are a function of `t`, numerically. The first ODE is the vertical equation of motion and the second one is the horizontal equation of that motion. Then I tried to find the path equation. I used `ParametricPlot` to plot the path. Now I want the equation of that path. How can I express it using the solutions of my ODEs? * * * The Point of my question is as follows: Assuming that we solved an ODE Numerically and I got the answer like this: > >     {{y-> InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,0.386145}},<>]}} >   How can I `Approximate` the function to do some calculus on it?               γ = 6;      g = -9.8;      NDSolve[{y''[t] + γ*(y'[t])^2 == g, q''[t] == -γ*(q'[t])^2,        y[0] == 0, q[0] == 0,        y'[0] == 1.5, q'[0] == 7}, {q, y}, {t, 0, 10}]
