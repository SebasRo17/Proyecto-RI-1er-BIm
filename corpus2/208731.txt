I was reading about the _at most once_ property that defines what an atomic action is and I've been curios about this example:               x = 0, y = 0     x = y + 1 || y = y + 1      If we use the 'at most once' definition, we can say that, indeed, `x = y + 1` is atomic because   * `y` is only referenced in an another thread and   * `x` is not being read by any thread But the result of this action is not deterministic, it could be 1 or 2 depending on which operation is being computed first. I might be wrong from the start, isn't atomicity suppose to grant some kind of determinism?
