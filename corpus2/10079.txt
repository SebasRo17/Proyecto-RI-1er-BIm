I'm trying to find the following limit using _Mathematica_ : $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^N\left(\frac{k-1}{N}\right)^N$$ The problem is taken from here and is known to converge to $\displaystyle\frac{1}{e-1}$. However, using `Limit` in a straightforward manner returns unevaluated:               Limit[Sum[((k - 1)/n)^n, {k, 1, n}], n -> ∞]     (* Limit[Sum[((k - 1)/n)^n, {k, 1, n}], n -> ∞] *)      How can I explore this problem using _Mathematica_ and obtain the limit?
