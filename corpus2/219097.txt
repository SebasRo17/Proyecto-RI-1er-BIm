New to OOP and trying to understand some basic fundamentals. Currently using PHP5 to build a basic web app. In using PHP's built in PDO as my database class and a separately created user class that handles, among other things, user log in and out, is it best to have the db class connect to the database in a log in situation, or does the user class need to directly connect to the db? If the latter, I think I'm likely misunderstanding how PDO would standalone. If the former, presumably some kind of 'helper class' needs to be created that would facilitate the db connection between PDO and my user class?
