I'm trying to work with some vectors and have run into a strange problem. An obvious way to define a difference of two vectors would be               dif[x_,y_] := x-y      I thought an equivalent way of doing this would be               dif[x_,y_] := Table[x-z,{z,{y}}][[1]]      However, using this second method, there is some strange behaviour. When I evaluate               dif[{x,z},{0,0}]      I get the result               {x,{0,0}}      which is clearly not what I wanted. If I try evaluating               dif[{x,y},{0,0}]      instead, everything is ok, which leads me to think that the variable `z` in my definition of `dif` is treated as non-local. This seems pretty counterintuitive to me, as I was expecting `z` to act as a dummy variable. > What am I missing? One solution that works is using `Module`. This is a bit unsatisfying though, as it seems to me `z` should be treated as local even without having to explicitly demand this.
