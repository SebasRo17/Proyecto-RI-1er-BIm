Could someone please tell me how I can increase the accuracy of this plot, please? Or is there some other reason the lines are breaking up?               m = 60;     ContourPlot[{Re[Table[BernoulliB[n, (x + I y)], {n, m, m}]],      Im[Table[BernoulliB[n, (x + I y)], {n, m, m}]]}, {x, -5, 6}, {y, -10, 10},      AspectRatio -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRWfa.gif)
