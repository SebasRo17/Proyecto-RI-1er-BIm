I've noticed a lot of programming introductions (almost any language) usually include a heavy barrage of string manipulation quite early, such as:   * Count the number of "xx" in the given string. We'll say that overlapping is allowed, so "xxx" contains 2 "xx".   * Reverse the given string and remove all vowels from it.  Not just online courses, but even in degree programmes. But the thing is, I've never encountered a situation in "real life" where you had to do anything like that. Is it just luck, or do you really need to do heavy manipulation in the above manner in some fields of programming? Can you give a description or an example where it is needed? Edit:   Just to clarify, not necessarily string processing itself as in echoing variables to a html template, or other basic stuff like that, but the more arcane type of processing, like reading every second character? But yes, perhaps it is just for training purposes instead of direct needs. The file format conversion is a good note, though.
