Are there any **common expectations** from perspective employers when they hire a Perl developer? For a student who likes Perl and Linux and would like to get a job as Perl developer, what would you recommend to learn? **I am looking for things that are generic and applicable to most/all Perl positions** , as opposed to specific details of a given company's requirements. In other words, what are the things I should be able to to/know to become more attractive to ANY company looking for a Perl developer.
