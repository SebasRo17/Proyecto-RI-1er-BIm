_I'm quite a CSS beginner. I've read some introductory books but now I came across a sort of question that isn't answered in any of them:_ Let's say I have a basic HTML-based website with a standalone CSS file. Now I'm creating a new CSS class or ID and I want it to have a meaningful name of course because I'll probably come back to those lines a couple of times again. For creating a meaningful name there are two options:   1. I can name them `hide-upper-space` or `small-seethrough-border` \- these kinds of names are very helpful when reading the HTML file, but in CSS file there will be a mess of all these classes and IDs from all HTML documents mixed together. Moreover, when I want to remove or modify one HTML document I won't be able to clear or modify the appropriate lines in the CSS file because I won't know if they affect also some other HTML documents.   2. On the contrary, I can name them `blog-footnote` or `gallerythumbs-upper-left` and it will make my CSS file thoroughly readable, structured and easily modifiable, but it's useless information in HTML documents - when you're reading the HTML code for the footnote of your blog then _blog-footnote_ is just plain useless class name. I hope you get my point.   I'd guess that one of these options is the actual way how the CSS should be used but I can't figure out which one and why. Thank you for helping me to use the CSS the proper and effective way.
