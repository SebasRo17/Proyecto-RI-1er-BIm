Lately I'm deeply disturbed by the thought that I'm still not devoted to one specific IT subject after so many years of doing it as a hobby. I've been in so many different IT related hobbies since I was 12. I have spent 8 years and now I'm 20 and just finished freshman year at Computer Eng. Just to summarize the variety:   * 3D Game Dev. and Modelling (Acknex, Irrlicht , OpenGL, GLES, 3DSMAX)   * Mobile App.Dev (Symbian, Maemo, Android)   * Electronis (Arduino)   * Web.Dev. (PHP, MYSQL, Javascript, Jquery, RaphaelJS, Canvas, Flash etc.)   * Computer Vision (OpenCV) I need to start making money. But I'm having problem to pick the correct IT business to do so. **Is it a problem to have interest in so many different IT subjects?(in business world)** I'm having a lot of fun by doing all those stuff from time to time. Other than making money I also noticed that having so many different interests is lowering my productivity. But I'm still having difficulty to pick one. I'm feeling close to all those subjects (time to time).
