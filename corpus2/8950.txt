I would like to evaluate the PDF of a custom `ProbabilityDistribution` at the min and max values. However, `PDF[...]` returns 0 at the boundary conditions. Is there an elegant way to prevent this? Example:               dst = ProbabilityDistribution[2 x, {x, 0, 1}];     PDF[dst, 0.99999] (* = 1.99998 *)     PDF[dst, 1] (* = 0 *) (* I would like this to return 2 *)      The docs say that > the pdf is taken to be zero for $x < x_{min}$ and $x > x_{max}$ It seems inconsistent that the PDF is forced to zero at $x = x_{max}$.
