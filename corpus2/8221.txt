I'm a physics student and I try to simplify my day with _Mathematica_. Every time I use _Mathematica_ I need `Div[]`, `Grad[]`, `Curl[]`, etc., so I use `Needs["VectorAnalysis`"]`. My question is: Is there any way to tell _Mathematica_ that the package `VectorAnalysis`` should always be loaded? It would simplify my day enormously. By the way, I tried               DeclarePackage["VectorAnalysis`", {"Div", "Grad", "Curl"}]      from the _Mathematica_ tutorial on Automatic Loading of Packages, which says: > When you first use Grad, Mathematica automatically loads the package that > defines it. Unfortunately, nothing happens. The functions are still unknown, until I use `Needs["VectorAnalysis`"]` What am I doing wrong, and how do I fix my problem?
