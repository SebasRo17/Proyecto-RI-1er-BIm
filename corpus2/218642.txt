The screen shot shows the magento product upload page. The left nav allows you to switch to different options for the product. Basically each option in the left nav appears as a different page. However when you save and close, it will save all the updates made on each page. Using Foundation4, html, css, js - what would be the best approach to replicating something similar? Say I want 3 pages and one save button option. Using http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/section.html#panel2 and having the save buttons the top line form level seems a possible option. ![Magento screen shot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7BRce.jpg)
