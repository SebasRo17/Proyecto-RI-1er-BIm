As we all know, _Mathematica_ changes its logo design with every new version, while still maintaining the dodecahedral/icosahedral motif. I have been able, through much digging around, to finally acquire the code for generating the logos corresponding to versions three, four, and five. I was able to obtain code for generating the version six logo from this blog post by Michael Trott (it is also available here). However, I have not been so successful in finding code for the version two logo: ![version 2 spikey](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FZeNo.gif) Some searching seems to indicate that there is code for this in one of the _Mathematica_ Guidebooks by Trott, but the libraries I have access to do not have copies of these tomes. (Google Books will also not let me preview the pages where the code seems to be.) I have also tried sending an e-mail to Michael Trott and Igor Rivin, but I have not gotten any response from them in three weeks, so it would seem that they are unable or unwilling to supply the code for generating the version two logo. So, **how might I generate the version 2 _Mathematica_ spikey?**
