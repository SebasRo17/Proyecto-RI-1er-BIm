I just searched for the same but didn't get the answers. What I have is a `db` file which is around `100MB`. I have saved the `db` file in `sdcard` . Through this `db` file I'm going to populate the contents for the android app. I can read the db file using like below.               File dbfile = new File("/sdcard/Your_db_File.db" );      SQLiteDatabase  db = SQLiteDatabase.openOrCreateDatabase(dbfile, null);      What I'm concerned is about the memory. I have read like in `assets` it has some memory limitations. I'm just worried like will `100MB` of db file in sdcard or external memory is a harm or is it OK to have `100MB` db file? Or is there any limitations for sqlite db file in external storage as well? Suggestions are appreciated.
