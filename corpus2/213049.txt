Every now and then when I have a complex lambda, I do something like this:               Func<SomeObject, bool> equals = o =>         o.ID == someID && o.Name == someName && IsAdd || ...     var myList = MyThings.Where(equals).ToList();      Let's assume that the logic in equals can not be simplified. Does extracting the lambda from the linq query improve, or reduce readability? The alternative being:               var myList = MyThings.Where(o => o.ID == someID && o.Name == someName && IsAdd || ...).ToList();
