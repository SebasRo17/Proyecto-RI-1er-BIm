A `Transaction` contains one or more `LineItem`. One `LineItem` has a relation with an `Item`. Every `Item` has a number field that represent quantity in stock. Using this approach, every `Transaction` creation will need to decrease quantity in `Item`. If user update a `Transaction` then quantity in `Item` will need to be adjusted. If user delete a `Transaction` then quantity in `Item` will need to be increased. What is the best way to implement this rule or behaviour in domain model layer? `Transaction` operations (like create, update, or delete) are located in data access layer.
