I am an iOS developer just getting started with Windows Phone. At the moment, I have the free product Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone. I see that Microsoft has several higher-end IDEs, and some of them have some very fancy price tags. My question is -- will upgrading get me significant advantages? One thing I find very annoying is that unlike with Xcode, Visual Studio Express does not let me edit my source code while my app is running. (I don't need fix and continue; but it sure would be nice to be able to make changes while it is running, and have those changes applied the next time I run my app.)
