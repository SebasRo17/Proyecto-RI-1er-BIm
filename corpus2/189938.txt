It seems like Python is used as a coding language for part 2 of Kent Beck's book Test Driven Development. I have read the first part of that book and started appreciating the value of TDD . First part was easy to understand as the examples were in Java and that is the only language that I have worked on. How should I prepare myself to go about reading the second part of the book? What value will it provide? I do not plan to write a testing framework myself. Can I skip this entirely and go to the third section?
