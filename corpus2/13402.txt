I'm trying to embed a "Manipulate" applet I've created into a webpage by embedding a .cdf. I'm running into a problem with displaying outputs from functions I've written. Here is a simpler example that demonstrates the problem. If I code something this way (which involves defining a new function):               Moof[n_] := Append[{Circle[{0, 0}, n]}, Circle[{1, 1}, 3]]     Manipulate[Graphics[Moof[a]], {a, 1, 4}]      then I get on the webpage the error "Moof is not a Graphics primitive or directive." This code works fine within Mathematica when the appropriate cell is evaluated. On the other hand, if I code the same Manipulate applet without defining a new function:               Manipulate[Graphics[Append[{Circle[{0, 0}, a]}, Circle[{1, 1}, 3]]], {a, 1, 4}]      then everything works fine on the webpage. Here is what the two different codes produce on a live webpage. Unfortunately, the applet that I actually want to post is considerably more complicated and it would be difficult to write the Manipulate command all in native Mathematica functions. I assume that the difficulty has something to do with initialization of my user-defined functions. Is there any way around this besides rewriting my code from the ground up? Any advice on how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated.
