If I have a loop within another loop, yet I know the inner loop will only run once, will this algorithm still be O(n^2)?               For i = 1 to n do               For j = 1 to i do                    If (i==j) do                        For k = 1 to n                            {Do stuff}      The very inner loop will run at most 1 time, since `i` will only equal `j` once per iteration of the second loop. Is this still n^3?
