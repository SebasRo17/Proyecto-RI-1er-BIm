In the function `Nearest` , I can define my custom function using the `DistanceFunction` option. e.g:               dist[{u_, v_}, {x_, y_}] := 3 Abs[u - x] + 2 Abs[v - y]      Which I can use like this               Nearest[{ {1.5, .6}, {2, 0}, {1.25, 1.25}}, {0, 0}, DistanceFunction -> dist]      Is it possible to give a user-defined `DistanceFunction` for `RegionNearest` in **V10**? I don't see how to do this.
