So I've been trying to import a large set of data (6900 point pairs) from an excel (.xls) file. The Exel file has 2 columns of numeric data. I've also been trying to plot this data, but when I do, it won't allow me to alter my DataRange. Here is a simplified version of my code:               Subscript[Elliptical\[ScriptCapitalL], \[Nu]] =       Import["EllipticalGalaxy.xls"][[3]]          ListPlot[Subscript[Elliptical\[ScriptCapitalL], \[Nu]],       DataRange -> {0, 10000}]      Actually, no matter which DataRange I specify, this will not alter the plot (i.e. the default way it is plotting doesn't even include all my points). My fix for this was to use PlotRange, instead, which actually works, **UNLESS** I use ListLogLinearPlot (or ListLogLogPlot, or ListLogPlot). Here is another sample of my code when I replace ListPlot with ListLogLinearPlot:               ListLogLinearPlot[Subscript[Elliptical\[ScriptCapitalL], \[Nu]],       PlotRange -> {{0, Log[10000]}, {0, 1}}]      This will alter the range of the plot, but not the domain... My 2 questions are: 1) Why won't DataRange work? 2) Why won't PlotRange work for the logarithmic axis?
