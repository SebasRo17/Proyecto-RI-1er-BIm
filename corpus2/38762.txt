Let's say I've got a list of procedures:               {Print[1];, Print[2];, Print[3];}      And I want to only evaluate 3rd one:               {Print[1];, Print[2];, Print[3];}[[3]]      > >     1... 2... 3... >   Well, that's not what I've wanted, the walkaround would be to use `Hold`:               Hold[{Print[1];, Print[2];, Print[3];}][[ 1, 3]]      > >     3 >   **My question is:** is there more "proper" way to do this? p.s. the most tidy what I thought of is `Switch`:               Switch[2,      1, Print[1],      2, Print[2],      3, Print[3] ]      > >     2 >
