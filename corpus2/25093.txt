I was a Google Summer of Code student this year and successfully completed my project. It was an awesome learning experience. Just wondering, from an industry point of view - how is or how well is a Summer of Code experience viewed? I mean, if you were going to hire me, would it mean anything to you? I am just asking this since doing SoC != an internship. As a SoC student, I was a independent contractor for Google. Sure, there was proper development, but I am interested in looking at it from the experience you guys have here. Would you prefer me? Sorry for not revealing my name; I'd hope you understand.
