Ever since entering the world of programming, I've been bombed with tips like "file should be only x lines", which is fair since new programmers tend to stuff everything into one file. But, having done programming professionally for more than a year now, I've mostly found myself getting hindered by the small size of the files, rather than than the large size of them. One of the biggest hindrances I have, is having to shuffle between 10-20 different files when investigating how something works, when some of those files contain only a couple of lines. So I guess my question is: how do I know I've split my program into too small pieces?
