Every evaluation generates a pair of In[n]/Out[n] signs tagged before actual input and output. Like the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T846D.png) If I save the file, close it and re-open it, that In[n]/Out[n] signs will disappear (as expected). Like the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lf8hJ.png) However, A code example in documentation file will always have its In[n]/Out[n] signs no matter you have computed that piece of code or not. Like the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GKirh.png) My question is: How to perserve the In[n]/Out[n] signs generated by computation even if I re-open the same file on a fresh kernel? Like what it looks like for documentation files. Maybe it is necessary to use `DumpSave` like stated in this question? Besides, how to access stylesheet of documentation files? If I can apply that style to my code notes would be great.
