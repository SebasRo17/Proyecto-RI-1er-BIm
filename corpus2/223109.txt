I'm writing a library to create and manipulate Word .docx files in Python. In general, I take a lot of influence from the Microsoft VBA/C# API for Word in designing the API, figuring they've given it a lot more thought than I'll ever be able to. Several times I've found the wisdom in designing it the way they did only after getting much further down the road. A table has the properties `.rows` and `.columns`, each of which is a sequence of the `Row` and `Column` instances in the table, respectively. In the MS API, the methods for adding a new one are `Table.rows.add()` and `Table.columns.add()`. I'm inclined to believe this is more complicated than necessary, making my API harder for beginners to learn without really providing any benefit. I'm thinking `Table.add_row()` and `Table.add_column()` would better suit. As it happens, it also simplifies the code somewhat; that's not a motivator, just an observation that I wonder might be trying to tell me something. Is there an argument for preferring the former?
