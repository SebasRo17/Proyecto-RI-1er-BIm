What is the best way of collecting and/or keep tracking of ideas/issues that needs to be discussed in details and during the time? As an example, imagine within the team you're brainstorming about going for NoSQL, or you're discussing if Node.JS is an option for your team or not? Or some people are in favor of going for Erlang but others don't. Something that needs time and lot's of discussions to be finally decided in the end. Currently we're keeping everything either on email threads or on paper, but is there any better way that you can actually extract data later on in a simpler or more intuitive way? Something like what we have as Todo/Task Managers but with discussion abilities? P.S. One option is to use a private _forum_ software, but nobody likes it in our team. Maybe because most of them look old.
