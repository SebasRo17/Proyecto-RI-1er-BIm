These are Robert C. Martin's rules for TDD:   * You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.    * You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.    * You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test. When I write a test that seems worthwhile but passes without changing production code:   1. Does that mean I did something wrong?   2. Should I avoid writing such tests in the future if it can be helped?   3. Should I leave that test there or remove it? * * * **Note:** I was _trying_ to ask this question here: Can I start with a passing unit test? But I wasn't able to articulate the question well enough until now.
