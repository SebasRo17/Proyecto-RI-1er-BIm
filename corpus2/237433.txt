I have game project that will have two versions:   1. A simple version of the game, the core   2. An advanced version of the game. I have the 1st version in my public repository and only I will be working on it. As for the 2nd version, me and two friends of mine will work on it. The crucial part is I want the two versions stay in my repository. I though I might use branches for this, but considering this question and its answer, it's not good practice to do so in terms of versioning. As far as I've found out, forking your own repository is not possible. What are my options here? How can I keep both versions in my repository?
