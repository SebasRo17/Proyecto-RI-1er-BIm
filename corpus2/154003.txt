I am in the process of working on a video on demand system part of it involves the management of a hierarchical tree structure (think windows explorer) which allows users to upload videos, move folders around, create new folders etc. User action will be allowed depending on which permissions they have. In addition to managing the structure (creating folders and uploading videos), subscribers will be viewing content (read access). The number of reads will be significantly more than the writes. My question (and it is big one) is should I store the data in a database (for the writes) and also have some sort of cache which will be used for the reads? or do I use two databases? or is there a better solution? Also I will have to resolve concurrency issues which I think optimistic locking on the database will resolve. I have a fair bit about CQRS over the last few months but not sure if this is the way to go. Any ideas?
