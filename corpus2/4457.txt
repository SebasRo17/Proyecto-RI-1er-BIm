I have 500 text files each of about 200000 rows. I need to delete one row in each of them as fast as possible (later such operations will repeat). What is the best way to do this with Mathematica? Solutions using `NETLink`, `JLink` etc. are welcome! **Update:** I have found a solution for C#: "Efficient way to delete a line from a text file" but I don't know how to adapt it for using through `NETLink`. Another option probably is to use the `java.io.RandomAccessFile` class in Java but I am not very familiar with Java and `JLink`. Any help will be appreciated!
