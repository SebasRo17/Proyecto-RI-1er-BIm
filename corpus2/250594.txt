I'm newbie of web services programming and I have some problem to understand how to work authentication/security for REST WS pattern. I had read about OAuth but I haven't understand how it work in detail, however I think I don't need it because only my app use the API. I need authenticate the users that need to use the "privates" APIs, can you explain me the correct way for implement a REST WS authentication, or give me a good guide or flowchart?
