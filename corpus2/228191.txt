I don't know if this is a good or bad idea, or if it's technically even possible... but I'd like to have something of the following sort:               public class Math {       public int gcd(a,b) // Method for Greatest Common Denominator       public int lcm(a,b) // Method for Least Common Multiple       public int factorial(a) // Method for factorial       ...     }      and then I'd also like to have a namespace called `Math` that has subclasses such as `Math.Matrix`, `Math.RowVector`, `Math.ColumnVector`, etc... so I can define my own Matrix data structure and its associated actions. Is this advisable? I am not too keen on the idea of using some other name for my `Math` class, as I want it to be a static class with all sorts of functions/methods that are useful to me, and at the same time, I want to gather all my relevant data structures under a `Math` namespace.
