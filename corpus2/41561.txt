FrenetFucntion = {         t'[s] == s* n[s],          n'[s] == -s* t[s] + 0.3* b[s],         b'[s] == -0.3* n[s],          t[0] == {{1, 0, 0}}, n[0] == {{0, 1, 0}},         b[0] == {{0, 0, 1}}     };     sol = NDSolve[FrenetFucntion, {t, n, b}, {s, 0, 50}];      How to integrate the solution of `NDSolve`. Also is there any way of plotting the integration function of interpolating polynomial? I used `NIntegrateInterpolatingPolynomial` but then it will give me definite integral only because I have to specify the limits of s. Is there any way of defining s limits like from 0 to s so that I may plot the result of integration as well.
