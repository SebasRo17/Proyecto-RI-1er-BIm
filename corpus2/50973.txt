I've been asked to create a web page from which users can access several other applications created using oracle forms and jsf, this will include also sso. I cant think of an easy way to do it, what I was thinking about was that the user should register and enter all his usernames/passwords for each application, after which he will deal only with the username/password he created for this page. What I wanted to ask was if this is a good idea or is there a better way to deal with this?
