My team will regularly make code changes that break a unit or integration test for a feature hidden deep in the dark corners of our application. When the test breaks there is a frequent question, "Who is even using this feature!?". We generally un-break the code and make the test pass because, as developers, we cannot determine if a feature is still in use and still needed. How can my team and I effectively address obscure or seemingly strange features? I think what we want to know is if any customer is using them and if not can we remove the feature. With several hundred users and the nature of our app it would be hard to put a logging or reporting feature in our app to phone home whenever a 'feature' is used. I think that makes this a management process rather than a technical process.
