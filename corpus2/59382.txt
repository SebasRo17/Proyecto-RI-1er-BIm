There is already a thread on how to split a string into equal sized chunks. I'm wanting to split a string into sets of substrings of length 1 and 2. For example, if I have the string "123456", my list would include elements such as {12,3,4,56}, {1,2,3,45,6}, and {1,2,34,56}. I found this little bit of Python code, but 1) I don't know how to translate it into Mathematica code and 2) it gives you strings with a bunch of extra commas (because it's basically just distributing n commas through the string in different ways). I suspect there is a very simple way of doing this in Mathematica.
