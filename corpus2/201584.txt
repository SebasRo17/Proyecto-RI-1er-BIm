I want to have sign up/login functionality on my site with a "Login with Facebook" and "Login with Twitter" button. Considering the following scenario:   * User A logs in with Twitter.    * Account gets created.   * User A logs out.   * User A comes back next week and can't remember what they signed up with (or just feels like) using Facebook login this time. How can you combine these accounts? So far there's 2 options I can think of:-   * Cookie (Not reliable)   * Have a 'login' and 'signup' action. So if they 'login' with Facebook it will say "You never signed up for this site with Facebook. Did you maybe use Twitter?" (But maybe they will 'signup' with Facebook then and then I still have no connection with the previous twitter account)
