**The objective:** Create a slider that, when displaced from the center, increases-decreases the value of another variable at a rate proportional to the displacement. So, I create a slider that automatically comes back to the center               Slider[Dynamic[var, {(var = #) &, (var = 0.) &}], {-1, 1}]      Now I want a second variable to be dynamically increased/decreased when `var!=0.` **My ideas are:**   1. insert in the previous dynamic, something that does the updating   2. use an animator with its speed set by `var` when `var!=0.` that updates the value **Problems with the above:**   1. How to control the speed of the updating given that I can't know for sure the intervals in which `val` will be updated, and `UpdateIntervals` sets an upper bound?   2. How to make it work without it showing in the screen? Any other alternatives are welcome (ideally I'd like an elegant solution).
