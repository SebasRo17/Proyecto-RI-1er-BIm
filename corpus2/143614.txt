I am planning to create a web solution for the desktop, I would be dividing my task into three steps   1. Design   2. Coding   3. Automated use case I am wondering if in the future I have to port my web solution as mobile phone native application. How would I do that? Will I go back again to the design phase to redesign or will I just recode some of the already written stuff meant to be for the desktop?
