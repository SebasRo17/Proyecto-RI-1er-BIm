I know we've covered what questions you should ask about a company before you would decide to work there. But what do you do with the answers? In other words, what would you consider a dealbreaker? I.e. what would scare you so much about a company that you wouldn't work there, even if everything else was great? For example, if they tell me they don't use version control, I wouldn't work there. End of story.
