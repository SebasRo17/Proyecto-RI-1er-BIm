Every developer advocates test-driven development, but I am coding a website in NodeJS and I am not testing my app. This is **not** because I don't see any reason. I know it allow me to check at each commit whether my code is right, thus avoiding security flaws. I don't do any tests because I don't know how or what to test. I coded a MVC app with express + mongoose + passport, and I have no idea what to test or how to test. I know it is possible to mock express requests or mongodb, but I don' find that clean and flexible. So, what and how to test?
