I have a question on plot labeling in _Mathematica_. I have               y = 4 x / L + 2      where               L = {10, 20, 30, 40}      I want to draw a graph of y vs. x. When I evaluate               Plot[y, {x, 0, 100},         ImageSize -> Scaled[1.0],        PlotLabel ->  Style["y vs X ", FontSize -> 18]]      I get four different lines in the same plot. I want to know how to label each line with its relevant L value; e.g., "l = 10" for the corresponding line. Could anyone please tell me how to do this?
