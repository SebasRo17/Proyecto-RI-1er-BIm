I want to analyse Chilean elections data available in the official website. What I have returns the data for president (numbers are strings, to be parsed later).               Import["http://www.eleccionservel.cl/ELECCIONES2013/vistaPaisPresidente", "Data"][[2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ;; 10, {1, 3, 4}]]      But to get the data for congress, the website does not have a direct URL and the data by districts needs to be selected by clicking in links that look like this               <a href="#" onclick="javascript:doSubmit('409','D');"> Distrito 9 </a>      Which in turn runs               function doSubmit(a,b){document.consultarForm.codigo.value=a;document.consultarForm.nivel.value=b;document.consultarForm.submit()}     <form id="diputado" name="consultarForm" action="/ELECCIONES2013/diputado" method="POST">      I have tried unsucessfully the following               url="http://www.eleccionservel.cl/ELECCIONES2013/diputado";     Import[url, "Data", "RequestMethod" -> "POST", "RequestParameters" -> {   "codigo" -> "409",   "nivel" -> "D",   "division" -> "POLITICA",   "codigoPadre" -> "409",   "codigoCircunscripcion" -> "409",   "codigoColegio" -> "D"   }]      Not sure if `"RequestParameters"` should refer to the "name" or the "id" of the form. Is there a chance to get this data with _Mathematica_ in an elegant and simple way, or should I be looking to a different tool?
