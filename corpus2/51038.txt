I am a front-end developer seeking to add programming to my skillset. As with all things, I'm sure that practice and practical application will aid me most, but I am currently having trouble wrapping my head around the transition from a very linear type of development (HMTL/CSS) to the more "3-dimensional" or non-linear concepts of programming, e.g., object-oriented programming. I'm just feeling overwhelmed that there's so much to know! Where to start, where to start. I'm especially interested in learning Javascript, PHP, and RoR. But I'd prefer to really get intimate with PHP as I like tinkering with WordPress. Does anyone have any suggestions for resources relevant to my study, or hands- on example projects that would yield the most practical experience for me? I've tinkered for years, but am just anxious for that ah-ha moment for things to start clicking. Thanks!
