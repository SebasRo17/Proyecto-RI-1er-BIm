i have to solve some solitons scattering through this coupled equations. i need to get two different graph, but still the graph did not come out. and also the equations quite complicated containing hyperbolic trigo . (maybe just for me). i dont know whether the problems come from the hyperbolic equations that i used, or becoz of initial condition.the coding as below:                   u = 0.05;         g = 0.2;         s = NDSolve[{x''[t] == 4/(\[Pi]^2 x[t]^3) - 10/(\[Pi]^2 x[t]^2) - (80 g)/(3 \[Pi]^2 x[t]^3) - ((6 u)/(\[Pi]^2 x[t]^2))[1/Cosh[y[t]/x[t]]^2 - (2 y[t])/x[t] Sinh[y[t]/x[t]]/Cosh[y[t]/x[t]]^3],        y''[t] == u (y[t]/(x[t]^3))[Sinh[y[t]/x[t]]/Cosh[y[t]/x[t]]^3],       x[1] == -3, x'[1] == 0, y[0] == 1, y'[0] == 3}, {x, y}, {t, 0,100}]     Plot[Evaluate[{x[t], y[t]} /. %], {t, 0, 100}, PlotRange -> All, PlotPoints -> 200]
