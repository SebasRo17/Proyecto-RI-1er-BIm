I recently read this article on knowledge sharing and immediately recognized the same problem within my own organization. My main goal now is to 'kill peer-to-peer collaboration' as the default method of communication for non- private, system related discussions. Otherwise you end up with all of the historical knowledge living in the heads of individuals, or lost in a massive email system. My question for the group is as follows:   * What methods / software have you used to encourage more 'public' discussions among your developers? Some initial ideas I had.. any feedback would be great:   * Internal news group   * 'better' wiki software (using Sharepoint now)   * Message board (I would love to have an internal instance of StackExchange, but don't think that is an option!) **Note:** As stated above, we already have a wiki, but I dislike the wiki idea because things are usually only added to the wiki after the fact, _if at all_. Thanks!
