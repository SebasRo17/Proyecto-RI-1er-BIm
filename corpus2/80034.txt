_(I've been wondering all day whether to ask this question here - my biggest concern would be that it would be seen as off-topic, or not relevant. It's not relevant to the US, this is true, but it is VERY relevant the UK market.)_ My question is: do hiring managers / IT decision makers in the UK use data from ITJobsWatch in their decision making process, how valid is the data and how accurate do you perceive it to be. (as a secondary, more worldwide question: do people use salary aggregation sites in their decision making/negotiation process) A couple of disclaimers! I don't work for them, I have nothing to do with them. I invite (genuine) comments from representatives of the site about how they collect the data (I've read the small paragraph on their website already). I also wouldn't consider that I'm pimping the site here - I imagine any UK hiring manager worth his stuff will already know about it! I've been asked whether the data on the site is valid and relevant, and I'm curious as to the response from the UK market.
