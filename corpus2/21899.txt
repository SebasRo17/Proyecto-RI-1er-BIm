I have a very weird problem that I don't usually get. I try to plot a set of equations using `LogLinearPlot` and the **Get coordinates** right-click menuitem is working just fine. However, when I change the parameter, I right click in the image to get the coordinate, however displayed coordinate value is inconsistent with the axis. I point at around 100 to 1000 but it gives me -0.02631. This problem does not always appear and it depends on the parameters I use (`ash`, `csh`, etc.). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E9c17.png) Can anyone please help me what might cause this issue? I never had this problem before. I am using _Mathematica_ v8. I'm sorry for dumping my code. It is given because I don't know how to make it simpler.               << "PlotLegends`"          bsh[ash_, Gs_, s0_] := ash/Gs*s0/100;     w[af_, nf_, mf_, ws_, \[Psi]_] := ws/(          (Log[Exp[1] + (\[Psi]/af)^nf])^mf);     e[ash_, csh_, w_, Gs_, s0_] := ash*(          ((((w/100)^csh)/(bsh[ash, Gs, s0]^csh)) + 1)^(1/csh));     s[af_, nf_, mf_, ws_, \[Psi]_, ash_, csh_, Gs_, s0_] := (          w[af, nf, mf, ws, \[Psi]]*          Gs/e[ash, csh, w[af, nf, mf, ws, \[Psi]], Gs, s0]);          Gs = 2.61; ws = 44.664; ll = 64; s0 = 98.373;     af = 1049; nf = 3.83; mf = 1.6; ash = 0.878; csh = 36.52;          LogLinearPlot[{       s[af, nf, mf, ws, \[Psi], 0.9, csh, Gs, s0],        s[af, nf, mf, ws, \[Psi], 2*ash, csh, Gs, s0],        s[af, nf, mf, ws, \[Psi], ash, csh, Gs, s0],        s[af, nf, mf, ws, \[Psi], 0.5*ash, csh, Gs, s0],        s[af, nf, mf, ws, \[Psi], 0.25, csh, Gs, s0]},      {\[Psi], 0.01, 1000000},      ImageSize ->400, AxesStyle -> Thick, PlotRange -> {0, 100},       LabelStyle -> {Bold, 14}, AxesLabel -> {"\[Psi]", "S"},       PlotLegend -> {"4ash", "2ash", "ash", "0.5ash", "0.25ash"},      LegendPosition -> {1.1, -0.4}, LegendTextSpace -> 1,      PlotStyle -> {Red, Thick, Dashed, Dotted, DotDashed}]
