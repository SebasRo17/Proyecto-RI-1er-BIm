**Update:** I've got a response from the FSF on this down in the answers From the answer to Can I remove all-caps and shorten the disclaimer on my License?, it appears that the APP CAPS sections of a software license are largely to provide extra legal ammo and increase the weight of those sections. On the flip side, ALL CAPS TEXT is more difficult to read in paragraph form. Furthermore, with formats like markdown, we can provide cleaner alternatives to all-caps "bolding" of text. So, I'd like to convert (for example) the warranty clause of the MIT license from:               THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR      IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE      AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER      LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,      OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE      SOFTWARE.      to (markdown):               **The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or     implied, including but not limited to the warranties of marchantability,     fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the     authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other      liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from,      out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the      software.**      Is this legally murky territory? (particularly w/ GPL?)
