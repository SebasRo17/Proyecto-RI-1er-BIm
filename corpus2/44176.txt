I am doing an Numerical integral with sigularities.               tk = Cos[Sqrt[3]/2 kx + 1/2 ky] + Cos[-Sqrt[3]/2 kx + 1/2 ky] + Cos[ky]      + I (Sin[Sqrt[3]/2 kx + 1/2 ky] + Sin[-Sqrt[3]/2 kx + 1/2 ky] - Sin[ky])      The integral I want do is:               int1 = NIntegrate[1/Norm[tk], {kx, 0, 2 Sqrt[3] Pi/3}, {ky, 0, 4 Pi/3}]       Without excluding singularities, I got:               57.6751      This integral has singularities in 3 Places:               {4 Pi/(3 Sqrt[3]), 0}, {2 Pi/(3 Sqrt[3]), 2 Pi/3}, {4 Pi/(3 Sqrt[3]), 2 Pi/3}}      ![Three Singularities](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tyiAb.jpg) So I will Exclude them using:               int1 = NIntegrate[1/Norm[tk], {kx, 0, 2 Sqrt[3] Pi/3}, {ky, 0, 4 Pi/3},            Exclusions ->{{4 Pi/(3 Sqrt[3]), 0}, {2 Pi/(3 Sqrt[3]), 2 Pi/3},             {4 Pi/(3 Sqrt[3]), 2 Pi/3}}]      This result is quite different from which I didn't exclude any singular points. However, it gives me a result:                13.6216 + 0. I      **Q:Why a complex term occurs?** It looks quiet strange to me. However, excluding other points which are not singularities also gives nearly the same answer. For example:               int1 = NIntegrate[1/Norm[tk], {kx, 0, 2 Sqrt[3] Pi/3}, {ky, 0, 4 Pi/3},             Exclusions -> {{1, 1}}]      Gives:               13.6215      Excluding {0,0} gives:               57.6751      This is even stranger for me. What happened? Can you explain to me? This is very untrustworthy for me. **How can I know this numerical integral is right or wrong?** Another integral I want to do is:               int1 = NIntegrate[1/Abs[Norm[tk]-1], {kx, 0, 2 Sqrt[3] Pi/3}, {ky, 0, 4 Pi/3}]      This has singular lines:![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EqQld.jpg) With an without excluding this line, the integral is a finite number. However, I expect this integral to be infinite. **What is wrong?**
