I'm confused in differentiating the OSI Model and TCP/IP suite. As per my knowledge. OSI is a structure on top of which Networks are built and TCP/IP is the suite of protocols that operate on these 7 layers of OSI. Correct me if I'm wrong. Also, is TCP/IP a replacement to OSI and is used **IN PLACE** of OSI? or both these work **COLLECTIVELY** to form the Network? any good source to clarify my confusion will be appreciated. Thanks.
