Recently, a colleague told me that it wasn't advisable to make conditions in the **join clauses**. Instead he suggested to make conditions in the **where clause**. He told me that the SQL engine was optimized for this way. Here is a simple example to illustrate my question. In this case, I think it would make any difference. What strategy is the best? And why? Assume we have a parameter nammed `@user_id`. ## First strategy               SELECT      role.name     FROM        user_role     INNER JOIN  user ON user_role.user_id = user.id AND                         user_role.user_id = @user_id     INNER JOIN  role ON user_role.role_id = role.id      ## Second strategy               SELECT      role.name     FROM        user_role     INNER JOIN  user ON user_role.user_id = user.id     INNER JOIN  role ON user_role.role_id = role.id     WHERE       user.id = @user_id
