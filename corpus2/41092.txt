I am a college student and I am majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. As I get closer to my senior year, I have noticed that continuing my studies is the best choice right for me now. I see that several universities offer an Computer Science Master's Degree and a Software Engineering Master's degree. What are their pros and cons?
