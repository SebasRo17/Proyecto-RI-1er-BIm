If I execute the following code:               char = 97;     Slider[Dynamic@ToExpression@FromCharacterCode@char, {0, 5}]      the slider will fail to change the value of `a`. How do you make this work, when the expression has to be generated with `FromCharacterCode` or similar? **Note:**               ToExpression@FromCharacterCode@97 == a
