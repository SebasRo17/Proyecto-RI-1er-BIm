For applications targeting multiple platforms, I see mainly two development approaches-   * Go for some JAVA-like development platform. Have one code solution and let the intermediate runtime handle different platforms. If something goes wrong in any platform, tweak the code a bit. But keep it same for all.   * Make modular code separating core logic and UI. Develop separate UIs for respective platforms which will be calling same core libraries. Build the application separately for each of the target platforms. So, which one to follow? I know, the answer will start with " **It depends** ". But I want to hear your opinions on these approaches and the factors to be considered to choose any of them.
