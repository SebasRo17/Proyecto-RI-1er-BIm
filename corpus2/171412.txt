Just read this in the REST API Rulebook: **GET and POST must not be used to tunnel other request methods**. > Tunneling refers to **any abuse** of HTTP that masks or misrepresents a > message’s intent and undermines the protocol’s transparency. A REST API must > not compromise its design by misusing HTTP’s request methods in an effort to > **accommodate clients with limited HTTP vocabulary**. Always make proper use > of the HTTP methods as specified by the rules in this section. [highlights > by me] But then a lot of frameworks use _tunneling_ to expose REST interfaces via HTML forms, since `<form>` knows only about `GET` and `POST`. My most recent example is a `MethodRewriteMiddleware` for flask (submitted by the author of the framework): http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/38/. Any ways to comply to the "Rule" without hacks or add-ons in web frameworks?
