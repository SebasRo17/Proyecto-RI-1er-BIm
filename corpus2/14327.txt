I found this pretty neat page showing cartograms for the US elections and I don't really know how to get started doing these graphics in _Mathematica_. For those who don't know, a cartogram is a map in which the geometry is distorted in proportion to the variable being plotted. For example, the standard red/blue US election map ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XRyKF.png) is is transformed to a _population cartogram_ by scaling each state so that its size on the map is proportional to the state's population: ![enter image description here](http://www- personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2012/statepop512.png) Or again, according to a each state's number of electoral votes: ![enter image description here](http://www- personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2012/stateelec512.png) Here's the population cartogram based on county data: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KkMuL.png) Even more exotic plots are discussed on the linked page. I'm asking for a kick start and ideas on how to approach it since I haven't done something like this before.
