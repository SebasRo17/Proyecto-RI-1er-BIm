This question arose during my analysis of the following problem: filling gaps. (The code used here is Simon Woods's work.) `FoldList` seems to not cooperate with `ParallelMap` and I do not understand it:               f[_, y_] := y     f[x_, "."] := x          fill[data_] :=       Transpose[FoldList[f, First[#], Rest[#]] & /@ Transpose[data]]          fillP[data_] := Transpose[       ParallelMap[        FoldList[f, First[#], Rest[#]] &,        Transpose[data]]       ]          data = Table[RandomChoice[{1, "."}], {10^6}, {4}]~Prepend~(Range@4);      Timings are as follows:               fill@data; // Timing // First (* -> 3.868825 *)     fillP@data; // Timing // First (* -> 4.056026 *)
