Another 2 days of reading and watching demos and here we go. For my enterprise LoB Silverlight app I'm going to use:   1. Prism for UI aspects and modularity.   2. MVVM pattern (using Prism)   3. ??? to bring data over and validations...   4. Entity Framework for Data access   5. SQL Server for data Ok, main dilemma is #3. If I won't use any framework then I will have to figure out how to do all CRUD stuff myself. I can do RESTful WCF, I can do SOAP. All that == MANUAL coding. I can do RIA Services. I kind of see what it does and it is nice for direct match with my data layer BUT it is not that great if there will be lot of business logic. Where would I put it? In my ViewModel? Another question is how those services maintained. Once I generated it - I should maintain them by hand if data changes? I also found CSLA which seems to be nice on one hand but receives lot's of critique.. CSLA will allow me to write business logic and shape object as I needed and than I can pass it "through" ViewModel and all is well. Something tells me that RIA Services will be much quicker to write. Also, I like the fact that I don't have to include extra dependencies. There is no blogs or mentioning of RIA Services since 2010. Is it going under table? Not widely accepted? Not scaling well for big apps? I'm trying to decide which one I need to bet on. CSLA or RIA Services. OR?
