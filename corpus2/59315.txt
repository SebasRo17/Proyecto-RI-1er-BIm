I have a double integral that I am trying to calculate numerically, and I'm having convergence issues.               f[x_, z_] := (Exp[-1*gamma*x]/x^0.5)*BesselI[1, (alpha*z*x)^0.5];     a[tau_, z_] := (alpha*z)^0.5*NIntegrate[f[tau - taup, z]*Exp[-1*gammaL*(tau - taup)]*Exp[-1*gammaS*(tau - taup)], {taup, 0, tau}, WorkingPrecision -> 200];     b[tau_, z_] := 0.25*alpha*z* NIntegrate[{f[tau - taup, z]*f[tau - taupp, z]*Exp[-1*(gammaL + gammaS)*Abs[taup - taupp]]}, {taup, 0, tau}, {taupp, 0, tau}, WorkingPrecision -> 200];     S[tau_, z_] := (1 + a[tau, z] + b[tau, z]);          gamma = 1;     gammaL = 10;     gammaS = 10;     alpha = 1;      Evaluating e.g. `S[100,10]` I get a convergence warning. From my understanding of how I'm expecting the integrals to behave, I think the answer I'm getting is incorrect. I get an answer of `3.259`.               NIntegrate::ncvb: NIntegrate failed to converge to prescribed accuracy after 7 recursive bisections in taup near taup = 99.96171345046263`.     NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one of the following: singularity, value of the integration being 0, oscillatory integrand, or insufficient WorkingPrecision. If your integrand is oscillatory try using the option Method->Oscillatory in NIntegrate.      I've played with `WorkingPrecision` and `AccuracyGoal`. Are these the right things to try? I am using rather dated Mathematica 5.2... Thanks for any hints.
