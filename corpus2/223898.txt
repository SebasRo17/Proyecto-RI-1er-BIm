I am working on a networking site where I need to reload the notification div _every second_. I wanted to know is it good or bad to load it every second as there are some other divs _also_ loading after every 3-4 seconds. Will it cause any problem like hanging, slowing down, etc? Reloading is done by ajax:               var auto_refresh = setInterval(         function ()  {             $('#notif').load('notiffinder.php #NOOFFNOTIFFC').fadeIn();             $('#jtoloadnot').load('header.php #jtoloadnot').fadeIn();         }, 1000);
