I was once told to read the books titled 'The Pragmatic Programmer' and 'The Mythical Man Month'. I have very little experience programming (basic HTML, CSS and JS). If I were to purchase these books, read through them, would it be beneficial to me with such a limited understanding or would I benefit from them? I ask because I am currently learning HTML5 and CSS3 from an online source and want some general reading material to add to my kindle.
