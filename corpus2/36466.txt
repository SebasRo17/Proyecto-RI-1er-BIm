I have been searching for resources to learn (Java) Web Services. Although I have found a lot of resources and tutorials on JWS, I am confused with the version numbers, the abbreviations and Metro. Plus the last update to Metro was in 2008. Is it a worthwile thing to learn? I wanted to learn how to access Web Services, since an upcoming project is about accessing one. I have some experience with OAuth on Twitter(using code available). Things I know about the project:   I have to access a Web Service.   Java is the preferred platform to use(Although I know I can use any).   Axis can be used to access the Web Service(I have never used Axis) I have a meeting scheduled to learn more, but I sure don't want to look silly since I am no Java expert, have never created or accessed Web Services using Java. My Questions: 1.Can someone point me to a tutorial which will help me learn how to access a already running Web Service (Preferably SOAP(?), not REST. It's XML based)   2\. Will you recommend using PHP or Python to do the work of accessing the web service? I am expecting a lot of nay saying, but I hope I get some answers too. I will clarify things if needed.
