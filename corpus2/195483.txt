I have an internal database at my work. At the moment we are using excel to import data, but this is very error prone, so I would like to replace this with some javascript based application which exposes some of the data in lookup tables in dropdown menus, for our customers to fill in, on a public website. So my internal database lives on an internal server not viewable by the public. How should I go about building an application that communicates with the internal database, and only exposes certain tables? Is some middleware like Django, that rather than using an SQL database uses some other way of getting the lookup values (I have a REST interface set up on the main database). (To clarify, I am looking for a server side technology that I can put on a public facing server, that will communicate with the internal server).
