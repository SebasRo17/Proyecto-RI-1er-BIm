So in college I started learning Php, mostly starting with the Larry Ullman books. I got a job at a company after, where I was able to learn some stuff from the higher up guys. Since then, I've done freelance stuff and sort of learned things as I needed to. I'm trying to figure out where to go next. I definitely want to stick with the web programming arena, and I'm enjoying concentrating on Php. I know MySQL as well, but VERY little Javascript / Ajax. I've also been reading a lot of OOP theory, and have a descent grasp of how it works, but it doesn't feel natural yet. Where should I go from here? Is it worth learning Java fort a while to really get the OOP stuff down? I took introductory Java in college, but it was only 1 semester. Or should I concentrate on some of the open source stuff (Wordpress, Drupal, JQuery, etc). How about E-commerce solutions? I have no experience with that. In terms of my goals, I don't have much plans for big, enterprise types of projects. I would mostly be interested in working freelance on websites of small, to medium size. But, I would like my coding to be as sound, and well structured as can be thanks for the help!
