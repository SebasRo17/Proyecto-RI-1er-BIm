Is there a specific reason that this would break the language conceptually or a specific reason that this is technically infeasible in some cases? ~~The usage would be with new operator.~~ **Edit:** I'm going to give up hope on getting my "new operator" and "operator new" straight and be direct. The point of the question is: why are constructors _special_? Keep in mind of course that language specifications tell us what is legal, but not necessarily moral. What is legal is typically informed by what is logically consistent with the rest of the language, what is simple and concise, and what is feasible for compilers to implement. The possible rationale of the standards committee in weighing these factors are deliberate and interesting -- hence the question.
