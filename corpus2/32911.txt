Can I compile a function that contains ArcTanh[]? The following doesn't work               Needs["CCodeGenerator`"]     c = Compile[ {{x}}, ArcTanh[x]^2];     c[2.5]      _Mathematica_ gives me > >     "CompiledFunction::cfn: Numerical error encountered at instruction 1; >      proceeding with uncompiled evaluation>>" >   However, in the answer to this question, a reply indicates that `ArcTanh` can be compiled.
