According to Wikipedia, > `about` is an internal URI scheme (also known as a "URL scheme" or, > erroneously, "protocol") in various web browsers to display certain built-in > functions. It is not an officially registered scheme, and has no standard > syntax. my question is... what "powers" these "interfaces"? there doesn't seem to be any kind of "application server" running - that would conventionally support such a front-end - were it to be running remotely.. i'm sure the reason for the dearth of information out there - is that these all break the _psuedo- promise_ that anything "you do" in the browser - won't "effect" your system. these interfaces _clearly_ have access to system level resources and permissions, etc.. are they all simply custom, c-coded hooks to the internal code of the parent applications - or are they a more abstract, _ui--layer_? i admit to little knowledge of plug-in authoring, but can this type of functionality be achieved via the typical plug-in API's, or are they too limited? i have spent some time in the webkit source code poking around - but it is so massive and convoluted that its hard to deduct much... it would seem that however these vendors are implementing these features might be an appealing alternative to say, the various language-specific bridges that webkit implements on various platforms. i personally find the bridges frustrating, which is probably what led me down this train of thought... any insights appreciated.
