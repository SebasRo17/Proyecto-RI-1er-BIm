In spanish speaking countries we use more than one last name, like: > First name ↘                           ↙ Last name   >                  **Pedro Arturo Rodríguez Loyola**   >          Middle name ↗                               ↖ (?) I'm trying to model data for patient name, in our country it's important, so I can't neglect the second last name, but I would like to build an application that can makes sense to other developers, specially from English speaking countries. * * * I created a similar question on English.SE, it has some insights about why it's important to persist both values.
