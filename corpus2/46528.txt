With the help of people here I was able to solve several cases similar to IC3 but this case - unlike the other cases - does not return an answer. I will try to run it for a day with 8 processors but will be grateful for:   1. Any suggestions on how to solve IC3 (besides more memory or more time)   2. In the end I only care about some other constraints so would help resolve if I add additional constraints on the other variables (a, c and d) when trying to eliminate x and z?              IC3 := (4 d^3 + 24 a d^2 x + 3 (2 a + c) d (-c x^2 + 2 a (x^2 + 4 x z - 2 z^2)) - (2 a + c)^2 (c x^3 + 4 a (x^3 - 3 x^2 z + z^3)))/(6 (2 a + c)^2)              && 0 < -((2 d)/(2 a + c)) < 1     Resolve[{x,z}, (-(2 d)/(2 a + c)) <= x <= 1, (-d/(2 a + c))<=z<=(-(2 d)/(2 a + c)), IC3]
