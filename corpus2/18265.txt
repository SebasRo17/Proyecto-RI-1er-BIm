The world of software creation is very competitive. I've heard it said to be successful you need to be the first one with the idea. Everyone knows how Bill Gates created IBM DOS on one machine while simultaneously building MS-DOS on another machine (and we all know how that turned out). In order to be the first to come up with a new software product, where do you go looking for fresh ideas? **Update 06/26/13:** Reworded this question in an attempt to get it reopened. Bill Gates developed MS-DOS at the same time he was hired to develop IBM DOS. As a programming community, we would all gain by understanding how to think up great ideas for software. As programmer we tend to get stuck in our thinking... it's refreshing to hear how fellow programmers busted out and came up with their ideas. It's not very likely that we will have an MS-DOS opportunity like Bill Gates. Please vote to reopen.
