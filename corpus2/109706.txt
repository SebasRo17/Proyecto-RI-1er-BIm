I have been asked by my local Association for Computing Machinery chapter to give a lecture on Android development, and while I already have some topics to cover, I was curious if the community of SO had any suggestions of things that would be interesting to hear about. Thus selected:   * OpenGL   * Using hardware features (camera, audio, accelerometer, multitouch)   * Good UI practices   * Social media integration
