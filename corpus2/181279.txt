I am working on debugging my mobile application. There is a specific requirement/issue that I am having related to a drag and drop touch interface on an iPad. I am at the trial and error phase of trying to figure out how to fix this (meaning I have no idea how to fix the issue I'm seeing). The only way I have been able to figure out how to test my app on a mobile device is to deploy it to my azure test instance because the azure compute emulator always runs sites under 127.0.0.1. This is really annoying since each deploy to azure takes 10+ minutes. So my question is, how the heck to people do mobile development on this platform? I've have found some people suggesting I could set up a reverse proxy using fiddler to allow remote connections but so far I haven't been able to get this to work. Is there some sweet ios simulator that I haven't been able to find? Am I missing something?
