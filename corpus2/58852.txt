I have an expression of the form $$q^{-3/2} t^{-7/2}[4qt^2(t + q t^2) + t^2 (q + t) (1 + q t (1 + q t))],$$ I can factor it and write it as $4((qt)^{1/2} + (qt)^{-1/2}) + (qt+1 + (qt)^{-1})((\frac{q}{t})^{1/2} + (\frac{q}{t})^{-1/2}),$ and conclude that it has content $4(1/2,0)\oplus(1,1/2),$ in terms of $SU(2)$ representations. Assuming $f(t,q)$ has the form in which such a rewriting is possible, I want it to express it in the form $\sum_{j_L, j_R}N^{(j_L, j_R)}((qt)^{j_L}+ (qt)^{j_L - 1} + \dots (qt)^{-j_L})((q/t)^{j_R} + \dots + (q/t)^{-j_R}),$ where $(j_L, j_R)$ are half integers or integers. For those of you familiar with representation theory, I want to express this as a sum of characters of representations of $SU(2)$. The rewriting is simple enough to do by hand for easy expressions like above, but I want to do it for longer ones. How can I do it using _Mathematica_?
