I'm thinking about approaching my lecturers in my university for student recommendation for me to hire. So far the emails I sent are not very encouraging. The lecturers either coming back to me, saying that they couldn't get good students, or just ignore my mail. I tried to be as polite as I could in the email, so I think it's not etiquette issue that turn them off. Still, I plan to visit my campus. What are the things I can do to maximize your chances of hitting good programmers in the campus? Any experience you can share?
