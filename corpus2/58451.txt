I'm writing a comprehensive text on graphs and Mathematica and in this context I have this, let's call it, creative gap between sound and graphs. There are plenty of ways one can create graphs from and to objects; meshes, morphological graphs from images, to/from (sparse) matrices, curated data...but how to turn sound into a graph? One could use a discrete Markov process to transition between chords, for example, but I don't see a solution in the other direction. Note, I'm not asking thousand lines of code, just a simple textbook-like example or idea.
