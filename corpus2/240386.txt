I've been working for a while on an app (hobby project) that makes up melodies. Each melody is composed of several phrases (musical sentences, or 'sub-melodies'). Lately I had the idea to allow the user to press a button to 'like' a melody. What this will do is save the phrases composing the melody to a storage. These phrases will be integrated into future melodies. Does this count as machine learning?
