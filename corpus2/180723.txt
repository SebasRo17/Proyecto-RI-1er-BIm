We have an application that we need to ensure that our APPLICATION DATA should not be used (or opened) in different computers with same users. For that we thought about getting harddisk GUID as a part of data encryption private key. In this case raid disks, virtual PCs would fail and wouldn't be able to open the data. We need some advice about how to get a proper id to strict user-per computer but not user-harddisk. Note: Both Mac and Windows supported Edit: it was about application data, but not the application itself. Sorry for wrong asking
