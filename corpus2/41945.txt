I would like to know if it's safe to do batch operations in a list of package files, applying a function like this:               SetAttributes[packStringReplace,HoldRest]     packStringReplace[packPath_String,{replaceRule__}]:=Module[{pack},         pack=Import[packPath,"Text"];         pack=StringReplace[pack,{replaceRule}];         Export[packPath,pack,"Text"]     ]          packs=FileNames["*.m","/packageDirectory",âˆž];     packStringReplace[#,{"text1"->"text2","text3"->"text4"}]&/@packs      Can `Import` and `Export` change something inside pack in some unexpected way? It's safe? Or should I use `ImportString` or another `Import` equivalent? If yes, why? ## Update As pointed by @AlbertRetey in the comments, it's safer do use: `Export[packname,pack,"Text",CharacterEncoding->"ASCII"]` instead of `Export[packPath,pack,"Text"]`
