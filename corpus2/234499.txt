I use to compute primes using linear code which took a long time. As I've an 8 cores processor I thought about multi-threading. At first I use to put a huge number of int in a vector then share the vector between the threads which takeout each number which is not a prime. The first thread processed the 1st/ _nthread_ part, the second processed the 2nd/ _nthread_ and so on. Which leads me to a resource issue due to concurrent access. Then I tried to split the vector in _nthread_ vectors to give one vector to each thread, removing concurrent access issue. But I'm not convinced that it's the best way to do it since processing the primes from 1 to 10 000 is faster than processing primes form 10 001 to 20 000.   * Is there a better way to take profit of the multi-threading ?   * If no, what is the best way to split vectors so the thread would take the same time ?
