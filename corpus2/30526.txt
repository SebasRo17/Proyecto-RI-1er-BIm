If you try resizing or moving the `Inset` in the following interface, the `Graphics` becomes incredibly jerky and borderline unusable.               Graphics[{LightGray, Disk[],       Inset[        Graphics[{Rectangle[]}, ImageSize -> 200,          Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True}]]       }]      Now if I remove `Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True}` the interface (`Drawing Tools`) works fine but a border is added around the `Graphic`               Graphics[{LightGray, Disk[],       Inset[         Graphics[{Rectangle[]},           ImageSize -> 200]]       }]      Is there a way to Shrinkwrap or effectively remove the border without destroying the ability to edit `Graphics`? As an alternative, might there be a way to embed the `Inset` data directly into the `Graphics`. Currently it only serves the purpose of adding an `ImageSize` value to the `Inset` Graphics.
