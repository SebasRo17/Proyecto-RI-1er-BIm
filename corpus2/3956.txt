Say I have a PDF:               PDF[LogNormalDistribution[1.75, 0.65], x]      Calculating it, Mathematica gives me an expression that looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/el6TK.png) I want to extract the equation itself so I can use it in other calculations. On a one off basis, I can do that with `Part[]`:               PDF[LogNormalDistribution[1.75, 0.65], x][[1, 1, 1]]      which gives me the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uzIdI.png) That's fine, but I need something more universal. For instance, for a different PDF that looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QrZ7u.png) I could get what I need with:               %[[1, 2, 1]]       You see my dilemma. How do I extract the business part of such expressions in a more universal way so I can use them in other calculations and functions that may need to deal with a variety of such expressions?
