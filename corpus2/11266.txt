I have a list of time durations, which are strings of the form: `"hh:mm:ss"`. Here's a sample for you to play with:               durations = {"00:09:54", "00:31:24", "00:40:07", "00:11:58", "00:13:51", "01:02:32"}      I want to convert all of these into numbers in seconds, so that I can actually do useful things with this data! How would I go about doing this? There must be some way to get _Mathematica_ to extract the relevant things from each string. Thanks. Edit: I'm surprised that there doesn't seem to be a question related to this already - but it may be that I was using the wrong search terms.
