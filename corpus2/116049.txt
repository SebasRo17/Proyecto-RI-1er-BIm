We waste a lot of time using tool specific terms when we are all really talking about the same things. The problem is that person1 is familiar with toolset1, person2 with toolset2 etc. So each uses a set of terms that they are the most comfortable with and in the end, we end up talking at cross purposes. Has anyone come across this problem in your work place? How did you resolve it? I am asking specifically about development teams here.
