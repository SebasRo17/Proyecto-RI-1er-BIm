How do you correctly or erroneously pronounce programming terms? Any that you find need strict correction or history into the early CS culture? **Programming** `char` = "tchar" not care? `!` = bang not exclamation? `#` = pound not hash? Exception `#!` = shebang `*` = splat not star? `regex` = "rej ex" not "regg ex"? `sql` = "s q l" not "sequel" (already answered, just i.e.) **Unixen** `|` = pipe not vertical bar? `bin` = bin as in pin , not as in binary? `lib` = lib as in library , not as in liberate? `etc` = "ett see" , not "e t c" (as in `/etc` and not "&c") **Annoyance** `/` = slash not backslash `LaTeX` = "laytek" not "lay teks"
