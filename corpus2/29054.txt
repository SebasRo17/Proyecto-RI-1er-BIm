I needed to look at the changes in the values of about 4000 items from one year to the next. I have a table with identifiers and values for each year. Not all of the items are in each list. The tables contain the following rows, with more data to the right. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FVM1i.png)   So I did the following:               govnew = Select[data[[2 ;;, {2, 3, 4, 6}]], #[[4]] > 0 &];       govold = Select[dataold[[2 ;;, {2, 3, 4, 6}]], #[[4]] > 0 &];       intersection = Intersection[govnew[[All, 1]], govold[[All, 1]]];        Clear[both];       Map[(both[#] = 1) &, intersection];       govnew2 = Select[govnew, both[#[[1]]] == 1 &];        govold2 = Select[govold, both[#[[1]]] == 1 &];          Which reduced the two lists to the intersection of the identifiers in both lists. It worked. But it reduces a list of Down Values to a dictionary. Doesn't use a _Mathematica_ function in a secret and powerful way. Is there a more _Mathematica_ like approach.
