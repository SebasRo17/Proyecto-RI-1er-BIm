My question is concerned with the `Graph` functionality, which was newly implemented in Mathematica 8. I already used `GraphPlot` and `LayeredGraphPlot` in the previous versions and in principle appreciate the new capabilities. However, I still wonder if the current implementation is complete. E.g. in the code below, I try to use `VertexCoordinates` for each vertex, which according to the documentation for `Graph`, should work.               vertices1 = {        Property[1, {VertexCoordinates -> {0, 3}, VertexSize -> 0.3}],        Property[2, VertexCoordinates -> {1, 2}],        Property[3, VertexCoordinates -> {3, 3}]      };          Graph[vertices1, {1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3},  GraphLayout -> {"LayeredDrawing", "LayeredLeft"}]      Other Options within `Property`, e.g. `VertexSize`, work correctly. `VertexCoordinates` has no effect whatsoever. `VertexCoordinates` will work as an option for `Graph`, but not as a `Property` for a particular vertex. My other concern relates to `GraphLayout` and in particular to the Suboption `"PackingLayout"`, which also seems to have no influence whatsoever. E.g. if I use `"LayeredDrawing"`, the Suboptions `"LayeredLeft"` or `"LayeredTop"` create the same `Graph`. What is your experience?
