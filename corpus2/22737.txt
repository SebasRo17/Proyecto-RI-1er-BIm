I just combined two lists using this method               molefrac = {1., 0.787402, 0.478927, 0.282592, 0.}     calibrationIndexOfRefraction = {1.440, 1.421, 1.395, 1.380, 1.351}     Partition[Riffle[molefrac, calibrationIndexOfRefraction], 2]      > >     {{1., 1.44}, {0.787402, 1.421}, {0.478927, 1.395}, {0.282592, 1.38}, > {0., 1.351}} >   The purpose of this was to prepare the lists to be plotted using `ListPlot`. Is there some way to use `ListPlot` directly (or something more functional) to do this without going through all the extra steps?
