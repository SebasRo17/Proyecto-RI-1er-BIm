Compared to other serialization languages, one of the main criticisms directed at XML is its verbosity; JSON's more terse and readable for most cases, but not all. But it seems to me that we could cut a lot of the excess from XML simply by stripping away the names from the closing tags. With proper indentation readability shouldn't be an issue (it should be an improvement, if you ask me), and since they're not structurally required any decent XML editor/viewer could easily be made to strip/hide or add them. **As such, the two formats should be completely equivalent and interchangeable.** Compare the following (source taken from http://www.w3schools.com/xml/simple.xml):               <breakfast_menu>         <food>             <name>Belgian Waffles</name>             <price>$5.95</price>             <description>                         Two of our famous Belgian Waffles with plenty of real maple syrup             </description>             <calories>650</calories>         </food>         <food>             <name>Strawberry Belgian Waffles</name>             <price>$7.95</price>             <description>                         Light Belgian waffles covered with strawberries and whipped cream             </description>             <calories>900</calories>         </food>         <food>             <name>Berry-Berry Belgian Waffles</name>             <price>$8.95</price>             <description>                         Light Belgian waffles covered with an assortment of fresh berries and whipped cream             </description>             <calories>900</calories>         </food>         <food>             <name>French Toast</name>             <price>$4.50</price>             <description>                         Thick slices made from our homemade sourdough bread             </description>             <calories>600</calories>         </food>         <food>             <name>Homestyle Breakfast</name>             <price>$6.95</price>             <description>                         Two eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and our ever-popular hash browns             </description>             <calories>950</calories>         </food>     </breakfast_menu>      and               <breakfast_menu>         <food>             <name>Belgian Waffles</>             <price>$5.95</>             <description>                             Two of our famous Belgian Waffles with plenty of real maple syrup             </>             <calories>650</>         </>         <food>             <name>Strawberry Belgian Waffles</>             <price>$7.95</>             <description>                             Light Belgian waffles covered with strawberries and whipped cream             </>             <calories>900</>         </>         <food>             <name>Berry-Berry Belgian Waffles</>             <price>$8.95</>             <description>                             Light Belgian waffles covered with an assortment of fresh berries and whipped cream             </>             <calories>900</>         </>         <food>             <name>French Toast</>             <price>$4.50</>             <description>                             Thick slices made from our homemade sourdough bread             </>             <calories>600</>         </>         <food>             <name>Homestyle Breakfast</>             <price>$6.95</>             <description>                             Two eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and our ever-popular hash browns             </>             <calories>950</>         </>     </>
