Suppose that I have two plots (e.g., `Plot`, `ListPlot`, etc) that cover two regions of space. I would like to display them "stacked" vertically, so that they align nicely in publication-quality form. Suppose that I am dealing with `ListPlot` and I have the following data:               xdata = Range[0, 2 Pi, 0.2];     ydata1 = Sin[xdata];     ydata2 = 1 + Sin[xdata];      So for plot1, I will plot `Transpose[{xdata, ydata1}]`; for plot2, I will plot `Transpose[{xdata, ydata2}]` (both using `ListPlot`). Plot1 covers both negative and positive $y$ values, whereas plot2 covers only positive $y$ values; this fact will be important later. For both plots, I will use `BaseStyle -> {18, FontFamily -> "Arial"}` so that the labels are large and legible. I will also use `Frame -> True` and will include frame labels with `FrameLabel -> {"x (Meter)", "y (Meter)"}`. Now if I do the following...               plot1 = ListPlot[Transpose[{xdata, ydata1}], Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {"x (Meter)", "y (Meter)"},        BaseStyle -> {18, FontFamily -> "Arial"}, PlotStyle -> Red, ImageSize -> 375]          plot2 = ListPlot[Transpose[{xdata, ydata2}], Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {"x (Meter)", "y (Meter)"},        BaseStyle -> {18, FontFamily -> "Arial"}, PlotStyle -> Blue, ImageSize -> 375]      ...I get the following... ![Image1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/40AKD.png) Notice that above, the frames are not aligned. To fix this, I can specify the same `ImagePadding` for both plots...               plot1 = ListPlot[Transpose[{xdata, ydata1}], Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {"x (Meter)", "y (Meter)"},        BaseStyle -> {18, FontFamily -> "Arial"}, PlotStyle -> Red, ImageSize -> 375,       ImagePadding -> {{70, 10}, {55, 10}}]          plot2 = ListPlot[Transpose[{xdata, ydata2}], Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {"x (Meter)", "y (Meter)"},        BaseStyle -> {18, FontFamily -> "Arial"}, PlotStyle -> Blue, ImageSize -> 375,       ImagePadding -> {{70, 10}, {55, 10}}]      ...which gives me the following output... ![Image2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hAIjv.png) Now the frames are nicely aligned. **_However_** , the $y$ axis frame labels are not aligned. This is because plot1 includes negative $y$ values in addition to positive ones, and the negative signs "push away" the $y$ axis frame label (i.e., `"y (Meter)"`) in plot1. So, **_my question is:_** is it possible to somehow align the $y$ axis frame labels? Apparently, `ImagePadding` does not do the trick for that particular issue. Thanks for your time.
