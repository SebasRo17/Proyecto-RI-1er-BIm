I'm sure many developers have faced this scenario: you're currently negotiating a new position at a company and you're going through the whole list (salary, perks, benefits, etc), but there's _always_ something missing. In my 8 years of professional work, not once have I seen a clause on ergonomics or injury prevention. I'm talking about providing an ergonomic chair, keyboard or even a stand for your LCD. I have a bad upper back and neck which I need to go see the chiropractor every week. I always make sure there's a least a good chiropractic plan in the contract, but that's just fixing the problem's surface. My chiropractor is telling me that my neck is straightening (not good) and that I should try to prevent bad ergonomics in the workplace to stop it. I'm at a point in my career where I'm in high demand and can make some reasonable demands myself. I have asked several companies in the past to procure me a better chair (Herman Miller, Humanscale, etc) or keyboard (Microsoft Ergonomic) or even an LCD stand, to which I normally get chuckled at. There is no doubt that this profession is ruining my neck/back, but good luck trying to pin this on any specific (or even collective) company for their lack of ergonomics. My question is, how do you approach the subject? Has anyone been successful in the past? Do you do on the contract or wait until you're in the company, then ask? How do you make sure the company hold's their end of the deal? Any suggestions and opinions would be greatly appreciated.
