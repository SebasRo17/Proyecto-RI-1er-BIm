I was reading this blog by James Bennett regarding HTML vs XHTML . He writes : > I don’t have any need for namespaced content; I’m not displaying any complex > mathematical notation here and don’t plan to, and I don’t use SVG for any > images. So that’s one advantage of XHTML out the window. I also don’t have > any need for XML tools; all the processing I need to do can be handled by > HTML-parsing libraries like BeautifulSoup. That’s the other advantage gone. What does he mean by `namespaced content` and what advantage does it provide us ?
