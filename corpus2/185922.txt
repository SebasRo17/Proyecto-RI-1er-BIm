scenario: I have an entity called `Member`. Members fall into multiple types. Some types are below.   * `Supporter`   * `Volunteer`   * `Sponsor`   * `Player` I can create class for each type and inherit from the base `Member` entity. But when a `Member` has more than 1 type in a given time, it is not the right way. can I use **decorator pattern** to achieve this intent? Or what the best pattern to get this work? **EDIT :** Language I use is C# Also different Member types can have additional methods, for example, `Sponsor` can have its own methods as `Donate()`, Or the `Volunteer` can have a method `Subscribe()` and so on. these thing have to be considered.
