I get stuck each time I need to write a constructor for any class I design. The reason is that I am not sure what should go into a constructor and what should not. On googling for this, I got the answer that the constructor need to do only as much as to make sure that the opbect created is valid. But my query is > How do you know if an object is in the valid state? My class represents a chess board:               public class ChessBoard     {         List<ICellRow> lstRow;         int cellOffset;              //Other function              public ChessBoard()         {             //What should go in here?         }     }      How do you decide when a class has the minimum information to be in the valid state? In this specific example, makes the board class valid?
