Trying to make most of the GAE Datastore entities concept, but some doubts drill my head. Say I have the model:               class User(ndb.Model):         email = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=True)         password = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=False)         first_name = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=False)         last_name = ndb.StringProperty(indexed=False)         created_at = ndb.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)              @classmethod         def key(cls, email):             return ndb.Key(User, email)              @classmethod         def Add(cls, email, password, first_name, last_name):             user = User(parent=cls.key(email),                         email=email,                         password=password,                         first_name=first_name,                         last_name=last_name)             user.put()             UserLogin.Record(email)               class UserLogin(ndb.Model):         time = ndb.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)              @classmethod         def Record(cls, user_email):             login = UserLogin(parent=User.key(user_email))             login.put()      And I need to keep track of times of successful login operations. Each time user logs in, an `UserLogin.Record()` method will be executed. Now the question — do I make it right? Thanks. * * * ### EDIT 2 Ok, used the typed arguments, but then it raised this: `Expected Key instance, got User(key=Key('User', 5418393301680128), created_at=datetime.datetime(2013, 6, 27, 10, 12, 25, 479928), email=u'al@mail.com', first_name=u'First', last_name=u'Last', password=u'password')`. It's clear to understand, but I don't get why the docs are misleading? They implicitly propose to use:               # Set Employee as Address entity's parent directly...     address = Address(parent=employee)      But Model expects key. And what's worse the `parent=user.key()` swears that `key()` isn't callable. And I found out the `user.key` works. * * * ### EDIT 1 After reading the example form the docs and trying to replicate it — I got type error: `TypeError('Model constructor takes no positional arguments.')`. This is the exacto code used:               user = User('al@mail.com', 'password', 'First', 'Last')     user.put()          stamp = UserLogin(parent=user)     stamp.put()      I understand that Model was given the wrong argument, BUT why it's in the docs?
