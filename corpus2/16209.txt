I was wondering if anyone could give me a hand with this problem I have. I have six points on a plane, and I am trying to determine if they form a circle or not. I know that any three points in 2D can determine a circle as long as the three points don't all lie on the same line. The way I figured that problem was taking two points, finding the line that connects them, finding the midpoint of that segment and then finding a perpendicular to the segment at that point. I do that with two segments and the intersection of the perpendicular lines that I find intersect at the center of the circle. When I follow the steps for the points I have in 3D, _Mathematica_ "gets stuck" when I ask it to find the equation of the line with the slope and the two points I give it (because the points have 3 coordinates and not two like in 2D). Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you,
