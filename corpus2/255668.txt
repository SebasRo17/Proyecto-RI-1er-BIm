I have huge PDF files which are in booklet format. example, Assume a booklet pdf file has 24 pages which each page contains 2 pages which is in two sides - left side and right side. The first page has 48th page number on the left side and 1st page number on the right side The second page has 2nd page number on the left side and 47th page number on the right side The third page has 46th page number on the left side and 3rd page number on the right side I have vertically cut the Booket PDF files in to separate individual PDF files using bulk operation in separate folder. for example, the cutted PDF file will be as follows in the above case 1st pdf file - 48th page 2nd pdf file - 1st page 3rd pdf file - 2nd page 4th pdf file - 47th page 5th pdf file - 46th page 6th pdf file - 3rd page.. Similarly for other PDF files too....if a PDF file has 95 pages.... the first page has 95th page number on the left side and 1st page number on the right side Now the issue is how to rename and arrange the files correctly in the sequence for EACH PDF file so that we can merge the PDF file as one at last for each PDF file... After renaming correctly in the proper sequence for the above file 1st pdf file should point to 1st page 2nd pdf file should point to 2nd page 3rd pdf file should point to 3rd page... The problem is all the PDF files which we are planning to split will have different set of pages..example PDF1 file - has 48 pages as above -> files should be renamed and arranged as 1, 2, 3, 4...48 correctly PDF2 file - has 96 pages -> files should be renamed and arranged as 1, 2, 3, 4.....96 correctly PDF3 file - has 56 pages -> files should be renamed and arranged as 1, 2, 3, 4.....56 correctly After renaming, the final file will be as follows 1st pdf file - should be pointed to 1st page..i.e 2nd pdf file name should be renamed as 1st pdf file 2nd pdf file - should be pointed to 2nd page i.e 3rd pdf file name should be renamed to 2nd pdf file 3rd pdf file - should be pointed to 3rd page i.e 6th pdf file name should be renamed to 3rd pdf file Could someone help me with a program which will rename the vertically cutted files in a proper sequence?? Thanks in advance.
