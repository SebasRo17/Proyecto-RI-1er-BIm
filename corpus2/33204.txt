While helping a user who mistakenly thought that `log` rather than `Log` was the correct built-in function name, I included a gently-worded suggestion of a "RTFM" approach to learning basics such as that built-in function names begin with upper-case letters (or possibly `$`). Then I tried to determine where in the Documentation Center one in fact finds such basics. Where, indeed? And how would a rank beginner come across it? I tried some obvious places:   * the Get Started button, but that takes you to an on-line video touting all the things that Mathematica can do;   * The Core Language > Language Overview, but that didn't help;   * The Core Language > Mathematica Syntax, but that didn't mention it. Etc. Is something very basic missing from the docs? (I note that there are a couple of videos at the Video and Screencasts pages of the Learning Resources section on the Wolfram web site that do mention the upper-case requirement, along with using square-brackets to enclose arguments, etc. But these are not something a new user might encounter right at the start. Indeed, even once one gets to the Video and Screencasts pages it's not obvious where to start to obtain such basics.)
