I have some windows c++ code (pure winapi c++, no MFC etc) that I would like to build a GUI for. My code does not know about windows GUI, it is completely decoupled from any type of UI. The question: How could I build a UI around the existing code. Ideally, I am imagining something like this: GUI <\--> Mediator <\--> MyExistingCode For example, `MyExistingCode.showmsg(char* msg)` would call `Mediator.MessageBox(0, 0, msg, 0);` I'm stuck at how to design the Mediator class (If that is the correct way of going about this). Is the Mediator an Interface?, Abstract Class?, Other? Is an MVC model the best way to go?
