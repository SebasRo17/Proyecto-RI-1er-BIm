Is it a good practice to call the variable a method returns with a variable name `result`? For instance:               public Zorglub calculate() {         Zorglub result = [...]         [...]         return result;     }      Or should I name it by its type?               public Zorglub calculate() {         Zorglub zorglub = [...]         [...]         return zorglub;     }      I have seen both in the wild, if I need to choose one what reasons could make me prefer the former or latter (or any better name)? I am mainly thinking about Java.
