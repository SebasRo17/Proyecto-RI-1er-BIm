Probably many of you receive hundreds/thousands of e-mail every week. This happens especially when you are part of wide distribution lists. How do you find the relevant ones? Do you use any _smart_ plugins (for Outlook)? Until now I tried:   1. Sorting them in folders but it failed because then I got into folder overload   2. Making rules. Fails especially when doing text matching because is not taking into account the context.
