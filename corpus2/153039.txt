I was wondering about the risks involved with hosting on Microsoft CodePlex and Google Code. Let's say I host a project on one of them and it ends up taking off and getting tons of downloads. I was wondering if it is possible (or maybe has already happened) for either Microsoft or Google to rebrand the project and turn it into closed-source? The reason I ask is because Microsoft and Google are multi-billion dollar companies and your average lawyer would have to be crazy to try and fight them.
