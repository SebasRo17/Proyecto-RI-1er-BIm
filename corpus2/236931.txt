I'm trying to program a very basic FLAC player using 100% C# completely from scratch. My understanding of this type of thing is very limited, so I'm using this project as a way to learn about compression and decompression. I'm a computer science and math major currently in university, so I'm not adverse to learning whatever math may be involved. I've looked up the format specifications on xiph.org and I understand how the headers and all are structured, but I can't seem to find a concise explanation of how the audio compression works. How do I go about converting the frames to pcm? Sadly, my knowledge of C/C++ is extremely limited, as I only have experience with Java and C#. As such, trying to navigate the c++ code already out there is not a great starting point. I looked at FlacBox and learned quite a bit from it, but it's barely commented at all and I am lost trying to figure out how the conversion from flac to pcm works. So what should I read as far as math goes so I can get started with this? Where can I find a basic algorithm for converting the audio frames to wav? Thanks.
