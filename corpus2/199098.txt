I'm almost brand new to programming, but have a fairly strong background in mathematics (primarily algebra and logic -- e.g. universal algebra). I've always heard that there is a strong relationship between math and programming, but the intro programming books I've looked at don't seem to emphasise it. For reference, I started with Java, since that's what I need to be able to use for a job I'm at this summer. I imagine that most authors of these resources assume that if you don't don't have a programming background, then you won't have a math background. It makes sense to me though to use the background in math that I have to help the learning process. All that being said, are there any resources out there for a new programmer (hopefully related to Java) that also reference the mathematical concepts that are being introduced? Perhaps explaining things with analogies to math? Apologies if this question isn't appropriate. I tried searching for such a resource, or an answer to this question on this site already, but have had no luck.
