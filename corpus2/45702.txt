Given a list of (frencuently repeated and unsorted) pairs `{Mode, SubMode}` I want to form the list `{ {COUNT_mode1, COUNT_mode2,...,COUNT_modeN}, {COUNT_mode1_submode1, COUNT_mode1,submode2, ... , COUNT_mdoe1,submodeM1, ... ,COUNT_modeN_submodeNM}, {mode1,mode2,...}, {submode1,submode2,...} }` Here is an example, given:               l = { {"games","minecraft"},{"games","minecraft"},{"games","WoW"}, {"books","book1"},{"books","book1"},{"books","book1"},{"books","book5"},{"other","something"},{"other","book1"}}          MyFunction[l] -->      {         {3,4,2},         {2,1,3,1,1,1},         {"games","books","other"},         {"minecraft","WoW","book1","book5","something","book1"}     }
