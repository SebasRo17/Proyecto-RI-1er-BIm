I am making software for recovering Shift+Delete files from Windows. I know when files are deleted only links to them are cut off by Windows but the actual file remains there at the same place, so recovering them would require myself to search hard-drive or specifically a particular drive. I installed the code on an old computer with Windows Millennium Edition and works. How can I make it workable for Windows 7?? Are there any API's or references for this that will be helpful?
