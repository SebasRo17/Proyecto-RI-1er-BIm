We have been working with a shopping cart for DotNetNuke, and have had endless problems with the developer's releases of their product. Every release fixes one thing but new bugs pop up elsewhere. I know that bugs are inevitable and that we cannot squash all of them at the time, but can someone please tell me what percentage of bugs should be stamped out before a product can be accepted as a stable release?
