I can find several Emacs libraries for _Mathematica_ , but I'm not aware of a clear favourite, a definitive list, or of a library which is actively maintained and developed. None of these appear to be in the Emacs Lisp Package Archive or Milkypostmanâ€™s Emacs Lisp Package Archive.   * http://www.watson.org/~mccann/mathematica.el   * https://github.com/Leockard/elisp   * http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/4567/   * http://www.itwm.fhg.de/as/asemployees/wichmann/mma.html   * http://chasen.org/~daiti-m/dist/math++.el I have been using the first one on the list for a while, but the indentation engine is not ideal. What do people use for editing _Mathematica_ source code in Emacs? I'm just talking about editing source code; I don't need to evaluate _Mathematica_ expressions in a subsidiary kernel process, etc. The important features for me are   * indentation,   * syntax-highlighting,   * forward/backward/up/down in _Mathematica_ bracketed expressions. Additional "IDE" features would be very welcome, especially imenu support.
