I noticed that a lot of GitHub accounts only have repositories which are forked from other accounts. In addition the people who do this usually don't make any contributions to the forked repositories. I've heard of people collecting stamps and seashells, but why would anybody want to collect repositories? Personally I would only fork a repository if I wanted to make some changes to it.
