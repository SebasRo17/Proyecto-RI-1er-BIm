I am trying to solve:               Exp[-a Exp[-x/b] - c Exp[-x/d]] == Y      to x, and using the command               Solve [Exp[-a Exp[-x/b] - c Exp[-x/d]] == Y, x]      Mathematica says me that it can't do it: > "Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve". I believed the problem was in introducing the terms or constants b and d, and maybe adding the assumptions that there are constants or parameters larger than 0 it works. But I see that solve doesn't accept Assumptions as parameters. Than trying to put any set of constants (example: 1,2,3,4) for a, b, c and d I got the same error. Somebody can help me to understand why it not works and how to solve this equation? Thank you very much.
