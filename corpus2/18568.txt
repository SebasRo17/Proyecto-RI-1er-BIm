I want to calculate the volume of fill required to level an area about the size of three foodball fields. The Department of Public Works in my city can provide me with topo data for the area. Their request form lists ArcView shapefile, AutoCAD.dwg, Geodatabase, and "other" data file formats, and JPEG, TIFF, and PDF map file formats. What kind(s) of files should I ask for? How do I calculate the volume of data required for an area I'm interested in? I don't know anything about this stuff. I would also like to estimate the number of trees, associated carbon dioxide sequestration, etc. for the area, and other things related to the wildlife in the area (based on some assumptions relevant to my area and the type of vegetation in the area). This additional question may not really be a _Mathematica_ question, but if there is something relevant in _Mathematica_ 's curated data, I would appreciate suggestions.
