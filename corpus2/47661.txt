I came across a behavior that doesn't make sense to me when I tried to use Exists in Reduce. If I run commands:               l = {a0, a1, x};     Reduce[Exists[l , a1 != 0 && a0 + a1 x == 0 && a1 < 0], Reals]      I get output:               a1 < 0 && a0 == -a1 x      But if I run command:               Reduce[Exists[{a0, a1, x} , a1 != 0 && a0 + a1 x == 0 && a1 < 0], Reals]      I get output:               True      I think the problem is in exists part:               Exists[l, a1 != 0 && a0 + a1 x == 0 && a1 < 0]      Gives output               a1 != 0 && a0 + a1 x == 0 && a1 < 0      And               Exists[{a0, a1, x} , a1 != 0 && a0 + a1 x == 0 && a1 < 0]      Gives output (which I think is correct):               \!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(\[Exists]\), \({a0, a1, x}\)]\((a1 != 0 && a0 + a1\ x == 0 && a1 < 0)\)\)      Can somebody explain what is going on there and how could I use variable in Exists if this not the correct way?
