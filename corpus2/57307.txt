When i write something like f(x_0) in traditional form mm puts white space around the index, so that especially the distance to the end parenthesis looks weird. In mm 9 I could reduce the issue by putting a 'negative space' (esc - space space) after the index. But in mm 10 this suddenly looks even weirder with the end parenthesis going through the index. It can be fixed by using af smaller negative space and add a space afterwards as seen on the image below. My students use both versions, so I wonder if there is a way to make it look the same regardless of which version of mm is used to view a notebook?
