The figure below is made by MATLAB. However, the scientific form of numbers in `FrameTicks` that how MATLAB deals with is quite different from that of _Mathematica._ ![MATLAB plots with nice ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9YfBV.png) By default, I plot the second figure based on the same data in a _Mathematica_ way. ![Mathematica plots](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tan6p.png) However, what is messy in the second figure is the overused ZERO in the vertical axis. So my first question is how to transform the number on the `FrameTicks` into some suitable scientific form. Well, after we transform them into scientific form, my second question arises: how to make the plot in the MATLAB way? For example, if one of the frame ticks is 2*10^-4, I hope to put only 2 on the vertical axis and 10^-4 on the left top of the figure (Like the first one in the second column in the first figure). I think we can test the idea based on               Plot[10^5 * Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, Frame -> True]      I think I can solve this problem in a stupid way: multiply/divide every number on the frame ticks by some number _x_ , then place a graphics object of text which writes _x_ to the left top side of the figure. But really what I need is a general way to do that. Any help will be appreciated.
