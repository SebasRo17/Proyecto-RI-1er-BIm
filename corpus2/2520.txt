I am doing a little project to demonstrate something:               a = 2; b = 5000;      d = 10000; l1 = {};       rc := RandomChoice[{a, b} -> {0, 1}]     c = 1; While[c <= d, AppendTo[l1, rc];c++]      e = ((Count[l1, _] - Count[l1, 0])/d)*100//N      f = 100 - e      I want to insert two InputFields for the values of A and B, but I want it to re-evaluate the rest of the cell whenever I input new values for A and B - I'm also curious for A or B. **Note** - Inserting the inputfields is not my problem, my problems is only the reevaluation of the cell after some event.
