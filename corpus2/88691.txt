Jeff Atwood recently wrote a blog post about Netflix's implementation of a "Chaos Monkey". It is a very high level article. I am curious if anyone has actually implemented this technique for testing a system. I guess what Im really trying to ask is: What strategies do you implement to ensure your architecture can survive a part of the system crashing ?
