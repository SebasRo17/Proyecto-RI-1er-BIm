I have been using the built-in function `Table` for some computations. (The following is not an actual representation of the equations I am using). $$\text{Table}[f[k]=g[k],\{k,1,10\}]$$ However, the assignment $f[k]=g[k]$ is not true for one $k$ value, say $k=6$. That is, say, $g[k]=k^2+1$ for $k\neq 6$ and $g[6]=1$ (when $k=6$). I can then break the table into two parts: $\{k,1,5\}$ and $\{k,7,10\}$. Is there any other (more efficient) way of doing this?
