Quoting The Evolution of Haskell Programmer, > graduate education tends to liberate one from petty concerns about, e.g., > the efficiency of hardware-based integers What exactly does this suggest?   Is it that after graduation, one gets more interested in abstract ideas so much that he does not think hardware is relevant? Or that hardware is also abstracted and one is more interested in algorithms? I am trying to understand on what grounds the sentence is based.
