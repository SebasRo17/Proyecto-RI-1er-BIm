So I feel kind of stupid having to ask this but tomorrow I have a phone interview with a good company. Phone interviews themselves not a big deal for me, but having to tell them my salary expectations is. The position that I'm applying for is a mid-level software engineer, I fit all of the requirements (I'm not overly qualified by any means), and I want to be sure I'm not asking for an amount that would be absurd or too little. Now, assuming I get a second interview and have to complete some sort of puzzle/code/work, they may pay me +/- whatever I asked for based upon their evaluation of my work. What I'd like to know, is what is a good amount to ask for? Or am I completely wrong with my assumptions? Either way some advice would be much appreciated!
