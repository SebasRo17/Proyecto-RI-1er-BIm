So I've been working on a small, small side project to learn a bit more about PHP database interactions. I bought a small, cheap database of "Inspirational Stories" and set to work on turning it into a web site that no one will ever remember. :P I've worked out a number of issues so far and learned a fair bit, however, one issue that I can't seem to pinpoint is issues with entities. I'm not entirely sure if this issue is arising from the initial database encoding, or perhaps I'm pulling in the data wrong from the database, or something... I'm not quite sure what's wrong, and on top of it, I don't really know how to pinpoint it. For an example of what I mean, see here. Any hints or clues on this would be appreciated. I'm not even sure if I'm using the correct terminology here.
