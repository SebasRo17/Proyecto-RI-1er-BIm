I've recently been asked to design a video player for the iPad. I've never done one before and I'm wondering if I could get some caveats in terms of it's development and design. Are there areas of building a video player that are particularly buggy or troublesome? What part of building one takes the most time? Generally speaking I'm just trying to get a feel of what will be the difficult part and what I'm about to get into. Thanks
