Today, I found the Euler Project. Problem #2 is > Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous > two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: >   >   >      1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... >   > > By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not > exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. I have two solutions:               For[i = 1, i < 100, i++, If[Fibonacci[i] > 4000000, Break[]]];     Plus @@ Select[Fibonacci /@ Range[i - 1], Mod[#, 2] == 0 &]      > 4613732               Plus @@ Select[     Fibonacci /@ Select[Range@100, Fibonacci@# < 4000000 &],      Mod[#1, 2] == 0 &]      > 4613732 However, I feel my solutions are not good and efficient. So my question is: can you show me more concise and efficient methods? Also, how cam I test whether a number is a Fibonacci numberï¼Ÿ
