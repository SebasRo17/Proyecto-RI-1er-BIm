We are continually revamping our front end developer test that we do in-house after a candidate has passed an online test. The online test has questions such as:   * How does a for loop start?   * What is the correct way to write a JavaScript array?   * Write the css selector for the 3rd list item within an ordered list with the id "myList"   * For var shoppingList = ["milk", "dumplings", "bread"]; - how would you return dumplings into a variable named groceryItem?   * FizzBuzz So we cover the basics, and try to get an insight into their knowledge. But, in house, we really want to test their problem solving skills, their logic approach, etc. And I don't think we've found a good way to do that for front end developers. For UI guys, it's easier - we give them a design challenge and a white board and see if they ask for more information, how they approach the problem, etc. But we haven't found a way to replicate this approach with web developers (for the record, I am one of the web developers on the team) Thoughts on how to approach?
