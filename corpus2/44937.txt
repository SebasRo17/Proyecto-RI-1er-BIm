I have a set of xyz data points. X and Y are coordinates of a regular grid of 10x10 units, Z is the independent variable. I am trying to calculate the volume under the set of points, using Riemann sum. I have used two approaches that I expected to produce the same result, and on the contrary, produce very different results. In the first approach I make a sum of the volumes of the prism formed by every point. In the second approach I make an interpolation function with an interpolation order of 0, and then integrate it. Here is a MWE of the code I'm using:               Data = {{{230, 310}, 0.4434}, {{230, 320}, 0.5078}, {{230, 330},      0.6000}, {{230, 340}, 0.6430}, {{230, 350}, 0.6724}, {{230, 360},      0.7204}, {{230, 370}, 0.7593}, {{230, 380}, 0.7987}, {{230, 390},      0.8908}, {{230, 400}, 1.0175}, {{230, 410}, 1.1136}, {{230, 420},      1.2342}, {{230, 430}, 1.3375}, {{230, 440}, 1.4055}, {{230, 450},      1.3979}, {{240, 310}, 0.4593}, {{240, 320}, 0.3963}, {{240, 330},      0.3985}, {{240, 340}, 0.3877}, {{240, 350}, 0.4262}, {{240, 360},      0.4763}, {{240, 370}, 0.5465}, {{240, 380}, 0.6163}, {{240, 390},      0.7376}, {{240, 400}, 0.8567}, {{240, 410}, 0.9769}, {{240, 420},      1.1350}, {{240, 430}, 1.2960}, {{240, 440}, 1.4032}, {{240, 450},      1.4310}, {{250, 310}, 0.5866}, {{250, 320}, 0.4513}, {{250, 330},      0.3789}, {{250, 340}, 0.3360}, {{250, 350}, 0.3273}, {{250, 360},      0.3526}, {{250, 370}, 0.4068}, {{250, 380}, 0.4520}, {{250, 390},      0.5269}, {{250, 400}, 0.6071}, {{250, 410}, 0.6807}, {{250, 420},      0.7808}, {{250, 430}, 0.8794}, {{250, 440}, 0.9572}, {{250, 450},      0.9682}};          Total[Data[[All, 2]]*100]          Integrate[Interpolation[Data, InterpolationOrder -> 0][x, y], {x, 230, 250}, {y, 310, 450}]      The first approach yields a volume of 3377.73, and the second one of 1918.94. Can someone explain the reason for this difference? Or which one is more appropriate for the purpose of estimating a volume? Any help will be very much appreciated.
