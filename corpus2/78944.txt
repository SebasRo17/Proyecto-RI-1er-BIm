This is a cousin to the question Programming with Speech Recognition for Typing Instead of the Keyboard: I program in Visual Studio 2010, and I find that programming takes a much greater toll on my hands than typing text does. I attribute this to (1) the extensive use of punctuation and other characters away from the home row, and (2) the extensive use of multi-key command such as Ctrl+Shift+B. So a question in three stages:   1. What programming language is "easiest" to type? BASIC? COBOL?   2. What editor/IDE is easiest (from a typing standpoint) for the edit/compile/execute roundtrip (and perhaps debugging)?    3. Is there a combined solution that's powerful enough to create, say, a web application? Ideally I'd like to hear about ideas for completely mouse-free solutions, compatible with (say) a one-handed chording keyboard.
