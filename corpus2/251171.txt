Specifically, what is contained inside code coverage data (.nccov or xml file) and how is an html report generated by this? Does the coverage data not include the actual percentage of code covered? Is this only generated when the report is made from the coverage data? Is the coverage data sort of a guideline for the reporting process? Do coverage files need access to assemblies to create a report?
