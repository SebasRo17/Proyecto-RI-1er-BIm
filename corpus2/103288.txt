The story is like this: I was hired under a work-for-hire contract that didn't specify what the pay is going to be. I was told it would be on the 15th of every month, depending on what work was completed. On the 15th of the first month, I was told it was going to be at the end of the project. Then the project got halted (required client response on some matter). Then another project was given to me, one that would take at least two months to complete. Few weeks after that, I have told the boss that I will refuse to do any work until at least a partial payment is made. I got fired and got promised a lawsuit. We're in different countries. He's from US. Contract doesn't have his signature in original, in my country this would render it invalid. There are a few questions here, the main one is how to handle this from this point forward? Maybe you could give me some advice to avoid this in the future? Does this lawsuit have any chances to be taken seriously?
