I am an author of project, that consists of two parts: daemon and library. I want to license library under BSD License (or MIT, will decide later), and daemon under GPLv3. I want to permit the library to be linked into closed-source products, but I want daemon to be GPL, as it uses GPL code heavily, and I do not want its commercial forks. The thing is: This library just provides client interface for the daemon, where daemon acts just like sort of server. Is it permitted to license my project using separate licenses for different parts of my project, linked with some sort of RPC protocol?
