I am trying to install Mathematica 9 on a Ubuntu 13.10 system. I had this working on my previous 13.04 version but now it breaks on when trying to unpack the sh archive:               $ sh Mathematica_9.0.0_LINUX.sh     Mathematica Secured 9.0.0 for LINUX Installer Archive          Verifying archive integrity.      Extracting installer. ...........................................................................     /home/stefan/Downloads/.3719     CRITICAL FAILURE: Fundamental Error      Installer text not found.      sudo sh ... produces same error, the md5 hash checks out ok. Anybody encountered this problem, and more to the point, figured out what is wrong? I submitted a ticket to Wolfram support but no luck there so far. Thanks for any ideas to try.
