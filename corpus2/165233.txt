I'm reading up on event sourcing and have a question regarding persistence. I can still have a DB with all entities, right? Or should the events be replayed every time the application is started to get the latest version of each entity in the memory? Seems like a waste on larger systems (as in large amount of data)? The point with event sourcing is that I can can replay the events to populate a data store if required? (or analyze the data)
