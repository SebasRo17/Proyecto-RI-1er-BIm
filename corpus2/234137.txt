I have the following program: Iterate `x` from 1 to `N`. Check to see if `x` is prime. If it is, add it to a list of primes. The way I check to see if it is prime is iterating through the current list of primes, and seeing if they can divide `x` evenly. What is the order analysis of this program? I don't think it is `O(n^2)`, because the growing list of primes certainly doesn't increase at the rate of `n`. I don't it is `O(nlog(n))`, either. How would I perform order analysis of the function?
