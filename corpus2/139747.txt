My understanding of a primitive datatype is that > It is a datatype provided by a language implicitly (Others are user defined > classes) So different languages have different sets of datatypes which are considered primitive for that particular language. Is that right? And what is the difference between a "basic datatype" and "built-in datatype". Wikipedia says a primitive datatype is either of the two. **PS - Why is "string" type considered as a primitive type in SNOBOL4 and not in Java ?**
