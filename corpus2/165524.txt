I am looking for a strategy to version an application with the following requirements. My requirements are given an exe with version number (major.minor.build- number) 1) I want to map the version to a svn source revision that made the exe 2) With the source and exe I should be able to attach and debug in vs2010 with no issue. 3) Once I check-out the source code for the exe I should be able to build the exe again with the version number without having to make any changes to a file.
