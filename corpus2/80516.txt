I have been given the task of implementing some QA testing into a massive existing system. We're going to start out with system-level tests and might add unit tests if it is deemed necessary. I don't really know where to start. I'm thinking of creating a new project in the main solution dedicated entirely to QA testing. From there, I'll just add system-level NUnit tests that can be run automatically from that project. How does that sound? I want to make sure that I make the right decisions now so that the QA system doesn't get messy and overly complicated in the future. Since it will be running alongside a big system, I anticipate that it too will grow to be a big system, which makes it vulnerable to becoming a cumbersome mess of code. Any suggestions would be great!
