In _Mathematica_ 8.0 and older, there are two ways to select cells based on cell tags.               NotebookLocate["CellTag"];     NotebookGet[EvaluationNotebook[]]      and               NotebookFind[EvaluationNotebook[], "CellTag", All, CellTags, AutoScroll -> False];     NotebookGet[EvaluationNotebook[]]      When executing either of these the user selection becomes modified. By manually extracting the cells from the notebook, the user selection is not modified. Therefore, you could run `NotebookGet` in some type of a loop or in another user interface without messing with user's interactions. Now `NotebookGet[EvaluationNotebook[]]` holds the Notebook data. So how can I extract cells as if I had run one of the commands above using `NotebookGet[EvaluationNotebook[]]`? **EDIT:** Here is a working solution http://pastebin.com/mvFPqvVY
