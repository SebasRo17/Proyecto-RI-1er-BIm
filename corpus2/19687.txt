I am trying to use CellPrint to print a cell that asks a user to solve an equation. This equation is randomly generated right beforehand, and I would like to have it print in Blue. The whole Cell should be in the "Section" style. Here is my first attempt:               equat = ToString[     Expand[Product[(x - RandomInteger[{-10, 10}]), {i,        3 + RandomInteger[]}]], TraditionalForm];     CellPrint[     Cell[TextData[     RowBox[{StyleBox["Solve the equation "],        StyleBox[equat, FontColor -> Blue]}]], "Section"]];      This does in fact create the cell, and the last part is blue, but it is hindered by the TraditionalForm "markup": I won't put any color here, but the command above gives the output               Solve the equation \!\(TraditionalForm\`\(x\^4 - \(\(73\ x\^2\)\) - \(\(72\ x\)\)\)\)      Is there a simple way to fix this? I have tried using ToBoxes, but then I don't see how to color the output Blue. Any tips or pointers would be much appreciated.
