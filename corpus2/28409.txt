I am collaborating on a spare-time project with someone else that has access to Mathematica. I do not. He has supplied me with his notebook file. Is it possible for me to open, or import this file in any other piece of software? If not, are there any options to export from Mathematica to another format or language? I have heard that it is possible to export from a .nb file to C/C++ code, but I don't know if my co-conspirator can do this or what the best options are. For my specific case, export to C++ would be ideal.
