We're using Subversion as a full CM for code and also for related project documents. We have JIRA and Fisheye. When we wanted to add a peer review tool, we looked at and tested several candidates. Our weighted requirements included both code and document review, but ultimately, the integration with JIRA slanted the scores in Crucible's favor. Atlassian has slammed the door on ever supporting Word or PDF in Crucible. I've tested several workaround methods to make Crucible work for documents without success. (The Confluence/Crucible plug-in was deprecated by Atlassian, so that option is out, too.) I haven't found a plugin for Crucible that adds this functionality, so short of writing my own plug-in, Crucible for documents is unworkable. Word Track Changes doesn't provide a method for true collaboration and commenting. Adobe PDF Comment and Markup is interesting, but doesn't provide a great way to keep a permanent quality record of the conversation. We can't go cloud-based, our documents must be locally hosted on our own server only. We're only on Sharepoint 2007. Help! Anyone have a suggestion?
