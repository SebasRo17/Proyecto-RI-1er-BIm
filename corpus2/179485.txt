I work in a Rest Oriented environment. The number of endpoints is quite large and span multiple applications. The dependencies between the endpoints are large in number as well and not very well planned. Applications have cyclic dependencies amongst each other. Unfortunately, there is no central location where all the endpoints are documented and declare dependencies (the endpoints that they inturn call). Is there a tool that will help in such dependency management. I tried searching for a tool online, but not know what such a thing would be called, I am unable to find anything.
