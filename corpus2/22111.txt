As documented               FindRoot[f[x], {x, xs, min, max}]       searches for a solution, stopping the search if `x` ever gets outside the range `min` to `max` and returning the error `FindRoot::reged`. Now I have               FindRoot[{f[x, y], g[x, y]}, {{x, xs}, {y, ys}}]      and I want to obtain the same behavior but for the constrain `x > y`. Is this possible? In particular, I'm interested in the case in which there are many solutions that satisfy the constrain, and I want to get as many as possible of them by giving several starting points.
