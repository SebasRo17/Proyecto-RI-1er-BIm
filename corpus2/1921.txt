Given a couple of lists like `a={1,2,3,4,6}` and `b={2,3,4,6,9}` I can use the built-in Mathematica symbol `Tuples [{a,b}]` and get all the arrangements easilly enough. But I am struggling with how to eliminate the generation of replacement results, for example: `{2,2}` and `{4,2}` and `{4,4}` are not desired but all the totally unique results like `{1,2}` and `{1,3}` are desired. So essentially I want to find all the combinations of numbers that do not have any ordering repeats such as `{4,2}` where I already have `{2,4}` and no number repeats such as `{2,2}` and `{4,4}`. Any ideas would be appreaciated!
