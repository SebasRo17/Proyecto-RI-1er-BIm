I'm on the way developing a Java application where user can provide a class diagram and get the corresponding Java code. I don't know how can I let the user interactively _draw_ a class diagram in Java. I am currently getting the required parameters like attributes, functions directly from the user, and then I render a class diagram for him. I show the class diagram on a jdialog.But when it comes to multiple class diagrams, it screws me. Is there a better way to do this? This is an example of a class diagram, I need to generate this from a Java program, given the values and relationship. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MgwsJ.jpg)
