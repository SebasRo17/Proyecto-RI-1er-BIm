An implicit function $f(x,k)=0$ is quadratic in $x$ and contains one parameter $k$ which I must vary. Using `Solve`, I get two real solutions for each specific $k$: $x_1$ and $x_2$, of which I must choose the one that lies within $[0, 0.5]$. I must do this for a continuum of parameters $k$ between, say, $0$ and $1$. I then must plot the relevant $x$ solution against the parameter $k$ in a smooth curve. Note: I also tried the unglorious method i.e. if $k$ took discrete values, I thought I could manually select say 30 points and interpolate. But any curve fitting command I tried, using various polynomial and exponential expansions, could not give me smooth curve? Of course I hope to learn the elegant method, but under time pressure anything that gives me a smooth curve is welcome!
