I am trying to convert an image to a graph. My image is already skeletonized and looks pretty much like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cET4A.png) What I need to do is identify all vertices and edges, and in particular get a list of pixel positions for each edge. I've seen that using `MorphologicalGraph` would get me the vertices, but is there any way to also extract information about the position of the edges? EDIT: First, thanks a lot for all your comments! Let me clarify. @acl: I would like the lists of pixel coordinates for each edge to be grouped together. @Yves Klett: I think that this solution would not work, it gives a morphological graph and I need the pixel coordinates from the original image. @Silvia, @Daniel Lichtblau: I could extract all pixel positions this way, but I need to know which pixel belongs to which branch... @Vitaliy Kaurov: I need to know which vertex is connected to which, and this can be done using `MorphologicalGraph`. But I also need to know the exact path between 2 vertices, so for each branch on the image, I need the list of pixel coordinates. As you show in your answer, edges found using `MorphologicalGraph` do not match single-pixel image branches (and I need the latter). I guess that Silvia's answer would be a solution. What's interesting though is that to get to the morphological graph, Mathematica has to process the information on the pixel coordinates of the branches! But probably doesn't store it anywhere???
