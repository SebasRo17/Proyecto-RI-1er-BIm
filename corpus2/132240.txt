I'm looking for books, online resources or suggestions about how to structure big projects or build a framework in JavaScript. I'm not looking for books explaining how inheritance or closures work. I'm more looking for design patterns and techniques to organize (and develop) complex applications. At the moment I found:   * this old topic Advanced javascript guidance   * the pdf Building A JavaScript Framework   * the article Let's Make a Framework: Library Architecture Any other suggestion?
