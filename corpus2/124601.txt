Our (mid-size) company (with 150 employees) has witnessed considerable growth since last year, and as a result we have been conducting lots of interviews to hire more and more engineers to bring new projects in motion. To begin with, following is our interview process   1. Screening resume by HR   2. Telephone technical interview (conducted by senior engg)   3. Final technical + HR interview (conducted by team-lead/PM) After some analysis we found that telephone interviews are not really becoming effective, due to which we are not able to find good number of engineers in final interview. My analysis revealed that engineers don't consider interviewing as important/serious activity, since it's internal and non- billable. Also I see that engineers don't find it really prestigious to carry a label of "interviewer" (at-least telephone interviewer). We do have set of good experienced engineers in company who can take any interview very effectively, but since number of telephonic interviews is large, this pool is not sufficient. Hence we try to use other engineers as well. What can be done to inspire engineers to conduct telephone interviews seriously and positively (not treating this as mundane job)? * * * [Update-2011/12/28] Thanks for sharing your valuable opinions. It really helped me to look at problem from variety of different angles. Alongside I was discussing issues with few colleagues as well and I personally feel that there is no single silver bullet for such issue. I will need to think recruitment process as a whole unit and plan to improve different areas/stages in it.
