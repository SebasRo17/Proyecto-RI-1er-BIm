I have never seen an example use for the mysterious `Raw` function: > **Raw[ _h_ , _"hexstring"_ ]**   >  constructs a raw data object with head h, and with contents corresponding > to the binary bit pattern represented by the string hexstring, interpreted > as a hexadecimal number. The documentation also makes clear that it must be used carefully: >   * Raw should be used only under very special circumstances. > >   * It is possible to crash Mathematica by creating a fundamental > Mathematica data object with Raw, and specifying illegal internal data for > it. If you create an object with head Real, but with internal data > incompatible with Mathematica Real numbers, you may end up crashing your > whole Mathematica session. > > In fact it also states: _As of Version 6.0, Raw is no longer supported._ Pre-v6.0 documentation gives _some_ indication of application, no details, and more admonition: > As an optimization for some special kinds of computations, the raw data in > Mathematica atomic objects can be given explicitly using `Raw[head, > "hexstring"]`. The data is specified as a string of hexadecimal digits, > corresponding to an array of bytes. When no special output form exists, > `InputForm` prints special objects using `Raw`. _The behavior of`Raw` > differs from one implementation of Mathematica to another; its general use > is strongly discouraged._ Nevertheless I regularly find use for other deprecated functions such as `Compose` and `ToHeldExpression`, and I am curious. How can one use this function?
