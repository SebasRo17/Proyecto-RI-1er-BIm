I am trying to solve so-called Coulomb Integral of two Gaussians:               Integrate[Exp[(-b1 (-c1 + x1)^2 - b2 (-c2 + x2)^2)/Sqrt[(x1 - x2)^2]], {x1, -Infinity,      Infinity}, {x2, -Infinity, Infinity}],      where $b1$ and $b2$ must be positive parameters, and $c1$ and $c2$ any real parameters. The denominator seems to be very nasty so I could not solve the integral. Any ideas how to tackle this problem?
