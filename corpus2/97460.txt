I tried my best to frame this question in such a way that it will help others out there who are curious about the same thing as I am. I am currently a full time C++ programmer. I also do a little bit of C#/.NET programming as well. I have over 4 years of experience total. I have looked into the possibility of doing contract programming. I am looking to avoid having to be stuck on one team/project forever. I am single, have no kids, and have enough money saved up to last over a year without an income. I live in one of the biggest cities in the U.S. I know there are different types of contract work, such as W2, independent, contract-to-hire, etc. I'm looking to work on contracts that last 6 months to a year. I would like to avoid having to do most of the marketing/overhead work myself and just want to do the programming work. I thought about getting contract work through different agencies and they would get a cut of the pay for doing the searching/overhead work for me. I just feel so stuck in my current job and want the freedom of working on a variety of projects and have some flexibility in hours and location (whether it's working at home or at another office). I have no desire to move up to management or navigate through office politics every day. What would be the best option for someone in my situation? W2 contracts through an agency? I wouldn't mind getting a little less pay as long as someone would take care of most of the marketing/overhead work involved.
