I have some plain Views, they don't have any logic behind them (there is no action or controller behind them), their only propouse is to alert the user about something like "We have sent you an email to confirm your account", "You have no access to this resource", etc... These views are really simple, and calling them through a Controller/Action seems to be too much overhead, but somehow I feel like it is not quite correct. What do you think? How do you handle this kind of situations?? I guess this question will apply to any MVC Framework, but in my case I'm using the ASP.NET MVC 3 framework.
