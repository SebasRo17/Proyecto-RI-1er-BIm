I'm working with an own package of functions. During development I noticed, that my naming scheme is not that clever; for example some of my functions are starting with capital letters. But I have several files working with that package, that I would like to be able to use further on with as few as possible. So my idea is, to write a small package named `loadOldNams`or something like that, providing the old function names additionally. Therefore I'm facing the following problem: Having a function with my new name - for simplification just `f`, e.g.               f[x_] := x^2;     f[x_, y_] := x^2 y^2;     f::usage = "A test usage text";      I would like to define a function having the old name (say `g`), such that all cases 'g[x], g[x,y]`and the`::usage`also work with`g`. Just `f=g;` or `f:=g;` won't work, so How do I get a function with the name `g` doing exactly the same as `f` (just having another name)?
