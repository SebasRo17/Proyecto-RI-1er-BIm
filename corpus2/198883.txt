I am considering the options for designing a system in java which accepts data files from different systems applies some transformations to the data, concats data from multiple files to produce some output data files for the downstream systems. The data transformations are not per record transformation, e.g. I need to read a record , then search the file for another record matching the pattern of a given field from the first record I was thinking of spring batch,but have been asked to consider other options also. Kindly help with any pointers, things to consider while designing and evaluating options.
