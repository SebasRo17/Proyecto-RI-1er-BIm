> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is there a canonical book for learning Java as an experienced developer? I've been coding for close to 25 years now in basic, (C64 & Amiga), (Object) pascal, C, LPC and for the last few years, Python. Python is definitely my favourite (and strongest) language. However, lately I've been forced to do stuff in Java - I have never written a single line of java code so far. So I'm asking your advice - what is the fastest and most efficient crash course to learn java. **EDIT** : I'm really looking for something along the lines _teaching java to people who know how to code and what OOP is_ \- not something that has _with no previous programming experience_ in the synopsis.
