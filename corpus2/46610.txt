I am a student interested in working on Memory Management, particularly the page replacement component of the linux kernel. What are the different guides that can help me to begin understanding the kernel source? I have tried to read the book _Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager_ by Mel Gorman and _Understanding the Linux Kernel_ by Cesati and Bovet, but they do not explain the flow of control through the code. They only end up explaining various data structures used and the work various functions perform. This makes the code more confusing. My project deals with tweaking the page replacement algorithm in a mainstream kernel and analyse its performance for a set of workloads. Is there a flavor of the linux kernel that would be easier to understand (if not the linux-2.6.xx kernel)?
