How can the data of the directional movement index below be extracted from this chart? It seems to be embedded in some kind of dynamic module.               data = FinancialData["IBM", "OHLCV",        {{2013, 12, 31}, {2014, 3, 31}}];     chart = TradingChart[data,       {FinancialIndicator["AverageDirectionalMovementIndex", 7]},       Appearance -> "Line"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KuTuW.png)
