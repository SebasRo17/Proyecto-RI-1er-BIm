I am trying to use mathematica to solve the following system of equation, but I can not for the life of me get it to work. I have the following:               Stiffness = ((Y*A)/L )*{{1, -1, 0, 0}, {-1, 2, -1, 0}, {0, -1,       2, -1}, {0, 0, -1, 1}} // MatrixForm          Displacements = {{0}, {a}, {b}, {0}} // MatrixForm          Force = {{x}, {(7*L^3 )/162}, {(10*L^3)/81}, {y}} // MatrixForm      I need to solve:               Stiffness * Displacements = Force      When I use LinearSolve it just spits back the input command. I need to solve for a, b, x, and y. Thanks for the help.
