Background: consider the following code-snippet.                 Dynamic@Grid[         Table[Setter[Dynamic[idx, (idx = #1) &],           i*6 + j,          Graphics[{Blue, Disk[]}, ImageSize -> 20]],          {i, 0, 1}, {j, 6}]]      This code creates two rows of clickable disk images. So if idx=10 is run, the 10th disk looks pressed. I want to make this control multi-selectable. So if idx={1,12} run, the first and last disks look pressed. ( In my application the disks may have different colors, edge properties and opacity. ) - See also: What is an efficient way of selecting multiple colors via Manipulate? **Question: How to create "a multi-selectable setterbar with colored buttons" ?** ( preferably based on the snippet above, but not necessarily ).
