I'm working in a big software company and I'm developing a big enterprise- level web-solution with a team of about 25 people (2 architects, ~15 developers, 5 QA engineers, couple BAs, project manager). We are following agile methodology and scrum and it seems to be pretty convenient for such big team in circumstances of frequent requirement changes. I also have one pet project - I have basic idea and I've started development. Currently I'm working alone, but I plan to propose to couple of my friends participate in my project. Some time ago I've faced with a problem of proper task-tracking and formalizing requirements. My first thought was to use agile methodology as we used it with my team at work. While it is very convenient for my job, I have found it too much time-consuming for team with 1-3 people. Is there any software development methodologies for really small teams? Or I should overcome myself and formalize all my thoughts into user stories and tasks and use iterations? I don't want my project become just another folder on my disk, but I'm also don't want to waste time on unnecessary formalizations.
