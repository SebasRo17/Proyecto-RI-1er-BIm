It's not about security or something. There is a table to record user information, like username, password, postcode and so on, one record per person. There is also a table called post to record the posts the users posted. It's very easy to set a relation to identify the user who posted the post. But think of this situation, how to store the posts that has been read by a user? If use many-to-many relation, the table will increase to very huge size. What's more, there's a lot things to record, I just take one of them for example. I call this personal information. The problem is how should I store it properly?
