Do you think that using akka actors in front of transactional service beans, is a good idea ? Actors are waked up by a facade used by a client application, and actor use a message to handle right service call. Is it a good practice ? This article (http://honeysoft.wordpress.com/2012/08/05/akka-actor-dependency- injection-using-spring/) is talking about using spring beans with akka actors. But I could not see the gain to use actors in front of (singleton) spring beans.
