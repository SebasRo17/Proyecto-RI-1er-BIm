Let's say I have the code:                    $runningLogFile0 = "m0.txt";          $runningLogFile1 = "m1.txt";          $runningLogFile2 = "m2.txt";               If[FileExistsQ[$runningLogFile0], Get[$runningLogFile0], Print["Error: Noexist"];];          If[FileExistsQ[$runningLogFile1], Get[$runningLogFile1], Print["Error: Noexist"];];          If[FileExistsQ[$runningLogFile2], Get[$runningLogFile2], Print["Error: Noexist"];];      that I use to read in a list of consecutively named files, `m0.txt,m1.txt, m2.txt`. I want to make this code more efficient for reading in a large number of such files, for which it would be very tiresome to do in the above way. Can I automate this with a `Do` or `Table`? I thought something like                Do["$runningLogFile" <> ToString[i] = "m"<>ToString[i]<>".txt";, {i, 1, 100}];      might work but apparently not.
