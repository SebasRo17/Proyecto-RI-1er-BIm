Hey guys I have this great idea for a web application, but I am unsure on how to develop it. I know I need a team of people to make it, Developers and Designers, but where do I start? Eventually I know I will need everyone, but for a startup, who are the people you need first, and who can you add on as time goes by. So first of, I know exactly what every web page will do, I know what elements each page should have and roughly the layout. So, I thought the best use of my time would to draw out Wire Frames of every page, and then use cases to describe the user interactions. So thats everything I think I can possibly do. The first set of people that come to my mind to hire would be a database designer, since I already know what information we need from the users and how their information and data collected from third parties. Also, they already know how data is going to be displayed from the Wireframes and use cases. Then I thought I would need to hire a designer, to design the web layout and interface. Then I thought I would need a Developer to connect everything together. If you were a small startup and could only hire 1 person at a time, is this the way you would go?
