I have two lists:               list1={4,6}     list2={1,2}      and I now want a function f that produces               f[list1_,list2_]:={1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2}      so 4 times the 1 and 6 times the 2. f should be generic so that               3list1={2,3,7}; 3list2={1,2,3}      yields               res={1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3}      If you know several ways to do this please provide the fastest one. thanks a lot.
