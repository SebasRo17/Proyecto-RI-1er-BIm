Following the recent release by Microsoft of TypeScript I was wondering if this is something that should be considered for a experienced WinForm and XAML developer looking to get into more web development. From reviewing a number of sites and videos online it appears that the type system for TypeScript makes more sense to me as a thick client developer than the dynamic type system in Javascript. I understand that Typescript compiles down to JavaScript but it appears that the learning curve is shallower due to the current tooling provided by Microsoft. What are your thoughts?
