Does anybody known of a web-based university course entirely built with _Mathematica_? I mean one where the whole course (lectures/labs/exams) is presented in _Mathematica_ FrontEnd form. My point is that _Mathematica_ is very user-friendly, supporting the principle "if you can visualize this data/process, you must do it". I suppose this feature makes _Mathematica_ very attractive for wide use in university courses, if not now then in the near future. So I am looking for exising examples. Any links?
