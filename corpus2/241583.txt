The actual GPL License (that is, the _text_ that contains the words _"The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed..."_ ) is a document; I would assume therefore that it is under some sort of copyright? What license is this license licensed under? That is, if I were to include the body of the GPL License in my own projects (and perhaps create a derivative work) what limitations am I under?
