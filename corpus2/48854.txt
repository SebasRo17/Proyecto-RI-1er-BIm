The expression               h[n_] = -((I^-n (-1 + I^n)^2)/(n^2 Ï€^2))       is real for all integers `n`. Although indeterminate at `n = 0`, _Mathematica_ computes the limit to be `1/4` as `n -> 0`. I'd like to use the expression in `DiscreteConvolve`, but even when I first declare `h[0] = 1/4`, a computation like               y[0] = DiscreteConvolve[h, DiscreteDelta[n], n, m]       yields only `h` and its explicit infinite summation representation results in "Indeterminate". How do I make operations with `h` usable?
