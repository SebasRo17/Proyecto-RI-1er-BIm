I'd like to detect when a website has changed, in particular when new products are announced on a site that doesn't change to often. Here's the code I wrote but I don't think it is perfect. Also the site might block me if I ping it too many times...               content = Hash@URLFetch["www.wolfram.com"];     $c = 0; Dynamic[$c]          RunScheduledTask[$c++;       If[content =!= Hash@URLFetch["www.wolfram.com"],        SendMail["To" -> "me@me.com",         "Subject" -> "The wolfram site has been updated!",         "Body" -> {"Check wolfram now"},         "From" -> "email", "Server" -> "smtp.gmail.com",         "UserName" -> "email", "Password" -> "pass",         "PortNumber" -> 587, "EncryptionProtocol" -> "StartTLS"];          content = Hash@URLFetch["www.wolfram.com"]], 100]      I'd also like to create a standalone executable for running this process in the background without mathematica being open.
