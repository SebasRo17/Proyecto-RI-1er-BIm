I am having two problems regarding _Mathematica_ , and both of them are happening because it does not accept such inputs:               RSolve[ g[n + 1] == g[n]^2 + 2*f[n]^2, f[n + 1] == 2f[n]*g[n]]      and               RSolve[ g[n + 1] == g[n]^2 + sum[ f[n - 1, i], i = 0..n-1], f[n,x]== (n!)/((x!)*(n-x)!)]      And I have no idea how to provide the correct input for such equations that _Mathematica_ understands.
