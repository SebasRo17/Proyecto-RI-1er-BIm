> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Should newbies use IDE autocomplete (Intellisense)? Since I moved on to actual IDEs for C++, Java and Python, I noticed they automatically try to complete my code. For example if I write `System.out.pr[...]` I am automatically offered a list from which I can select the item I want to use. As a beginner I avoided using this feature as I thought I should learn the syntax by typing. Was I correct in thinking that? From a more experienced programmer's point of view, I'd see no harm in using this feature.
