If I put some viscosity (or density, ...) lookups in my notebook, such as:               muMercury = ChemicalData["Mercury", "Viscosity"] ;     muWater = ChemicalData["Water", "Viscosity"] ;      Then these are fetched each time the notebook is loaded, which is kind of slow (a little window pops up showing "Initializing Chemical Data Indices" while it does this lookup). Is there a way to cache these, without doing a kludge like manually copying the numeric values obtained from an initial call? I've got two reasons for asking. The first is just the slowness aspect, and the second is functional. I've got a `Manipulate` control that depends indirectly on these values, and when I start up the notebook for the very first time, it appears that my `Manipulate` executes before the preceding `ChemicalData` functions are evaluated. The `"Initializing ChemicalData indices"` doesn't occur until after an explicit evaluation.
