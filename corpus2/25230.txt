I am trying to solve the following rational integral (I got assistance here): $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{\frac{a+x}{b^2 + (a+x)^2}\frac{1}{1+c(a-x)^2}}dx$$ where $\\{a, b, c\\}\in \mathbb{R}$. I would like also to find an analytical solution using Mathematica. I have tried `Integrate`,               Integrate[(a + x)/(b^2 + (a + x)^2)*1/(       1 + c*(a - x)^2), {x, -Infinity, Infinity}]      but this gives me an imaginary result based on $a$, $b$ and $c$. I believe the result should be 100% real. Am I using `Integrate` the correct way?
