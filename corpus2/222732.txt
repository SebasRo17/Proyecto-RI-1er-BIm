As a beginner to J2EE, I have recently started developing my own project from scratch using the Core of J2EE : Servlets & Jsps. I could not evaluate whether my project folder structure is right or not. Here is my project folder structure. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pmpU9.png) Before asking question, I admit that I could not answer or neither justify if somebody asks me, why this type of folder structure. The question: Is it a good sign to put my jsps outside of web-inf. If not, why is it so? If yes why? Is there any standard folder structure convention for a J2EE web application, I know maven has brought up some standards but still, we can customize as per the requirement I believe. I have done a bit of googling and found the two references 1 2 where in the answers are not on the same page, from which I couldn't draw any conclusion. What are the points to be considered while laying out the folder structure for a J2EE web application, importantly where should the Jsps, static content should go into & why?
