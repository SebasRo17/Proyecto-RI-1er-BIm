I'd like a FaceCenteredCubic image as in the in LatticeData docs, but space packed, and cropped on all the boundaries, so that it illustrates the geometry of the calculation that leads to the $\pi/\sqrt{18}$ density result. The call that produces the plot is               LatticeData["FaceCenteredCubic", "Image"]      but this has small spheres, and probably doesn't have a way to crop on the boundaries. I see that there's a PackingRadius listed in the documentation. I thought it might be possible to use the PackingRadius property, to display the spheres in the lattice in a space packed fashion (so that they touch), but that wouldn't handle the cropping part of the problem. Is there any easy way to do this, perhaps using the lattice data to draw spheres using the Graphics drawing options, and then using the various ViewAngle type options to crop that appropriately?
