In http://semver.org/ —which in my perception seems to be the most widely used convention in versioning— it is recommended to increase the major version number when a change that breaks/modify the API is introduced. There are two related scenarios I don't see how to apply this guideline though:   1. What if my code doesn't offer any API? How should I version my code?   2. What if my code starts offering an API in a late stage of its development?
