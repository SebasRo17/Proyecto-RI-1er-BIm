I'm mostly thinking of PHP here, but if you want to refer to other languages that's fine. An object has a method that requires data contained in another class of object. Should I extract that data from the other object into a variable and then send just that data to the requesting object? Or should I pass the entire data-containing object into the data-requiring object, and then have the requesting object perform the data extraction operations? I'm asking because I'm working on a big project that I've written 100% of the code for, and some of my early code takes string or numeric arguments, but my later code seems to be leaning toward passing around objects. As I bump into some old code, I'm wondering if I should convert it to object parameters.
