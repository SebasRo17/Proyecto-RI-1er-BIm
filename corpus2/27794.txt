Imagine I have some data in a list I'd like to plot using `ListPlot` in _Mathematica 9_ , for example:               ListPlot[Table[{i, Cos[i]}, {i, 1, 10^3}]]      How can I specify that the data points should be colored according to a linearly scaling interval from one `RGB` value to another (e.g. `Red --> Blue, Green --> Red`, etc.) depending on the point's index in the array? Can we do something similar using `ListPointPlot3D`?               ListPointPlot3D[Table[{i, Cos[i], Sin[i]}, {i, 1, 10^3}]]
