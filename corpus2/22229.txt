I have a notebook which contain all the variables and defined functions. I want to do two tasks. As an example, I want to find the density and energy which have equations in terms of above mentioned variables and functions. If I write one code for these two tasks, it is a very large notebook. So, if I have separate notebooks for "variables and functions",density and energy, how can I connect each notebook so that they can run properly and give the result? Could anyone please help me to do this?
