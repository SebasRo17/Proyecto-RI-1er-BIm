Recently I have started working for company which is developing mainly low level stuff (like device drivers, system level apps etc.). I was hired as high level programmer to develop a machine learning system (details of this system are not so important). My problem is that my coworkers, that are all low level programmers, do not respect my job, because I am using high level techniques. They think that high level programming is easy and only low level requires skill and knowledge. This is quite unfair for me because writing a scalable machine learning system only by myself is not trivial task. How can I convey them that my work is also valuable? Or maybe I am wrong and low level programming is so hard that only gods can handle it? ;) What are your opinions about that?
