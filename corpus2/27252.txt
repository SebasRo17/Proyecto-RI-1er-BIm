I'm wondering how to display the support $\mathrm{supp}(f)$ of a piecewise surface $z = f(x,y)$. As an example, let's consider the following piecewise function (and plot it):               f[x_, y_] = Piecewise[{{1, 0 <= x <= 1 && 0 <= y <= 1}}];     g[x_, y_] = Integrate[f[x - t, y - t], {t, 0, 1}];     Plot3D[g[x, y], {x, -0.5, 2.5}, {y, -0.5, 2.5}, PlotRange -> Full]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gasp5.png) My first thought was to use a contour plot for this purpose, such as               ContourPlot[g[x, y] == .05, {x, -0.5, 2.5}, {y, -0.5, 2.5}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0qT6M.png) But this is of course only an approximation of the support. How do I display the actual support of my piecewise function? ### Edit The proposed solution in the comments below works great, the result looks as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oubOk.png)
