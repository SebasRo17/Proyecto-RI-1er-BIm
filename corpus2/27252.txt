Ok, so I have a program that basically logs errors into a nosql database. Right now there is just a single model for an error and its stored as a document in the nosql database. Basically I want to summarize across different errors and produce a summary of the "types" of errors that occured. Traditionally in a SQL database the this normalization would work with groupings, sums and averages but in a NoSQL database I assume I need to use mapreduce. My current model seems unfit for the task, how should I change the way I store "models" in order to make statistical analysis easy? Would a NoSQL database even be the right tool for this type of problem? I'm storing things in Google AppEngine's BigTable, so there are some limitations to think of as well.
