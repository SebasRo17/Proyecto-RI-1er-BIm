I am concerned about the expression on the RHS of equation A.5 (page 19) in this paper: $$\int\frac{d^d q}{(q^2)^{\nu_1}[(\vec{k}-\vec{q})^2]^{\nu_2}}=\frac{\Gamma(d/2-\nu_1)\Gamma(d/2-\nu_2)\Gamma(\nu_1+\nu_2-d/2)}{\Gamma(\nu_1)\Gamma(\nu_2)\Gamma(d/2-\nu_1-\nu_2)}\pi^{d/2}k^{d-2\nu_1-2\nu_2}$$   * Can I use _Mathematica_ to find a Laurent kind of expansion of the RHS in the limit of $d-3 = \epsilon \rightarrow 0$? I would guess that it has poles in $\epsilon$ and I would like to know the residues.    * And could I have used _Mathematica_ to do this integral and give me the value as stated in equation A.5?
