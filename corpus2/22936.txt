I am trying to plot two lists, where one is the reference list, and the other is only used to select and highlight the first list. Basically, I want to use the selection list `slist` to highlight different points in the reference list `reflist` after using `Manipulate`:               reflist = Flatten[Table[{x, y, z, a}, {x, 0, 4}, {y, -4, -1}, {z, 0, 5}, {a,0, 3}], 3];     slist = Flatten[Table[{x, y, z, a}, {x, 0, 1}, {y, -2, -2}, {z, 0, 1}, {a, 0, 1}],3];          Manipulate[      Show[ListPlot[        Select[reflist, #[[1]] == x && #[[2]] == y &][[All, 3 ;; 4]],         PlotStyle -> Black, AxesLabel -> {"z", "a"}, PlotLabel -> {x, y},         PlotRange -> All, Joined -> False],        ListLinePlot[        Select[slist, #[[1]] == x && #[[2]] == y &][[All, 3 ;; 4]],         PlotStyle -> Red, AxesLabel -> {"z", "a"}, PlotRange -> All,         Joined -> False]], {x, 0, 4, 1}, {y, -4, -1, 1}]      Returns the following graph when x=1 and y=-2: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H2IIH.png) The problem occurs when `slist` has no point in common with `reflist`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hb4pn.png) So my questions are: 1. Is there any way for me to avoid getting the error and just have **no point highlighted** when the two lists have no points in common, and **just show all points in black**? 2. I am also looking to highlight the whole regions where the points are (this would make a square in the first figure, with vertices in each red point). Is there any way to do it in `ListPlot`? Thanks so much for all the help!
