I have been away from computers for about 3 years and starting to get back into programming. Lots has changed in resources and help sites available on the web especially the evolving StackExchange community. I come from the IRC #javascript, #html, #php days with php.net and a bit of google search finds here and there. With that said, before I took my break from programming JQuery was around but not nearly as common as today. I personally stay away from it finding it easier to just write what I need done in traditional javascript. Now I have just stumbled across AngularJS. I do not know much about it, just looked at the home page and saw a few script samples. My question is: Am I hindering my clients by using javascript while being ignorant to JQuery and/or AngularJS?
