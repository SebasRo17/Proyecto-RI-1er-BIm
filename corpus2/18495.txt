After reading this question; Why are so many programmers arrogant It does bring a related question to my mind. Is it possible to have egoless programming or is it even desirable? As a profession we do seem to want to show off the latest gizmo, technique or say “look at this awesome piece of code I’ve written”. Yet we can get very defensive when asked to submit items of work for code reviews or get negative comments from other programmers (hearing the term WTF, has never been a good sign). Can we as a profession be able to sit down and analyse a piece of code, data or architecture for its merits or constraints and a calm and respetful manner, without causing offence or antagonising our colleagues, or are we just the archetypal Dilbert character, raging against the system?
