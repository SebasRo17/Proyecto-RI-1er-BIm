Does anyone happen to know of some guidelines for writing up a document for coping with possible disaster scenarios ? By disaster I mean anything that could lead to loss of work, time or eventually a client. I seem to remember reading an article along these lines but, unfortunately, I can't find it anymore. So I'd appreciate some feedback in this direction. I think such an approach would be useful in the company I'm in right now as we've had the occasional scare which might have been avoided with some preventative thinking.
