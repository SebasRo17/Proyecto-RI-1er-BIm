I recently read this article online and began to question my knowledge. Now I went to uni(ish) and have a honours degree, I program in c++ using pointers but I wonder if i would have made it in Joel's class. We had two programming modules but mostly I am self taught. So I want to know how can I learn the things mentioned in the article but without it feeling like gappy self taught knowledge without having to do another 3 year degree? How can I go back to the real basics and learn it properly so I am confident in my abilities and dont feel I have a dumbed down modern degree knowledge ?
