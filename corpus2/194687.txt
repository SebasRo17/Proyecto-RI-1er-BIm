When I remote connect to my work PC, in IE10, the juniper remote client service which is basically a plugin executed in the browser does not run. I need to turn on compatibility view to see it. My question is what exactly is happening behind the scenes in compatibility view such that such a large number of compatibility problems can be fixed with it? What did they do...make a list of deprecated APIs that was running ok in ie8 but deprecated in ie10 and then on clicking compatibility view, those APIs are supported again?
