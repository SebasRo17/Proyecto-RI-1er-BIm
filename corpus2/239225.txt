I am fairly new to c# and trying to learn best practices. I've been faced with many situations over the last week in which I need to make a choice between longer+simpler code, or shorter code that combines several actions into a single statement. What are some standards you veteran coders use when trying to write clear, concise code? Here is an example of code I'm writing with two options. Which is preferable? A)                   if (ncPointType.StartsWith("A"))//analog points         {             string[] precisionString = Regex.Split(unitsParam.Last(), ", ");             precision = int.Parse(precisionString[1]);         }         else         {             precision = null;         }      B)                   if (ncPointType.StartsWith("A"))//analog points             precision = int.Parse(Regex.Split(unitsParam.Last(), ", ")[1]);         else             precision = null;      C)                   precision = ncPointType.StartsWith("A") == true ?                  int.Parse(Regex.Split(unitsParam.Last(), ", ")[1]) :                  null;
