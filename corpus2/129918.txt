> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do I improve my coding skills? I'm a 4 yrs experienced programmer with JAVA being the strong point of mine. I know basics of web, C++ android, blackberry programming. Was wondering how should I improve myself. Does learning new languages help or learning design stuff and learn to become a architect? How do you guys plan yourself for future? May be learn a language every year? or be in touch the the new technologies? How do you guys improve yourself as a core programmer?
