On a related questions about "Finding and/or becoming an open source product owner" -- the first comment to the question itself was "the idea of a product owner goes against the idea of open source."   * Is this true, and if so, why?   * If not, what circumstances and/or context would it make sense for open source project to have a product owner role? I've attempt to find an example of this role at Mozilla.org \-- but I've had no luck so far. (Just to be clear, I'm talking about a volunteer role, not a paid position at a non-profit.)
