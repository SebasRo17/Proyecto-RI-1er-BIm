I have a project where I need to translate a lot of words and text fragments in different languages. In these texts, underscores are currently added in these text (fragment(s)) to be used as keyboard shortcuts (used in Visual Studio). However, I was wondering if this is the way to go, or if it would be better to remove the underscores and add them AFTER translation. Is there some guideline to follow?
