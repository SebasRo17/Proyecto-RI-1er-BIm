I have problem when using mathlink, the source code is quite simple:               void MAXF(char* ex1, char* ex2, char** result){        MLINK lp;        int pkt;        MLEnvironment env;        env = MLInitialize(NULL);        if (env == NULL) return;        int argcs = 4;        char *argvs[5] = {"-linkmode", "launch", "-linkname", "math -mathlink", NULL};        lp = MLOpen(argcs, argvs);        if (lp == NULL) return;             *result = malloc(100);        sprintf(*result, "0");             MLPutFunction(lp, "Exit", 0L);        MLClose(lp);        MLDeinitialize(env);     }      and in main, i call it by:               char* test;     MAXF("0", "0", &test);      However, after running, the terminal always shows this line:               In[2]:=       I believe that there is a problem, but I can't figure it out. Please help.
