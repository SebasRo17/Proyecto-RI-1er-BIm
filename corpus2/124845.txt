As I gain more professional experience, I've become a bit more skeptical about a lot of the politics of the interview process. In particular, I'm curious to know if y'all think it's ok to ask the interviewer the same questions you're asked. For instance, in an interview a few years back, I was asked: > Where do you see yourself in 5 years? I gave a decent answer, and then asked the interviewer: > Where do you see yourself in 5 years? He actually gave a fairly thoughtful answer. What about questions like:   * Why do you like working here?   * Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker and how you resolved it.   * Answer this question. EDIT: I meant:   * Answer this [insert technical gotcha question here] question.
