how do I get the name and definition of a builtin Mathematica functions? For instance, I would like to see how default Tick plotting function is implemented. However, it is not clear where it is and what is its name, because its name never appears for the user. Example:               Plot[ {Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 3 Pi}, Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> {None, Automatic}]      Basically I want to know, how do I get the name of the function called under the `Automatic` label? Thanks!
