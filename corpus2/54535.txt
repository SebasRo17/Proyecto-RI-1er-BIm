Suppose we have this equation: $$ 2 - x g(z) f \left(x, \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right) = 3y $$ using initial condition $y = 2$ where $g = \left| \frac{3}{2-iz} \right|$ and $f = \frac{2x}{1-3\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}} $ I want to plot the contours of $ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ within axes $x$ and $z$. How do I go about doing it? I tried using $NDSolve$ but it doesn't quite work.               g := Abs[3 / (2 - iz)]     f := 2x / ( 1 - 3D[y[x,z],x] )     NDSolve [ {2-x*g*f == 3y[x,z] ,y[x,z]==2}, D[y[x,z],x], {x,0,1}, {z,0,1}  ]      * * * Too long for a comment - Your answer works, but I improvised this to my current problem and it doesn't seem to work.. I want to find the contours of $ \frac{\partial T_e}{\partial P_{local}} $ in axes $P_{probe}$ against $w$ in the limit $P_{local} \rightarrow 0, T_e \rightarrow 0.2 $.
