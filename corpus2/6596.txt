Mathematica 8 introduced SymbolicC, a set of Mathematica functions that capture C language constructions in the familiar Mathematica tree-like fashion. Additionally, there are functions to write SymbolicC trees as straight C code to a file. The tutorial clearly explains the functions, but -as far as I know- it doesn't provide any examples of useful applications of this capability. It sounds like it should be tremendously useful, but I have a hard time coming up with some creative uses of my own. A couple of years ago, I used Mathematica to 'flatten out' a recursive algorithm I had written in C to gain some speed. Mathematica wrote the whole program for me pasting C phrases together I had prepared in strings. SymbolicC would have been much neater, though not really necessary. Yesterday, Leonid Shifrin came up with a very nice application of symbolicC to make an alternative of CForm that doesn't make calls to the auxiliary function Power(). That's a good start. I'd like to ask the creative minds on StackOverflow to come up with more _ideas_ and/or actual _uses_ of SymbolicC. I'll accept the most upvoted answer. **EDIT** Mar 30 The response to the question is a bit scant so far. So, we have this mma extension with more than 60 functions added and virtually nobody has an idea of how to use them? Come on guys, show that you're creative!
