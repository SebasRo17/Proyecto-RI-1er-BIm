I am working on a testing tool that provides image comparisons. For test data insertions, I am using excel and csv files that supply the tests with text that is used by the tool to mock actual user interactions - in filling up of forms/screens in the tests. After the insertion, there is a need for verification to ascertain whether the test has functioned properly or not. What mechanism should I apply to ensure proper validation for the tests ? As the screens will differ widely, I cannot use a hard coded error/success validation string/image. One approach that I am considering is generation of images based on inputs(OCR) for different tests, which will be used to validate the instance of test where the specified input was executed. Can anyone comment/share any other technique for doing this ?
