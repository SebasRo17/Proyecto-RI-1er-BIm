I am somewhat new to programming and the best way I can ask this question is with an example. I know how to do basic things in Java and C#. Things like a small windows forms application or make a generic class. I've basically been learning and haven't tried to do anything big yet. Anyways, I've always been curious about how things are done "under the hood" I guess you could say. I know it all gets boiled down to 1s and 0s and that assembly languages basically give commands to patterns of 1s and 0s, but its seems like there's this jump from there to: use a library for this a library for that. It seems to me like all C# can do without a library is arithmetic and binary logic. To get input or output, you use libraries, etc... I know this question probably seems obvious to some and I know that I have a lot to learn but I don't even know where to begin with a question like this. Thank you. So my question is this: > If someone were going to make a virtual machine or a Playstation emulator, > or an operation system, or a driver, or add mp3 support to a media player, > or make your own file type, etc... How? I can't see the way that would be > done with C# or Java. In other words, if I read a book like Professional C# by WROX or Programming C# by OReilly, would I know how to do these things? Or do you have to learn assembly language or something more low level like C++?
