This might seem as a silly question, but is it feasible to use a mathematical expression as the name of a function? For example, I'm studying the cross section of Compton scattering and there is a formula for the differential cross section, which is denoted as $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}$. I'd like to express the latter as a function of energy E, angle θ and atomic number Z. If I, naively, use $\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}[Z\\_, E\\_, \theta\\_] := \ldots$ I get the anticipated error: > SetDelayed::write : Tag Times in dσ/dΩ[Z_,E_,θ_] is Protected Instead of the obvious workaround of using a name such as `diffSection`[Z_,E_,θ_] := ... is there any other way ?
