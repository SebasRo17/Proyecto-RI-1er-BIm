I read some other questions and tried to implement the given answers but yet, I did not succeed to find proper solutions for my eigenvalues. I hope someone can show me how to do this for this case, and even larger matrices in the same shape:               mat = {{L - 2*s, -w, s, 0, s, 0}, {w, L, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {s, 0, L - 2*s, -w, s, 0}, {0, 0, L, w, 0, 0},     {s, 0, s, 0, L - 2*s, -w}, {0, 0, 0, 0, L, w}};      I used `FullSimplify[Eigenvalues[mat], Assumptions -> {Element[L, Reals], Element[w, Reals], Element[w, Reals]}]` as well as               Sort[Eigenvalues[mat] // Simplify // N]      with the same results that 4 eigenvalues are written as Root.
