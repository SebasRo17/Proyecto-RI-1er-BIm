I'd like to be able to feed an expression into Mathematica, and have Mathematica convert that expression to TeXForm WITHOUT ANY SIMPLIFICATION WHATSOEVER. As a trivial example, currently, if I enter               6/9 //TeXForm      MM returns               \frac{2}{3}      I'd like to be able to feed it 6/9 and have it return               \frac{6}{9}      Obviously there are solutions that would effectively involve writing my own parser, but I'm specifically looking for relatively short and clean solutions, if there are any.
