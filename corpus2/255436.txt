I'm dealing with my DB systems course project, it's a stock exchange simulation app using Oracle 10g, the deal is that the support is for Java, but i'm going to do this in Python. The last iteration for the project is to connect two apps using message queues (MQ Protocols), if both apps are in Java the TA proposed to connect them using JMS, can you advise me on how to connect a Django app (my app) with a Java app (partner's app). I have found that MQ Protocol is based on a universal standard, so that must not be a hard problem to solve. Another option i've looked is Spring Pytthon, a framework that facilitates this connection. So ehat is the best option.
