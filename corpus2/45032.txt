This question is not really practical, but rather a curiosity question. Can _Mathematica_ solve a quadratic equation without its discriminant?   I mean, whenever it see a quadratic equation it tries to solve it with discriminant. (I use `Trace` for that)   But could it find it discriminant formula by itself?   I mean, the discriminant was found by human, and looking from how it was found, I see that was not very easy. I know that _Mathematica_ looks for patterns in equations. Can it found patterns, like discriminant?
