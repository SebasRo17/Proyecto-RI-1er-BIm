I think it's generally good practice to `#include` the header for any types used in a CPP file, regardless of what is already included via the HPP file. So I might `#include <string>` in both my HPP and CPP, for example, even though I could still compile if I skipped it in the CPP. This way I don't have to worry about whether my HPP used a forward declaration or not. Are there any tools that can enforce this `#include` coding style? _Should_ I enforce this coding style? Since the preprocessor/compiler doesn't care whether the `#include` is coming from the HPP or CPP, I get no feedback if I forget to follow this style.
