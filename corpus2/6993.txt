I just considered if/how one could implement `Sequence` in Mathematica if it were not predefined. It turned out that the following simple definition has in all my tests exactly the right behaviour:               myseq /: f_[x___, myseq[y___], z___] := f[x, y, z]      Now my question: Does this already correctly reproduce the full behaviour of `Sequence`, or is there something `Sequence` does but `myseq` doesn't which I missed in my tests? Here's what I tested:               foo[myseq[a, b]]     (*     ==> foo[a, b]     *)     Hold[mysec[a,b]]     (*     ==> Hold[a, b]     *)     HoldComplete[myseq[a,b]]     (*     HoldComplete[myseq[a, b]]     *)     Hold[f[myseq[a,b]]]     (*     ==> Hold[f[myseq[a, b]]]     *)     f[myseq[myseq[a,b],c,d],e,myseq[f,g,myseq[]]]     (*     ==> f[a, b, c, d, e, f, g]     *)
