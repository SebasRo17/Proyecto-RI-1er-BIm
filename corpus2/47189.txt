I need to calculate double integral as shown below. I used the Classroom Assistant palette to write the integral. How can I enter it as ordinary text, i.e., `Integrate[....],` so _Mathematica_ would treat it exactly the same as the form entered by means of the palette? How would I formulate it for submission to Wolfram Alpha? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFOf8.png)
