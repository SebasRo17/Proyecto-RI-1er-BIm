In working with Doctrine 2 I came across the following paragraph. > In fact, since Doctrine is aware of all your managed entities, when you call > theflush() method, it calculates an overall changeset and executes the most > efficient query/queries possible. For example, if you persist a total of 100 > Product objects and then subsequently call flush(), Doctrine will create a > single prepared statement and re-use it for each insert. This pattern is > called Unit of Work, and it's used because it's fast and efficient I am not up to speed on relational databases and ORM theory so I was wondering why is the Unit Of Work pattern  considered fast and efficient?
