I've been looking for a way to read numbers that have thousands separators in them:               StringCases[" 1142.123 ",  Whitespace ~~ NumberString ~~ Whitespace, 1]      gives               {" 1142.123 "}      but               StringCases[" 1,142.123 ", Whitespace ~~ NumberString ~~ Whitespace, 1]      gives               {}      So ideally there's a Mathematica way of defining `NumberString` to recognize commas in numbers. Or should I be looking into regexen at this point?
