In the following plot, the colors mean the phase, so I need to label the color bar not in integers, but in increments of $\pi$. I searched, but could not find how to change the ticks. Does anyone have an idea?               ListDensityPlot[         Table[ArcTan[Cos[x + y], Sin[x + y]], {x, 0, 10, 0.01}, {y, 0, 1.2, 0.01}],          DataRange -> {{0, 10}, {0, 1.2}}, PlotLegends -> Automatic, ColorFunction -> Hue]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PyLhk.png)
