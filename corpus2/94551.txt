I decided to ask this question here instead of on stack overflow because it is rather subjective. In C#, typically I see generic types with very poor names. Specifically, "T" is commonly used but is not a meaningful name by itself. For example:               class Fruit<T>     {         T fruit;     }      While this is the typical approach, would anyone recommend against this? And if so, what would a reasonable naming convention be for generic types in the context of C# for generic functions and classes? In my previous example, let's assume that generic type `T` must always be a type of fruit, such as `Apple` or `Orange`. The type `T` needs to make it obvious that it's a type of fruit, so maybe a better name would be `FruitType`, so we end up with:               class Fruit<FruitType>     {         FruitType fruit;     }      This is just to give you guys an idea of what I'm looking for. What's an acceptable "rule of thumb" for this issue?
