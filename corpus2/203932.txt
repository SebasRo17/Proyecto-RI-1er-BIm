I'm creating an open source PHP project that reuses other open source code instead of reinventing the wheel. I'm using composer to pull these projects into my vendor folder. What happens if these vendors delete their repository & all traces of their code from the internet? Now composer can't download the project. Should I fork every project I'm depending on, and depend on the fork? Seems like a pain, but the only 'safe' way to ensure the vendor can't delete things my project needs to run.
