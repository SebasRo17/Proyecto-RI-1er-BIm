Should developers be worried about possible automation happening in their projects that might make them redundant ? I never particularly worried about this myself but I have seen many developers worrying about it, even if they don't admit this openly. There is a fear that if you automate most of the aspects of a system that you are handling it might make you redundant eventually. I myself had an experience on this. 1 year back I had started working in a project were any requirement/change request that came, the only deliverable was a bunch of insert queries. That team had 2 developers and 1 tester working on it (all on shore). The only thing that the developer had to do would be to configure the insert queries based on the requirements. When I came to work on it, I immediately suggested to build a web application that would enable the business people to do it directly. Every thing would be configured in the web application including error reports in case anything went wrong. Needless to say my manager loved the idea but it never passed through with the higher management. The logic for that was until the client comes up with such a requirement it should never be done as it will involve future losses for the company and possibly loss of employment of the employees currently handling it. So should a developer be concerned about this ?I would certainly like to believe that > If you don't take care of your customer some one else will but experience tells me otherwise.
