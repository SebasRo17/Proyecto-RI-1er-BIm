I keep getting an error trying to used `NDSolve` for three coupled equations. It works in another programming language, but I am having trouble apparently writing it correctly in _Mathematica_. The error message says that equations are expected. I really don't understand why this is written incorrectly.               Nn = 100;     R = 50;          Cc = .00008;     K = 0.5;     VP = 1.4;     VS = 0.33;     VMAX = 1.0;     a = 20;          TW = 40.0;     TP = 200.0;     DT = 1.0;     TS = 5.0;     TU = 10.0;     k1 = 1.0;     k2 = 10.0;     k3 = 1.0;     P1 = 0.001;     P3 = 0.001;     nw = a*x[t]/(1.0 - x[t]);     np = a*(1.0 - x[t])/x[t]*(VS/VMAX);     M = 50;          s =        NDSolve[{           x'[t] == y[t]/(TW + (a*x[t]/(1.0 - x[t]))*DT) - z[t]/(TP + TU +              np*DT)*VP/VMAX - Cc*x[t]*(Nn/M),            y'[t] == P1*(1.0 - x[t]) -              y[t]*(1.0 - k1*E (((nw/k2)^k3)))/(TW + nw*DT),            z'[t] == P3*x[t] -              z[t]*(1.0 - k1*E ((((a*(1.0 - x[t])/x[t]*(VS/VMAX))/k2)^k3)))/(TP + TU + np*DT),            x[0] == y[0] == z[0] == .1},          {x[t], y[t], z[t]}, {t, 10}];
