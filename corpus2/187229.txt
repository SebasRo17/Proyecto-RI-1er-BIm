I am working on a text editor in javascript. I have created the front end and i need to prototype a backend. I need to model the structure of the document using this as hierarchy: Character , Word , Tag , Document I am trying to create objects based on this hierarchy. For example: Characters are represented a linked list. Word are pointers to the first and last characters. Tags are another linked list of words, and a document is a collection of words and tags. I am was wondering if anyone has a better suggestion to model these relationships as classes. I receive a character from the keyboard and i need to store this as an object in my document model. thanks
