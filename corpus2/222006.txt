I have some objects that will be created an entered into the database. There is no guarantee that any of their fields will be unique except for the auto- incrementing primary key. I would like to be able to access these objects later in the program using their primary key. What is the best way to get this key out of the database? I can think of two methods to obtain the primary key after adding the object's data to the database:   1. Find the maximum primary key as this was the one most recently added.   2. Delete the current object, compare the data in the database with the data in the program, and then create a new object based on the row that is not contained in the program. Both of these seem error-prone and hacky and I am wondering if there was a more standard way do to this.
