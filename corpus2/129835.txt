Are there any good sites / blogs / books / articles on using Java EE together with Scala? Or indeed articles saying that it should not be done. Many Scala resources talk about using Akka and Lift. Akka solves a different domain problem than Java EE. I don't know Lift, but I assume its geared towards the web end of Java EE and doesn't replace app server containers which provide transactions, security, scalability, resource management, reliability, etc. (all those things which Java EE markets itself as being good at).
