I haven't touched XHTML/CSS for many months now. I'm no where near efficient coding as I used to be. Creating more complex things is taking me a lot of time lately. What should I do to brush up on my skills? Just work a bunch of tutorials? Go through some old documentation before moving into HTML5 and CSS3?
