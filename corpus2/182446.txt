A bit of background (in case I'm mistaken)... I think I understand that (it's an oversimplification):   * manually entering codes into memory (or on a punchcard) is "first generation language"   * using mnemonics corresponding to CPU instructions would be a 2GL (like assembly language)   * C/C#/Java/Objective-C are all 3GLs   * SQL is a 4GL Where would Clojure stand in such a classification? I'm particularly confused by this Wikipedia sentence: > The archetypical example of a declarative language is the fourth generation > language SQL, as well as the family of functional languages and logic > programming. This sentence seems to imply that all functional languages are declarative. Is that correct? Then Clojure can be used in a functional way (and it is probably recommended to use it "as much as possible" in a FP style), so is Clojure a declarative language ? Also, I can see that Clojure make it really easy to create 4GLs (e.g. as embedded DSLs, like core.logic reproducing logic programming in about 200 lines of code) but is Clojure itself a 4GL?
