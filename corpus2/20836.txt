I'm trying to create a chart usually called "Helio chart". It's a chart type very suited for canonical correlation analysis involving several dependent and independent variables. However, it is a little bit difficult to find good examples of for this chart on the web and the best example I have can be found on the 6th page of this paper on the NASA website: http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/adegani/Canonical%20Correlation.pdf It is possible to create such a chart in Mathematica? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1fPk3.png)
