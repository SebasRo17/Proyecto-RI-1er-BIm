I'm just coming in to an application that's already built with a DCI architecture. I've discovered in trying to implement a feature that there is duplicate code in a use case and a model. This is not general utility code, but domain specific code about pulling data back from a service. As I understand DCI right now, I don't see an obvious good way to factor this out so I can call the same code from both places. What is the recommended way to deal with a problem like this in DCI?
