Microsoft released today the final builds of Visual Studio 2012 on MSDN. I'm trying to decide from this version comparison page which edition to install (I can install any edition I want for free). I'm a solo developer who develops mostly web apps and console apps in C# and Python. Some of the features in Ultimate/Premium look potentially cool (like UML and "historical debugging"), but most of the features I will not need, or have never heard of. On the one hand, it would be nice to have the features in case I want them someday. On the other hand, for some software products, the extra features cause the higher end editions to (1) be slower and use more memory, and (2) have a more cluttered UI. Is this the case with Visual Studio?
