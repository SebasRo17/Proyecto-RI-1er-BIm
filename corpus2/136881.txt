I want to practice Scrum on a personal project and I'm looking for Scrum management software. I've tried Jira + GreenHopper, but it has some limitations - limited nesting of user stories in particular. It's also a bug tracker at its core. I'm looking for something built for Scrum from the ground up so I don't go down too many blind alleys. As a newbie to Scrum and as a learning exercise, what software would you recommend?
