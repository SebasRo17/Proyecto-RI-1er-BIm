I'm new here, so please apologize any formal errors. I stumbled upon a somewhat simple problem. I want to import plain numbers or protected signs like `Pi`, `Cos`, `Sin` from .txt files. Somehow Mathematica does not understand that the read-in Pi is the protected `Pi` (= 3.14...). Even more simple examples seem not to work, e.g. reading in the number 5 from a .txt-file does not allow for using that 5 for further calculations. My approach was:   1. Saving the sign/number in a txt file. E.g. Pi.txt contains just "Pi" (without quotation marks).   2. My Mathematica code is               SetDirectory["C:\\Code"];     x := Import["Pi.txt"]     f[t_] = Sin[t];     Evaluate[f[x]]      Thank you for your help.
