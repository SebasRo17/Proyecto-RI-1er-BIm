I have a project which will have basic and professional edition. The professional edition will have all the features of the basic edition. I am using git to manage the project's codebase. I consider that I will fork repo of the basic edition after I completed it. Then, I will start to code the professional edition on the forked repo. My problem is that if there would be a bug in the basic edition in the future, I don't want to fix the bug in the basic edition and professional edition twice. How to handle this situation?
