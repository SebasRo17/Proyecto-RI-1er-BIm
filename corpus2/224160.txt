I have a set of integration tests written using MSTest. I want to deploy my application to various environments and run my integration tests on that environment. There are certain configuration values that change per environment which are not contained in a config file. I am delivering a COM component on a legacy machine that doesn't support per application config files. I had thought to use TestCategories to split the tests into their various environments, and only running the tests in the appropriate category. However, I am running into difficulties when attempting to set up my test dependencies with the appropriate configuration values. For instance, I have the following code in my test class:               Private Property ObjectToBeTested as BusinessObject          Protected Sub New()         ObjectToBeTested = New BusinessObject("URL to my web service.")     End Sub      Then my tests are split up like this:               <TestMethod()>     <TestCategory("DEV")>     Public Sub MyDevTest()         ' code here     End Sub          <TestMethod()>     <TestCategory("SIT")>     Public Sub MySitTest()         ' code here     End Sub      But doing it this way I have to change my URL and recompile for each environment I want to test in. I'm trying to figure out a better approach. I've thought to somehow use ClassInitialization, but I can't determine if I'm in a DEV or SIT test at that point. I'd like to have the initialization take place once at the class level based on the environment I'm in. Thoughts?
