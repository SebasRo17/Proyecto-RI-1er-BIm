Coming back to SQL Server after several years away, I find the Visual Studio Database projects (and now SSDT) very exciting, as they are aiming to offer a way to develop databases declaratively, rather than having to mess around with change scripts. However, the elephant in the room is the 'data motions' (I'm not too sure whether that's an official term): it's not too hard to automatically script a simple change in one table, but if you're normalising/denormalising, things get hairy very quickly. Gert Drapers said as much in this TechEd video, and that they're trying to work out a way of working with these complex data migrations too. **The question:** This got me thinking. How could you do this? Is there a way - even in theory - to define these data migrations declaratively? Or even a non-declarative way which could be combined elegantly with the declarative bits? Does anything like this already exist in other frameworks (I've vaguely heard something about Ruby/Rails?) _(I wondered whether to post this ondba, but I'm not sure whether they like 'good subjective questions (if this is one), feel free to migrate if necessary)_
