I'm trying to use the _Mathematica_ C Code Generator package to generate code that is to be included in a web application by a developer. I don't know any C, and this seems to be the only way to integrate my model with the web-app. I am having a lot of difficulties getting off the ground. A persistent error seems to be that my iteration indices are not recognised as integers. Here's an example:               Needs["CCodeGenerator`"]     funct = Compile[{{M, _Real, 2}, {l, _Integer}},       Module[{matrix = M, lag = l },        columns = Length[Transpose[matrix]];         Flatten[            Join[ {{{Table[1, {columns - lag + 1}]}},            Table[matrix[[;; , lag - i + 1 ;; columns - i + 1]] , {i, 1, lag}]} ] , 2]         ], {{i, _Integer}}     ]      This produces the following error: > `Compile::cpintlt`: "1;;All at position 2 of > `matrix[[1;;All,lag-i+1;;columns+i+1]]` should be either a nonzero integer > or a vector of nonzero integers; evaluation will use the uncompiled > function." Finally when I export the C code, I get errors like > `CCodeGenerate::wmreq`: "The expression > `Function[{M,l,iCompile$18},Block[{i=iCompile$18},{All,i}]]` requires > _Mathematica_ to be evaluated. The function will be generated but can be > expected to fail with a nonzero error code when executed. " Any help would be greatly appreciated.
