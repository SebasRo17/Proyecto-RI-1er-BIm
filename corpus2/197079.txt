I am wondering... Recently I have observed github; I saw many Java projects' codes which don't have copyright at their headers... I mean, as I may guess, in this case the only thing which can prove the code author is - it is author's github account; So my question is... is it safe to protect open source code with github account only or there is a more optimal way to do so? Please share your experience; Thanks
