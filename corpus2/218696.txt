I'm willing to compile certain language to C or C++ for some speedups. My idea was, though, to generate readable code and use structures such `std::vector` and similar wherever I can, expecting CLANG to do the trick of optimizing it as much as it can. I notice that some languages that compile to C or C++ are nothing like that, though. Looking on the code generated by Chicken Scheme, for example, is scary. This, for example, is a snippet generated from `(fn (a b) (sqrt (* a a) (* b b)))`:               float f_(float a,float b){         float b_=a*a;         float c_=b*b;         float d_=b_+c_;         float e_=sqrt(d_);         return e_;     };      Is there a particular reason for those languages to do that? Is my approach wrong in some aspect? EDIT: to make it clear, this is an example of "readable" code generated from my language. Look at code generated from Chicken Scheme and it looks like an UFO building manual wrote in an alien language.
