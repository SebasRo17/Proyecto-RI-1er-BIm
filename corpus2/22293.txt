Let's say I have some data generated by anything. For practical sake, let's say I was able to generate a sequence of numbers through a recursion and I listed them out through a table of numbers.               F[1] = 1;     F[n_] := 3*F[n - 1]     H = Table[F[n], {n, 1, 10}]      Now I set the table of values to a variable 'w'               ListPlot[H]      Here I am plotting the data. What I want to do now is to "fit" a curve that connects all those points. I just want to see the fitted curve on the plot together the data points. I don't even need (or want to) see the equation that best fits the data. I tried using NonlinearModel and Fit, neither works well for me. The recursion is just an example. I could of course product new data from something else
