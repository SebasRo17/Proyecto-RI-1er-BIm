Personal context: I've been learning C++ formally the last 6 months at university. Prior to this I dabbled in JavaScript for a year. Now I am considering learning Python during a month off school. By splitting my focus early in the learning process am I degrading the efficiency of my learning? Should I spend the month off continuing in C++? Or is it never too early to learn a new language?
