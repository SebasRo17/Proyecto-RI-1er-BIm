I have a customer who has a client app and when they log in to their client app, they will see a link to my website. When they click on the link, it should log in them in automatically to the website without asking for the credentials. Is this only possible if the username/password are the same between the client app and the website? Also, what if the username/password is not known for the client app? How is this handled? I have heard of technologies such as openId, oAuth, etc, but these don't seem to fit my scenario where there is an existing client app that already has a membership base and it not needs access to my website. I am not sure what approach to make take here? If the above is confusing, I will give a scenario:   1. User A logs into there desktop application.   2. User A clicks a link to go to wwww.mysite.com.   3. User A is authenticated and authorized for www.mysite.com, so they do not need to provide credentials.
