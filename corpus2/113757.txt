I'm having some trouble understanding what a design pattern is and isn't, particularly with respect to version control systems like CVS and Git. Is "push, pop, stack" a "design pattern"? If yes, is CVS the same design pattern? > ...clients connect to the server in order to "check out" a complete copy of > the project, work on this copy and then later "check in" their changes. If yes to both, then are DVCSes like Git a different pattern? Which one? If these aren't design patterns, why aren't they? What should they be called?
