I'm a newb to cocoa programming and looking around in various open source code online I see things like:               #pragma mark global variable declaration      and I was wondering what the meaning of "pragma mark" is in that is it any different than a // or /* (comment) block..like is it used throughout the program, and is there a commonly used methodology to it, or is it more or less a way for programmers to organize and collect their code for themselves (and others if the case may be) to use later? I found this article: http://inchoo.net/mobile-development/iphone- development/what-is-a-pragma-mark/ and it is pretty helpful, but I just needed to clarify again if it's more or less used by the coder or used by XCode? Thanks!
