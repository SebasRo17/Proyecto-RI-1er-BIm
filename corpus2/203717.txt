I'm new to TFS branches, and have opted to set up a \Dev and \Main branch (ultimately there will be release branches too). I'm using TFS2012. My understanding is that I will work on the \Dev branch on a day to day basis. When a bug is fixed or a user story is completed, I will merge \Dev to \Main, build, and give that to the tester. In \Dev I have a policy to ensure that check-ins are associated with a work item. However when I merge from \Dev to \Main, and check-in that merge, what would I associate that check-in with, if anything? The reason I ask is because I'm wondering how someone could find out what changes went into a particular \Main build? It's obvious in \Dev, as you'll see the associated work items in the build output. But there will be no such history in \Main, unless I associate the merge check-in with some sort of work item. The tester needs to know what's gone into a particular \Main build, but how? Is it a manual process, where the developer simply gives him a list of changes that have been merged into \Main? I've read the MS branching/merging guidance, but it doesn't really shed light on this kind of thing.
