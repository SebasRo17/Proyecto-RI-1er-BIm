re: Version 9. I typically write concise code and make a real effort to refactor. As such debugging has tended to take care of itself. Recently, I've needed to assemble applications of more complexity, in that it they have deeper hierarchies of functions, lots of them, and often from multiple packages. So I've started to want just a bit more debugging help. I prefer as simple development environment as possible, so I'd like to focus on debugging with native functionality of `Breakpoints`, rather than debugging functions from third parties or Workbench. I just need to see what goes on in the code. While, several questions on the site explore strategies and tactics for debugging. I have not found a concise description of how to effectively use the `Breakpoints` debugging functionality accessible from the menu items:               Evaluation > Debugger Controls > Show Breakpoints Window      either on this site, on Wolfram's site, or in the Mathematica documentation. Opening the Breakpoints debugging window doesn't tell one much. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HpqAZ.png) One would expect a clear way to set up breaks and variables to watch, and a way to run code to the specified point. In particular can and how can one:   * set a series of breakpoints both at a functional level and within a function and   * step through processing, point to point? Some examples or mini-overview? Thx.
