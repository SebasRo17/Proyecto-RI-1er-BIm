I have been working on a project recently that uses a pretty comprehensive framework built by someone else. The framework is free to use commercially and privately as anybody sees fit, so there are no legal reasons not to use it. I do find myself, however, uncomfortable about the fact that I'm creating projects and submitting them without fully understanding everything that goes into a project. The entire framework of the project is built by someone else and I haven't had the time to go through it all and what I have gone through is slightly confusing. I'm a (ground up) kind of person by nature so building something off of another project makes me nervous, but is this a common practice to do even if you don't fully understand how or why the code you're using works? I'm mainly wondering if using other peoples code is a common practice when:   * You don't have the time to go through said code to fully understand what its doing, but you know it works (via tests and other reviews)   * You are submitting a project based on said code, but have only been exposed to the top layer you wrote yourself.
