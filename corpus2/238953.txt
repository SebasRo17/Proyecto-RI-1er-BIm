In some languages (C++, Java, Ruby, etc.) an assignment returns a value and can be used in an expression:               x = (y = z);    // ok, 'x' gets the value of 'z'      In other languages (Ada, VHDL), an assignment is a proper statement and cannot be used in as expression:               x := (y := z);   -- error!      However, in both cases, it is possible to find teaching material where the assignment symbol is called the "assignment operator". My question is, is it technically correct to call the assignment symbol an "operator" in the second case, where it is actually a statement, does not return a value, and cannot be used in the middle of an expression?
