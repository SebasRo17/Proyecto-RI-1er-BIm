I was asked to make a table in which developers in team could use to evaluate their Java level (Maybe from 1 to 5). And then they will know what they are lacking so they could focus to learn on that technique. I think about Skill Matrix but don't know how to start. Could you please help me some hint? Thank you in advance. * * * As Paul commented, i would like to update some information. our software is just related to Web-Application using Core Java, JSP, JSF, Struts, Spring, Hibernate. Desktop application is using Core Java, Swing to develop
