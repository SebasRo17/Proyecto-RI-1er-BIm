I am now struggling to understand code that contains the following (simplified) `Manipulate` structure.               Manipulate[         complexparts[E^(I Pi t)],      {{t, 1/4.}, 0., 2},      {{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]} &}, None}]      I am having difficulty with the last line: `{{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]}&}, None}`. Somehow, this creates a "pure function" with a name "complexparts," which is then used above in the line               complexparts[E^(I Pi t)]      I tried to execute these independently outside the body of code so I could watch them do what they do, but without success. I evaluated:               {{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]} &}, None}      and then:               complexparts[x+Iy]      But my output was just:               complexparts(x+I y)      Can I get some help in understanding how `{{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]} &}, None}` works? And what does the word `None` do?
