I am working in a small team on a large complex software project. I want to document all requirements, but I've been told by my manager that it is waste of time. I have tried the same with design and functionality, and I encountered the same discouragement. I am responsible for anything that goes wrong, and obviously, I don't remember everything. Still, I've been told not to create documentation. How should I approach this problem?
