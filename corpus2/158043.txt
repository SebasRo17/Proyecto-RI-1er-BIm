I'm very new to source control management and one thing puzzles me: is it possible to search through the whole repository for a string? For example I'm tracking one file, which has 100 commits and I would like to see all the version of the file which contain "xyz" inside. Is this possible? I'm using various GUI clients and non of them has this..? Yes, they can search trough commit messages but I want to find a version even when the commit message does not contain the string. To put it differently, which GUI client has such a feature? I don't care about which SCM it uses - git, hg, bazaar, all are fine.
