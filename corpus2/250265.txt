I have a site that heavily relies on high res images being uploaded and viewed constantly. Currently it's hosted internally which keeps everything fast. I now want to move the site externally, but I am not quite sure how to keep the image viewing fast. What is important to know, is that the connection from the internal location to the external site is slow. With messaging (RabbitMQ) I can make the sending part work quite nicely. The viewing part is the thing I can't figure out. What I would like is that when viewing an image, first a local version is requested, if it's not present it will request it from the external server. Thoughts?
