I am attempting to calculate the mean curvature [1, 2] of a surface defined by a function of `x` and `y`. My function is rather simple:               f = 1 - 0.05(Cos[2 π x/L] + Sin[2 π x/L])Cos[2 π y/L];      So to calculate the mean curvature, this is what I do (`κ` is the mean curvature below):               L=79.1829;     f = 1 - 0.05(Cos[2 π x/L] + Sin[2 π x/L])Cos[2 π y/L];     κ=((1 + D[f,x]^2) D[f,y,y]-2 D[f,x]D[f,y]D[D[f,x],y]+       (1+D[f,y]^2)D[f,x,x])/((1 + D[f,x]^2 + D[f,y]^2)^1.5)      And then I plot it as :               (*Surface defined by f*)     Plot3D[       f,       {x, 0, L},       {y, 0, L}       ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yX7l9.png)                (*Plot of kappa*)      Plot3D[       κ,       {x, 0, L},       {y, 0, L}       ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ez4VU.png)   1. I wasn't entirely sure of whether to post this question in math.se or mathematica.se but I did so on mathematica.se since it does have a _Mathematica_ component to it.   2. Is what I am doing correct? I ask because this seems rather trivial.   3. Does anyone have any suggestion as to do this in a better way, perhaps plot it in a better way? A little background: * * * I am trying to prove quantitatively that different initial conditions created by the surface like `f` would engender different amounts of curvature for a fluid dynamics problem.
