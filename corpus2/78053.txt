I have a few years worth of C++ professional experience under my belt. Recently, I decided to look for a new job, and found out that find a C++ job is not as easy as it used to be. Nearly all jobs posting and head hunters are in the market for Java/C# developers.   Event though I have a some experience with Java, it's not enough to make me interesting to any of the companies I applied for. I've decided that after I get a new job (C++ as it appears) I must get my hands dirty with Java or C# . Currently, my only possible plan is to either join or start my own open source project. But will it be enough? Can such a project replace 2-3 years of working in a commercial company? Is there another way to make the transition?
