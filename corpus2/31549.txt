I'm trying to used the Coefficient command to extract the numerical values in front of a Chebyshev polynomial. I know that there is a numerical way to do this, presented in numerical recipes, which I have already done. But I think using the Coefficient function would be easier and possibly less prone to numerical issues. For example when I use the method from numerical recipes Mathematica thinks that some of my Chebyshev coefficients have an imaginary part, which I know they certainly do not. This is what I have so far:               test = {6.6358882978163365`, 2.12043877554564`, 7.221785806754298`, 8.556762565842575`,          0.8777943247026911`}          test2[y_] = Sum[test[[i + 1]]*ChebyshevT[i, y], {i, 0, 4}]          6.63589 + 2.12044 y + 7.22179 (-1 + 2 y^2) + 8.55676 (-3 y + 4 y^3) +      0.877794 (1 - 8 y^2 + 8 y^4)      Then I try               Table[Coefficient[test2[y], ChebyshevT[i, y]], {i, 0, 4}]      which resulted in an error, so I just trying getting the coefficients one by one to see if I could figure out the issue. Please bear with me,               In[38]:= Coefficient[test2[y], ChebyshevT[0, y]]          During evaluation of In[38]:= Coefficient::ivar: 1 is not a valid variable. >>          Out[38]= Coefficient[     6.63589 + 2.12044 y + 7.22179 (-1 + 2 y^2) +  8.55676 (-3 y + 4 y^3)      + 0.877794 (1 - 8 y^2 + 8 y^4), 1]          In[39]:= Coefficient[test2[y], ChebyshevT[1, y]]          Out[39]= -23.5498          In[40]:= Coefficient[test2[y], ChebyshevT[2, y]]          Out[40]= 7.22179          In[41]:= Coefficient[test2[y], ChebyshevT[3, y]]          Out[41]= 8.55676          In[42]:= Coefficient[test2[y], ChebyshevT[4, y]]          Out[42]= 0.877794      So, the Coefficient command is not working for the zeroth order and first order Chebyshev polynomial. I think I understand why it won't work for the zeroth order. The Coefficient function probably needs a symbolic argument and not a number like "1". Is there anyway to fix this? More confusing to me is why it fails for the first order Chebyshev polynomial. I can't figure that part out at all. * * * The code               Table[Coefficient[test2[y], z = ChebyshevT[i, y]; If[z === 1, Sequence @@ {y, 0}, z]], {i,         0, 4}]      provide by Nasser, seems to work, it gives               {0.291897, -23.5498, 7.22179, 8.55676, 0.877794}      But I'm starting to understand that there is a fundamental problem with what I'm trying to do. When I give the command               Coefficient[test2[y], ChebyshevT[1, y]]      Mathematica just interprets that as               Coefficient[test2[y], y]      and the adds together all of the numerical coefficients in front of anything that has a "y" in the term. Ideally I want Mathematica to output 2.12044, but it is adding up all of the terms that have a "y" in front of them. I guess I will just have to stick with the method found in numerical recipes.
