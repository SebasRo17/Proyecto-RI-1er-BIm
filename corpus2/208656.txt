I already posted this question on SO and it did ok. It was unfortunately closed though(only needs one vote to reopen) but someone suggested I post it on here as it is a better fit so the following is literally a copy paste of the question * * * I was reading the comments on this answer and I saw this quote. > Object instantiation and object-oriented features are blazing fast to use > (faster than C++ in many cases) because they're designed in from the > beginning. and Collections are fast. Standard Java beats standard C/C++ in > this area, even for most optimized C code. One user (with really high rep I might add) boldly defended this claim, stating that   1. heap allocation in java is better than C++'s    2. and added this statement defending the collections in java  > And Java collections are fast compared to C++ collections due largely to the > different memory subsystem. So my question is can any of this really be true, and if so why is java's heap allocation so much faster.
