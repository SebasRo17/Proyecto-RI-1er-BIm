I'm working on a messaging application, based on a server/client architecture. Now I am thinking about the way how to store the user credentials. It's not a huge number, just about 20 entries with their User-IDs, Usernames and hashed passwords. Storing it with a SQL Server in my opinion is overkill. Is it better to store it in sort of a text file or in a SQLite database file? These methods would keep the server portable and the installation simple. And is password hashing enough to keep the passwords secret? What is the best way to handle this?
