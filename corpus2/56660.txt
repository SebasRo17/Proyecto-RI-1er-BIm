I want to cause a button to open a local html file using the default web browser. When I use:               Hyperlink["Play","myfile.html"]      Clicking on the link opens the html file in a notebook. If I use               Hyperlink["Play","http://myfile.html"]      My browser (FireFox) opens and fails looking for "www.myfile.html". I know this may be trivial but can anyone help with this?
