I have been trying to understand the DOM, and although I have a fair idea of what it is, there are certain ideas I just cannot pin down. I will list down what I think the DOM is and my questions will be inline.   1. The DOM is a fully object-oriented representation of the web page. The W3C DOM standard forms the basis of the DOM implemented in most modern browsers. _So does the DOM talk about how an XML/HTML document is represented as an object model?_   2. The DOM does not specify that documents must be implemented as a tree or a grove, nor does it specify how the relationships among objects be implemented.  _In what other ways can the document be represented?_   3. When you do something like this -              document.write('welcome to my home page!');      the document object is provided by the DOM. The write methods are the interfaces that are exposed to JavaScript by the DOM. _So the objects and its methods are created as JavaScript objects by the DOM parser and then presented to the JavaScript engine? Or are the objects and methods within the DOM parsing engine in their own native language? And is exposed to the JavaScript engine? If this is so, then what is responsible for translating from JavaScript to the native language?_   4. What are language bindings ? The language binding is the set of objects native to the language in question that implements each of the interfaces in the DOM specification. Developers can create language bindings from the DOM to their language simply by following the IDL (Interface Definition Language) in the DOM specification. _So if the DOM parsing engine is implemented in say C++, does that mean that when you create language bindings by following the IDL, you are just creating objects in the specific language, i.e C++ that your DOM parsing engine is built with?_
