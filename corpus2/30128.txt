I have a symbolic solution to a linear system with respect to some variables a[i,j] which depend on a parameter t.               sol=Solve[...,Table[a[i,j],{i,0,n},{j,0,n}]]      I would like to make functions from the solutions. Something like               a[i,j][t_]:=a[i,j]/.sol[[1]]      When I do it by hand, everything is fine. But when I try to get it in any loop, like               Do[{a[i, j][t] := a[i, j] /. sol[[1]]}, {i, 0, n}, {j, 0, n}]      it doesn't work. For example, when I'm trying to look at a[0,1][t] it gives me               a[i,j]      How can one define a family of functions in a loop?
