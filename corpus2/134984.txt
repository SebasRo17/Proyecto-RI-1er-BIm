> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to promote an open-source project? I've done quite a lot of work in my spare time on a project that was mostly for my own learning experience and I'm quite pleased with the results. I've used github as a source control management, so the code is already public in a sense. The code in question is a library that is quite specialized in it's application, and pretty well commented and understandable. It would probably be a good resource for students learning about the algorithms being used. What I'm really looking for is the best way to see if there is any audience for what I've done. It's no big deal if there isn't but if there are I'd like people to know about my code, and find it if they are searching for something similar. How to go about this task in the best way? I do have a blog and I intend to introduce the code there, but the audience is so far quite small - mostly co- workers and friends. I'm also unsure about going to specialized sites and advertise, especially as I'm not really part of a community around these types of libraries. Any thoughts and ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for reading. **Edit:** I'm not sure if I should post a link to the project in question on github, or refrain. It's not my intention for this question to come off as advertising. Also, it's amazing how I always find good links _after_ I posted my question. http://producingoss.com/ seems like a good fit.
