I am a C# programmer, and most of my development is for websites along with a few Windows application. As far as C goes, I haven't used it in a long time, as there was no need to. It came to me as a surprise when one of my friends said that she needs to learn C for testing jobs, while I was helping her learn C#. I figured that someone would only learn C for testing only if there is development done in C. In my knowledge, all the development related to COM and hardware design are also done in C++. Therefore, learning C doesn't make sense if you need to use C++. I also don't believe in historic significance, so why waste time and money in learning C? Is C is still used in any kind of new software development or anything else?
