I am trying to compile a little summation function. As far as I understand, because the built-in `Sum` function can also return `NaN` objects I have to make sure only numbers get out before returning.               X = Compile[{}, (        result = Sum[i, {i, 10}];        If[NumberQ[result], Return[result], Abort[]];        )];      The problem is that I keep getting the following two warnings... > CompiledFunction::cfse: Compiled expression True should be a machine-size > real number. CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation > at instruction 2; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation. I guess the glitch is in the `NumberQ` function and its return type. Any ideas on how to handle this issue correctly and effectively? **EDIT:** When I omit the check for numeric values while inserting a Return[] statement Mathematica falls back to the uncompiled version (warning: Compile::cret).
