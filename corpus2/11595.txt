I want to use a self-written package in a parallel computation. However while `Needs["mypackage`"]` works without problems, `ParallelNeeds["mypackage`"]` can't open my package. The immediate reason is related to the fact that I added to `$Path`, and the package is in one of the directories I've added. `ParallelTable[$Path,{1}]` reveals that this addition is not propagated to the subkernels, despite the fact that it is changed in the user kernel init file (`$UserBaseDirectory/Kernel/init.m`), and thus long before any subkernels are launched in the Notebook. Explicitly using `DistributeDefinitions[$Path]` didn't help either. So my question is: Why isn't the $Path propagated to the kernels, and more importantly, what can I do about it?
