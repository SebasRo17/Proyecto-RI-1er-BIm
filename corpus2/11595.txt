Lately we have decided in our company to have a monthly 30-60 minutes talk on a subject that relates to C#/.Net programming or anything else that will make us better in our work.   We are currently programming in C# 3.0 with .NET 3.5 in VS 2008. So... I've tried to come up with a topic for the talk (Something that is not too trivial but still could be applied as a guide for better programming, and not just an ad-hoc solution for specific problem) but nothing has come to my mind. I will be more than happy to hear about such topics that could fit my need. Feel free to elaborate or provide references to any resource that would help :)
