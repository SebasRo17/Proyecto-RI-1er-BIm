list = {11.5575, 11.397, 5.52734, 4.0878, 2.54815, 1.86652, 2.55028,     2.14952, 1.6242, 1.34117}      I have a list of numbers. How do I make a function that creates a new list, where the first entry is equal to               {list[[1]], list[[1]] + list[[2]], list[[1]] + list [[2]] + list[[3]]}       etc until the end of the list. I ask because my real list is quite a bit longer than just 10 entries, and writing this out would get far too long to handle.
