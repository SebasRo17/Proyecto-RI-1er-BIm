I would like to group the elements of row c of the following dataset according to the values in the columns a and b. That is **Go from here** ![dataset2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JUQXC.jpg) **To here** ![grp](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TGpw5.jpg) And then I would like to print this on a grid, without visible lists (like {2,7})                   1      2      x  1      4      y  2          7        z  7      8      **Code** This is the dataset I used               dataset2 = Dataset[{     <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> "x", "c" -> 1|>,     <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> "y", "c" -> 2|>,     <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> "z", "c" -> 7|>,     <|"a" -> 2, "b" -> "x", "c" -> 4|>,     <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> "y", "c" -> 7|>,     <|"a" -> 2, "b" -> "z", "c" -> 8|>}]      and this is the dataset2 after grouping on columns a an b               grp = Dataset[{<|"b" -> "x", "a=1" -> {1},      "a=2" -> {4}|>, <|"b" -> "x", "a=1" -> {2, 7},      "a=2" -> {}|>, <|"b" -> "x", "a=1" -> {7}, "a=2" -> {8}|>} ]      **Example from the help** that comes close to what I want to do               dataset = Dataset[{     <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> "x", "c" -> {1}|>,     <|"a" -> 2, "b" -> "y", "c" -> {2, 3}|>,     <|"a" -> 3, "b" -> "z", "c" -> {3}|>,     <|"a" -> 4, "b" -> "x", "c" -> {4, 5}|>,     <|"a" -> 5, "b" -> "y", "c" -> {5, 6, 7}|>,     <|"a" -> 6, "b" -> "z", "c" -> {}|>}]      ![dataset](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dJvrq.jpg)               dataset[GroupBy[Key["b"]], Catenate, "c"]
