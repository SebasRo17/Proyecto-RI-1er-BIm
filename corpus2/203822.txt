I don't know whether this is even possible or I imagine (according to my habit of over thinking) will bring through numerous issues but let me give it a go. I have an idea where I would like a single web service which a user will send a request to, for example logging in. The response back dictates a URL where they get redirected too so essentially this means for me less maintenance in updating web services etc as its all in one place. What I am trying to do is have a single service that routes people to the correct server to get data from instead of having the end user to have knowledge of the endpoint address etc. For example, I have a system on the web and want it visible to my windows, android and apple devices but there is a specific site for each client. Ideally, I only want the user to enter their login credentials and the web service does the rest, i.e. fetches data from the correct data source. I imagine this is common practice for many systems but I guess is there a risk factor in that a user being sent data from another request if they happen at the same time? Obviously this is a huge flaw and perhaps I am going completely the wrong route here. I would appreciate any resources to links, books etc. I was unsure of what to search for on the web so thought this is the best place for such questions. This is a system I am developing to help me understand web services better in general. A little project I am working on to help me explore different techniques and approaches towards development :)
