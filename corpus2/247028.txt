Would you rather:               $this->getDoctrine()->getManager()->persist($currency);     $this->getDoctrine()->getManager()->persist($user);     $this->getDoctrine()->getManager()->flush();      or               $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();     $em->persist($currency);     $em->persist($user);     $em->flush();      Is using a aliasing variable for faster coding a smart choice, or should the programmer rather use variables only if they are really variables.
