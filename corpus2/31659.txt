I am new with Mathematica, but am trying to fill an area between two parametric plots               ParametricPlot[{{u + Sin[u], -Cos[u]}, {u + Sin[u + Pi], Cos[u + Pi]}},      {u, 0, Pi}, Axes -> True ]      which thus far are nice, clean curves: ![1](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~stuhlmeier/Trochoid.png) Thanks to the answers here: How do I fill in a circle made by ParametricPlot with one solid color? I became aware of `ListLinePlot`. However, my `ListLinePlot` for this situation               ListLinePlot[Table[{{u + Sin[u], -Cos[u]}, {u + Sin[u + Pi], Cos[u + Pi]}},     {u, 0, Pi, 0.0005}], Mesh -> All,      MeshStyle -> Directive[AbsolutePointSize[0.0005], Black],      PlotStyle -> Directive[Thin, LightGray]]      ![2](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~stuhlmeier/Filled_Trochoid.png) does not seem to give as good a resolution no matter how finely I subdivide the interval, and also produces problems with self-intersection near the boundaries when plotting several periods. In particular, the contrast with similar curves filled in `Plot` is striking. Is there a smarter way to fill the area between these parametric curves? Perhaps using something else than `ListLinePlot`? Thanks!
