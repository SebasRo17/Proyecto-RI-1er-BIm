I am working on a large asp.net app as a single developer. I will often work on a number of change requests concurrently. For example, a change required to the Finance component and a change required to the sales component. I sometimes create a separate project to hold the changes and then reference the main application (file reference to the assembly). Is this a common approach or are there any tool/techniques that make this easier? For example, I make a change to the sales component, I will create a new project (SalesChange.sln) and if I make a change to the Finance component then I will create a new project called FinanceChange.sln. FinanceChange.sln and SalesChange.sln reference MainProject.sln and will eventually be migrated to MainProject.sln.
