When I create a new application, and I am choosing a name, most common dictionary words appear to be unavailable, along with even some of the more esoteric ones including 'aaaaaa' (I've tried variable length, and different letters). However, most of these applications don't actually seem to exist. So either all of these names have been taken, but none of these people have bothered to build even a hello world app on it, or there are additional naming rules that app engine enforces beyond > Application Identifier must be between 6 and 30 characters. Lowercase > letters, digits, and hyphens are acceptable characters. Leading and trailing > hyphens are prohibited. I'd like to rule out the later -- are there any additional naming rules that GAE imposes?
