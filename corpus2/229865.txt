I have a friend who asked me whether I can be her mentor as a programmer. I had to tutor several junior programmers in the past so I have experience working with / tutoring people on different skill levels. This is the first time however when there was no **pre-filtering** and the future programmer is an **absolute beginner**. Is there a method that has a chance to work in order to tell someone's innate talent level?
