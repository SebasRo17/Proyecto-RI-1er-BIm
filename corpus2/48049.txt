I need some help with NIntegrate. I pasted the code that I wrote below; I know that up to "de" is correct. What I would like to do is NIntegrate de w.r.t phi{0,0.1} and curlE{-10,10}. The final answer should be just a number, but I am not sure if I am going about this wrong.                e = 1.60217657*10^-19;      n = 10^-10/e;      r = 1.5;      sigma = 50*10^-6;      p[phi_] := (r*phi^3)/(24 sigma);      g[curlEprime_] := Exp[-((curlEprime)^2/2)];           gSomething[phi_, curlE_] :=  With[{p = p[phi]}, p^(-(1/3)) (g[curlE - p] - g[curlE - 4             p]) + NIntegrate[     1/(curlE - curlEprime)^(1/3) g'[curlEprime], {curlEprime, curlE - p, curlE}]]           de[phi_, curlE_] := (2*e^2*n)/(3^(1/3)*Sqrt[2 Pi]*r^(2/3)*      sigma^(4/3))*gSomething[phi, curlE]           de1[phi_, curlE_] := NIntegrate[de[phi, curlE], {phi, 0, 0.103}]           de2[curlE_] := NIntegrate[de1[curlE], {curlE, -1, 1}]      So, at the end de2 should give a numerical value.
