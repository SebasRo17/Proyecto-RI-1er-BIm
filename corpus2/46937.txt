I want to understand the behavior of Mathematica for the following code.               E^(-m0 + e1/2 + 1/2 (-e1 - e2) + e2/ 2 + (e1 + e2)/2) /. {Power[E, a___] -> Power[E, Expand[a]]}      I expected to see               E^(-m0 + e1/2 + e2/2)      but instead, Mathematica returns               E^(-m0 + e1/2 + 1/2 (-e1 - e2) + e2/ 2 + (e1 + e2)/2)      Why is it? If there is any suggestion, could you reply to me? Thanks a lot.
