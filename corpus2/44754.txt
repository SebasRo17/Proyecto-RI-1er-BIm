I am trying to solve $$u_t=\frac{1}{4}u_{xx}$$ $-\infty<x<\infty,\: t>0$ With the initial condition $u(x,0)=\phi(x)$ where $$ \phi(x)= \left\\{ \begin{array}{lr} 1 & |x|<1\\\ 0 & |x|\geq 1 \end{array} \right.$$ So I initially typed in my piecewise function like this               ϕ[x_] := Piecewise[{{1, Abs[x]<1}, {0, Abs[x] >= 1}}]      But I have also tried this, (are they both valid, or is just one, or is neither?)               ϕ[x_] := Piecewise[{{1, -1 < x < 1}, {0, x >= 1 || x <= -1}}]      Then, following the mathematica examples I tried to solve the differential equation:               pde = D[u[x, t], t] - 1/4 D[u[x, t], {x, 2}] == 0     soln = DSolve[{pde, u[x, 0] == ϕ[x]}, u[x, t], {x, t}]      Which outputs a bunch of weird stuff, not the solution (I think) I was expecting. If my math is correct I think the solution to this would involve the error function. Any tips to where I might be going wrong would be aprreciated!
