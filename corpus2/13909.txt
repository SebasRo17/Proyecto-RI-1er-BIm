I'd like to create a keyboard shortcut that will allow me to select all of the cells from the current cell until the end of the notebook, similar to how `Shift``Ctrl``End` functions when editing text in most Windows applications. By editing `KeyEventTranslations.tr`, I've already created a shortcut using `Shift``Ctrl``A` that allows me to select the current cell (rather then pressing `Ctrl``.` repeatedly). I'd like to then use another shortcut that would allow me to avoid having to hold down `Shift` and press `â†“` over and over until I reach the bottom. Any ideas?
