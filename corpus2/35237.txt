I'm trying to use `Get` to load some pretty substantial packages from a custom menu in the _Mathematica_ toolbar (added via MenuSetup.tr).   The problem is, the standard 5-second evaluation timeout seems to apply to commands executed with `KernelExecute`, so only a fraction of my `Get` is evaluated before the command times out. I'm wondering whether there's an option that can be passed to `KernelExecute` (or to `Item` / `MenuItem`) that will remove that time constraint so that my command can be executed completely.
