I know some people are massive proponents of test driven development. I have used unit tests in the past, but only to test operations that can be tested easily or which I believe will quite possibly be correct. Complete or near complete code coverage sounds like it would take a lot of time.   1. What projects do you use test-driven development for? Do you only use it for projects above a certain size?   2. Should I be using it or not? Convince me!
