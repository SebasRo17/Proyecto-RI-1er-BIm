I generally use NDSolve for stiff non linear partial differential equations of 4th order. I find that a BDF1 method generally does well to placate my beast of a PDE. I've also tried out `"MaxSteps"` to curtail my simulation to a certain number of time steps. I understand that BDF and other methods for stiff equations are adaptive time step methods and I notice that `"Fixed"` step is not a valid option for BDF at least. Is there any way I could solve stiff equations with a fixed time step? I realize that NDSolve knows best but it would give me more flexibility to play around with the wonderful options in NDSolve if there were a way to use fixed time steps. **> My references:** this and this **> This is how I tried using`"FixedStep"`:** `Method -> {"FixedStep", "Method" -> {"BDF", "MaxDifferenceOrder" -> 1}}` Obviously this was incorrect as `"BDF"` isn't a submethod.
