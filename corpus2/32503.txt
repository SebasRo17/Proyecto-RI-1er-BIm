During the execution of the following code a column of three lists and two sliders are displaying in output. The first list updates if either a or b changes. The second list updates only if the value of a is changed. Similarly, the third list updates only if the value of b is changed.               a = 0;     b = 0;     Column[     {       Dynamic[{a, b}, TrackedSymbols :> {a,b}],       Dynamic[{a, b}, TrackedSymbols :> {a}],       Dynamic[{a, b}, TrackedSymbols :> {b}],       Slider[Dynamic[a], {0, 1}],       Slider[Dynamic[b], {0, 1}]     }     ]      Next I would like to replace {a,b} by a list x with two elements:               x = {0, 0};     Column[     {       Dynamic[{x[[1]], x[[2]]}, TrackedSymbols :> {x}],       Dynamic[{x[[1]], x[[2]]}, TrackedSymbols :> {x[[1]]}],       Dynamic[{x[[1]], x[[2]]}, TrackedSymbols :> {x[[2]]}],       Slider[Dynamic[x[[1]]], {0, 1}],       Slider[Dynamic[x[[2]]], {0, 1}]     }     ]      It is easy to check that now only the first list updates. Please help me to solve this problem.
