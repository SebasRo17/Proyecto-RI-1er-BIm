I need to have a queue mirrored in two distributed servers with WAN between them. Does the RabbitMQ suit for my situation? Or should I start with another AMQP solution? Which? Or non-AMQP? What about Redis? **Some more details:** Script at server "A" sends the "x" command locally. Script at server "B" receives the "x" command locally too. And vice versa with another queue. If there's a problem with availability of server B, it still receives the "x" command, just a bit later, when it becomes available. But my program does not need to watch that. Queue broker must control the cross-machine delivery.
