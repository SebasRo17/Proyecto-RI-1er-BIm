Have a significant amount of a Data Warehousing application written in Javascript. The application is set up so that the Javascript code runs in a web browser (Chrome). Of course, running a Data Warehousing application inside a web browser is pretty dumb (the application is of significant scale that the rest of it runs on a cloud server cluster). Would like to install NodeJS onto the server cluster. A major concern is losing the ease of debugging Javascript inside the Chrome web browser. The developer tools for Chrome are awesome. It is incredibly easy to set break points and view variable values and application state using the Chrome web browser. When we move the Javascript code to the server, what is a good IDE to use with NodeJS? Right now, the server is running Python. For that we use PyCharm and have remote debugging set up such that we can debug line-by-line, view variable values and application state within PyCharm on our local machines even though the code executes on the server. Is there a way to do this with Javascript and NodeJS? Thanks so much!
