I am designing a high volume web service which will rely on a central database containing objects of a single JSON type. Currently I am considering using ChunkDB to store the objects and retrieve the objects using views (RESTful API). Some of the views may be complex. The amount of data stored in the database will be limited as objects will 'expire'. Is a sensible approach to the problem? What are the other options?
