I'm trying to understand the following cross-browser layout: http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-2-column-left-menu.htm but I'm having some confusion with some of its parts and there isn't enough information on the page or in the css comments to help me.     * What is the purpose of the .colleft div? Why can't the 2 columns be directly under the .colmask container?   * Why does the .colleft div have a right 75%? I don't understand its purpose/benefit.   * Why don't the widths of .col1 and .col2 add up to 100%?   * How was left:102% calculated for .col1 and left:6% for .col2? The comments for this are not very clear to me. How is it any different from not even specifiying a left/right css property?
