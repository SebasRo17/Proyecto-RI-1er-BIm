I created a grid of size 200,200 and placed a button in it of size 200Ã—200.               Grid[{{Button["Button", Null, ImageSize -> {200, 200}]}},             Background -> Red, ItemSize -> {15, 15},             Alignment -> {Center, Center}, Frame -> True]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KhfCr.png) When I tried increasing the width of the button, the edges on the 2 sides didn't appear as expected, but when I increased the height of the button, the grid itself gets enlarged to the button's height. I don't want this enlargement to happen. How can I avoid it?
