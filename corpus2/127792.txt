I'd like my app to show locations of nearby restaurants, with different categories. It would have a screen with a button to select which categories should be shown. Depending on which button is pressed, map pins come up at nearby locations, and the pins can be pressed for more information. For storing all the restaurant data, should I create a list using 'enum', similar to the Apple sample code 'MapCallouts'?
