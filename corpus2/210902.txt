This is the link: https://gist.github.com/jgarber/2302238 I am new to github and web development.So please bear with my questions. I would like to use the responsive video code on the link mentioned above, for a commercial website I am building. I see that the code is posted under the 'public' section but there is a copyright attached as well. And, the file name is MIT-LICENSE.txt. Does this have any connection with the MIT-License? Two questions: a) Can I use this code by giving an attribution? b) And, if I can, under which license can I use the code and what sort of attribution is required?
