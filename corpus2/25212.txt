I found a code for Mie Scattering from 2007, written for Mathematica. I have edited it quite a bit, since there are package definitions that we don't need, etc. But I am having difficulties figuring out why the plot with ShowLegends does not work. The command is               CLegend = {{{RGBColor[1, 0, 0],       "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(C\), \(scat\)]\)"}, {RGBColor[0, 0, 1],       "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(C\), \(abs\)]\)"}, {RGBColor[0, 0, 0],       "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(C\), \(ext\)]\)"}},      LegendPosition -> {-.55, 0.3}, LegendSize -> {0.25, 0.25},      LegendShadow -> {0, 0}};          ShowLegend[     Show[CScatPlot, CAbsPlot, CExtPlot,      DisplayFunction -> Identity], DisplayFunction,      CLegend -> $DisplayFunction ]      It only outputs this with no legends present. ![ShowLegends](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rvogQ.png) ![showleg](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4bGgH.png)
