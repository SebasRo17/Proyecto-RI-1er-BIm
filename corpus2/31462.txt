I'm using the Quaternion package:               << Quaternions`      Very simply, I would like to be able to get the individual components of the quaternions by themselves. My problem is, if I try               Re[FromQuaternion[Quaternion[1,2,3,4]]]      I get               1+Re[3J+4K]      I would like to isolate the components instead. Then I could get               1      ... or 2 or 3 or 4. How can I do this? **ALSO** Is it possible to convert quaternions into a vector?
