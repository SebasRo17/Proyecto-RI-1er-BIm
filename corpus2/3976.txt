I have some dialog windows in a GUI of which one regularly crashes the kernel. I managed to focus on this particular piece of code, though I don't really know what causes the crash:               CreateDialog[DialogNotebook[Button[TextCell["Go"], DialogReturn[]]]];      Whenever I push the button, _Mathematica_ crashes. Strangly, if I remove either the `TextCell` wrapper or the `DialogReturn[]` command, the button behaves correctly. Any idea what is the cause of the symptom? ( _Mathematica_ 8.0.4, Win7/64)
