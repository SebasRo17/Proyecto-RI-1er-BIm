I am more used to typing then using the mouse. I was wondering if there were hotkeys for the drop down list and the info button? What I mean is what I have marked in the picture below. ![Array drop down](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yq5xl.png) ![Array drop down](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VARMk.png) When I type open square bracket it appears, and I can press the down arrow to get the list. But I can't make it reappear without deleting characters, and I don't know how to trigger the information button. Can anyone point me to how to do this?
