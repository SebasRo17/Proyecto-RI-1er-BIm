For being a better programmer there are ways to get started like:   1. Get some open source project and start contributing to it.   2. Solve some `Project Euler` or `Yodacode` Excercise. But if someone wants to move in the direction of `Project/Product Management` then in what direction he/she should move and what available options are out there to get started in that direction. Background: I mid level Programmer with 3 yrs of Programming Experience and I want to get started in `Project Management/Product Management` Role but my resume shows programming experience and so my question is how to break into Project/Product Management line with 3 yrs of Programming Experience. Do we have similar options available for `Project/Product Management` as we have for Programming like one's mentioned above ? _I know it's`chicken and egg` situation but what is the best way to get out of it ?_
