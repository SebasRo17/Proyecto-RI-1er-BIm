There is always a debate over the topic - "Whether to put the business logic in Stored Procedure or Not?". If we decide not to use the ORM Tool and not to put the Business Logic in Stored Procedure then where would we put the Business Logic? In my previous applications I have always preferred putting all of the Business Logic in Stored Procedures only. Then from .NET code I call these Stored Procedures using Data Access Application Blocks. SQLHelper etc. But this can not be the scenario all the time. So I did some googling but ended up in confusion....... Any suggestionss...?
