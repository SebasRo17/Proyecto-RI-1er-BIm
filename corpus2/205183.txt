I am confused about using licensed open source control in my comercial iOS application. Do I have to include any license in my code or i can just add open source control and push app to app store? For example have look on following https://www.cocoacontrols.com/controls/klnoteviewcontroller It has two lincenses. I can download it for free using Apache 2.0 License but I am not sure if I can use it my paid iOS application. Please advice
