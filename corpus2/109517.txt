I've been following these organizations (institutes, entities, whatever) for near 3 months now, and both of them claim that they're trying to make the Internet a better place. They're creating documents under the name of RFC (for IETF) and Recommendation (for W3C) to guide others. Yet another organization called WHATWG has started another path to develop web, and another community is in action under the title of Internet Society. I don't know, why many organizations? I mean, can't they simply get merged? Are they really different? How?
