I am working on an idea as a hobby project, and I have almost finished it in android and about to finish in Java ME platform, and we are also planning it on other smartphones including blackberry, iOS and symbian phones. But coding on these platform is not started yet. Here are my questions regarding to that **Is it a wise step to release this application for a non iOS device first and wait for good reviews before I start for iPhone and other platform?** I choose this because what android[read a non iOS] version needs is good packaging and some finishing work. But I fear that it will not be that much popularize and even there may be less downloads than expected only because this application will not get attention between too many applications. Or **It's better to develop iOS release first and than release a non iOS version?** I may get better attention because of popularity of apple among developers and users, but I don't feel it good to market an original android [non iOS] application as porting of iPhone one while the reality is reversed. **What are advantage to release a non iOS version first and than port it to iOS?**
