I'm writing a small database-centric application in Java Swing that will be used internally in a small company. I haven't much experience with developing production-level applications. I don't use an ORM, just a few simple methods that run SQL queries with Java JDBC. On every method that access the database I use a `try-catch` statement for `SQLException` and `IOException`. Should I do any logging here? In case I should, how much should I log? Please give me examples of good practice in this case.
