Under the options menu for `Histogram`, there is an option called `ChartLegends`, which adds little boxes beside the plot to indicate which curve represents what. I cannot find a similar option for `SmoothHistogram`. I know that `PlotLegends` is new in version 9, and I would've expected the option to be valid for `SmoothHistogram` as well. Does anybody know of a way around this issue?
