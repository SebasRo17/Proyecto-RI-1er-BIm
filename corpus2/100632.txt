I've been to about 50 interviews in my life. Many of them I've done just to get experience, and keep doing. The question I keep hearing again and again is > Are you more a front-end or a back-end developer? I program mostly for the web, but 2-3 years ago I was database developer, and even wrote a desktop app. And if I remember correctly, I heard this question at interviews that had nothing to do with the web. I can't remember exactly what I was answering. IIRC, usually I would say: it's hard to tell and that I had programmed an application X, Y and Z, and W. Last time I started answering and then said _"Wait, how do **you** define backend?"_ Now, does this question, whether I'm better at frontend or backend programming, really make sense nowadays?   * a website has a front end, true. But it's backend is usually the admin website. There's little difference between them.   * if I write a DB driver for a Django-driven website, is it really a front end thing? I remember at some interview I asked what are front and back ends, and got an answer that front end is for clients and used or visited a lot, and back end is something for internal use. Well, it makes no big difference. Things must work and work efficiently on both sides. I also led a dozen of interviews myself, and have never made this question, because it makes no sense and doesn't come to my mind. Is this just a test whether I jump into the hoop and start speaking or if I try to clarify the question?
