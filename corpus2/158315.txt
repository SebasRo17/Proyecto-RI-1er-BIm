This may be a stupid question but I am working on an algorithm which calculates intervals for variables in some given constraints. For example there is a function called propagateValues and its description is               `Propagate value ranges for the given constraints`      What exactly is meant by value propagation ? The algorithm I am working is basically trying to simplify sets of constraints by doing a range/interval analysis before querying the solver for a feasible solution (to make solving constraint sets more efficient)
