Problem with `ListPlot` when each point has a `Tooltip` and there are exactly two points(or for a multi-plot `Listplot[{list1, list2...}]` with individual `Tooltip`s per point and each plot having exactly two points). The points don't appear on the plot (or the associated tooltips) in the **3rd and 4th** case below. 1 point is ok, also 3 points or more is ok. I thought it might be to do with two points maybe being just outside the plot region, but extending `PlotRangePadding` and `PlotRange` didn't reveal the points. Any ideas for a workaround? I've submitted this to support in case it is a bug.               ListPlot[{{{1, 1}, {2, 2}}, {{1, 1}, {2, 2}}}]     ListPlot[{{Tooltip[{1, 1}, "1"], Tooltip[{2, 2}, "2"]}, {Tooltip[{1, 1}, "1b"]}}]     ListPlot[{{Tooltip[{1, 1}, "1"], Tooltip[{2, 2}, "2"]},               {Tooltip[{1.1, 1}, "1b"], Tooltip[{2.1, 2}, "2b"]}}]     ListPlot[{{Tooltip[{1, 1}, "1"], Tooltip[{2, 2}, "2"]}}]     ListPlot[{{Tooltip[{1, 1}, "1"], Tooltip[{2, 2}, "2"], Tooltip[{3, 3}, "3"]}}]     ListPlot[{{Tooltip[{1, 1}, "1"]}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SWtPs.png)
