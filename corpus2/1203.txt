I want to make a list of plots and my functions are named `C1`, `C2`... `Cn`. The command I wish to execute is:               Table[Plot[Cn[t], {t, 0, 1}], {n, 1,6}]]      which obviously doesn't work. How is the equivalent of the above done in Mathematica? **EDIT:** Thanks for the answers. Here is what it looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jvj4K.jpg)
