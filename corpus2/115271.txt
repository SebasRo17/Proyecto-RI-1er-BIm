I had to a incorporate several legacy applications and services in a network- distributed application. The existing services and applications are written using different languages and technologies, including: java, C#.Net and C++; all running on MS Windows machines. Now I'm wondering about the communication mechanism between them. What is the simple and standard way? Thanks! PS. communications include simple message sending and remote method invocations.
