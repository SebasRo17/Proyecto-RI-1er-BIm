I was looking at some certifications that can potentially enhance my knowledge and market value as a Software Engineer. IEEE's Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP) caught my attention. When I looked on the net for any user experiences with it I couldn't find anything substantial. Doesn't seem too popular. And I certainly havent heard of anyone in my organization or friends circle who have done it. I would like to know from community members if anyone has done this certification and their experiences with the same. Was the certification useful in terms of knowledge. Did it add weight to your resume (not deadweight!)?
