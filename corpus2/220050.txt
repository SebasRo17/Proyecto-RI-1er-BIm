I'm about to set off on a journey to create a new report-generator for our in- house software. Our old generator is made in VB6, remotes Word, and pixelpushes images. And its slower than a sloth on a flypaper. The language I'm most fluent in is C#, so preferably I'll want to make it in C#. I'm open for other languages though, of which I probably know Javascript the best. My question really is how I should proceed in setting up my app. The data it's reporting on is survey data. It's separated into questions and questiongroups. Today this goes a bit like this:   * Create report score for complete report   * Create report score for each questiongroup   * Create report score for each question   * Create report score for each question group I addition there might be several extra steps to get scores by variable filter and such. My problem is that I can't really wrap my head around any other way to do it than this "procedural" way. How would you go about in solving this? Any suggestions? More data:   * Data is stored in MSSQL   * The environment is Windows
