It happens that some one just leaves the company all of sudden. Now his work needs to be completed and you are being assigned it. Having no idea what was he up to (was it 90% done or 9%), how do you manage the leftover?   1. Shall I start from scratch? What if it was 90% done?    2. Shall I try and understand whatever he has done? What if it was just nonsense?
