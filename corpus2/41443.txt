I would like to solve the following integral:               Integrate[y Erf[a Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]]/Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]                 Exp[-b ((x - c)^2 + y^2)], {x, -∞, ∞},               {y, 0, ∞}, Assumptions -> {a > 0, b > 0, c > 0}]      If I add such input in Mathematica, it takes ages to solve it and in the end it could not. The solution is obviously a function of a, b, and c. Any ideas, tricks how to tackle this problem?
