A question has been bothering me for a while: when developing international projects, it is common sense to use English as the reference language since it is the language that the most people understand. However, how can one choose to name a function when it could have different valid English spellings. For example, would one name a function `get_center` or `get_centre`? Are there some rules of thumb to choose, do we choose both or just choose one arbitrarily and try to keep consistency afterwise? **NOTE:** Most answers recommend using American English, which makes sense. However, I had no idea that one of the spellings was American English and the other one was Great-Britain English. Therefore, my example is not a good one. Of course I would have used `center` if I had known that difference. But my question is still valid even though my example is a poor one. **NOTEÂ²:** Concerning `center` vs `centre`, I see that wxWidgets uses both.
