I just finished the book "Tech Yourself Java in 24 Hours, 6th Edition" I have an understanding of the language (by understanding I mean, the basics and everything covered in the book) and I have been experimenting and building little things with my knowledge. I want to learn about Android and was wondering if I need to increase my knowledge in Java before moving on to Android or can I just go straight to Android?
