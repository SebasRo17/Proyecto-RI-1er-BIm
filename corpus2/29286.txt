I have a 3D data that I want to visualise its each slice with ArrayPlot. However, there is a problem the way it represents the data. As, > ArrayPlot by default generates grayscale output, in which zero values are > shown white, and the maximum positive or negative value is shown black. It conflicts with the general idea, cause it should represent 0 values as black, max value(if it is scaled, equals to 1) as white and the rest of the values as gray levels. I am playing with it and I wrote a code sample:               ArrayPlot[data, ColorFunctionScaling -> True, ColorRules -> {1 -> White, 0 -> Black}]      I am not sure whether it is correct. Actually, I am not satisfied with the result. Any help is appreciated.Thanks.
