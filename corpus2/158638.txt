I have been reading a bit about Common Lisp and I am considering trying to learn it (I only know very basic concepts) or even using it for some project. Question: how stable is Common Lisp as a language? What I mean is, regardless of new libraries, are new language features (involving new syntax and semantics) being added to the language? In other words, if I learn Common Lisp now, would I be able to use the same language in 10 years from now, or read code that was written 10, 20 years ago (apart, of course, from having to get familiar with different libraries and API's)?
