I'd like to control more aspects of a `DateListPlot`, for example: shading for weekend days, and/or indicators for daytime/nighttime areas. By way of illustration, here's a simple example of a set of time data points (recent questions on mathematica.stackexchange):               questions =        First[Rest[         Import["http://api.stackexchange.com/2.0/questions?page=1&\     pagesize=100&order=desc&sort=creation&site=mathematica", "JSON"]]];          questionTimes =        Cases[questions, HoldPattern["creation_date" -> value_] :>  value,         Infinity];          hours = (Mod[#, 86400] /86400) 24  & /@ questionTimes ;          DateListPlot[Transpose[{questionTimes, hours}], Filling -> Bottom,       GridLines -> False, Frame -> {True, True, False, False}]      and the plot is like this: ![stack exchange](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xwQlR.png) I can't see how to show the necessary information along the x-axis, nor how to shade different areas of the graph to show day/night. _Edit_ : I now realise that the date/times returned by the SE API are in Unix Epoch (1970), and I hadn't noticed because I wasn't able to see the day numbers or years on my first attempt at a plot...
