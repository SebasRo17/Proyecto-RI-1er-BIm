When you are being interviewed by potential future employers, it is of course of benefit to both parties to discuss what your previous job entailed (ie, what you have been doing for the last few years). What if the technology (and the ideas behind the technology) that you have been working on is sensitive and confidential? I'm working on some really cool stuff at the moment, things that would impress an interviewer, that could demonstrate my passion and understanding, but at the same time I can't just come out and explain the nature of it without disclosing too much about my current employer. On the other hand, if I keep it vague without explaining the subtleties, it just seems as though I am working on fairly basic applications. The key is in the middle ground- the way the applications are constructed- which makes what I currently do both special and difficult. But even acknowledging this middle ground gives away vital information about how my employer competes. Hope that made some sense. What should I do in an interview? Is there like a 2-way NDA for interviews so I can just launch into an in-depth explanation of my past experience, or do I need to be deliberately vague and apologise for not being able to go into detail?
