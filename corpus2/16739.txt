> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to avoid returning a Null if there is no “else” condition in an If > contruct I know there are other ways to solve this problem. Just because I'm curious I tried:               Map[If[# == 1, , #] &, {2, 1, 3, 1, 4}]      This should return a list without the value 1, because when the statement is true it should do nothing. The solution should be:               {2,3,4}      and not               {2,Null,3,Null,4}      Why is it not working as I expect?
