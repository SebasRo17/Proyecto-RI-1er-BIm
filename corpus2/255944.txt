I am in the process of trying to sell my organisation on the value of code reviews. I have worked at several places where they were employed. I have seen them used to nitpick styling choices, and functional decisions, and I have seen them used as nothing more than a gut check to make sure nothing dangerous is being implemented. My gut feeling is that the most effective purpose is somewhere between the two options. So, what is the purpose of a Code Review?
