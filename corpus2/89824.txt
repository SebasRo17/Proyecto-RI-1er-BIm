At the urging of my father, I recently signed up for disability insurance. It got me wondering, if I were to become blind, what would it be like to write code without eyesight? An old question on Stack Overflow deals with the tools that are available, but I'm more interested in the experience, especially of someone who lost their vision after learning to program. I know that my own style is very visual: when writing code for the first time, I often write a big block of code, look it over to see what makes sense to split out, and then refactor it into separate functions by cut/paste. It seems like it would be hard to do that without _seeing_ the code. After learning to work with tools like a screen reader, is the experience basically the same? Or does it affect how you write code in a more substantial way?
