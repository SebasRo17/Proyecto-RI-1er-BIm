I am making a bunch of two dimensional plots and I would like to have them arranged in a grid with no space in between them. That is, I want their frames touching each other. My problem is twofold. First I don't know how to get the plots to have a consistent size. When I try to give the plots the same size via `ImageSize`, it applies the size to the overall image, including the tick marks and labels. But when I have two different plots, one with tick labels and one without, giving the same value to `ImageSize` doesn't give the result I'm looking for. Secondly, I want to get rid of any white space around the images such that when I give `Grid` the option `Spacings ->{0,0}` there really is no visible space between the plots. In the example code I use the `CustomTicks` package.               (*an example of what I might plot, simple sum of two dimensional \     Lorentzians*)     lzn[x_, w_, g_] := (x - w + I g)^-1;     exampledata2D =        Table[Re[lzn[w1, .2, .1] lzn[w2, .3, .2] +           lzn[w1, .4, .1] lzn[w2, .8, .1] +           lzn[w1, .8, .2] lzn[w2, .4, .2]], {w1, 0, 1, .01}, {w2, 0,          1, .01}];     << "CustomTicks`";       standardticks = LinTicks[0, 1, .2, 4];     (*I don't want the last tick label for one plot overlapping with the \     first tick label of the plot right next to it.*)     ticks2 = LinTicks[0, 1, .2, 4, ShowLast -> False];     (*Custom plotting function so I don't have to reprint the same \     options over and over *)     plottingfunction[list_, plotopts : OptionsPattern[]] :=        ListContourPlot[list,         Evaluate[FilterRules[{plotopts}, Options[ListContourPlot]]],         Contours -> 30, PlotRange -> All, DataRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}},         BaseStyle -> 18,         ColorFunction -> (Blend[{Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue,              Darker[Blue]}, #] &)];          bottomleft =        plottingfunction[exampledata2D,         FrameTicks -> {{ticks2, StripTickLabels[standardticks]}, {ticks2,            StripTickLabels[standardticks]}}];     bottomright =        plottingfunction[exampledata2D,         FrameTicks -> {{StripTickLabels[standardticks],            StripTickLabels[standardticks]}, {standardticks,            StripTickLabels[standardticks]}}];     topleft =        plottingfunction[exampledata2D,         FrameTicks -> {{ticks2,            StripTickLabels[standardticks]}, {StripTickLabels[            standardticks], StripTickLabels[standardticks]}}];     topright =        plottingfunction[exampledata2D,         FrameTicks -> {{StripTickLabels[standardticks],            StripTickLabels[standardticks]}, {StripTickLabels[            standardticks], StripTickLabels[standardticks]}}];          Grid[{{topleft, topright}, {bottomleft, bottomright}},       BaseStyle -> ImageSizeMultipliers -> 1, Spacings -> {0, 0}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/usCDh.png)
