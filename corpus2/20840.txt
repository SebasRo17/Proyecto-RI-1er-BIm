I work for a multi-national I.T. services company. I'd thought they'd be applying good development practices but they aren't. One example is the source code base for a Java project that is currently being developed for a client. It's full of incorrectly indented code. There's mixtures of tabs and spaces on lines (no they're not using the GNU formatting style) as well as 2 or 3 or 4 space indents. Everywhere else I've worked people have agreed to a fixed indentation coding standard and stuck with it, so that's why I find this project an anathema. How do I diplomatically get them to indent properly?
