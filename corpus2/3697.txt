I'm evaluating this code in _Mathematica_ 8.0.0 on **Mac OS X 10.6.8** :               Table[StringCases[TextRecognize[Binarize[Import[imgList[[i]]]]],        RegularExpression["[0.-9]*-[0.-9]*-[0.-9]*"]], {i, 1, 87}]      which finds every CAS registry number present in 87 GIFs. Looking at the Activity Monitor, I can see that _Mathematica_ calls `Tesseract.exe` and `GIF.exe` when working on the images. Are those processes being virtualized, or is their name simply misleading?
