I have a simple lattice / line manipulation:               Manipulate[r = 10; b = {{0, r}, {r, 0}};     l1 = Flatten[Table[i b[[1]] + j b[[2]], {i, 0, r}, {j, 0, r}], 1]/r;     Clear[a, b]; b = a /. Solve[a + y == 90, a][[1]]; x = y Pi/180;     g = Graphics[Line[{{0, 0}, {If[y <= 45, r/Cos[x], r/Cos[b Pi/180]], 0}}]];     rot = l : Line[pts_] :> Rotate[l, x, {0, 0}];     Show[Graphics[Point[l1], Frame -> True, AspectRatio -> 1], g /. rot], {{y, 45}, 0, 90}]      and would like to add points (that move with the manipulation) on the line that are perpendicular to the nearest points of the lattice, as shown below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/79O89.png) It would be a bonus if the perpendicular joining lines appeared also. The only way I can think of pursuing this is to use something like `Nearest`, `FrobeniusSolve`, etc. (have been looking at the answers to this question with little success so far) to generate data for something along the lines of:               f = Graphics[Point[{{0, 0}, data, {If[y <= 45, r/Cos[x], 12], 0}}]];     rot1 = l : Point[pts_] :> Rotate[l, x, {0, 0}];     Show[Graphics[Point[l1], Frame -> True, AspectRatio -> 1], g /. rot, f /. rot1]      # Note: As noted by Vitaliy Kaurov below, the defining 'band' (dashed in the diagram) would not (necessarily) be symmetric about the main line. In this instance, the ratio of smaller to larger is the golden ratio. This is more obvious when looking at central red line in the above image - compare with: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NG1d7.png) I would ideally like this band width to be adjustable within the manipulation, but this is a minor concern. # Update A minor modification of george2079's code               a = N[1/2 (Sqrt[(2/(5 + Sqrt[5]))] + Sqrt[10/(5 + Sqrt[5])])];     b = N[Sqrt[2/(5 + Sqrt[5])]];     Manipulate[Module[{grid, f, lndat, near, lnpts, lines1, lines2}, band = 1;     grid = Flatten[Outer[List, Range[-4, 4], Range[-4, 4]], 1];     f[x_] := m x;     lines1 = Select[pointlinedis[{{{0, 0}, {4, f[4]}}, grid}],      Norm[Subtract @@ #] < a band &];     lines2 = Select[pointlinedis[{{{0, 0}, {4, f[4]}}, grid}],      Norm[Subtract @@ #] < b band &];     Show[Plot[f[x], {x, -4, 4}, PlotRange -> 4],      Plot[f[x] - b band/Cos[ArcTan[m]], {x, -4, 4}, PlotRange -> 4],      Plot[f[x] + a band/Cos[ArcTan[m]], {x, -4, 4}, PlotRange -> 4],      Graphics[{{Opacity[.5], PointSize[.015], Point[grid]},     {Orange, Thickness[.005], Line /@ lines1}, {Red, Opacity[.5],      PointSize[.03], Point[#[[1]] & /@ lines1]}, {PointSize[.015],      Blue, Point[#[[2]]] & /@ lines1}}], AspectRatio -> 1]], {{m, N[Pi/5]}, -10, 10}]      gives ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TYEXg.gif) which is nearly what I was after, but I would really like to exclude the points outside the lower line. If I swap `lines1` for `lines2` in bottom 3 lines of code, they are excluded, but so are some of points in top band. I have tried playing around with various `If` combinations, but can't seem to select points in upper band separately to points in lower band. Also, point near $\{3,3\}$ shouldn't be included (though george2079 does note that this may happen in his answer).
