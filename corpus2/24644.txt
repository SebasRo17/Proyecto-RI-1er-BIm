I want to do a cross product involving a vector of Pauli matrices $\vec \sigma = \left( {{\sigma _1},{\sigma _2},{\sigma _3}} \right)$; for example, $\vec \sigma \times \left( {1,2,3} \right)$.               s:= Table[PauliMatrix[i], {i, 1, 3}];     Cross[s,{1,2,3}]      The code above will not work. The only way I can think of is to use the method which I have just learned from Mr. Wizard:               ReleaseHold @ Block[{PauliMatrix}, Hold @@ {Cross[s,{1, 2, 3}]}]      But I feel uncomfortable writing such long code to realize such a simple cross product. Is there any better way or not? * * * **Update** J.M. give the method               Cross[Unevaluated /@ PauliMatrix[Range[3]], {a,b,c}]      But it turns out that when one of the a,b,c is zero, the code will give error. a Remedy is given by J.M in his comment. But I am asking here why it gives right answer when a b c are all nonzero while failed with a zero component?
