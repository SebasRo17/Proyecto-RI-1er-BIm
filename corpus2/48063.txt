I have a rather basic question but can't figure out a foolproof answer. In the following code, I build a function which returns the mean difference between successive elements of a vector created from `j` random variates from an exponential distribution:               fun2[j_] :=          Module[{x = RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[1/25], j]},          Mean[Table[Abs[x[[i + 1]] - x[[i]]], {i, Length[x] - 1}]]]      Will the use of the `x` call to `RandomVariate` create an immutable object, i.e. so that `x[[i + 1]]` and `x[[i]]` reference the same instance of the distribution? Thanks a lot for any help.
