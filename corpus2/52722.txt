IBM got me confused (again). For many years IBM have been pushing for Portlet Containers with the JSR 168 and later the JSR 286 Specification. 2008-2009, IBM the Lotus division introduced the iWidget Specification. Based on my reading, it is a more dynamic and lightweight version of the Portlets, close to Google Gadget. It uses a different paradigm than Porlet while providing the same features. A major differentiator with this kind of client side technologies is that you don’t need a big and costly Portal infrastructure. To not fall in the ‘It depends on needs’ discussions, let consider the following:               * New company, no legacy portlet, no portal in place.      What are your thoughts on this?
