I have data produced by the following code:               u2 := y^2 + ϕ + 1          ϕ = 0.1;                      aa1 = Table[{y,u2}, {y, -1.2, 1.2, 0.05}]          ϕ = 0.15;                                             aa2 = Table[u2, {y, -1.2, 1.2, 0.05}]          ϕ = 0.20;                                               aa3 = Table[u2, {y, -1.2, 1.2, 0.05}]      I want to save this data in a single file like this               y      u2 (output form aa1)        u2 (output form aa2)        u2 (output form aa3)     -1.2      2                           3                           4     -1        3                           4                           3      0        2                           2                           2      The full code can be found here How to export data from listplot?
