I've defined a system of equations, but I been unable to get Mathematica to solve for the individual variables created by matrix tables.               Table[tair[j,i],{j,y},{i,x}]==c*Table[Sum[t[j,i],{j,j+1,y}]-Sum[tair[j, i],{j,j+1,y}],{j,y},{i,x}]          Table[tout[i],{i,x}]==c*Table[Sum[t[j,i],{j,1,y}]-Sum[tair[j,i],{j,1,y}],{i, x}]          tout[1]=16     tout[2]=16     tair[2,1]=0     tair[2,2]=0      C is a known constant. To confirm my math, I've used values of 2 for y and x and I've written out the 6 resulting equations in Mathematica, defining variables explicitly rather than through tables:               tair11,tair12,tair21,tair22,t11,t12,t21,t22,tout1,tout2      Using the Solve function, I get the right answer. But since I want to be able to increase the order of y and x to say, 100, a manual enumeration process is not practicable. My question: what must I do syntactically to get Mathematica to solve for these variables? Even a simple example not related to my code would be most helpful.
