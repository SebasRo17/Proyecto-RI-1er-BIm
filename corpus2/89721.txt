I'm a student but I am hopefully moving into the software industry soon. There seems to be a lot of hype about the MVC software pattern. I noticed that PHP frameworks are often MVC, what about non-web languages.. is it the same with them? For my masters dissertation (C++), I chose the MVC pattern because it nicely separates out the logic and user interface. In industry is it used a lot? If so, what are the main reasons and what are other competing, popular designs?
