We need to support a legacy web service using a new web service implementation. At a given time the old input as well as new input should work. So here is what we need to achieve > Old SOAP input -> translate -> New SOAP input -> New WS -> New WS output -> > translate -> Old SOAP output. For now, I have created xslt for translating input and output But looks like that has little use if I implement a webservice to handle old input Given that we know the input and output XSD for all formats involved, how to implement a web service that will take old soap input, translate it (using XSLT) and call the new service? What tools (spring ws,cxf ..) are most suited?
