I am building a photography website and I want to allow the user to put tags on their photos for easy searching. But I'm not sure if I want the tags to be an nvarchar field in each picture and then search for that tag in each record or if I want to pull them out and create a separate table of tags and tagIds and then have a look up table, so I can just search the database for that ID. So, what I'm asking is which would be better efficiency-wise and scalability- wise. The database will have over 3-4000 pictures.
