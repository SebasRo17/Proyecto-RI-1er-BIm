I am practicing OOP with PHP, and I am struck at setter and getter methods. I can directly access the class properties and methods with getter method then what's the use of setter method? See my example.               <?php     class MyClass{         public $classVar = "Its a class variable";         public function Getter(){             return $this -> classVar;         }     }     $obj = new MyClass;     echo $obj -> Getter();     ?>
