Through SO/P.SE browsing, I've been picking up useful pieces of Python code (e.g. a Mutable memoizer, an efficient prime generator) that I'd like to stick into one spot to have available should I need it in future projects. What are some best practices for how a "personal" code library of reusable classes/functions/modules should be set up? For example, do I just drop it all into one module? Or should I model it after the standard library, even though some modules may have 1 class/function in them?
