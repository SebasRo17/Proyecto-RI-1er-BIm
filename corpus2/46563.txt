I have written the code below:               ListPlot[das1, PlotMarkers -> {\[FilledCircle], 12},       PlotStyle -> {Black}, Joined -> True, Mesh -> All, MeshStyle -> Red,       PlotLegends ->       Placed[Style[#, FontSize -> 20] & /@ {"6.7 ps"}, {Top, Right}]]      I want a black line to go through my red data points. Then, I want the plot legend to be red. However, by using the above code I get a black plot legend. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dPyNu.jpg) How can I set the plot legend color independent of the plot itself? How can I extend the solution to multiple graphs in one plot?
