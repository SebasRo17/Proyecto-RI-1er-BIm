I tried to divide two large matrices DLand PL of size 100,000 x 5 each and they look like this, DL=![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WpATf.png) and PL=![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vwcHi.png) By using conditional function:               Spread1[DL_, PL_] := SparseArray[ {i_, j_} /; PL[[i, j]] != 0 :> 100000 DL[[i, j]]/PL[[i, j]], {1000, 5}]          test = Spread1[DL, PL];     MatrixForm[test]      and then I get result as shown, but why do I get those messages and some of the resulting test matrix elements say ComplexInfinity? Not sure if I should ignore those messages as all zero elements are aligned? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wol1z.png)
