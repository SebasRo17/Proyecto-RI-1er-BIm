I am interested in defining a function (with arguments: a symbol for a variable and a list of 6 points) that represents a quadratic interpolating spline of the points. Here is my attempt               f20[x_, P_, Q_, R_, S_, T_, U_] :=        InterpolatingPolynomial[{{{P[[1]]}, P[[2]], 0}, {{Q[[1]]},           Q[[2]]}}, {x}];     f21[x_, P_, Q_, R_, S_, T_, U_] :=        InterpolatingPolynomial[{{{Q[[1]]}, Q[[2]],           D[f20[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U], x] /. x -> Q[[1]]}, {{R[[1]]},           R[[2]]}}, {x}];     f22[x_, P_, Q_, R_, S_, T_, U_] :=        InterpolatingPolynomial[{{{R[[1]]}, R[[2]],           D[f21[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U], x] /. x -> R[[1]]}, {{S[[1]]},           S[[2]]}}, {x}];     f23[x_, P_, Q_, R_, S_, T_, U_] :=        InterpolatingPolynomial[{{{S[[1]]}, S[[2]],           D[f22[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U], x] /. x -> S[[1]]}, {{T[[1]]},           T[[2]]}}, {x}];     f24[x_, P_, Q_, R_, S_, T_, U_] :=        InterpolatingPolynomial[{{{T[[1]]}, T[[2]],           D[f23[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U], x] /. x -> T[[1]]}, {{U[[1]]},           U[[2]]}}, {x}];     Interp2[x_, P_, Q_, R_, S_, T_, U_] :=        Piecewise[{{f20[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U],           P[[1]] <= x <= Q[[1]]}, {f21[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U],           Q[[1]] < x <= R[[1]]}, {f22[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U],           R[[1]] < x <= S[[1]]}, {f23[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U],           S[[1]] < x <= T[[1]]}, {f24[x, P, Q, R, S, T, U],           T[[1]] < x <= U[[1]]}}];      Then I try to evaluate the function and plot it               Interp2[s, {1, 1}, {2, 3}, {3, 3}, {4, 4}, {5, 5}, {6, 3}]     Plot[Interp2[s, {1, 1}, {2, 3}, {3, 3}, {4, 4}, {5, 5}, {6, 3}], {s,        1, 6}, PlotRange -> Full]      The output is the following ( **problem 1** ) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i7Zjo.png) which seems very weird because the function is correct but the plot is not. If I manually edit the first output to plot the function (with the same code as the second line of the input), or if I use the code               Interp2[s, {1, 1}, {2, 3}, {3, 3}, {4, 4}, {5, 5}, {6, 3}]     Plot[%, {s, 1, 6}, PlotRange -> Full]      instead, I get this ( **problem 2** ) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qXtnv.png) Notably, the plot is discontinuous, but the discontinuity points are not always matching the extremal points of the intervals in the piecewise definition: the gap near s=4 is between s=4.1 and s=4.2. In this second case I tried various options of MaxRecursion and PerformanceGoal to obtain a better quality, with no different results as the one in the picture. I am interested in a solution for problem 1 (rather than 2), but any suggestion is very welcome. Thanks
