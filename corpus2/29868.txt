Looking at Documentation for `ListSurfacePlot3D`, I follow the basic example presented there.               data = ExampleData[{"Geometry3D", "StanfordBunny"}, "VertexData"];     ListSurfacePlot3D[data, MaxPlotPoints -> 50, Mesh -> 30, Axes -> None,       MeshFunctions -> (#1 - #2 + #3 &), MeshShading -> {None, Yellow}]      What happens is that, first of all the vertex data from Stanford Bunny is read and stored in `data`, but then running `ListSurfacePlot3D` returns no output (I was expecting a graphic object as shown in documentation). In fact after running the line with `ListSurfacePlot3D` I see that `data` is cleared from workspace (it doesn't contain any data, in fact it is not even defined anymore - changing color from black to blue). It seems that `MeshShading` is causing this problem, so the following works:               data = ExampleData[{"Geometry3D", "StanfordBunny"}, "VertexData"];     ListSurfacePlot3D[data, MaxPlotPoints -> 50, Mesh -> 30, Axes -> None,       MeshFunctions -> (#1 - #2 + #3 &)]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V2ZEm.jpg) I face the same problem when trying other examples from documentation; ListSurfacePlot3D/Options/MeshShading So, is this a bug or am I missing something? I am using OS X 10.8.4 64 bit, and _Mathematica_ version 9.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) (January 24, 2013).
