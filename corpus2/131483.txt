I am tasked with building an tool to allow users to publish to Wordpress from their PC using MS Word and Outlook. I know, completely defeat the purpose of having Wordpress, but the basic requirement are: 1) Format must be preserved, including images 2) Providing an interface for categorizing and tagging the document After doing some research, I think this could be achieved by creating an VBA macro that saves Word to html format, and sending it via http to Wordpress XMLRPC However, I haven't quite work out how to include the images, and how to keep the category from Wordpress and the macro in sync. I would like to hear from anyone who have experience in this and suggestion on how to implement this.
