How do I control the shape of my arrow heads? LaTeX's TikZ package has a wide variety of predefined arrowhead styles, some of which I'd like to try to match for Mathematica figures I'm importing into a LaTeX document: ![LaTeX arrow examples](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U0b9m.png) But Mathematica's default arrowhead style comes nowhere near any of these. For example,               Graphics[{Thick, Arrow[{{0, 0}, {-50, 0}}]}]       yields ![Default Mathematica arrow](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFjHH.png) Earlier versions of Mathematica had options for controlling arrowhead shape, but those seem to be gone in 8.0. How can I get the shape of my Mathematica arrowheads to match the LaTeX TikZ arrowhead styles?
