i've a doubt about using Prolog for my grad school research. Recently, i've presented a small part of my research work which is discussed about logic and prolog in a conference. I got a comment from an audience that questioned me "why i chose prolog". He said that prolog is an outdated languages (popular usage around '80s) and people are rarely talk about prolog now. Is there any risk if i use prolog in my research study because of its old-fashioned language? or maybe i should prolog as only a part of my study. This is confusing me as i know that prolog is still be using in academia now..
