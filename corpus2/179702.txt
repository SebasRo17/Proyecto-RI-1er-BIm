I am curious about my work, where I have to work with configurations of servers, linux, databases, some SQLs but there is no line of code for my favorite programming language: Java. Is it normal that developers should have such roles to work so that they can better comprehend? My question is related to career perspective. I was hired for programming but moved to different project where there is NO CODE at all. I am missing to code.
