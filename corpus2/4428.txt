I have a Mathematica batch script which makes some MySQL queries using DatabaseLink to store parameters of the run in a database. Recently, I had a run where these queries failed, and there was no output to indicate why. In the past, when I was using the SQLite interface, I had much success debugging (or at least recovering from errors) by printing out every SQL query made to the log file, but with functions like `SQLUpdate` and `SQLInsert` I don't get access to the raw queries. Is there a way I can get DatabaseLink to print them out for me, or at least get access to the raw query so I can print it myself?
