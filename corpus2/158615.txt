code found at: fatal error...Java Runtime Environment: EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION Presuming that the problem indicated above is due to the test app and not due specifically to method generateRandomDigits(). When NUMBER_OF_DIGITS_TO_ORDER is <= 9, I do get a naturally ordered sets (just trying to prove that it is possible), but when it is set to 10 I never get such a set and I've run it many times. Why? I am more than open to suggested improvements to method generateRandomDigits() - it seems a bit convoluted.
