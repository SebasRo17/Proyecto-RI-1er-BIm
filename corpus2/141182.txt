I am building a application that allow different user to store the subscriber information   * To store the subscriber information , the user first create a list For each list, there is a ListID. `Subscriber` may have different attribute : email phone fax .... For each list, their setting is different , so a `require_attribute table` is introduced. It is a bridge between subscriber and List That store `Listid, subid, attribute, datatype` **That means the system have a lot of list, each user have their own list, and the list have different attribute, some list have email , phone , some may have phone, address, name mail.. And the datatype is different, some may use 'name' as integer, some may use 'name' as varchar**   * attribute means email phone, it is to define for `which list have which subscriber attribute`   * datatype means for each attribute, what is its datatype              Table :subscriber :             Field :subid , name,email          Table :Require Attribute:          Field : Listid ,subid , attribute, datatype      The attribute here is {name, email} So a simple data is               Subscriber: 1 , MYname, Myemail          Require Attribute :           Listid , 1 , 'email', 'intger'           Listid , 1 , 'name', 'varchar'      I found that this kind of storage is too complex to handle with, Since the subscriber is share to everybody, so if a person want to change the datatype of name, it will also affect the data of the other user. Simple error situation: Subscriber:               list1,  Subscriber 1 , name1, email1          list2, Subscriber 2  , name2 , email2          Require Attribute :               List1 , Subscriber 1 , 'email', 'varchar',               List1 , Subscriber 1  , 'name', 'varchar',                Listid , Subscriber 2 , 'email', 'varchar',                Listid , Subscriber 2, 'name', 'integer',       **if user B change the data type of name in require attribute from varchar to integer, it cause a problem. because list 1 is own by user A , he want the datatype is varchar, but list 2 is won by user B, he want the datatype to be integer** So how can I redesign the structure?
