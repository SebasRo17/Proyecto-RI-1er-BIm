Suppose there is a function get-data which returns a map of information about the id of the user passed in. now this function uses 3 functions source-a, source-b and source-c to get three different kinds of maps. now we combine all these maps into one map and return from get-data. when I test get-data, should I test for existence of data for keys ? Does it makes sense for this function to fail unit tests if one of source-a, source-b and source-c fail? If thats function job is to combine data,and its doing it, it should be enough right ?
