I have a few questions about the Subversion open source project. I know that there are multiple versions of svndumpfilter (2,3). What are the tradeoffs and benefits of each version? In other words, what problems does each version seek to address? There are known bugs in the original svndumpfilter that have not been resolved for years. Out of curiosity, why is this the case? Is it because svndumpfilter is of lower priority than the other working components of svn?
