We currently use JIRA to track our development work. My management wants to format and categorize everything as "User Stories," including non-software development related tasks. For example: "As a test manager, can I perform testing of the application using only automated tests and no manual testing so that I can test the application as efficiently as possible? Acceptance Criteria: 1\. Convert 50 existing manual tests to fully automated tests 2\. Tests must execute in less than 1 hour" I want to get a sense from the community if it makes sense to use "user stories" for work that supports the software development process, is not done by the programmers, and does not directly results in deliverable code. Or should this be handled/classified differently (for example, in JIRA)? Updated 6/7/2011 - Rephrased question to focus on "user story" term.
