I often work with big tables that I want to treat kind of like a database. Here's an example table.               theTable = {      {"id","color","size","flavor"},      {1,"blue",5,"cherry"},      {2,"green",5,"piquant"},      {3,"blue",20,"peppermint"}     }      In a database I would ask               SELECT * FROM `theTable` WHERE `color` = 'blue' AND `size` > 10      and get effectively               {{3, "blue", 20, "peppermint"}}      in response. In _Mathematica_ , I need to determine the "column number" for `color` and `size`, then use `Cases` with `And` to do the same thing.               Cases[theTable[[2 ;;]], a_ /; And[a[[2]] == "blue", a[[3]] > 10]]      This is operationally much clumsier than the database way. Unfortunately setting up a database for every such table is too much extra work, particularly since I want the data to end up in mma anyway. How can this approach be improved? Specifically, how can I more easily use the column names directly, instead of their part numbers? And how can I avoid the ugly `a_/;f[a]` pattern?
