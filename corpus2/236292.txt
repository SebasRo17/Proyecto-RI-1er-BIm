I'm looking for a very exotic thing and have no idea if it exists at all in SQL Server 2012. (Please forgive me - my background is in T-SQL, but not yet the fine details of SQL 'programming'.) So, whether this 'this' is a UDF or SP or something else - I don't know. The challenge is to have something so flexible that it could return a table with one or more records and a list of fields that is determined at runtime. I guess something like a virtual table, but 'lighter' and faster. Is that doable (and how)? As an example, let's say I have two records (IDs being `1` and `2`) and their values for field '`name`' are '`R1`' and '`R2`'. Some other logic makes me want to combine these into a record with ID '`virtual1`' and two fields names , '`F1`' and '`F2`' with value '`R1`' and '`R2`' - very much boiled down, but this what I'd like to achieve....
