Fixed-point object locations allow for worlds which are much more scale-able. Using a 64-bit integer (per dimension), and 0.1 millimeter precision, a world can be created which is 100% numerically stable, and _12,000_ astronomical units across. I have been looking all over the internet, and I can't seem to find a physics engine which supports this. Is there a 3D physics engine in existence, which uses _fixed-point_ (i.e. Integer, hopefully int-64) values for entities' positions? It's for a really ambitious sci-fi game I'm working on.
