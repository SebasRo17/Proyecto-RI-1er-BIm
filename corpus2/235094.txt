According to Microsoft documentation, the Wikipedia SOLID principe article, or most IT architects we must ensure that each class has only one responsibility. I would like to know why, because if everybody seems to agree with this rule nobody seems to agree about the reasons of this rule. Some cite better maintenance, some say it provides easy testing or makes the class more robust, or security. What is correct and what does it actually mean? Why does it make maintenance better, testing easier or the code more robust?
