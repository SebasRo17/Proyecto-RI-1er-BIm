I am working on a C++ project that is getting bigger and bigger. I do a lot of UML so it was not really hard to explain my work to co-workers until now. Lately I implemented a lot of new features and I gave up updating by hand my Dia UML diagrams. My code is documented with Doxygen but the generated doc is not really visual. I would just like my co-workers to quickly understand updates in my class design. Doxygen seems to handle UML diagrams using Graphviz but I would like to know if other possibilities are available and what you guys do to be as clear as possible when showing your code to co-workers (not clients).
