Imagine if your development team were asked to develop a system. The system should only response to some particular user groups such as "Group A", "Group B" or "Boss" who are the actually users of the system. If you receive a phone call from the user saying that the system crash upon some particular situation/parameters. You tried to reproduce the problem and discovered that you Ip was filtered because there are not any valid user groups which include you/your team. You cannot even reproduce the crash and you go to ask the caller if you can borrow his/her PC to reproduce the problem at once. After this, would you think adding a new valid group such as "Developers" would be necessary?
