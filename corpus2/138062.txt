On the Google Apps Marketplace Vendor Listing page, Google says the following: > Google charges a one-time fee of $100 for submitting your first listing. I've searched Google Groups and other forums, and I cannot seem to find the answer to the question of whether or not the one time $100 fee applies to _only my individual Google Apps login_ or if it applies to other Google Apps logins on my domain as well. For instance, If I, james@mydomain.com, pay the $100 fee so I can submit N listings, does this also apply to john@mydomain.com or does John have to pay the $100 fee to so he can publish his apps without having to ask me to do it? Is it best to use a single, group login like admin@mydomain.com or development@mydomain.com when paying the $100 Listing fee? What is your experience in this regard with posting multiple listings to the marketplace where N developers are involved?
