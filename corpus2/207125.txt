I'm looking at the wiki on ExtJS, the wiki on List of rich Internet application frameworks, and the wiki on Comparison of web application frameworks. I'm confused. The first line of the ExtJS wiki page says: > Ext JS is a pure JavaScript application framework for building interactive > web applications[1] using techniques such as Ajax, DHTML and DOM scripting. So I assume it's a web app framework. But in the right hand side summary box it says: > Type: JavaScript library Is ExtJS a web app framework or a Javascript library or both? (Can it be both?) ExtJS is also missing from the web app framework lists...       Thanks for reading
