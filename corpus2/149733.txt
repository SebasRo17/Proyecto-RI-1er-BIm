Attempting to research how to allow a group of people to effectively rank a set of objects (each group member will have contributed one object to the group), and then assign each member an object that's not their own based on:   * Their ratings of the objects,   * Their objects rating, and    * The object remaining to be assigned. Idea is to attempt to assign objects to people based on the groups rating of their contribution to the group relative to other member's contribution, the the personal preferences expressed via the ratings. Any suggestions for:   * Further research,   * Refining the statement of the problem/solution, or   * A solution.
