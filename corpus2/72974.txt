I've written few jQuery plugins (as well as some other stuff) and I publish all the code on my blog (http://erraticdev.blogspot.com). I update them as people tell me about any issues they came across by leaving comments on blog posts. Then I update the code and republish my original post. Worked so far as expected. But this seems like a bad way of code hosting. It does work I admit but it's not really version controlled. Only latest version (which should be used anyway) is accessible. I've use Google Code hosting for few of my other non-jQuery projects which seems fine because I can centrally track all my web content (blog an those projects) in Google Analytics. The bad side is it takes some time to set up new projects with writing project page description. Version control seems the main benefit although some projects may not be updated at all... So what's the point then? My plugins are therefore available as is. No minified versions or similar. I guess I could also upload full + minified version on my Google Docs and link them on my blog if I wanted to, couldn't I? ## Question What would you suggest where (or how) should I make my public code available to public? Should I change code hosting at all apart from having it freely available on my blog?
