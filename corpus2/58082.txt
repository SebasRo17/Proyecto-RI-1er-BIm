I'm at the beginning of my career and I'm currently looking for jobs. I know that the farther you get away from college graduation, the more employers look at your experience as opposed to your actual degree. I'm wondering with the ultimate goal of being in software engineering/computer science, would taking a job in the IT field limit my options of getting into software engineering? Likewise would taking a job in software quality assurance limit me from pursuing a development position later, even though both are in software engineering?
