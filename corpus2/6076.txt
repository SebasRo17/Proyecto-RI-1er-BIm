Consider the following piece of code from Heike as an ( accepted ) answer on LocatorPane, selecting multiple Locators \- Basically the code implements dragging polygons on a LocatorPane.                DynamicModule[{pts, range, gr, drag, pts0},       pts = RandomReal[1, {7, 2}];       range = {1 ;; 4, 5 ;; 7};       gr = {{Red,  Polygon @ Dynamic @ pts[[ range[[1]] ]]},             {Blue, Polygon @ Dynamic @ pts[[ range[[2]] ]]}};       drag = 0;            Panel[LocatorPane[Dynamic[pts],         EventHandler[          Graphics[           EventHandler[gr[[#1]],              {"MouseDown" :>                (drag = #; pts0 = # - MousePosition["Graphics"] & /@ pts[[ range[[#]] ]])}           ] & /@ {1, 2},            PlotRange -> {{0, 2}, {0, 2}}],          {"MouseDragged" :>             If[drag > 0, pts[[range[[drag]]]] = # + MousePosition["Graphics"] & /@ pts0],           "MouseUp" :> (drag = 0)},          PassEventsDown -> True         ]       ]]      ]      If you run this code you'll notice that when a locator's position is on another polygon the locator does not work anymore. **Question: How can the code above be changed so that a click on a locator always works? Why was it necessary to use two two EventHandlers, and what is a good rule to decide on wether to use the PassEventsDown option?**
