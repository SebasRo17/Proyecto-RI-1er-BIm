I'm designing a silverlight application for showing sheet music from a midi file. I want to create a horizontally scrolling musical staff. At my job I maintain a winforms application that is a scrolling Gantt chart of airplane schedules, and it basically has a rows collection, and it maps the left-most pixel and right-most pixels of the control to datetimes. Then the paint method loops through what it determines will be the visible rows, and draws a screen that shows the schedule information between the two dates. Would I be correct in assuming that I would need to something similar in silverlight for my sheetmusic, or would it be better to just create a horizontal scrollviewer containing a canvas that I have drawn programmaticially on. Am I headed in the right direction? I havent seen any articles on designing such a custom control: can you point me at any?
