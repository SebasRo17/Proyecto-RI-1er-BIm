I have a list of coordinates like this one:               {{x1,y1},{x2,y2},{x3,y3},...,{xn,yn}}      I need to get the minimum and the maximum of all x-values and the minimum and maximum of all y-values. Is this possible? If I use the in-built `Min` function for example gives me just the minimum of all x and y values...
