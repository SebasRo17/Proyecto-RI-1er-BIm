Given a set $\\{A_1,...,A_m\\}$ of $m$ commuting $N\times N$ diagonalizable matrices, it is known that there exists a basis of eigenvectors $\Lambda$ that simultaneously diagonalizes all the $A_i$. Is there an automated way to compute $\Lambda$ in Mathematica? For a pair of matrices $\\{A_1,A_2\\}$ it can be done "by hand" using `Eigenvectors` to first compute the eigenvectors $\Lambda_1$ of $A_1$, finding similarity transforms $P_k$ that act on the degenerate subspaces of $\Lambda_1$ to make them also eigenvector of $A_2$, and then combining the transformed degenerate subspaces together to form $\Lambda$, but I don't know how to generalize this to more than 2 matrices.
