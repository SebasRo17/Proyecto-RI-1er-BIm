Please give reasons for your answer. As I found, two additions are needed. This is because every number to be add needs to changed to binary. Then addition is done between two binary numbers where the XOR gate is used for addition. When a carry bit is required an AND gate is involved to add the carry bit to the next line. Therefore if more than 3 binary numbers are added together there can be more than one carry bit and the AND gate doesn't support that. Am I right or I am confusing everything and nothing make sense? Thank you for your time.
