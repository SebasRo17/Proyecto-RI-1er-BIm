I have a private stylesheet I'm using. I edit it by going to the menu Edit->Edit Stylesheet and then clicking on the private stylesheet cell. I can modify whatever I want but it never gets saved. The notebook option Saveable can be set to True (is by default False) but that still doesn't change the fact that in order to save it I can only do it by going to Save AS, and making it replace itself. To do that I have to go to the `$UserBaseDirectory`, SystemFiles, FrontEnd, StyleSheets, not practical... The question is implicit, can you help out?
