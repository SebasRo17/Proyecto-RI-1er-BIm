How can you use the same colour to the data in `Epilog` as the data in the `ListLinePlot`? I am plotting 25 lists (4 in this question) on which I would need to mark each maximum. I would like the point marking the maximum to have the same colour as the line (if possible with a black exterior circle). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2wXtK.jpg) Is it possible?               a = {1, 3, 6, 3, 2};     b = {3, 2, 5, 6, 9};     c = {2, 7, 3, 1, 6};     d = {4, 2, 8, 8, 10};     am = {Position[a, Max[a]][[1, 1]], Max[a]}     bm = {Position[b, Max[b]][[1, 1]], Max[b]}     cm = {Position[c, Max[c]][[1, 1]], Max[c]}     dm = {Position[d, Max[d]][[1, 1]], Max[d]}     ListLinePlot[{a, b, c, d}, AxesLabel -> {"Iteraciones", "Objetivo"},       LabelStyle -> {24, Bold},       PlotStyle -> {{Thickness[0.01]}, {Thickness[0.01]}, {Thickness[          0.01]}}, Epilog -> {PointSize[0.04], Point[{am, bm, cm, dm}]}]
