I am performing a Bayesian updating on a Lognormal prior. After combining the prior and likelihood and dividing by the normalization constant I get the following expression as the posterior:               (0.805745 E^(-7.05*10^6 t - 0.255194 (15.576 + Log[t])^2))/t      I now want to use this as a distribution:               pdist = ProbabilityDistribution[posterior, {t, 10^-12, 10^-5}];      So far ok. I can now plot with the distribution               LogLinearPlot[PDF[pdist, t], {t, 10^-11, 10^-6}, PlotRange -> All, FrameLabel -> {"Failure Rate (f/hr)", "PDF"}]      But I cannot take the mean, Mean[pdist], or variance etc, they just return the input. Trying RandomReal[pdist] returns the following:               RandomReal::udist: The specification is not a random distribution recognized by the system      What am I missing in the assignment of the expression to ProbabilityDistribution[].
