I have issue with non-regulary spaced data. I have set of 3 numbers `{x, y, z}` in my list.               data={{-33335.6,15525.1,20722.4},{-33231.7,15509.8,20723.5},<<99852>>,{-32909.4,26425.3,20957.6},{-33021.5,26438.1,20954.4}}      I can plot my data with `ListDensityPlot`. I just want to get those data (interpolated) from the plot for further processing. If one uses               ListInterpolation[data, { {Min[xValues],         Max[xValues]}, {Min[yValues], Max[yValues]}},       InterpolationOrder -> 2]      Interpolation is poor, I suppose because data are not on regular tensor grid. Is there way just to get what _Mathematica_ is doing for `ListDensityPlot` ?
