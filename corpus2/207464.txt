I would like some help/advice on a design pattern or similar I could use for my problem. I have some shared functionality in my code and I use the Strategy pattern at present. I have a base class named "ProjectSectionBase" and from here I have 2 derived classes, "ProjectSectionStandard" and "ProjectSectionSuperior". Now the problem is that "ProjectSectionSuperior" has a lot of extra functionality than "ProjectSectionStandard" and I'm finding that throughout my code i am calling methods like this: DirectCast(_projectSection, ProjectSectionSuperior).DoSuperiorStuff And I am also wrapping IF statements such as IF typeof(_projectSectio) is superior then. It just feels like bad class design. Both standard and superior share a lot of common functionality but then Superior has so much more functionality. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
