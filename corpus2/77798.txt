I am thinking about helping to finance an adaptation of Postgres to utilize the GPU for sequential scans. To reduce my cost, I would like to get others who are interested in the same feature to co-fund it with me. I have come across a few sites facilitating such financing, but as none of the ones I looked at had facilitated the financing of more than a few projects, I did not even bookmark their URLs. **My question** What are the best sites to do this? The sites needs to be active. **EDIT:** The best thing would be if coders could also commit to contribute, either by developing, testing, documenting or doing other work.
