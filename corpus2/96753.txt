We have an HTML designer who is not a developer but needs to modify .aspx files from our ASP.NET 2.0 projects from time to time in order to get CSS to work properly with them. Currently, this involves giving her the .aspx page by itself, which she opens and edits via Visual Studio 2008 (her computer used to be a developer's). I'm considering getting her set up with Visual Web Developer 2010 Express and Subversion access so she can be more independent, but I wanted to make sure VS Express will work properly with what we do. So:   * Does VWD 2010 Express support automated tests?   * If no to the above, what happens when it opens a solution file that includes a test project, modifies it, and saves it?   * Are there any potential snags with setting up AnkhSVN with VWD 2010 Express?
