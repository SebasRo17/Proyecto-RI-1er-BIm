I have run into a problem that I can't explain. Here is the code:               σ = {{{0, 1}, {1, 0}}, {{0, -I}, {I, 0}}, {{1, 0}, {0, -1}}}     σ[[1]]          σr[t_] = Map[{Cos[t], Sin[t]}, {-Sin[t], Cos[t]}.# &, σ]     σr[[1]]      I just want to store the Pauli matrices in a list and call them as needed. The first block works fine. In the second block I'd like to apply a rotation on all matrices and be able to use the new matrices as with the first part. However, even though `σ` and `σr` have the same structure, I get a > >     "Part::partd: "Part specification σr[[1]] is longer than depth of > object" >   Can anyone tell me what I'm missing here? Thanks!
