I would like to convert this Java applet into an equivalent web app. This is my first time creating a web app, but I have some programming experience and time, and am willing to teach myself all of the necessary tools. By "web app", I mean an application which would work in browsers without requiring Java or Flash, for example. Therefore, it could work on compatible mobile devices. What tools should I look into for this development project?
