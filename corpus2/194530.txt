I'm currently planning a new ASP.NET MVC3 project which will be quite bespoke. However, there will be a lot of common features (login, profile edit, blog etc). Initially I was planning on building this all from scratch, however I'm tempted by CMS so that I'm not reinventing the wheel, and don't waste time building standard features which will need a lot of testing. I've been looking into using Orchard Project CMS, and installed this the other night so that I could have a play around. The CMS seems great, however it seems restrictive in terms of wanting to add new sections. I was hoping that the CMS would basically be an ASP.NET MVC3 solution, with login features etc, which I can then build on. However I feel bound to having to write "widgets" for my application. I understand CMS's are great for simple blog sites etc, but would it seems too restrictive to be able to build a social network for example. Is there such a thing as an open-source MVC3 solution with pre-built login functionality etc, which isn't bound by an interface? Or if I'm planning to build a large application, are CMS's the wrong path to take?
