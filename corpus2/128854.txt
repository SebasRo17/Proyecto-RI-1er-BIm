I'm building an app that I think would benefit from the use of MySQL stored procedures. I know stored procedures have a bad reputation, but I think they suit my application well. Using stored procedures would reduce the number of queries per request significantly (mostly inserts), as well as allow me to leverage the procedures across multiple implementations of this software. I think the software will benefit. My concern however, is that pushing functionality into stored procedures may make it harder for users to deploy the software on shared hosting services. Is it common practice to expect users to have stored procedure capability (i.e. allow scripts to create and run stored procedures)? **Edit:** This application is intended for my end user to deploy on her own.
