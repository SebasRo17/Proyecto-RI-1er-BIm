Evaluating the following lines in my computer takes near six seconds in Mathematica 10 and near 5 in Mathematica 9. I consider this very slow as only quantiles are being calculated from data to create this simple set of charts. I think that Mathematica should do much better than this. Do you agree? Thoughts?               data = Table[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[RandomInteger[5], 1], 100000], {10}];     Timing@BoxWhiskerChart[data, ChartLabels -> {"a", "b", "c"}, PerformanceGoal -> "Speed"]
