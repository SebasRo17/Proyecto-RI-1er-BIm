On reliable websites I always see claims such as "All data is encrypted" or "All passwords are encrypted using 128bit encryption" and etc. However I have never come across a claim such as "All passwords are hashed." On my website, I will be storing all user passwords in a database after using SHA-512 (most likely) hashing with a random salt. I want to add a snipet assuring users that their passwords are secure so they will not be deterred from using my website because it requires a password. I want users to feel secure but I do not think everyone knows what hashing is. MY QUESTION: Is it okay to provide a message saying that "All passwords are encrypted and secure" since I do not think that the average user will know what the difference between hashing and encryption is, and will more likely feel secure just because they see the comfort word "encryption"? Or is there an alternative message I should provide? On a side note, I am new to encryption and password hashing and I was wondering if this would be safe enough for now as I launch my site. I do not want to tell users it is secure if it is not. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
