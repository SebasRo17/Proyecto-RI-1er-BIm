In some code I'm writing right now, I have something like this:               if (uncommon_condition) {         do_something_simple();     } else {         do();         something();         long();         and();         complicated();     }      Part of me thinks "It's fine the way it's written. Simple cases should go first and more complicated cases should go next." But another part says: "No! The `else` code should go under the `if`, because `if` is for dealing with unusual cases and `else` is for dealing with all other cases." Which is correct or preferable?
