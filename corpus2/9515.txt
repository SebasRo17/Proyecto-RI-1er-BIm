Any suggestions for a good approach to implementing a zoomable 'keyframe' based curve editor? Essentially, something akin to the functionality of the graph editor in animation packages such as Maya. (see here). I can see how to get started on something simple using Locators, but the ability to zoom and pan on long time ranges is something that looks tricky to me, and I suspect starting out with the right concept in the first place will save a lot of headaches...any ideas much appreciated.
