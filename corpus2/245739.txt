I'm developing web application using PHP with CodeIgniter MVC framework with a huge real time client-side functionality needs. This is my first time to build large scale of client-side app. So I combine the PHP with a large scale of Javascript modules in one project. As you already know, MVC framework seperate application modules into Model- View-Controller. My concern is about View layer. I could be display the data on the DOM by PHP built-in script tag by load some data on the Controller. Otherwise I could use AJAX to pulled the data -- treat the Controller like a service only -- and display the them by Javascript. Here is some visualization I could put the data directly from Controller:               <label>Username</label> <input type="text" id="username" value="<?=$userData['username'];?>"><br />     <label>Date of birth</label> <input type="text" id="dob" value="<?=$userData['dob'];?>"><br />     <label>Address</label> <input type="text" id="address" value="<?=$userData['address'];?>">      Or pull them using AJAX:               $.ajax({       type: "POST",       url: config.indexURL + "user",                       dataType: "json",       success: function(data) {          $('#username').val(data.username);         $('#dateOfBirth').val(data.dob);         $('#address').val(data.address);       }     });      So, which approach is better regarding my application has a complex client- side functionality? In the other hand, PHP-CI has a default mechanism to put the data directly from Controller, so why using AJAX?
