This PGP library was bought up by Network Associates and then eventually Symantec Corporation. The source code is available and is licensed under the GPL (it was linked to from here). They have a source code license here: > http://www.pgp.com/developers/sourcecode/sourcecode_license.html Even though this code is licensed under the GPL, are they restricting me from using it for business purposes. i.e. I am not making any modifications to the code, I am not linking the code into any other commercial or otherwise business application. I just want to run the command line and desktop applications as part of the normal day-today goings on of my business (signing and encrypting emails). Is this permissable? **Update:** After having carefully re-read this page: > http://www.pgp.com/developers/sourcecode/index.html I have just noticed that the library itself _is not_ licensed under the GPL: > **Modifications to GPL Code**   >  Although PGPÂ® software itself is not subject to the GNU General Public > License (GPL), PGP Corporation utilizes certain code subject to the GPL However, the question and answers, had the library been fully GPL'd did help.
