I work using Reporting Services 2008 and I'm constantly creating ad-hoc reports. We'd like to use PowerPivot on Sharepoint but we're stuck on Sharepoint 2007. Using easy reporting software like Tableau Server would be fantastic but we can't afford it SSRS Report Builder hasn't proved to be very helpful, unfortunately. I've been trying to think of ways to leverage Excel / PowerPivot or any other (free or inexpensive) tool. We just need to be able to provide more data to users so they can analyze on their own. This is an area our IT team as a whole needs to improve. We use SSRS 2008 and SQL Server 2008. We also don't have a data warehouse, it's in the works...
