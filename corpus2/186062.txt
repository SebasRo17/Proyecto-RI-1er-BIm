I am developing an application for my universities student research symposium around the idea of polyglot persistence. I have read Martin Fowlers book and done some other research online about the verious different types of NoSQL db's. I am curious as to what the different use cases are for the different NoSQL databases? Currently I have what Fowler has pointed out (other research was mostly done into API's). Key/Value:   * session data   * user profile   * shopping cart   * basically anything that has a single unique key that can be easily generated and replicated Document:   * event logging   * CMS/blogging   * e-commerce (after the transaction has been completed)   * web analytics Column Family:   * event logging   * CMS/blogging   * counters   * expiring usage Graph:   * connected data   * location based services   * recommendation engine So what other use cases are there? More specifically what are the use cases for each type of NoSQL db that are better than a relational model?
