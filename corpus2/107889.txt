When should you put Key/Value type of data in it's own class instead of using a pre-built generic structure, such as a `KeyValuePair` or a `Tuple`? For example, most ComboBoxes I create contain a DisplayName and a Value. This is the kind of data I am trying to decide when to put in a new class, and when to just use a KeyValuePair. I am currently working on something that uses `iCalendar`, and the selected user's data ultimately gets combined into a `key1=value1;key2=value2;` type of string. I started out by putting the data in a `KeyValuePair<string,string>`, but now I am wondering if that should be it's own class instead. Overall, I am interested in finding out what guidelines are used when deciding to use an existing structure/class like a `KeyValuePair` over a 2-property object, and in what kind of situations you would use one over another.
