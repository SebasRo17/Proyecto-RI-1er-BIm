I want to be able to find low-complexity algebraic approximants to decimal numbers. For example, 1.41 can be approximated as a solution to the polynomial `x^2==2`. There is a Mathematica function `RootApproximant` that seems like it should be able to do this approximation. However, I can't get it to work. `RootApproximant[N[Sqrt[2]]` returns $\sqrt{2}$ correctly, but `RootApproximant[1.41]` doesn't - it prefers to approximate it as `141/100`. Presumably I need to tell it to lower the accuracy it's aiming for. There is an option called "DegreeCost" that can be passed, but I can't work out how to use that to achieve my goal.
