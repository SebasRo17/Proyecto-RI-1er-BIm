I'm developing a JavaScript application that uses several open source JavaScript projects. All their licenses have a phrase like "You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License". Does this mean I need to make a massive HTML comment at the top of my webpage with all the licences of the software that I use? I ask this question because I've never seen the source code of a webpage that does this.
