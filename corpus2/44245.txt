I need to distiguish the true rotation of a vector (time dependent, solution of a system of two coupled differential equation) respect a fixed vector. As showed in the follow,neither `VectorAngle` nor `ArcCos` work, because they yeld only positive results (i.e. as a counterclockwise rotation). I'm sure (from physical reasoning that the correct result is the opposite).               sol1 = FullSimplify[        DSolve[{y'[t] == -3 y[t] - z[t], z'[t] == -0.6 z[t] + y[t],         y[0] == 0, z[0] == 1}, {y[t], z[t]}, t]];          {{Gy[t_], Gz[t_]}} = {-z[t], y[t]} /. sol1;          sol2 = FullSimplify[        DSolve[{vy'[t] == -3 vy[t] - vz[t],       vz'[t] == -0.6 vz[t] +  vy[t], vy[T] == Gy[T],       vz[T] == Gz[T]}, {vy[t], vz[t]}, t]];          {{VY[t_], VZ[t_]}} = Simplify[{vy[t], vz[t]} /. sol2];          ang[T_]= VectorAngle[{Gy[0], Gz[0]}, {VY[0], VZ[0]}];          Plot[ang[T], {T, 0, 8}, PlotRange -> Full]      You can see, if you compile the code, that the plot result is: ![plot-output, but it'is incorrect](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vAEYS.jpg) I can obtain the correct result if I put an overall minus sign in `VectorAngle`, but obviously this is an incorrect procedure. I show her the output just for say you what is the "correct" output (as I said previously, I motivate it by physical reasoning)![correct plot- output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ifbEC.jpg)
