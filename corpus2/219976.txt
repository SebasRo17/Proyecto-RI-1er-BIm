Systems / programs / distributed algorithms / ... are often described with the predicate **robust** or **fault-tolerant**. What is the difference? * * * Details: When I google for +robust +"fault-tolerant", I only get two hits, both unhelpful. When I googlescholar for the terms, I find a lot of papers that have both terms in their title. Unfortunately, they do not precisely define the terms :( But since they use both terms, it seems that neither implies the other.
