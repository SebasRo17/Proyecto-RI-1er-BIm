There was a topic about job marker few days ago, and urban legends about this topic have been floating around as well. So, what's your experience? Have you tried hiring programmers (it's probably a good idea to mention the sector - web/database/embedded/general, and a continent)? And what are your experiences? Do companies receive 500+ CVs a day? No-one applies? People who apply are bad at things? What are the main reasons why candidates are found "not good enough"?
