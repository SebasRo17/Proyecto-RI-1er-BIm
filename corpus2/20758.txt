I'm not sure how to name this problem appropriately. But anyway. I have, say, three variables (arrays in my case), which I call:               A1, A2, A3      I would like to perform a certain operation on all of these arrays. Obviously I don't want to duplicate the code. What I figured is the following:               For[id = 1, id <= 3,     INPUT = ToExpression["A" <> ToString[id]];     INPUT = Table[{INPUT[[j, 1]], 10^4*INPUT[[j, 2]]}, {j, 1, Length[INPUT]}];     id += 1;     ];      This unfortunately does NOT work. It's just an example. But the big question is how to handle names of variables in "such" cases? Any help greatly appreciated.
