I can't find anything anywhere on the web to help me with this. My plot:               Plot[{(u (u + d) (1 - u))/u, u, 0}, {u, 0, 1},       PlotStyle -> {Orange, Green, Green}, PlotRange -> {-0.1, 1},       Frame -> True, Axes -> None, GridLines -> {{0}, {}},       GridLinesStyle -> Directive[Green]]      I would like to be able to put vertical arrows on the orange lines and horizontal arrows horizontal arrows on the green curve. If it helps, this is a plot of the nullclines of a system of ODEs and i need to draw the direction of the arrows of the vector field on each nullclines.
