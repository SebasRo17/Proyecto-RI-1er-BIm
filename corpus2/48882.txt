I was showing some of my code to a junior programer, and he asked me why am I registering functions for event handling like this:               button1.Click += new RoutedEventHandler(button1_Click);      and not like this:               button1.Click += button1_Click;      The only thing I could say was: because you just write `+=` and press tab two times... What is the difference between those two metods (if there is a difference)?
