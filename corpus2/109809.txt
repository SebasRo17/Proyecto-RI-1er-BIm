Ok so I've been out of university now for 7 years and in the same job as an application developer for a company that uses their own in house development languages/products. I've learnt a lot here but I should definitely be moving on now! In my time here I've dealt with hands on support, on site installation, training of customers, development of POC's (having to use a mix of technologies including Java and Python) and many other tasks. My main job however has NOT been Java oriented, although I'd say I do have a good deal of experience in it from my own personal projects. I am aware that this might reflect badly on my CV so I have spent a number of months adding professional certs to my resume, these include.   * Sun Certified Java Programmer 6   * Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 JSP and Servlets Developer   * Oracle Certified Exper, Java EE 6 Enterprise JavaBeans Developer I also plan to take the core spring training, shortly followed by taking the springsource certified spring professional exam. I'm not entirely sure how to structure my CV? Restricting myself to two pages is quite difficult especially seeing as mentioning my career history is obviously a big part (I currently have 3/4 of a page which mentions, job title, brief description of company I work for, what my duties include and some of my achievements, Java has a brief mention). Any advice for what I should do? Ideally if I get my foot in the door for an interview I'd be looking to start on a salary of about 35k (I'm in the UK) which is only a few k more than I'm earning currently. I'm posting this as anon because I'm aware of leaving a trail for potential employers, plus I'm disappointed in myself for staying here so long. EDIT: Forgot to mention I was in the UK, so that's Â£35k not $35k so in USD that's closer to $55k Edit2: Not in London, Bristol
