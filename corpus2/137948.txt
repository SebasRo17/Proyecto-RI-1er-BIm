I am about to start work on my biggest project yet (about 6 months full time work). For previous projects as they were only short I never intentionally used a model, I may have done but I didn't set out to do it. So... Before I start this project would it be advised to try and use some model? And if it is then what do you think would be useful to a 1 person team?
