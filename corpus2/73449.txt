I want to choose to learn a functional programming language, it should fulfill the criteria:   1. Open source, static typed & fully object-oriented too.   2. Must has web framework because it's for web development.   3. I want to avoid oracle jvm altogether, therefore not scala, clojure.   4. Should be rather popular, i.e. has real-world applications in industry. Please recommend which good language I can use? thanks.
