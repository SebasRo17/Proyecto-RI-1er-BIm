I have a question that must have a simple answer, but googling and searching this website did not produce an answer, so I'm asking it here. I'm working with three variables $x, y, \theta$, and I want to tell mathematica that I have a function $f$, which is a function of $x$ and $y$ alone. I **do not** have an expression for $f$; all I want is for mathematica to produce outputs like $f_x, f_y, f_{xx}$, etc, when asked to differentiate $f$, for instance. But I do want to get $0$ when I ask mathematica for $f_{\theta}$, since $f$ doesn't depend on $\theta$. How do I define this $f$? Thank you very much!
