I am trying to evaluate $$\displaystyle J=A\sum_{k=0}^{n-2}(-1)^k{n-2 \choose k}B^{n-2-k}\left(\frac{C_1}{k+n}-\frac{C_2}{k+n+1}+\frac{C_3}{k+n+2}-\frac{2}{k+n+3}\right)$$ in _Mathematica_ as a function of n (i.e. `J[n]`) Note that B, C1, C2, etc are just coefficients for some parameters I have in the model. I assign their values before I enter the function. They are given below for reference $$\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\left((n-1)nv^{-2n}\lambda^{-n}\right)=A \\ v+\lambda v=B\end{array}\right.$$ $$\left\{\begin{array}{cc}(v^2B\lambda)=C_1 \\ (vB+(B+2v)\lambda v)=C_2 \\ (2\lambda v+B+2v)=C_3 \end{array}\right.$$ Currently I have `J[n]` coded as:               J[n_] :=        a Sum[(-1^k) Binomial[n - 2, k] (b^(n - 2 - k))            ((c1/(k + n)) - (c2/(k + n + 1)) - (c3/(k + n + 2)) - (2/(k + n + 3))),          {k, 0, n - 2}]      But when I call it by `J[5]` with `{v, lambda} = {1.3, 2.1}`, for instance, I get a negative value when it should be positive! Another user, Dolma, who helped me derive the function (it's a definite integral of another function) claims it is positive here. I trust that I am doing something wrong more so than Dolma's derivation being wrong, though I should mention _Mathematica_ provides a MUCH more complex answer to this integral than in the post above. Can anyone spot where I am making a mistake? I appreciate your time and insight!
