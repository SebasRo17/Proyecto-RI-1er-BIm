> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What are some good tools for introducing kids to programming? My 9 year old is obsessed with developing an app, and I have no idea how to help him with this. Where/how should he start? Are there some simple yet useful online courses or tutorials? Does he need to know how to program? And if so, what type of programming courses should I look for? Thanks for any help!
