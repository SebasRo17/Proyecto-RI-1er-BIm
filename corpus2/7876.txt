I can extract the parameters of a single variable derivative with the rule               D[f[x], x] /. Derivative[order_][fcn_][variable_] ->       {order, fcn, variable}      produces               {1, f, x}      How do I generalize this to the multivariate case? For example,               D[f[x, y], x, y] /. Derivative[order_][fcn_][variable_] ->       {order, fcn, variable}      produces ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZhEw.png) The match didn't work -- but I can't seem to reproduce the actual Mathematica display. I'm sure there's some magic syntax that will accomplish the match. I tried a few variations to no avail. Can anyone help? Thanks much.
