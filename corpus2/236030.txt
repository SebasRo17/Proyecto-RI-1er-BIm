I will give a simple example to help you understand my question. Suppose we have a rectangle and a Utility class with a method that creates a buffer arround a shape. The `.createBuffer` method has required and optional arguments:   * required: radius   * optional: direction (for example "inside" or "outside", default is "outside") ... maybe more arguments ... Every combination of arguments needs a different algorithm. Which design pattern is appropriate for solving similar problems?
