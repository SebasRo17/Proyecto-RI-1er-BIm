I'm trying to export and then later import graphs with additional data added such as `VertexLabels` and `EdgeLabels`. When I export a graph, such as the following, and then import it, I find that some information has been lost.               g=Graph[{1->2,2->3,3->1},VertexLabels->"Name",VertexStyle->Purple,VertexShapeFunction->"Diamond"];     Export["graph.gml",g];     r=Import["graph.gml"]      This will maintain some of the options, e.g. `VertexShapeFunction` and `VertexStyle`, but will lose `VertexLabels`.               PropertyValue[r,VertexLabels]      The above returns `{}`,showing that the data was not retained. I have tried .graphml and .gxl formats as well, with the same issues.               Import["graph.gml",{{VertexLabels}}]      The above returns the following error:               Import::noelem: The Import element "VertexLabels" is not present when importing as Graphlet. >>      What is the best way to export and then import graphs while retaining all additional data?
