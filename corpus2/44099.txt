I have Safari, Opera, Chrome, Firefox and IE installed how might a get a browser screen shot of a set of HTML code from inside Mathematica(for any of those browsers)? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/441Lu.png) (Image is optional) The shortest/leanest/fastest approach(within reason) is ideal. For example: Waiting for a website to serve a screen shot is to long. The solution should be local.                screenshot["<!doctype html><i>Italicized text</i>"]      screenshot["http://example.com"]      Possible ideas: SWT, HTMLunit ,http://watin.org/, Selenium (fairly certain Selenium will work with right install and code).
