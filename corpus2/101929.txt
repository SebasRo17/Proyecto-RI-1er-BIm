Are there any legal hassles when you work in these Casino kinds of industry? I'm offered a job and I like it owing to clever algorithms and multi-threaded enviornment. I'd like some advice on legal issues before taking the offer. *Ok I'm not going to sue any one of you for bad advice. I just wanted to know if people have any experience in such affairs. And I'm not looking for a lawyer's advise at all, I'm trying to know the gaming industry trends in general and what the programmers there have to say about their work when it comes to gamblings. And how would the lawyer know what goes inside the casino programming industry? *
