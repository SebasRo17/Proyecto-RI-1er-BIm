A small team (3 or 4) are working on a fairly big project that might take 1 year to complete. We are basically re-designing an existing software (that had been developer over 5-6 years while being used without any direction). Currently we have a list of things we would like to have (features). We have about 25 of them. How do we effectively turn these into a number of backlog tasks and also build our specs from here. Any resources or help would be appreciated as we are all fairly new to design process.
