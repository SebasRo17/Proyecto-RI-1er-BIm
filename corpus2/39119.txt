Background: I'm looking to write some fully functional webservices in Common Lisp as an April Fools prank on the rest of the development team at my company. There are two pieces to this: reading info from / writing it to a MySQL database, and receiving / processing / responding to requests over HTTP. (Actually, there's a third piece, writing automated tests, but my QA partner- in-crime is going to handle that part.) After some Googling I found a good resource here ( http://www.ymeme.com/creating-dynamic-websites-lisp-apache.html ), but I'm surprised that there's seemingly only the one walkthrough. Does anyone know of others, or can anyone share personal experiences with writing webservices in CLisp?
