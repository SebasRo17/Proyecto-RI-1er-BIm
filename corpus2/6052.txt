I want to calculate following recursive sequence: $\alpha_{0}=0,\\\ \cos(\alpha_{i})=\cos(\alpha_{i-1})\cdot\cos(\beta_{i})+\sin(\alpha_{i-1})\cdot\sin(\beta_{i})\cdot\cos(\gamma_{i}).$ In mathematica 8.0.1 I try to do this with:               endRecursion = 20;     beta = Import["beta.txt", "List"];     beta = beta[[1;;endRecursion]];     gamma = RandomReal[{0,2*Pi}, endRecursion];          alpha[0]:= 0;     alpha[i_]:=         ArcCos[Cos[alpha[i-1]]*Cos[beta[[i]]]+         Sin[alpha[i-1]]*Sin[beta[[i]]]*Cos[gamma[[i]]]];          result=Table[alpha[i], {i, 1, endRecursion}];      The values for `beta` are imported because they are generated by another formula which is not important for my question here. Values for `beta` can be found here. The problem is that the calculation of the `result` is very slowly. It takes about 14s for just 20 iterations! And I need about 300 iterations (times ~10000, because I have several lists of beta values). I recognized that the calculation is much faster if I skip the `Cos[alpha[i-1]]` in the first or the `Sin[alpha[i-1]]` in the 2nd summand. Then it takes just ~ 0.01 s for 20 iterations. But unfortunately this falsifies my result. I cannot understand why it is so much faster if there is just one time `alpha[i-1]` on the right side of the equation. Am I doing something wrong? Is there any way to increase the speed of this calculation? I would be glad about any help!
