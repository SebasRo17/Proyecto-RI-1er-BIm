I was thinking about it. You may have access to endless memory (one computer with lot of RAM) so that you can keep on adding more and more elements to your ArrayList. But, I think that you can only access elements BY INDEX up to a certain value of index. The maximum size of this index could be = maximum number your computer can represent, that is long 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 in Java. I know that you can access the NEXT element using an iterator. But, how do i access elements after the (9,223,372,036,854,775,807)TH index, using an index number ?
