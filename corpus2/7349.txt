As a **general purpose** programmer, what should you learn first and what should you learn later on? Here are some skills I wonder about...   * SQL    * Regular Expressions    * Multi-threading / Concurrency    * Functional Programming    * Graphics    * The mastery of your mother programming language's syntax/semantics/featureset    * The mastery of your base class framework libraries    * Version Control System    * Unit Testing    * XML    * Do you know other important ones? Please specify them... On which skills should I focus first?
