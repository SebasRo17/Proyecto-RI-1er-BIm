I have signed a Non-competitive agreement but I would like to be able to reuse some code across all projects that I work on for this company. So, which license can be used for my library code that would basically say the following:   * I (the author) can use my library code in any client project.   * You cannot use my code in part or in whole in any of your projects.   * You may not redistribute or share my code in any way in part or in whole.
