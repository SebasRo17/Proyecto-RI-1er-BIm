I'm working on software that uses the following libraries:   * Biopython   * SciPy   * NumPy All of the above have licenses similar to `MIT` or `BSD`. Three scenarios:   1. First, if I don't redistribute those dependencies, and only my code, then all I need is my own copyright and license (planing on using the `MIT License`) for my code. Correct?    2. What if I use py2exe or py2app to create a binary executable to distribute so as to make it easy for people to run the application without needing to install python and all the dependencies. Of course this also means that my binary file(s) contains python itself (along with any other packages I might have performed a `pip install xyz`).   3. What if I bundle Biopython, SciPy, and NumPy binaries in my package? In the latter two cases, what do I need to do to comply with copyright laws.
