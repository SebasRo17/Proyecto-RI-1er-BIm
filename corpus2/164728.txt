For example, should I be doing something like:               <?php     function output_message($message,$type='success') {       ?>       <p class="<?php echo $type; ?>"><?php echo $message; ?></p>       <?php     }     output_message('There were some errors processing your request','error');     ?>      or               <?php     function output_message($message,$type='success') {       ob_start();       ?>       <p class="<?php echo $type; ?>"><?php echo $message; ?></p>       <?php       return ob_get_clean();     }     echo output_message('There were some errors processing your request','error');     ?>      I understand they both achieve the same end result, but are there benefits doing one way over the other? Or does it not even matter?
