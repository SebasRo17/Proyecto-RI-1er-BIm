When I want to test something in JavaScript, I open up a new browser window (mostly Firefox) and start writing code in the provided console (mostly Firebug). However, this tends to be really tedious and slow. Is there an environment, like an IDE with self-execution capability for example, in which we can test JavaScript? Guide: I'm looking for something like jsfiddle, but not in the browser, and not online. I'd like to have an execution environment which is both off-line, and is not a browser. All I'm asking is to have something like the Firebug Console as a separate applications (preferably Windows application) which can be opened by double- clicking, and in which, you can write JavaScript code and hit execute. That's all. In simpler terms, all I want is Firebug's console, without Firefox. Do we have such a thing on the market?
