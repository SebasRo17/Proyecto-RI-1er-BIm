I have discovered a problem with `OpenerView`. My opener views always close when I change the value of the manipulator control in my `Manipulate`. A simple example:               Manipulate[       Column[        {OpenerView[{"plot1", Panel@Plot[x^2, {x, -10, 2}]}, False],          OpenerView[{"plot2", Panel@Plot[x^2 + 3 x, {x, -10, 2}]}, False],          Plot3D[Sin[ n x y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]}],      {n, 1, 10, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fdkYf.jpg) I tried the option `ContentSize` in the `Manipulate` and `ImageSize` in the `OpenerView`, but both failed. My question is what options do I need to add to make the interface to keep the state of the opener views unchanged when I change the value of the slider for `n`?
