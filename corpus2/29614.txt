Programming always required to learn new concepts, paradigms, features and technologies and I always have been failed at first attempt to understand new concept what i encounter. I start to blame and humiliate myself without remember before how i understood new concept which i hadn't understand it before. I can hardly stop to tell myself "why i cant understand ? Am i stupid or idiot ? Yes, i am stuppiiddddd!!!" What your inner voice tells if you can not understand new concept after spend long time till been tired or hopeless ? How do you handle your self-esteem in such situations ?
