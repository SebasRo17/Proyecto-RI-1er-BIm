> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to combine images with the same dimensions in a grid? I would like to arrange images without any space between their edges as each piece is made to connect with others. The images should not necessarily be merged but simply tiled. My ultimate purpose is to use a Manipulate to generate different arrangements. So, how can I place those images in a coordinate system so I can define 9 positions and assign those locations to the images without any space between them ? Below my attempt using Grid and 2 example of the desired Output once I figure this out. Those composition were generated using Java Scripts. **EDIT** : The problem with `Grid` or `ImageAssemble` is they would not allow for "empty slots", which is an option I would like to have as shown in the last image for example. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2V1DA.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MZExV.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MW6h8.png)
