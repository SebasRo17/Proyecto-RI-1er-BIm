This appears in a combinatorics book: $a(m,n)=2 a(m,n-1)+2 a(m-1,n)-3 a(m-1,n-1)$ It is a recurrence equation for the number of rook walks from $(0,0)$ to $(m,n)$. The initial conditions are: $ a(0,0)=1,\;a(0,1)=1,\;a(1,0)=1,\;a(1,1)=2 $ The following is my implementation in _Mathematica_ :               RecurrenceTable[{ a[m,n] == -3a[m-1,n-1] + 2a[m1,n] + 2a[m,n1],                       a[0,0] == 1, a[0,1] == 1, a[1,0] == 1, a[1,1] == 2},                      a, {m, 1, 10},{n, 1, 10}]      That will not work and just returns the function. I tried entering more initial conditions and changing the iterators to `0,10` and `2,10` etc. I know I can do this with loops or recursive functions and memoization, but I am wondering what I am doing wrong with `RecurrenceTable`
