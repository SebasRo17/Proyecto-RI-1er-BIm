From what I've read agile development often involves refactoring or reverse engineering code into diagrams. Of course there is much more than that, but if we consider the practices that rely on these two methods, are dynamically typed languages at disadvantage? It seem staticly-typed languages would make refactoring and reverse engineering much easier. Is Refactoring or (automated) reverse engineering hard if not impossible in dynamically typed languages? What does real world projects tell about usage of dynamically typed languages for agile methodology?
