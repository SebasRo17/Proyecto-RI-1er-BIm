Recently, I've been switching between several projects and development environments. The expectations for coding style in each is different. Now, my question is three part, the first, just of curiosity:   1. How did you define and find your coding style?   2. How do you keep augmenting and improving it?   3. How do you maintain it? (From mental notes, keeping a document, using a tool like StyleCop etc.)
