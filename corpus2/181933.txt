Our company has spent a year working on an internal web application and has decided to open source the project and host on github. The application was originally versioned with Bazaar and we are going to preserve the commit history when converting it to git. There is some confidential information within the commit history, such as internal database information. **Question:**   Is there a way to preserve the commit history while removing or hiding all traces of confidential information? The big reason being that we have had employees that have worked on the project that have moved on to ~~higher-paying~~ other jobs and we want to maintain recognition of their hard work.
