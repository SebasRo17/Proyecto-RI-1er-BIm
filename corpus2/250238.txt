I have two objects which work together to provide interaction with HIDs on a machine. One object is responsible for the communication (read/write) to the HID and the other object is responsible for modelling the HID. Information is read and written to the HID as byte arrays. As a contrived example:               class Hid     {       private HidComms comms;            public DateTime? GetPropertyB()       {         return comms.GetPropertyB();       }     }          class HidComms     {          public DateTime? GetPropertyB()       {         // request property B from HID         // get 1 or more byte[] in response         return new DateTime();       }     }      Which of these two objects should be responsible for encoding/decoding the byte arrays, or should a third object be responsible for this? Meaning the `Hid` object only knows about state and the `HidComms` object only knows how to read/write with a third object responsible for the conversion?
