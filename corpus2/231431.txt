Currently I'm sending UDP messages to a server which handles and processes the message. To make the processing more scalable, I'd like to have some sort of autoscaling mechanism for the receiving servers. I have two ideas: 1.) Use a UDP load balancing technology   2.) Distribute the messages on the client side. For the second option, I would update the receiving server list on the client side using a background thread on the client and would hit some sort of internal API and retrieve an updated list periodically. My question is, does this sound like a reasonable method? Also, would something like zookeeper be good for this? It would store the server list and be retrieved by the clients.
