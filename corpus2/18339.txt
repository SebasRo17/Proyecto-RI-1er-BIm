I am using the following structure to save the images that users are uploading for their items:   * Images      * User_dir1        * Item_dir1          * Picture_file1         * Picture_file2     * User_dir2        * Item_dir2          * Picture_file3       * Item_dir3          * Picture_file4 Can I go on with this if I am going to have thousants of users and hundrets of items per user? Talking about performance will the Linux dedicated server have trouble in the future? Thanks!
