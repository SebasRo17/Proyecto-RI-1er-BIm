What is the best way to provide popups that contain asp.net server controls? I am working on a .net site. I have search functionality where if someone presses a button a panel appears where they can input the search information. I would like this to be a popup instead. Normal JavaScript won't work because the controls operate server side. So how do I go about creating a popup that is interacted with via server side?
