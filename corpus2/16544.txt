What build or deployment tools are available for a 1 person development effort, in the .NET space, that are capable of producing project outputs? I'm not looking _necessarily_ looking for a CI server (though I can't think of anything else that does what I'm looking for) but I am looking for it to:   * produce and publish documentation from xml comments   * produce and publish the project (web and/or clickonce app)   * handle basic versioning (automatic build number incrementing)   * work from a sln file   * be easy to setup (< 8-16 hrs for someone who knows little to nothing about the tool(s))   * do this at the push of a button (after configuration obviously) Things I don't need:   * source control integration : I can point it to a sln if need be. Not a huge deal.   * unit testing : I run test suite before commits   * static analysis : again, I also run these before commits I know that msbuild is capable of most or all of this, and I do have my msbuild book(s) with me, but I'm still very new to it and I don't have the time at the moment to learn it well enough to do what I want.
