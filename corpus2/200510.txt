The C Programming Language by K & R states that C, like most languages, does not specify the order in which operands of an operator are evaluated. (The exceptions are &&,||,?: and ','). According to the book, the result of the statement :               printf("%d %d\n",++x,power(2,x));      depends on the compiler. But it itself says in the previous line,that I have quoted that it does not predict the order of evaluation,except ',' and others. So don't you think book is contradicting itself?
