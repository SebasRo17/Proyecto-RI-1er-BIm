I have spent three hours debugging some code and at the end I think I found a bug. Otherwise I cannot explain what I am seeing: When I want to use `RankedMax` on nested sublists, Mathematica freaks out, but it works all smooth as I expect when I use `Max`. Try:               tab = Table[{i, j, k}, {i, 1, 2}, {j, 1, 3}, {k, 1, 4}] // TableForm     Map[Function[{x}, x/Max[x]], tab] // TableForm     Map[Function[{x}, x/RankedMax[x, 1]], tab] // TableForm      The last line will cause an error, and I do not understand why, because the documentation says: > RankedMax[{Subscript[x, 1],...,Subscript[x, m]},1] is equivalent to > Max[{Subscript[x, 1],...,Subscript[x, m]}]. Why is this happening? Do I understand something incorrectly?
