Let's say I have two manipulated plots:               Manipulate[Plot[Sin[a x], {x, 0, Pi}], {a, 0, 10}]     Manipulate[Plot[Cos[b x], {x, 0, Pi}], {b, 0, 10}]      How can I create a new plot that combines these two and is updated dynamically by each of them? Can I somehow use `Show[]`? Of course I could create a unified manipulator, but in reality these are a handful of conceptually separate problems with lots of sliders each and I'd hate to duplicate them all.
