I have a function which needs to output a string containing a list of file paths. I can choose the separation character but I cannot change the data type (e.g. I cannot return a `List<string>` or something like that). Wanting to use some well-established convention, my first intuition was to use the semicolon, similar to what Windows's `PATH` and Java's `CLASSPATH` (on Windows) environment variables do:               C:\somedir\somefile.txt;C:\someotherdir\someotherfile.txt      However, I was surprised to notice that `;` is a _valid character_ in an NTFS file name. So, is the established best practice to   * just ignore this fact (i.e. "no sane person should use `;` in a file name and if they do, it's their own fault") or   * is there some other _established_ character for separating Windows paths or files? (The pipe (`|`) might be a good choice, but I have not seen it used anywhere yet for this purpose.)
