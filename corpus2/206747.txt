I just have a quick licensing question about PSEXEC by sysinternals. As some of you may know if you have ever used PSEXEC, it is confusing to learn at first. I have created a program that makes it easier to use, and was wondering if I am allowed to sell that program (even if PSEXEC is included with it?). I looked in the sysinternals license agreement, but couldn't really find the answer to my question. The agreement is here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en- us/sysinternals/bb469936 The main download and info page for PSEXEC is here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb469936 Please let me know if I will be allowed to sell my program. (I assume i am on the right stackexchange site, but let me know if I should move my question) Thanks!
