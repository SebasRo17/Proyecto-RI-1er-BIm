I have a piecewise function that I would like to plot but I was wondering if it is possible that each part of the function that is plotted when its corresponding condition is true be plotted with a different color from the other parts. That is, if I have a Piecewise function `Piecewise[{{val1, cond1},{val2,cond2},{val3,cond3}}]` then I want `val1`, `val2`, and `val3` to be plotted with different colors so that I can differentiate each case in the plot.
