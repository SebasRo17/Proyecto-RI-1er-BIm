Case1: formula generated by functions.               Nest[1 + 1/Style[#, Red] &, x, 5]          (*         1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/(1+1/x))))     *)          TeXForm[%]          (*         \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}+1}+1}+1}+1}+1     *)      Case2: formula typed by hand(or copy from elsewhere) in inline `InlineFormula` style cell or in `DisplayFormula` style cell. This is an inline formula with coloring ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CFT7k.png) Some posts or answers at Math.SE you would see are with colored TeXForm output rendered. Here is one sample http://math.stackexchange.com/a/432154/76942 If you are interested that, you may find some more samples, it's helpful by highlighting questionable part of the formulas when asking in Math.SE or Mathematica.SE.                Consider the analytic formulas relating the $\color{#00A000}{\text{vertices}}$      , $\color{#C00000}{\text{midpoints}}$, and $\color{#0000FF}{\text{median}}$:      > $\color{#C00000}{\text{midpoints}}$, and $\color{#0000FF}{\text{median}}$:
