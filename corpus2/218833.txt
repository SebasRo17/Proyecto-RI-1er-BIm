Recently reading a lot materials on Reactive Programming, one thing frequently mentioned is the 'PUSH' versus 'PULL' style of application. Event driven ( Reactive programming ) Some of the authors say that both these styles have their area of applications, but aren't most application domains we are trying modeling are all changing rapidly in real world and thus event driven is more appropriate? And why we started from the 'PULL' approach and now turning into 'PUSH' approach, are there specific reasons causing the change?
