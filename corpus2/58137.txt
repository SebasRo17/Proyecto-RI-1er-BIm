I want plot the max value in a sine plot. We can use the following code               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 50}, Mesh -> {{.99}},        MeshFunctions -> {#2 &},        MeshStyle -> {PointSize[Large], Red}]      Why can't `Mesh -> 1` be used to plot the red point? But in a mathematics way, I want to use this code               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 50},        Mesh -> {{1}},        MeshFunctions -> {Boole[(Cos[#] == 0) && (-Sin[#] < 0)] &},        MeshStyle -> {PointSize[Large], Red}]       You can see the `MeshFunction` doesn't work? Why? Then I try some other test. For example,I want to emphasize the point above 0.5 to draw on Red. I use this code               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 50},        Mesh -> {{1}},        MeshFunctions -> {Boole[Greater[#2, 0.5]] &}]       It doesn't work again. So I guess the equation `PrimePi[z] == 2` will give `2 <= z < 3`. To see whether this region can plot in `MeshFunction`, I tried the following:               f[x_, y_] := (x^2 + 3 y^2)*E^(1 - x^2 - y^2)          Plot3D[f[x, y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},        Mesh -> {{1}},        MeshFunctions -> {PrimePi[#3] &}]       ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DU9XG.png) You can see the plot is weird. So what is my problem with `MeshFunction`? Can I use `MeshFunction` to plot the maximum value in a plot?
