So, I'm not a programmer, though I've been writing code all of my life. As is my habit, I attempt to contact well know experts in almost any domain I find of interest, and interestingly, I get a lot of meetings, which I value a great deal. So, here's the deal -- a meeting has been set for me to meet a very well known programmer and I would like advice on how to make the most of it. They've written a number of books, some of which I've read, but nothing strikes me as a point of conversion; meaning they know I'm not a real programmer, though I am very interested in talking to them about their advice for becoming a programmer. Should I attempt to have a potential coding topic, set of code to review, etc -- or just show up and get general advice?
