I am trying to solve a system of two equations with two unknowns. In these equations I have, a part from constants:   * Unknown nr 1, $$D_{\perp}$$   * Unknown nr 2, $$\omega_C$$   * Known function of r: $$\mu(r)$$ The full system looks like: equation1: $$ D_{||}= \frac 1 {2 \omega_0}(-\alpha-1)\sqrt{(-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||})^2+(\mu(r)D_{\perp})^2}+ \frac{\alpha}{2\omega_0}\sqrt{(-2\omega_0-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||})^2+(\mu(r)D_{\perp})^2}+ \frac{1}{2\omega_0}\sqrt{(2\omega_0-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||})^2+(\mu(r)D_{\perp})^2} $$ and equation2: $$ 1= \mu(r) \frac{\alpha}{2\omega_0} \ln{\left[\frac{-2\omega_0-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||}+\sqrt{(-2\omega_0-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||})^2+(\mu(r)D_{\perp})^2}}{-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||}+\sqrt{(-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||})^2+(\mu(r)D_{\perp})^2}}\right]}+ \frac{\mu(r)}{2\omega_0} \ln{\left[\frac{2\omega_0-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||}+\sqrt{(2\omega_0-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||})^2+(\mu(r)D_{\perp})^2}} {-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||}+\sqrt{(-\omega_C+\mu(r)D_{||})^2+(\mu(r)D_{\perp})^2}}\right]} $$ So the solution of the system of equations will be $$D_{\perp}(r),\;\omega_C(r)$$. What I've tried to do is simply                   Solve[{equation1, equation2},{Dorthogonal, omegaC}]      but Mathematica keeps on running forever without any output. I have also tried:                   DorthFun[r_]:=Solve[{equation1, equation2},{Dorthogonal, omegaC}][[1,1]]         omegaCFun[r_]:=Solve[{equation1, equation2},{Dorthogonal, omegaC}][[1,2]]      and it just keeps on running... It doesn't return any errors. Just...eternal running. Forrest Gump Syndrome... I have also tried to solve the system putting $$\mu(r)=1$$ without any change. I have given Mathematica about 20 minutes. Should I give it more time or does this mean that Mathematica cannot solve this? Or is there something I could do differently? Thank you for your help! My code looks like this:                   NSolve[{         Dparallel==1/(2 omega0) Sqrt[(-omegaC + Dparallel)^2 + (Dorth)^2] (-alpha-1)+alpha/(2omega0)Sqrt[(-2omega0-omegaC+Dparallel)^2+(Dorth)^2]+1/(2omega0)Sqrt[(2omega0-omegaC+Dparallel)^2+(Dorth)^2],         1 == alpha/(2omega0)Log[(-2omega0-omegaC+Dparallel+Sqrt[(-2omega0-omegaC+Dparallel)^2+(Dorth)^2])/(-omegaC+Dparallel+Sqrt[(-omegaC+Dparallel)^2+(Dorth)^2])]+1/(2omega0)Log[(2omega0-omegaC+Dparallel+Sqrt[(2omega0-omegaC+Dparallel)^2+(Dorth)^2])/(-omegaC+Dparallel+Sqrt[(-omegaC+Dparallel)^2+Sqrt[(-omegaC+Dparallel)^2+(Dorth)^2]])]         }, {Dorth, omegaC}]
