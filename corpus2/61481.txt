I've started working on my first open source project on Codeplex and came across some terrible code. (I did learn that C# still has the "goto" statement) I started adding features that the "owner" wanted and after exploring the code base and seeing what a mess it was (e.g using "goto") I wanted to clean it up a bit. But I am a bit concerned and that is why I'm turning to you all: is it proper etiquette for me to "fix" the "bad code" or should I let it be and work on new features? Like I said before, I'm new to the whole OSS scene and working on a team in general so I would like to not mess it up.
