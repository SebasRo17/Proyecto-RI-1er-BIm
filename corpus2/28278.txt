Over lunch, a colleague of mine, that has a manager (person in direct charge of the project) and a BOSS up top was asked to resolve one issue. The manager had arguments with the boss regarding how it should be resolved. They both agreed they would go with the manager's way. When my colleague was starting to resolve the issue, the Boss calls and said, "You do it my way." In this case, what would you do?!
