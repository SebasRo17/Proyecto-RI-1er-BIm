I'm a web developer primarily, and I've been learning C/C++ and trying to get involved in some open source projects. Something I find very unusual is the lack of comments in C/C++ source code (I've looked at big projects like Linux, Varnish, and HipHopVM). In web development, I'm used to seeing a **lot** of comments in source code, and I tend to comment a lot as well. I assume it's a culture/attitude thing, as I posted some C code for review and a couple people said I had too many comments.
