We can use `RowReduce` with a field. For example, we state               RowReduce[{{1,3,5},{0,1,2}},Modulous->23]      ...which then returns:               {{1,0,22},{0,1,2}}      ...So we will have effectively solved a linear system in a field. **THE QUESTION** Can we somehow use this to solve a system with variables, i.e. solve a symbolic system? As an example, I would like to somehow solve:               RowReduce[{{1,3,a},{0,1,b}},Modulous->23]      The idea is that we should get a result essentially stating something like:               {{1,0,a - 3b},{0,1,b}}      or possibly even better:               {{1,0,a + 20b},{0,1,b}}      The first result is just the solution without the `modulous` included. I'm wondering if there is some way to get the second result.
