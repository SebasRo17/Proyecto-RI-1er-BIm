I am having trouble with this Mathematica command:                Probability[ x + y + z > 14, {x, y, z} \[Distributed]       ProductDistribution[{DiscreteUniformDistribution[{1, 6}], 3}]]`      outputs 5 / 54. What I would like to do is use the EmpiricalDistribution sort of like this:                Probability[x + y + z > 14, {x, y, z} \[Distributed]      ProductDistribution[{EmpiricalDistribution[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}], 3}]]      of course, that does not work and just spits out the command. How can I get the Empirical Distribution to work like that?
