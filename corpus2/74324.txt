I am a newbie trying to learn embedded systems programming on ubuntu. I've tried the below link: http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/Linux-For-Devices-Articles/Tutorial-A- simple-embedded-Linux-system/ But after doing this, I don't know, I felt as though I just created a USB boot disk. I don't know what other people knowledgeable in this field might think...nonetheless I'd like to take the next step. What should I look for next?
