I've noticed that Mathematica 8 seems to have some kind of string interpolation feature, but I couldn't find any documentation on it and I can't figure out how it works. For example, if I enter               StringForm["x=``", 1 + 2]      in a notebook and evaluate it, I get the string `"x=3"`. If I select that cell and choose Cell->Convert To->StandardForm (Ctrl-Shift-N], Mathematica converts the cell to an expression that looks like this:               "x=\!\(1 + 2\)"      that also evaluates to `"x=3"` However, if I enter the exact same character sequence on a new cell, it evaluates to `"x=1 + 2"`. My question is: Is this documented somewhere? How does it work?
