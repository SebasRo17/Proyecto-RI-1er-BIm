Ok I am trying to follow the examples of Cuda Code in the docummentation Run the `CUDAQ[]` and get back a `True` and run some of the first examples of Cuda code in the documentation and they also work but when I try               doubleFun = CUDAFunctionLoad["       __global__ void doubleVec(mint * in,  mint length) {           mint index = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;               if (index < length)               in[index] = 2*in[index];         }", "doubleVec", {{_Integer}, _Integer}, 256]      This example is to multiply a vector by 2 I get the following error code               CUDAFunctionLoad::noxcomp: A C compiler was not found in specified directory `1`.      Set"XCompilerInstallation" to the directory containing a supported C compiler.         Supported C compilers are detailed in the NVCCCompiler documentation page. >>      It looks like mathematica does not know where my C compiler is at and needs to be define I look in the documentation and I do not see how to do that. I am using OS X for Mac and from the above error message they are asking me to set XCompilerInstallation to the directory containing the C compiler, I also have installed XCode. What should I do next?
