_Mathematica_ seriously lacks some useful toolbars. I wonder why keeping a totally barebone gui is part of WRI's policy? Would such a feature be so platform-specific that it does not worth design it? I really am clueless here. Palettes are fine, but they don't behave like toolbars or dockers. First of all, I have to write them (which is in itself is not trivial to do, see e.g. this post on MathGroup), but then even if I create some, how can I tell them to appear every time I start _Mathematica_ , and that they should appear the same place (e.g. toolbar should be below menubar)? It would be nice to have a toolbar where some of the functionality of the menu **and** custom-wrote functions can be accessed easily. Note that this question is not just about **how to implement it** , but also about **why this was not implemented so far**. If you think that this does not belong here, I am happy to ask it on meta or delete it. For those requiring a specific question for which some coding can be done, here it is: **Question:** How to implement a toolbar with buttons like **Restart kernel** , **Delete all output** , **Show memory in use** , **Turn off syntax colouring** , etc. which always starts with _Mathematica_ and docks just below the menubar in such a way that when windows are maximized, they do not go behind or cover it?
