I've got a two variable function that I'm plotting against one axis for a few different values of a parameter               Clear[f, r]     f[r_] := 4 r /(1 - r)^2     i[r_, delta_] := 1/(1 + f[r] Sin[delta/2]^2)     Show[      Table[ Plot[i[r, delta], {delta, 0, 4 Pi},        PlotRange -> {0, 1}], {r, {0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.97}}]      ]      This looks like ![Plot of etalon interference](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jd5PZ.png) but I'd like to label each of the curves with the value of the parameter (`r = 0.1`, `r = 0.3`, ...). I can do this manually inserting labels with the Graphics controls, but figured there's got to be a better way.
