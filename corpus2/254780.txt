I am an experienced java developer.Of now I have started learning multithreading in java.I am able to grasp most of the concepts but still I am unable to visualize applications running on threads.I know the concept but somewhere if I am given a problem statement, I am unable to think or visualize it in threads.How should my approach be in order to start visualizing applications in threading and start coding the applications in threads?
