Sometimes, when I open Mathematica, while the opening splash screen still says "Initializing Kernel Connections", Windows will tell me that "Wolfram Mathematica 9 has stopped working". This will happen every time I try to open Mathematica for a while, but then just as randomly as it started, it will stop, and I'll be able to open Mathematica again with no problems. When it stops working, I'm given the option to Debug it, but all I can tell is that it's a segmentation fault that seems to be caused by dereferencing a null pointer. Interestingly, MathKernel still runs fine even when Mathematica is refusing to launch. Does anyone know how I can start fixing/investigating the cause of this? Edit:   Version: Mathematica Version 9.0.1.0, Microsoft Windows 64-bit   OS: Windows 8
