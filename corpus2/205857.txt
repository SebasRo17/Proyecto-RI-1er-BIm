I understand that in the earlier days of computing, shorter method names like `printf` made sense, because storage was limited. But why do modern languages like Python and Go still use the less readable names from the C APIs? Why don't they switch to a more readable form like print_format, the same goes for other names. I wouldn't mind having to write `make_directory` instead of `mkdir` in go.
