Simply what are the practical techniques people use to check if a class violates the single responsibility principle? I know that a class should have only one reason to change, but that sentence is somewhat lacking a practical way to really implement that. The only way I found is to use the sentence **_"The ......... should ......... itself."_** where the first space is the class name and the later is the method (responsibility) name. However, sometimes it's hard to figure out if a responsibility really violates the SRP. Are there more ways to check for the SRP? **Note:** The question is not about what the SRP means, but rather a practical methodology or a series of steps to check and implement the SRP. **UPDATE** ![Report class](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D8u6h.png) I have added a sample class that clearly violates the SRP. It would be great if people could use it as an example to explain how they approach the single responsibility principle. The example is from here.
