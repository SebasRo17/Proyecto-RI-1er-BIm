There is a sorted list of Integers.               ilist = PadRight[Sort[ RandomSample[Range[1, 99999], 3], Less], 5]        It should become string area codes like:               {0123, 023345, 043563, 0, 0};        with trailing zeros.   Can I do this with one function?               slist=ReplaceAll[ilist,n_Integer :>"0"<>ToString[n]]        Note: last elements are zeros already and should not double.
