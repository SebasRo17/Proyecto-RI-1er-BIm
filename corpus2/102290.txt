I've been programming in PHP for a long time, and I've just recently decided to make the switch to Python. Of all the Python web frameworks, I settled on Twisted Web to build the framework of my startup. However (and I know it sounds nitpicky), mod_rewrite was something that I really appreciated about Apache. I want the entire system written in Python, and not just bits and pieces written in PHP and Python: while a PHP frontend could work, I'd avoid it if it was at all possible. Is it possible to build such an application without resorting to ugly urls? Note: I am aware of the fact that Django allows URL rewriting, but it kinda defeats the purpose of using Twisted by itself.
