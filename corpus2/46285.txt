I'd like to use `StringCount` to count the number of subwords in a string that have the form `****` where `*` is designed to stand for any character in a specified set:               starSet = {"A","B","C"};     modifiedStringCount[string,"*****"]      For example:               string = "ABAACAWABCAA";      Would generate an output of `2` if `Overlaps -> FALSE` and a output of `3` is `Overlaps -> TRUE`. Is there a way to do this?
