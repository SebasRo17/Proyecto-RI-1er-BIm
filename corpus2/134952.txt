Is there a license "wizard" question system that asks you questions about how you would like to use the software, and then either allows you to compare it against one or more license types. Background: In asking a question that requires the open source image recognition software to have a license commercial internal distribution without release of the source code even internal to all those who have the binary... I realized that the current answer using a GPLV2 license likely mean it's a bad fit. I'd like to make the question more clear by adding a list of licenses that are known to be a fit, and those that are not a fit, but I don't even have a clue as how to do that other than to ask if there's a wizard that will help do this.
