Firstly I should explain the background. I am interested in high frequency trading programming roles. After looking at many job specs it is very clear that there is a big demand for programmers who have programmed Java and C++ on Unix as opposed to Windows. My question is what are the differences a High Freq programmer would come across? It cannot be something in the language itself because syntactically they do not differ over OS? Therefore I thought it must be something which the programming language has to interface, resources etc? Could anyone please help me out as I am trying to improve my C++/Java on Unix, in order to aim for this type of career? ps I'm guessing part of this answer lies with the socket infrastructure on Unix?
