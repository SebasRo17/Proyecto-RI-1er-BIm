I'd like to get a sense for the range of complexity that algorithms fall into. I think it would be interesting and helpful for those, like me, trying to better understand how algorithms are formulated and how to deconstruct them. Can you offer a basic algorithm with explanation, an intermediate algorithm with explanation, and maybe an expert level one (with or without) an explanation?
