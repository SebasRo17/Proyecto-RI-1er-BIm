How do handle developer keys that are supposed to be non human readable in your app? From twitter's developer page, under My Access Token it says: "Keep the oauth_token_secret a secret. Along with your OAuth consumer secret, these keys should never be human readable in your applications." However, the awesome twitter gem ( https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter ) says to make an initializer with this:               Twitter.configure do |config|       config.consumer_key = YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY       config.consumer_secret = YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET       config.oauth_token = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN       config.oauth_token_secret = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET      end      What do you do about this type of conflict? You can't just reset the oauth_token and oauth_token_secret, as far as I know you have to create a whole new twitter app. I concerned as I am going to begin working with some freelancer programmers and to begin with I wouldn't want to trust them my apps private keys/tokens. Thanks.
