How can I calculate the Total Variation Distance of a transition Matrix? is there any built in function? I've searched all documentation and haven;t found anything. ** More information: Let me try to explain it better. let's say we have a transition matrix (P), 4x4 that describes the probability of going from a, b, c and d to a, b, c or d in 1 step. We can calculate the stationary distribution of P, and that's called Pi in the following equation, and Pyx is the probability of going from state y to state x (a,b,c,d): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DtxLN.png) What I want to do is calculate the Total Variation Distance of P from Pi after n-steps and starting on a given state. _*_ This is what I have so far: > M = {{0.3, 0, 0.5, 0.2}, {0, 0.4, 0.3, 0.3}, {0.3, 0.2, 0, 0.5}, {0.4, 0.1, > 0, 0.5}} > > B = Transpose[M] > > N[B] // MatrixForm > > {eVals, eVecs} = Eigensystem[B] > > eVals // MatrixForm > > eVecs // MatrixForm > > eigenvector = eVecs[[1]] > > Print["Stationary Distribution"]; > > eigenvector/Total[eigenvector] > > Print["M after 1 step"]; > > M2 = MatrixPower[M, 2]
