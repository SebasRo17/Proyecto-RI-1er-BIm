I'm currently evaluating a potential new project that involves creating a DB for typical customer information (userid, pwd, first & last name, email, adress, telfnr ...). At this point, requirements are only roughly defined. The customer DB is expected in the O(millions) of records. In order to calculate some back-of-the-envelope numbers for DB sizing and evaluate potential DB options & architectures, I'm looking for some de-facto standards for these kind of records. **In particular, the std size of every field (first name, last name, address,...) or typical avg for a simple customer record would be great info**. With so many e-commerce websites out there, there should be some kind of typical config that can be reused and avoid re-inventing the wheel. Any ideas? \---- edit ---- The answers seems to be steering towards adopting an standard customer record vs designing your own. I would like to stress that the focus of this question is to locate a **reference** for field sizing for a customer object, and avoid figuring that out on my own.(I've emphasized that part on the original text - **now in bold** -)
