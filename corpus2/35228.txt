I have put together a very simple climate model based around four equations which define the state at time `t` based on time `t-1`, along with a initial state at time `t = 0`. The problem arises when I wish to evaluate, say, the temperature at year 2000 (`t = 2000`) or higher. I hit the recursion limit. I could keep increasing the `$RecursionLimit` all the time, but I wonder if there is a better way to deal with the problem?
