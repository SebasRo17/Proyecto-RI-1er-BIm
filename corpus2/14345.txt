In a `Manipulate`, one can specific the type of an individual control like so:               Manipulate[v, {v, Red, ColorSetter}]      I tried to do the same with `FileNameSetter`, i.e.               Manipulate[v, {v, "no file chosen", FileNameSetter}]      but that doesn't work, and the control is a slider. I can work around the issue like so:               Manipulate[{v, FileNameSetter[Dynamic[v]]}, {v, "no file chosen"},        ControlType -> None]      but I would rather understand why my second example above doesnâ€™t behave as expected. Do you have any idea?
