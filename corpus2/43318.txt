It appears that, counter to my expectation, all of these (and probably many others) seem to work fine:               Plot[Hold[x], {x, 0, 10}]          FindRoot[Hold[x^2 == 2], {x, 1}]          NMinimize[Hold[x^2], x]      I would expect `Plot` or `NMinimize` to complain that e.g. `Hold[0]` is not a number. These were mentioned a few times on this site but didn't get any attention: (1) (2). Doing this does appear to solve problems which would normally require `_?NumericQ`. Is this usage of `Hold` supported? Is it _meant_ to work this way, does it work by design, or is it accidental? My guess is that these work accidentally because these functions use `ReleaseHold` internally.
