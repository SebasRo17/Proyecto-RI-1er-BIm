Sometimes I get the feeling I'm just flailing blindly with Mathematica. Is solving for $x$ in the equation $$ \frac{\cosh (x/2)}{x} = \sqrt{2} $$ really beyond the scope of Mathematica? I try to solve it with the command: `Reduce[(1/x)Cosh[x/2] == Sqrt[2], x]` and am met with `Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Reduce.` I get a feeling that I'm doing something very silly. Cheers for any assistance!
