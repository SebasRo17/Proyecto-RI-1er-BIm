(I ask here because gamedev.stackexchange.net isn't as exposed to programmers as this site) Code Kata are good programming exercises ( see Code Kata ). I think the provided exercices are good for general problem solving. Now I'm mostly interested into all that is specific to game developpement and similar typical constraints. I mean not the low level stuff (like manipulating texture bits, that's too specific) but more like buffered event systems implementation or similar systems used in typical games. Maybe basic fast collision. Is there a list of game-dev-oriented code kata somewhere?
