I'm having issues while exporting a tables of numerical values to "*.dat" data files. Here's the thing, **sometimes** when I export a table, I get _more_ decimals on some **random values**. The problem is that they weren't even there in the first place. Now, for the sake of illustration, here's a **very simple** example on the issue. I tried constructing the following table :               Table[t, {t, 0, 0.4, 0.1}]      Which provides with the following list :               {0., 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.11, \     0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.2, 0.21, 0.22, \     0.23, 0.24, 0.25, 0.26, 0.27, 0.28, 0.29, 0.3, 0.31, 0.32, 0.33, \     0.34, 0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38, 0.39, 0.4}      Now, I just tried to export it using the `Export`command like this :               Export["t.dat", Table[t, {t, 0, 0.4, 0.1}], "Table"]      and everything should be fine, but when you try to read what's in "t.dat" using `FilePrint` :               FilePrint["t.dat"]      I get the following : 0. 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1 0.11 0.12 0.13 0.14 0.15 0.16 0.17 0.18 0.19 0.2 0.21 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.25 0.26 0.27 0.28 0.29 0.3 0.31 0.32 0.33 0.34 0.35000000000000003 0.36 0.37 0.38 0.39 0.4 Note that the number 0.35 suddenly became 0.35000000000000003, which messes everything up. Is there something to solve this issue? I tried using the `NumberForm` function but it changes the structure of the exported list... What I intend to do is to export **t** list presented above, alongside with _another_ list in which I do operations using the values of the first one. For example :               time = Table[NumberForm[i, 6], {i, 0, 0.2, 0.01}];     op = Table[time[[i]]^2 + time[[i]], {i, 1, Length@time}];     Export["data.dat",Transpose@{time,op}, "Table"];     FilePrint["data.dat"];      Which returns :               0.  NumberForm[0., 6] + NumberForm[0., 6]^2     0.01    NumberForm[0.01, 6] + NumberForm[0.01, 6]^2     0.02    NumberForm[0.02, 6] + NumberForm[0.02, 6]^2     0.03    NumberForm[0.03, 6] + NumberForm[0.03, 6]^2     0.04    NumberForm[0.04, 6] + NumberForm[0.04, 6]^2     0.05    NumberForm[0.05, 6] + NumberForm[0.05, 6]^2     0.06    NumberForm[0.06, 6] + NumberForm[0.06, 6]^2     0.07    NumberForm[0.07, 6] + NumberForm[0.07, 6]^2     0.08    NumberForm[0.08, 6] + NumberForm[0.08, 6]^2     0.09    NumberForm[0.09, 6] + NumberForm[0.09, 6]^2     0.1 NumberForm[0.1, 6] + NumberForm[0.1, 6]^2     0.11    NumberForm[0.11, 6] + NumberForm[0.11, 6]^2     0.12    NumberForm[0.12, 6] + NumberForm[0.12, 6]^2     0.13    NumberForm[0.13, 6] + NumberForm[0.13, 6]^2     0.14    NumberForm[0.14, 6] + NumberForm[0.14, 6]^2     0.15    NumberForm[0.15, 6] + NumberForm[0.15, 6]^2     0.16    NumberForm[0.16, 6] + NumberForm[0.16, 6]^2     0.17    NumberForm[0.17, 6] + NumberForm[0.17, 6]^2     0.18    NumberForm[0.18, 6] + NumberForm[0.18, 6]^2     0.19    NumberForm[0.19, 6] + NumberForm[0.19, 6]^2      What I mean by "changes its structure" is the fact that I can no longer operate on the _time_ list and its values correctly...
