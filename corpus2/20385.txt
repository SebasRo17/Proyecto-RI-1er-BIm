I am currently working as an intern at a consulting firm. I am soon to move to a full time employee once I graduate next semester, and I love working there. However, as a student, I lack money and I have met a business owner outside of work who has offered to hire me for some freelance web development. Because I met this individual outside of work, I feel it would not be a conflict of interest to freelance for him. However, the work his is wanting me to do is very similar to what I already do for my current boss. Should I speak with my boss before considering the offer? **Edit** : I understand that I cannot take IP from work, and I am not in a contract, I'm employed at will.
