In cluster computing, there seems to be two options: task redirection and task splitting. Task redirection seems easy enough, you just have the master dispatch the small calls to other nodes in the cluster for processing (eg webserver clusters (I think)). Task splitting however seems wildly more complex. Since I don't think you can have two threads of the same program run on different machines, meaning you have to split up the work. How though does one split up the work? I can see some stuff like rendering or video encoding just because you can tell each node to work on a different part of the video, but when you want to do things like calculate the 5 trillionth digit of pie, how would you split that up? Or even in science where you need to simulate weather or other resource intensive tasks? In short, how do you split up tasks that aren't really designed for splitting up?
