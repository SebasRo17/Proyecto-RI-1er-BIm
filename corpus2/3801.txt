I've seen that if I click on a square bracket `[`, I can then use "Check Balance" in the right click menu to see where the matching bracket is. Is there a way to see different levels of brackets in different colors? The closest that I've found is 'Show larger' for bracket matching syntax errors under preferences. If there's no way to colorize bracket nesting, is there a keyboard shortcut for "Check Balance" like `Shift``%` in Vim for C code?
