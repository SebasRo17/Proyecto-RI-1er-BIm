Can some one explain to me the concept of Continious Integration, how it works in an easy to understand way? And why should a company adopt CI in their code delivery workflow? I am a developer and my company (mainly the build team ) uses Team City. As a developer I always checkout, update and commit code to SVN but never really had to bother about TeamCity or CI in general. So I would like to understand what is the usefulness of CI? Is CI a part of Agile methodologies?
