I plan to run a lengthy Mathematica script on a Linux terminal (by "a Linux terminal," I mean that I have text output only -- no GUI), using the program `math`. To be able to track the execution progress of my script, I would like to `Print` "success messages" to the terminal when no errors or warnings have been thrown by Mathematica in the current session. For example, here is a very basic script that `Import`s two text files, `test1.txt` and `test2.txt`, using the `"Table"` specification. I would like to write a function or expression that sets the variable `success` to `True` when no error or warning messages have yet been thrown by Mathematica.               Import["test1.txt", "Table"]     success = f;     If[success, Print["test1.txt import successful!"];, Print["General failuire!"];];          Import["test2.txt", "Table"]     success = f;     If[success, Print["test2.txt import successful!"];, Print["General failure!"];];      where `f` is a function or expression that evaluates to `True` when _no error or warning messages have yet been thrown by Mathematica_. Please note that I am _not_ trying to write a function or expression `f` that determines if `test1.txt` or `test2.txt` exists. Rather, I am trying to write an `f` that determines whether **any** errors or warnings **at all** have been thrown during the current Mathematica session. If any have been thrown prior to when `f` is called, then `success` should _always_ be set to `False`, for the remainder of the Mathematica session. Do you have any advice on this? Thank you for your time.
