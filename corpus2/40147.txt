Not sure how to phrase this in a concise way, anyway it seems like the function FourierSeries assumes the interval for which to compute the Fourier coefficients of a given function is $[-\pi,\pi]$, which is all well and good. But if the function $f$ is defined as $g$ on, say, $[-\pi,a)$ and as $h$ on $[a,\pi]$, is there a way to define $f$ this way so that one can apply FourierSeries immediately on $f$? Also, is there a way to make Mathematica understand that $\cos{n\pi}=(-1)^n$ and $\sin{n\pi}=0$?
