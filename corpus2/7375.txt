I am a graduate student in CIS, had BS in EE. I will be graduating next spring. This means I still have one more semester before I graduate. I really don't want to start looking for jobs after I graduate. The problem is that I will be doing some heavy courses along with a project next semester. I really want to snag something this semester, but do you think employers would recruit candidates so early?
