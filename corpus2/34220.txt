I'm looking to have a Manipulator Locator that moves in discrete steps and requies the user to click on/near the locator position.. consider these two examples:               Manipulate[              Graphics[Line[{{0, 0}, q}],              PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {{x,                  0}}, {{q, {0, 0}}, {-1, -1}, {1, 1}, .2, Locator}]      The locator moves in discrete steps, but _warps_ wherever you click. Alternately this does nearly the same:               p = {0, 0};     Manipulate[           Graphics[{Line[{{0, 0}, p}], Locator[Dynamic[p]]},                  PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {{x, 0}}]      Here you need to click _on_ the locator to drag, but I have no way to specify the grid snap.. Any way to achieve both effects? ( this hack comes to mind as I'm posting ..               p = {0, 0};         Manipulate[q = Round[5 p]/5;             Graphics[{Line[{{0, 0}, q}], Circle[q, .1], Locator[Dynamic[p]]},                PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {{x, 0}}]      not very satisfactory though.. ) Edit: Two working solutions based on Kuba's answer, plus a bit of tinkering:               p = {0, 0}; Manipulate[            Graphics[{Line[{{0, 0}, p}],             Locator[Dynamic[            p, (p = Round[ MousePosition["Graphics", {0, 0}], .2] ) &]]},                PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {{x, 0}}]      ..                 Manipulate[           DynamicModule[{p = {0, 0}},                Deploy@Graphics[{Line[{{0, 0}, p}],                Locator[Dynamic[p, (p = Round[ #, .2] ) &]]},                PlotRange -> 1]], {{x, 0}}]      I remain a bit puzzled why this doesnt work:                       p = {0, 0}; Manipulate[                 Graphics[{Line[{{0, 0}, p}],                  Locator[Dynamic[p, (p = Round[#, .2] ) &]]},                  PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}], {{x, 0}}]      (The incremental rounding causes the locator to drift away from the mouse pointer). I should rather say I see why this doesnt work, I dont see why DynamicModule fixes it.
