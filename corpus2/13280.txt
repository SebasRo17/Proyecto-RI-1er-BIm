Is there a convenient method to compute the AUC (Area Under the Curve) metric that quantifies a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) like shown here? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JYKRr.png) The data used to build the ROC are just pairs of real values in `[0,1]`:               {{1, 1}, {15/64, 30/73}, {5/64, 21/218}, {3/64, 5/109}, {1/64, 3/       109}, {0, 2/109}, {0, 1/109}}      Although this data can be closed to form a polytope, documentation for Area states that polytope edges need to be unit-length, which is not the case in general. Is there a convenient way to pass this data to `NIntegrate`, and if so what integration methods (eg, Trapezoid vs ..) and interpolation are appropriate for the ROC AUC problem?
