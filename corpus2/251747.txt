Lets say I'm building a site similar to this or Quora (or some arbitrary blog- like site). I need a real-time component that will be using web-sockets/long- polling to notify the user of new posts, questions, etc. depending on what page the user is viewing. That real time component will essentially be the site's API implemented in something like Twisted or Java NIO, and the site's web server will be sitting in front of say Flask or Pyramid. Should the API and webpages be served by the same component or is it best to keep them separate? (I'm asking _both_ logically and physically)
