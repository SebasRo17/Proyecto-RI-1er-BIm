I'm trying to solve a set of equations (chemical kinetics for a complex system, but don't worry about that). I ran it for 24 hours and I got no output. Here is the relatively simple code (I want to eliminate everything except for `Itot` and `x` and solve for one of them):               eq1 = x == (Etot - M - MI)/(Etot - 1/4 (-Kd + Sqrt[Kd] Sqrt[8 Etot + Kd]))     eq2 = Etot == M + 2*Di + M*Inh     eq3 = Itot == Inh + MI      eq4 = Kd == M*M/Di     eq5 = Ki == M*Inh/MI     Solve[{eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5}, Itot, {Di, M, Inh, MI}]      I hoped to benefit from knowing a few things, like the fact that all quantities are nonnegative and real. So I tried this (not sure if I've done it correctly because the documentation on Solve is a little confusing):               Solve[{eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, x >= 0, Itot >= 0, Di >= 0, M >= 0,            Inh >= 0, MI >= 0}, Itot, {Di, M, Inh, MI}, Reals]      But again nothing in 24 hours. Any suggestions? Would it be helpful if I tried to remove a variable or two myself?
