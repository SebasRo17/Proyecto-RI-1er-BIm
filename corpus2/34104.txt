I have two observed frequency data, let say               f1 = {100, 200, 150, 100, 50};     f2 = {110, 195, 160, 105, 40};      and i want to know whether these random samples belong to the same distribution using `KolmogorovSmirnovTest[]`. Since `KolmogorovSmirnovTest[]` takes raw data, i simulate them based on `f1` and `f2`.               data1 = {};     data2 = {};     k = 1;     Do[data1 = Join[data1, Table[k n, {f1[[n]]}]], {n, 1, Length[f1]}]     Do[data2 = Join[data2, Table[k n, {f2[[n]]}]], {n, 1, Length[f2]}]      The test gives the result               KolmogorovSmirnovTest[data1, data2]     0.99998      Is this correct procedure to perform KS on frequency data? I have changed `k` with any other number and got the same result. Thank you.
