I like many others have spent a few of my High School years teaching myself software development and various languages.   * I'm fluent in C++/C#   * Have a fairly solid understanding of Computer Science and Computing Techniques.   * I _don't_ have any worthy projects to display because I have a bad habit of stopping them before they're presentable in pursuit of newer, more exciting projects; **But if you asked me to sit down and solve a problem I could do it easy.** * * * **Is there any way to get formal recognition of all the time I've spent watching online lectures / tutorials, actually coding, and researching?** * * * It would be nice to have something I can actually put on my college application!   _I just want to show that I havn't just been sitting around playing Video- Games all day._
