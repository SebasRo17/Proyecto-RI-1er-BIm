Suppose a rest api returning this json:               {         "status" : "fail",         "data" : { "title" : "A title is required" }     }      Since the client application would always adapt the error message, would it be better to return an explicit i18n key that the client would have mapped rather than "A title is required"? :               {         "status" : "fail",         "data" : { "title" : "error.creation.title.required" }     }      Indeed, the point is to expect the request consumer (web application for instance) to easily translate the message regarding its localization.
