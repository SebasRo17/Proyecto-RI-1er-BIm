I have watched a couple videos on JS where the presenter mentioned "caching" a variable but I didn't see them do anything in the code that would "cache" it beyond normal assignments. When i think of cache i think of something stored in local memory in which case aren't all js variables cached by definition. When you cache a variable in javascript what or you "doing" to it? EDIT: I have heard the term in several but the only one that comes to mind is Writing Modular Javascript - Tutorial. Which i just watched last night. I didn't post it because you have to pay to view and I hate feeling liking i am plugging a pay service on stackexchange.
