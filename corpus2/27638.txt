Provided a coordinate $c_k$ in a two-dimensional image, how can I return all of the pixels in a bounding disk or rectangle centered on $c_k$ of some specified dimension $d$? **Update:** Hat tip to Kuba for recommending `PixelValue` and Sjoerd C. de Vries for recommending `ImageData`. However, considering the case of the bounding box, is it possible to return the pixels using:               PixelValue[image,                {Subscript[x, min];;Subscript[x, max],Subscript[y, min];;Subscript[y, max]}]       In the form of a matrix rather than a 1-dimensional array?
