My friend recently finished his personal work on a project that fixes a known bug in `sharepoint 2010`. The guy spent significant time\effort to reach this point   He consulted me on how to license this `fix` and asked if this possible and is it accepted for a such type of solutions! Actually I don't have any experiences in this area, especially that he is willing to start selling the `fix` and don't want to be lost in the market P.S.: his current location is U.A.E TIA.
