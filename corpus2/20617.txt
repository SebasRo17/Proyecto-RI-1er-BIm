I want to plot a lot of arrows in a sphere (3D-Plot). That is not a problem with a small number of `Arrows`; for a few I can do than something like this:               Show[       Graphics3D[{Thickness[Large], Arrowheads[Large],         Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0}}], Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}}]},          Axes -> True],        SphericalPlot3D[1, {θ, 0, Pi}, {φ, 0, 2*Pi},          PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.2]]]      However, I want do something like a for-loop to plot many `Arrows`               For[i = 1, i < 11, i++, Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {1/i, (1-i)/5, (1-i)/5}}]      I have tried to paste for loop in many places of my graphics code, but without success. How should I build that code?
