I have a pair of ordered lists. I want to generate a new ordered list (using the same ordering) of length n by applying a binary operator to pairs of elements, one from each list, along with the index of each list's elements. For example, if I have two lists of real numbers in increasing order (sorted via Less),               l1 = {5.7832, 30.4713, 74.887, 139.04, 222.932, 326.563}          l2 = {3.481, 9.2816, 15.7112, 27.8226, 45.0379, 67.222, 94.3526}      and the binary operator is Plus, then if I ask for 5 elements, the result would be               {{9.26417, 1, 1}, {15.0647, 1, 2}, {21.4944, 1, 3}, {33.6058, 1, 4}, {33.9522, 2, 1}}      I've written code that achieves this but I'm looking for the most elegant, efficient, and general solution that would work with arbitrary lists and binary operators.
