I'm wondering if it is worth reading language specifications/standard documents (e.g. The Java Language Specification) if you aren't going to write a compiler/interpreter for the language or something similar? I understand that reading such a book shouldn't be anyone's first exposure to the language, but it could be a great way to learn the finer details of it. Have you ever bothered, and should others?
