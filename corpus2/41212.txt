I have a problem with numerical integration of this function. Integral value is zero, but `NIntegrate[]` needs a lot of time to calculate this. Is there any way to speed up this calculation? Input:               function[s_, t_] :=100 (-2160 (1 - 2 s)^4 t^3 (-2 + 5 t) +       96 (1 - 2 s) t^3 (25 (-1 + 2 s) t^2 (-3 + 5 t) +          5/4 (-1 + 2 s)^3 (-1 + 5 t)) -       24 (-1 + 2 s)^3 t (5 (-1 + 2 s) t^2 (-3 + 5 t) +          25/4 (-1 + 2 s)^3 (-1 + 5 t)));          AbsoluteTiming[NIntegrate[function[s, t], {t, 0, 1/2}, {s, 0, 1/2}]]     AbsoluteTiming[Integrate[function[s, t], {t, 0, 1/2}, {s, 0, 1/2}]]      Output: > During evaluation of In[4]:= NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration > converging too slowly; suspect one of the following: singularity, value of > the integration is 0, highly oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too > small. >> > > During evaluation of In[4]:= NIntegrate::eincr: The global error of the > strategy GlobalAdaptive has increased more than 2000 times.
