We switched to VS2010 from VS2003 a few months ago, and there are many many improvements. But the speed of Intellisense is not one of them (although it does generate higher quality results, which is great). I read that Intellisense and the MSDN help system has been improved in VS2012. I'm curious if its actually faster? The only data I could find were graphs of an early release (VS2011). For the record, I am using a vanilla install of VS2010 with SP1 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64). No plugins or add-ins running. What I'm looking for specifically:   * Has the speed of intellisense auto-complete improved?    * Has the speed of F12 (GoTo definition) improved? The answers to these questions will help in determining if VS2012 is worth the money to upgrade at this time as the intellisense slowness would be the only major reason for upgrading. I'd also be interested in knowing if the help system has improved. I'm currently using MSDN help from VS2008SP1 because it has filtering and is faster.
