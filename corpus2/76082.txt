I have been programming recently with Entity Framework 4.1 Code First and am loving it for development, but with only an end plan and a rapidly changing feature list, I am constantly modifying the Class/Database to meet the applications needs. In development, there is no live data and I can easily just delete the entire database so it is recreated with the new schema however, obviously, when live - this is very bad! The only solutions I can see are to either drop the metadata table and manually keep the database in sync or basically drop and reseed. I personally prefer the first method as I think it will be a lot easier to add a column/table than to recreate and migrate data, but, unless I have missed something, this is completely moving away from Code First. So the question really is, is Code First just about the initial development and what is a good strategy for managing EF for a production environment?
