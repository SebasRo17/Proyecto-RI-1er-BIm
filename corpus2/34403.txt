I was wondering whether it was possible to have a two way control system, whereby one could click and drag both the locator (which would in turn move the sliders), AND click & drag the sliders (which in turn would move the locator). Here is an image of what I would like to achieve: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uyUAK.gif) The code below controls the locator only:               f[x_] := x^2;     Manipulate[n, {n, 1, 20, 1}]     Manipulate[With[{x0 = Clip[p[[1]], {0., 10}]},      Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 10}, ImagePadding -> 20, LabelStyle -> (FontFamily -> "Ariel"),     Epilog -> {PointSize[Large], Red,     Tooltip[Point[#], #] &@{x0, f[x0]}}]], {{p, {0, 0}}, Locator, Appearance -> None},     AppearanceElements -> None]      for which I must credit Michael E2 and Timothy Wofford :-)
