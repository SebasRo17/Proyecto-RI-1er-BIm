Having found out about the second argument to `Return` I played a bit with it, and the following tests all resulted in `Return::nofunc`:               f[x_]:=x     f[Return[3,f]]          SetAttributes[g,HoldAll];g[x_]:=x     g[Return[3,g]]          h[x_]:=f[x]     h[Return[3,f]]          SetAttributes[i,HoldAll];i[x_]:=f[x]     i[Return[3,f]]      On the other hand, the following works fine:               Module[{i},Return[3,Module]]      Does that mean the second argument of `Return` can only be used with a predefined list of symbols? If so, is there an easy way to find out that list? Otherwise, what am I doing wrong (and how would I do it right)?
