Are there thorough tutorials on 3D printing for _Mathematica_? It seems that being able to export _Mathematica_ files for 3D printing is unfortunately still a novelty, but it's vital for my business plans. It would be much appreciated to specifically make                ContourPlot3D[3 Sin[E^x] == (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(.5), {x, -1, 1}, {y, -4, 4}, {z, -4, 4}]      3D printable for MakerBot. _Mathematica_ would not allow using `Thickness` for `ContourPlot3D`, but did for `ParametricPlot3D`.
