I noticed that I often turn out to have a list of substitutions in the form               list =      {       {var1 -> value1, var2 -> value2, ..., varn -> valuen},        {var1 -> value1, var2 -> value2, ..., varn ->  valuen}     }      and need to extract some of the values (for instance for plotting). I use the syntax               {var1, var2} /. # & /@ list      Is there a shorter one?
