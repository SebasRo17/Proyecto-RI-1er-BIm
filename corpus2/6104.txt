A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. There are many trivial quines in Mathematica:               In[1]:= "Hello world"     Out[1]= "Hello world"          In[2]:= 3.14     Out[2]= 3.14          In[3]:= f[x]     Out[3]= f[x]      where `f` and `x` are undefined symbols; and some more               In[4]:= Hold[N[\[Pi]]]     Out[4]= Hold[N[\[Pi]]]      These are all trivial. I was thinking that perhaps a more interesting challenge for Mathematica was a multiquine. This is a program A that outputs another program B, _distinct_ from A, such that when B is exectued, the output is A. Multiple levels of depth are also allowed: Thus one might have a program that when executed outputs a distinct program that when executed outputs another program distinct from the first two ... that when executed outputs the original program. There are also multiquines that output a distinct program _in a different language_ , such that when this program is executed, the output is the original program. **QUESTION** (Though more of a challenge): Can you come up with a multiquine for Mathematica?
