I'm learning ruby (and OOP in the process) and I find keep having to write the same patterns when logging progress so I want to wrap this up in a logging library that my other code can then just pass data to - say a string, a file name and a log level. This of course couples the logging library with other code - other code still has to be aware of how the logging library works (that it wants the string, name, & level). I tend not to like coupling like this but it seems like I can't really prevent it, but rather have to deal with it by consciously deciding to scope the library's use to an area of concern "ie: snoweagle's personal tech projects" Is this good design or is there a better way to approach coupling?
