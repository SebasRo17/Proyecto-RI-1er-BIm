I am writing a text based RPG, and I have three classes that inherit from a super class, they all have special attacks that they can perform, at the same time I have a class that holds the function which handles battles in my game. Now how do I get the unique special abilities functions for whatever role the player chooses into the battle function? Also I am using the vector.push_back method to handle how my sub classes are referenced.
