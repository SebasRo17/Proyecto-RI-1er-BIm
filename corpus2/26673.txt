I have a "friend". Yes good start I know but honestly this isn't me! Basically he's been working on a successful project for about 4 years now, the difficulty is the technical debt has caught up and he's finding it almost impossible to stop supporting the product (tweaking this and that) and actually move on with _real_ development. I've made various suggestions, log all of your time, create tickets, don't answer emails etc etc. The problem with this is that it seems to only serve as a reminder that he's not getting anything "useful" done. The technical debt has largely occurred because in the first instance it was a big benefit to the product, to take requests and phone calls from users and just quickly implement them. What I would like to know is does anybody have any suggestions for how he might get out of this rut, a large part of which would be changing the perceptions of the users so that they don't think they can just ring and expect something to be done then and there. It's all very well saying plan better, though I understand it's very difficult to plan actual development given the requirement for support and the relative pressures from users (see above).
