I was looking at the google coding guide [here] and they do not recommend that one use the `using namespace or`namespace:function` - if I did not misinterpret it. Does this apply to `std` as well? `cout<<` does not work without it. This book, recommends the same. So how do I go about using `cout<<` without `using namespace std;` or `std::cout<<` ? What is the recommended way? `std::cout<<`? Most c++ text books teach beginners with `using namespace std;` are they propagating poor coding practice?
