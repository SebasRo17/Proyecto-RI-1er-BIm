This may be more of a legal question: Some guy claims to copyright his source code but he has several publicly exposed source code examples on his website but just puts a copyright notice at the bottom of the site. Is it automatically assumed he can claim copyright on the provided example code he has throughout his 'open source' software directory? According to the US copyright office, he would need to apply for a copyright on each software sample or software program with publicly exposed source code on his site. Am I right on this? Also, his software samples on the site have no declaration of any licensing at the top of each sample. Can he still enforce licensing or copyright protection without the declaration? He claims people can only read it but NOT copy it for their own use or distribution. I thought this defeats the purpose of open source although his site is declared an open source directory. Can I assume his source code is for the taking since he has no licensing declarations anywhere in the code? I thought you can only copyright screens and workflow. Can you legally protect algorithm or programming logic? Thanks for providing this great resource.
