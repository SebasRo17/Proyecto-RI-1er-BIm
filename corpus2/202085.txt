Folks, this seems like it should be straightforward, but I'm drawing a blank here. As a simplified example, consider an abstract class called Number with an abstract method add(). I want to create two concrete subclasses, Integer and Float, with method signatures Integer.add(Integer other) and Float.add(Float other). A Float can NOT be added to an Integer. What should the method signature of the abstract add() method in the Number class be in order to enforce this constraint at compile-time?
