Given a DDD application with a hexagonal architecture, which layer should my JBehave acceptance tests target? I want to write Features and scenarios as specifications for the overall system behavior as we are introducing **ATDD** as our development process. In my application I have these layers:   * Presentation layer   * Web services layer   * Application services layer   * Domain layer   * Infrastructure layer
