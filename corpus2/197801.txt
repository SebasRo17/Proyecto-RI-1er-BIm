I am attempting to create an list which should be sorted by a particular field in a colon separated string. I have an array of strings with the following values:               name1:535     name2:697      After sorting this list, I would have it sorted by the number in the second field:               name2:697     name1:535      How should I go about doing this, are there any issues I should be aware of when sorting this List of Strings?
