I've been noticing lately, as I've played around with javascript, HTML5, and node.js for the first times that javascript seems to be a language that is used very differently (and with different syntax) depending on where it is used at. My observation with javascript is this: -Front end javascript finds the JS embedded in HTML5 pages, where it is used to build dynamic webpages and react to events that occur on the page. -Back end JS is used as a solo language with node.js and its associated packages to handle web page requests, data transfers, and general server tasks. Have I accurately summarized front end versus back end JS?
