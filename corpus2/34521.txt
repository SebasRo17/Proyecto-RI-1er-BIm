How do I call `AxesStyle->Arrowheads[ ]` in order to control whether or not an arrow appears on each of the four ends of the axes in a `Plot`, and if it does appear how to control the size of each one? Here's an example:               Plot[1/x^5, {x, -20, 20}, AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[{-.02, 0}],      ImagePadding -> None]      It seems `Axes->Arrowheads[.05]` makes all 4 of them appear and appear at the same size, while `Axes->Arrowheads[{-.05,.05}]` makes them appear in "pairs". But sometimes I just want the "north" and "west" axes to have arrows and nothing else.
