I am creating a series of small sites, I'm using the django framework. The theory goes a user comes to a master site, signs up, then he gets his own child site. Example:   * navigate to example.com   * user creates an account "mysite"   * user then gets his own site: mysite.example.com and he can configure this all he wants My question: * would it be better to have a "gold" version of the site that gets created for each site? for instance: cp ~/goldsite ~/mysite and change the database pointers appropriately ** the downside is if I ever have to do maintenance on a file, I would have to change all subsites. ...or * have one host and configure the database to support multiple sites. The DB might get messy. Any feedback would be great.
