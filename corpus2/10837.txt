`OpenCLLink` allows _Mathematica_ to use the OpenCL parallel computing language. I have done some tests on simple examples, but so far, the CPU regularly outperforms the GPU. **Question:** What are some nice (inherently parallel) number crunching problems that use OpenCL code and `OpenCLLink` to show (with `AbsoluteTiming`) impressive performance benefits, that are not already in the documentation?
