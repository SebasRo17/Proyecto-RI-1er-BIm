After learning JavaScript syntax, what are some good resources for learning about integrating JavaScript with other languages (HTML, XML, CSS, PHP) to create real, useful applications? I'm most interested in reading articles or other people's code - not so interested in books. Basically, I'm looking to move from programming puzzle- solvers to programming complex applications and could use some advice.
