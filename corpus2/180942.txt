I am studying software engineering, just finished the requirements course and going for more. I don't know how important software design is (in real world and actual projects) in later SDLC phases. As I read on the internet a lot of development teams like less documentation or design, and more coding. This makes my major worthless (in the real world). I am very good at programming and I like it but its not my main thing. I would like to hear from people about their experience with this, about a software engineer's actual role in real-world projects, and about how projects usually go?
