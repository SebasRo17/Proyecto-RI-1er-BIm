Consider some graphics which spill over the plot range, like these:               Graphics[{Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 1]},       PlotRange -> {{-1.1, .9}, {-1.1, 1.1}}, Frame -> True,       PlotRangeClipping -> False, ImagePadding -> 20, FrameStyle -> Thick]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/M9DxJ.png) Can I make the graphics be drawn in front of the frame without drawing the frame manually? Is there a possibly undocumented option for this (maybe a `Graphics` `Method` option)?
