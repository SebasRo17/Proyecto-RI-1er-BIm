I've spent 3 days debugging one very obscure bug in a library made by my colleague, this bug happens very infrequently. After all I found that this bug happens due to cross-thread access to an object without any lock. Actually this is not a first bug of this kind, there were similar bugs before. He just runs his unit tests, and if something fails puts somewhere a lock. And if nothing fails, ughm, then his code is perfect. It seems he has no idea about threading safety. I'm 100% sure there are many similar bugs that just haven't surfaced yet. It seems PM doesn't understand threading stuff too.   The problem is, he works much more time in the company than I do. Anyway, I can't just say "this guy is incompetent in this area", because this always shows you as a "bad team player", etc.   Any ideas, what I can do?
