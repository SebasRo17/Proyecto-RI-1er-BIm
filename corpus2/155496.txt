I am trying to compile and install every custom module under it's own designated folder. (ex: `/myApps/myLinux/compiled_app`) I had luck with Python so far, where my Python is compiled from source and lives in: `/myApps/myLinux/python2.5` and "python2.5" -> `/myApps/myLinux/python2.5.6-gcc463` So I can access this Python through a wrapper script that sets the right environment. The question is recently I had to compile and add something called gperf3.0.4. So now it lives: `/myApps/myLinux/gperf3.0 and "gperf3.0" -> /myApps/myLinux/gperf3.0.4-gcc463 ` The question is: How will I point to this lib if some other app needs to access it? Is it done through the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable?
