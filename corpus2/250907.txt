I have an ERP, coded with Java and the database in MYSQL Community edition. When I was going to sell it to a client he asked me for the sources to my application (with the belief that it is GPLed). I already got an upfront payment from him. But now he asks me to deliver the source code for my ERP with the executable. When I told him no, he responds that as I am using MySQL community edition the project must be open source, and I must give him the sources. He is not willing pay extra for the source for what I wrote. It doesn't seem like the MySQL license should affect the license of the code I have written. But is that true?
