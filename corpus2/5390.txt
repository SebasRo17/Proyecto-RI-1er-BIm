Is it possible to force Mathematica to perform computations with hardware supported quadruple-precision? The following test suggest, that all of the computations with fixed precision, different than `$MachinePrecision=15.9546`, are performed via the same arbitrary precision algorithm. Am I right? Is it possible to speed up 34 digit accurate computations?               num = RandomInteger[{1, 100}, 5 10^5];     First@AbsoluteTiming[       Sin[N[num]];     ]     (* ==> 0.273485 *)          {#, First@AbsoluteTiming[      Sin[N[num, #]];]} & /@ Range[32, 36]          (* ==>     {{32, 10.224581}, {33, 9.942714}, {34, 10.043138},     {35, 9.856203}, {36, 9.929918}}     *)
