I am working on a C# console application that loads the data from a third party and bulk inserts into tables. Basically the code consists of a static method with logging statements. In these scenarios, how does one write the unit test cases? Example code               void Main(string[] args)     {         // for loop here to read config from XML file              // initialize third party library         ReportLib objLib = new ReportLib();                   DataTable dt = objLib.Refresh("test");              //call SQL bulk copy         DBHelper.BulkCopy(dt, dictmappings, destTblName);//dbhelper is static class          }
