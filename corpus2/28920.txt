I wanted to know what solutions you guys tend to do when sketch modeling on whiteboards. Since my reading on Creg Larman's very good book Applying UML and Patterns, I do my everyday business and software modeling with whiteboards. The problem is, I have a hard time being 'agile' and 'iterative' after the whiteboard has been erased and snapshotted. Sketching is the way to go for me but as soon as all my work is snapshotted in a digital picture, I don't find the required added value of having to either redraw it on the whiteboard, or use an UML tool. I wanted to know, for those of you who favor whiteboarding over UML tools, what are your techniques? (web/desktop based softwares, hardware, materials, etc.) you employ to achieve those criterion:   * Refine and iterate over past whiteboards that have been erased   * Collaborate remotely (not only room-to-room)   * Synchronize and simultaneously work on your sketches I have come to search for online web-based whiteboardings and I found the following which are pretty neat:   * Vyew   * Dabbleboard   * Twiddla However, my solution seems to go over with Smart Technologies, especially with their Notebook software which is very good for whiteboarding multiple designs. I was wondering also if some had some feedback for this application and their conferencing software as well (usage of their digital whiteboards and etc.)
