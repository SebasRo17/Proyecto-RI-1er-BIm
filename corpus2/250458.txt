Assume a method with the following declaration               public IList<Location> GetLocations() { ... }      I write (at least) the following tests   1. Check to see if the method returns an empty collection if no locations are found.   2. Check to see if the method returns the correct number of locations.   3. Check to see if the data in the locations the method return is correct. However, all the tests above will fail if the method returns null. I feel like a single error should only result in one unit test failure, but at the same time I do not see how to avoid it in a scenario like this. Is this just the way it works; sometimes multiple tests will fail for the same reason?
