I am using a shared variable as a progress indicator ( via `SetSharedVariable[counter]` and then `Dynamic[counter]`), to keep track of a parallel computation. However, there seems to be a massive overhead just because I ask ParallelTable to increment the counter:               AbsoluteTiming[ParallelTable[(counter++; myCompiledFunction),{i,1000}];]          (* {6.580984, Null} *)      But the same exact computation without the counter is about 50 times faster:               AbsoluteTiming[ParallelTable[myCompiledFunction,{i,1000}];]          (* {0.129618, Null} *)      Does anybody know why, and if there is a solution? Note: this does not happen if I use `Table`, but then I cannot take advantage of all my cores.
