In have written a function which expects the caller to pass in a configuration file like XML. Then I parse this given file and extract something which i then return. In this function (at least) two "bad" things can happen:   1. The given file does not exist or is not accessible in any way   2. While parsing/validating the file some unexpected content is found The first thing is clearly an `IllegalArgumentException`. I am however not sure what kind of exception the second case would be. Is that also an `IllegalArgumentException` because i expect (by documentation-contract) that the input is in a valid form? Or is it rather an `IllegalStateException` as the given parameter is formal correct but only after parsing I can't do any further steps as it would result in unwanted behaviour? Or is it even something else?
