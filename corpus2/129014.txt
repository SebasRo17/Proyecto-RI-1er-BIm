I'm creating a UI table component that returns an array of selected indices. Some typical return values would be               var myRetVal1 = [0];//one value selected      var myRetVal2 = [0,1,2,3,8,11];//multiple value selected      as you can see I'm always returning an array. I had an idea to return `-1` when nothing is selected, but then I thought that might be confusing when in every other condition an array is returned. So checking for an empty set of values would be either               //returns -1     var selectedItems = tbl.GetSelectedIndex();     if(selectedItems !== -1){        //we have data to process     }      OR               //returns []     var selectedItems = tbl.GetSelectedIndex();     if(selectedItems.length > 0){        //we have data to process     }      OR               //returns null     var selectedItems = tbl.GetSelectedIndex();     if(selectedItems){        //we have data to process     }      Maybe I'm making too big a deal over this, but is there a standard expectation for this type of control? As I build other controls should they conform to a standard empty return value or should they always return a "empty" version of their expected return type?
