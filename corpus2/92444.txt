I just read an article on MSDN about reasons for declaring classes as `sealed`. In the last paragraph, Eric Lippert says: > 4) Secure. the whole point of polymorphism is that you can pass around > objects that look like Animals but are in fact Giraffes. **There are > potential security issues here**. I tried to look on the Google about this topic, but I didn't manage to find anything other that OOP tutorials, so if anybody could point me in the right direction where to look, or even say a few words on this topic, it would be great. Thanks.
