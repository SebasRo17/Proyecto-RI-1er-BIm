Mathematica provides a score of convenient functions to make plots with various logarithmic scale axes, for instance I am using `ListLogLinearPlot` to have a discrete plot with a logarithmic x-axis and a linear y-axis. My issue however is that I would like the x-axis to be on a binary logarithmic scale, instead of the default logarithmic scale (natural? with decimal ticks?). In particular I need 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. to be equally spaced on the x-axis to highlight the periodic nature of the function I'm plotting. How may I proceed?
