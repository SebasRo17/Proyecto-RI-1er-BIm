The whys, wherefores, pros and cons of this are well beyond the scope of this question. This development department contains an Architecture Service team that is made up of 10 people that are officially known as "Solution Architects". In reality they cover more than just the solution, these are technical people that cover every technical architectural aspect of a project (i.e. hardware, software, security, governance etc). They also provide ad-hoc functions to the development team (code reviews, standards guidance etc) and wider business (technical input into tenders, pre contract technical preview of customer requirements) As part of this transition I have been tasked with creating a Kanban board for the purposes of getting a view of the work activities that the Architecture Service team are accountable for. There are a myriad example boards for development / coding teams, but none that I can find for Architecture. So I have taken from various sources and created "something", I would really appreciate genuine feedback on it. It is also worth noting that this will be presented to the team as a starting point / work in progress. It is their board and I want them to own it, all I am doing is setting a foundation for the guys to build on (and change if necessary) So far I have something like this # The Main Board The main board is where we hold all active / backlog projects - all active work will be on this board. This will be short reviewed in the daily architectural scrum with a more in-depth review at the end of every week.                          ------------------------------------------------------------------------                | Evaluation            | Implementation       | Ad- Hoc               |                | Todo  | Doing  | Done | Todo  | Doing | Done | Todo  | Doing  | Done |         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------         Person |       |        |      |       |       |      |       |        |      |         --------       -----------------       ----------------       -----------------         Person |       |        |      |       |       |      |       |        |      |         --------       -----------------       ----------------       -----------------         Person |       |        |      |       |       |      |       |        |      |         --------       -----------------       ----------------       -----------------         Person |       |        |      |       |       |      |       |        |      |         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The column descriptions / purposes are: **Evaluation** : Projects where the person is doing an initial technical analysis, i.e. running through technical options with a product owner, determining the size of the project. As an example an Evaluation project may be the Architect evaluating a new technology or working with a customer to produce a mutually agreed technical solution. **Implementation** : Projects that are actively in development (coding, testing etc) and the person is acting in an SA function for the wider project team. As an example this could be the development of coding aspects of the "mutually agreed technical solution" mentioned above, equally it could also be architecturally overseeing the implementation of some new hardware. **Ad-Hoc** : All the weird and wonderful stuff that comes up that can't be put into the other two columns. As an example in a strange recursive world there is a card for me in the ad-hoc column to create a KanBan board :). **Person** : Fairly self explanatory, the person who "owns" the cards in that row. To make things a little more fun this actually contains an avatar of that persons choice. **Todo** : Is effectively our backlog, the cards in here are ordered top to bottom in priority. As space in a persons doing cell becomes available we take from the top of todo. **Doing** : Fairly self explanatory **Done** : Items that have been completed since the last full board review (Friday afternoon every week) ## WIP Limits Rather than do what we do now (i.e. give out work until somebody squeals), I would like the main board to work with objective / evidence based WIP limits. The intention is to size each of the board cards with:   * XS (Extra Small) : 3 points   * S (Small) : 5 points   * M (Medium) : 8 points   * L (Large) : 13 points   * XL (Extra Large) : 21 points The size is very much from an Architects workload perspective, for example a project that requires 1 year of coding for 10 people but minimal Architectural input would be XS or S. However a project that has massive Architectural input but minimal coding could be an XL. Over time we should be able to work out the WIP limit for each person. So we know that Jonny Smith can work with a velocity of 42 points and therefore allocate projects up to that level. As we have not done this before my intention is to set the initial limit high, the idea being that when a person squeals we can (as a team) look at this objectively and determine if it is genuinely too much or is it because our processes etc are too onerous and should be streamlined.   * **NOTE** : Of everything here these WIP calculations are the bit that "feel" the least right* # The Funnel Board In order to keep track of all the random things that fly through the team we also have a funnel board. This is a relatively simple board that looks like this:                   ------------------------------------------------------------------------         | Evaluation            | Implementation       | Ad- Hoc               |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------         |                       |                      |                       |         |                       |                      |                       |         |                       |                      |                       |         |                       |                      |                       |         |                       |                      |                       |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------      As the team is made aware of a "project" but this is not yet officially sanctioned (i.e. can be put into the Todo columns on the Main Board) then it goes onto the funnel board. Items here are not allocated to a person. The idea being that we can track those random things that come through and ensure they are not forgotten. Also, as the person completes an evaluation project this then moves from Main Board Evaluation Done to the Implementation funnel board (unless it immediately becomes an implementation project) A member of the team will occasionally be tasked with following up everything on the funnel board, i.e. quick phone call to the product owner asking if this is still relevant (this would be an ad-hoc project on the main board) # The Successes Board This is just a simple board to track what we have done over the last X months. It holds the cards that have been through the Funnel and / or Main boards                   ------------------------------------------------------------------------         | Successes                                                            |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------         |                                                                      |         |                                                                      |         |                                                                      |         |                                                                      |         |                                                                      |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------      The idea being that we can occasionally get around this board and give each other mutual pats on the back :) # Board Cards The cards that are on the boards contain the following information:                   ------------------------------------------------------------------------         | SIZE (XS,S,M,L,XL)          | OWNING TEAM MEMBER             |  RAG  |          ------------------------------------------------------------------------         |                                                                      |         |                         PROJECT TITLE                                |         |                                                                      |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------         |                                  |                                   |         |        DEPENDENTS                |          DEPENDENCIES             |         |                                  |                                   |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------         |                                                                      |         |                         MISC INFORMATION                             |         |                                                                      |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------         |                WIDER PROJECT TEAM (AS APPLICABLE)                    |         | Other Architects, Project Manager, Principal Developer, Business     |         | Analyst, Scrum Master                                                |         ------------------------------------------------------------------------      As you will notice the granularity of the card is at a fairly high "Project" level, I am not planning on doing a developer style board that is split into tasks (thoughts on this welcome). Also worth mentioning that depending on where the card is not all sections will be applicable. I am also planning on colour coding the cards, as a first stab I have: Yellow : Anything that is customer contractual Pink : Anything that is internal (i.e. not end user facing) Green : Anything that is a company group project The cards will be magnetic rather than post-it, I am hoping to find some that are like mini white boards as this will make life easier as things change # Other Stuff   * If its not on a card on a board then as far as the team is concerned it doesn't exist   * The boards themselves are Whiteboards with Wheels, we can take them wherever we want   * We may consider going to a virtual whiteboard in the future (physical whiteboards are easier to change when we decide that the X column is best on the left of Y not the right) # Questions   1. After reading my newbie Kanban War and Peace what are your thoughts? (please go easy on me :))
