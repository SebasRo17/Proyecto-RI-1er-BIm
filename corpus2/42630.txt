Let's assume that Sol is the solution of NDSolve, given as an InterpolatingFunction               f     InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,10.},{0.,100.}},<>]      If I want to plot it, for a fixed x, it is sufficient to write               Plot[f[0,t],{t,0,T},PlotRange->All,Frame->True]      Why, if I want to define the partial derivative of f, I cannot use the following code?               GradTheta[t] = D[f[x, t], x]          ReplaceAll::reps: {InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,10.},{0.,100.}},{3,10,1,{25,103},{6,4},0,0,0,0},<<1>>,{Developer`PackedArrayForm,{<<1>>},{<<1>>}},{Automatic,Automatic}]} is neither a list of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for replacing. >>
