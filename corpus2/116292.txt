I'm working on a project that involves the chaining of separate jobs into a single master job, though there may be parallel paths in the chain leading up to the final output. Job and chain details will be stored in a database. Eventually what I want to end up with is a GUI in which blocks representing the individual jobs can be moved around and chained up, with the system definition stored in the DB for execution. This will be implemented as C# on top of SQL Server. I don't want to reinvent the wheel if I can help it. I'm certain there must be some good patterns out there, particularly for how to represent the flow and dependencies in DB tables, but have been unable to find anything that fits the bill. More than anything, I'm curious if there are any effective schemas people have used to define the jobs, dependencies, etc. Does anyone know of any commonly used strategies?
