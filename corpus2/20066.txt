Very often I encounter a situation that I want to select some points inside certain areas of a plot. For example,               p1 = Graphics[Point[Table[{Random[], Random[]}, {200}]]]      will give a plot. If I use MMA's drawing tool to draw a region in the plot, p2=![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Y7iB.jpg) how I get the plot dynamically updated so that it shows only the points inside that region? * * * Here is my attempt. I use the function `inPolyQ` by rm -rf at here to test whether the points is inside the region or not.               lines = First[Cases[p2, Line[x_] :> x, \[Infinity]]];     pts = First[Cases[p2, Point[x_] :> x, \[Infinity]]];     inPolyQ[poly_, pt_] := Graphics`Mesh`PointWindingNumber[poly, pt] =!= 0     slctPts = Select[pts, inPolyQ[lines, #] &];     Graphics[{Point[slctPts], Line[lines]}, AbsoluteOptions[p1]]      the out put is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Lc7aJ.jpg) I have two problems:   1. How can I change it to a efficient function that can do all this dynamically on a plot(or may density plot), and with the option to output the selected data points?   2. There is a problem that sometimes I actually select more points than I want. Like in the example, there are two points outside the region are also selected. Is there a way to solve that? Thanks.
