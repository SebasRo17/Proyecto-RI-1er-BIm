Create a new graphic via the menu bar: `Graphics -> New Graphic`. The `FullForm` expression for this graphic is:               Graphics[{}, ContentSelectable -> True, ImageSize -> {480, 360}, PlotRange -> {{0, 4/3}, {0, 1}}]      Using the Drawing Tools palette, the entire area of the newly created graphic is editable: ![fullyeditable](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nv1iC.png) Suppose now I want to make a new graphic but make it taller; that is, I want a new graphic but with dimension 480 x 800. I can do so with `Graphics[{}, ImageSize -> {480, 800}]` but only a small part of it is editable. ![noteditable](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GWpdf.png) If I add a `PlotRange`, for example, `Graphics[{}, ImageSize -> {480, 800}, PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 4/3}}]`, the editable area increases. ![noteditable2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/21Eip.png) To make the entire area editable, I can change `PlotRange` to `{{0, 1}, {0, 5/3}}`. ![noteidtable3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sQmfY.png) If I change `ImageSize`, is there a systematic way to choose `PlotRange` to make the entire area editable? Other approaches are also welcome.
