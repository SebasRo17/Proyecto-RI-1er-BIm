I have this code to produce an interactive visualization of a tangent plane to a function:               Clear[f]     f[x_, y_] := x^3 + 2*y^3     Manipulate[      Show[       Plot3D[f[x, y], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.8]],       Plot3D[f[point[[1]], point[[2]]] +         Limit[(f[point[[1]] + h, point[[2]]] - f[point[[1]], point[[2]]])/            h, h -> 0]*(x - point[[1]]) +         Limit[(f[point[[1]], point[[2]] + h] - f[point[[1]], point[[2]]])/            h, h -> 0]*(y - point[[2]]), {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},         PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.8], MeshStyle -> Gray]],      {{point, {0, 0}}, {-1, -1}, {1, 1}},       SaveDefinitions -> True]      It is, however, extremely slow. I suspect that the reason is that I unnecessarily compute the partial derivatives over and over again inside the second `Plot3D`, so my question is: how to change it? Note: I am using the above code also for other functions as discussed here, and that is the reason for the `Limit` in computation of partial derivatives.
