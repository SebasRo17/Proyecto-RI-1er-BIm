I was recently refactoring a method that was both a command and a query method. After separating it into a one command method and one query method, I found that there are now multiple places in the code where I am calling the command then getting the value from the query, which seems like a violation of the DRY principle. But if I were to wrap that common code into a method, that method would be both command and a query. Is this acceptable?
