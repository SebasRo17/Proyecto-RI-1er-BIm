I study software engineering and have every intention to become one and stay one. However, I also love logic, computability theory, automata theory, and similar computer sciency math topics, and would love to do at least a Masters degree _at some point_ after I graduate to study these topics more in depth. This is really something I want to do for myself, and not because it will contribute something to my career as a software engineer (and let's face it- it won't either), but I'm worried that a few years of absence from the field will be frowned upon, and will make it harder for me to get back on the horse, so to speak. Is that true? How _do_ employers react to such absence?
