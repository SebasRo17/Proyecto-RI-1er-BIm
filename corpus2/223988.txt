I have a question regarding dynamic initialization. Example code               void main()     {     int a = 100;     //Statement1     //Statement2     ...     float b = 6.32987; //StatementA     ...     return;     }      The `StatementA` allocates memory at the middle execution of program. How does process takes place and where does space gets allocated for variable `b` (stack or heap)?
