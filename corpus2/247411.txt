I don't have compilable code, because the code in question depends on a large function that's irrelevant to the question, but say I have the following scenario:               savePath = "C:\\..."          changePath1, changePath2 :: String -> String          changePath1 passedPath =         'Do something with passedPath'          changePath2 =         'Do something with savePath'          let newPath1 = changePath1 savePath in ...     let newPath2 = changePath2 in ...      Is it more proper to set up functions like changePath1 (where the global path is passed in), or changePath2 (where it just internally uses the global path) If the functions had a chance of processing more then 1 path, obviously I'd use changePath1, but in my current program, there is only 1 path to deal with, so it seems simpler to just have all the functions internally know the global path instead of constantly passing it in. Thank you
