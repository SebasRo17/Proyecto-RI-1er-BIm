As many of you guys know, _concepts_ , C++'s approach for constraining possible types for a template argument has failed to be included in C++11. I learned that the D programming language 2.0 has a similar feature for its generic programming. Its solution seems to me quite elegant & simple. So my question is _why C++ cannot use a similar approach_.   * The C++ concept's goal might be bigger than what D's implementation provides?   * Or C++'s legacy prevents it from adopting such an approach?   * Or any other? Thanks for your answers. p.s. To see some examples of D's generic programming power, please refer to this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7300298/metaprogramming-in-c-and- in-d/7303534#7303534
