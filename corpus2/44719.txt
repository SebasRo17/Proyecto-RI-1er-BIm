I want to work with a formal vector space spanned by integer triplets: $$ V=\text{span}\\{(a,b,c):a,b,c\in\mathbb N^3\\}, $$ such that Mathematica can do additions for me. For example,if I input {1,0,1} + {2,0,1} + 3{1,0,1} - {4,4,7} - 3{2,0,1} Instead of getting {-4, -4, -5} where it is calculated entrywise, I would like Mathematica to return 4{1,0,1} - 2{2,0,1} - {4,4,7} What is the simplest way to implement this?
