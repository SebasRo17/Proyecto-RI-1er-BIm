I am attempting to style a `Plot` in which all of the lines are Thick and I have selected the colors manually:               solid[t_] := -292 - 0.41 t;     liquid[t_] := -286 - 0.07 t;     gas[t_] := -242 - .189 t;     Plot[{gas[t], liquid[t], solid[t]}, {t, 0, 400},       PlotStyle -> ({Thick, #} & /@ {Black, Blue, Red})]      The above code gives me the desired result, but I can't believe that the use of a pure mapped pure function is the best way to get these results. Is there a less obfuscatious method to assigning some `PlotStyle` directives to all functions and then a set of directives that will apply to each function individually?
