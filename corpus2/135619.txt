Making reference to this link In particular, what made them decide to pick 'tl' as the converter symbol for hour... It seems so random. I understand why they've decided on 'te' (it's because 'e' comes after 'd' in 'td' and d is the first letter of 'day'). Edit: Oh come on, why the downvote? I'm asking something that might not be important but it does nag on me
