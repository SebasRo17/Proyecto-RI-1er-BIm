If we open `DocumentationCenter` and then run code, we will find that the `Cells` are independent from each other. For example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p4Ntp.png)   * `a` or `b` in third `Cell` is independent from the one in the first or second `Cell`. I think maybe it is local cell? If I want to achieve this behaviour in my notebook, how to do this? Thanks.
