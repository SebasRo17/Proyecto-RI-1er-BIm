I've been programming for years now, mainly in VBA (the _horror_ ), Python, Javascript (Node.js mainly), HTML, and SQL. Most of these languages came with environments that made sense: for VBA I used the built-in editor for Microsoft Office, HTML I could use whatever and debugged with Chrome Dev Tools, and SQL doesn't really require anything fancy. However, for Python and Javascript, I switched around a bunch between editors. History of my usage: Python - IDLE, nano, Notepad++, Sublime Text 2, JetBrains PyCharm   Javascript - Notepad++, Sublime Text 2, Node interpreter, JetBrains WebStorm Languages I plan to learn (eventually): [Clojure | Common Lisp | Scheme], [C | C++ | Objective C], Ruby, Haskell, Assembly As I'm getting more serious into programming, I'm starting to look into the most famous editors--emacs and vim. I have some idea of what they do and don't have over IDEs. I'm a really quick typer so I like the idea of not having to use the mouse. I also love the functions that Sublime Text 2 has for quick switching for funcitons and across open files, and also the multiline select. However, despite lots of research, I'm having trouble figuring out the difference between emacs and vim, and I'd like to have a good understanding of them before deciding which one to commit lots of time to. ## TL;DR **Question:** What are the key differences between emacs and vim? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each for a developer? **Please note: I am _not_ asking which is better, which is higher quality, which is more useful--I'm not trying to restart a famous debate. I just want to know what is distinct about each in terms of functionality and user interface, so I can decide based on my own needs.**
