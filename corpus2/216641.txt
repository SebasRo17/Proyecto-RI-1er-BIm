Are there any programming languages that support the use of unicode logic operators? For example, many programming languages use " **!=** " as the _"does not equal"_ operator, but in mathematics the symbol is " **â‰ ** ". Since unicode is now more standardized, why don't programming languages support their use as logical operators? Many of the symbols are on my keyboard, I just hit the `alt` button.
