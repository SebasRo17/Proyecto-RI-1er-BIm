For a uni assignment, I need to plot the "number of triples at each v in V(G)". I tried to find relevant information in the Mathematica documentation through Google, but I'm lost. How do I get the set of number of triples at each v in V(G)? I have graph WS:               WS = RandomGraph[WattsStrogatzGraphDistribution[500, 0.01, 10]]      I want this:               ListPlot[NumberOfTriples[WS]]      NumberOfTriples is an imaginary function, but the previous line illustrates what I want.
