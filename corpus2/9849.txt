I'd like a feature added to Eclipse, as a small plug-in, but:   * It's a bit niche, so not high demand. So if I post it as a feature request it's unlikely to be followed-up.   * Still, I'm sure someone else would find it handy.   * I'm a programmer, but I don't know Java, and I don't think it's currently worth my time learning Java just to code this. What might be a good way to find a programmer who could code such an Eclipse plug-in, and pay them to do the job? My example is specifically about Java and Eclipse, but what might be an answer to this question in general terms?
