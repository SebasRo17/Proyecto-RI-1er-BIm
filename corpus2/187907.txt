We are currently looking at using the idquantique random number generator device to provide random numbers. There are some issues though. We would only be using one device and we have at least 5 servers that would need to use it and this number will probably increase in the future. This implies that blocks of random numbers would have to be sent to the servers in some way. All the servers are running Linux. All of our servers are Intel based and have the RDRand random number instruction available. It would be easier to use RDRand since no networking calls would need to be made and RDRand also appears to be significantly faster. But, the question I would like answered is - is there a difference between the quality of the random numbers generated by RDRand and those generated by idquantique? Has anyone ever measured or tried to measure how well these two random number devices perform against each other?
