I have two lists of values               xx = {0.1, 0.3, 0.35, 0.57, 0.88, 1.0}     yy = {1.2, 3.5, 4.5, 7.8, 9.0, 12.2}      I want to make a scatter plot (list plot) with xx as x axis and yy as y axis. The help document on ListPlot tells me I have to use               ListPlot[{{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, ...}]      How do I create something like               ListPlot[{{0.1, 1.2}, {0.3, 3.5}, ...}]      from xx and yy? Thank you.
