In Von Neumann's stability analysis of Finite Difference Equations, the Euler's formula is used to describe a perturbation. Now the finite difference equation is stable if this perturbation does not grow in time. Now, my question really is: how do I plot the perturbation (Equation 1) three- dimensions(?)/Im vs Real dimensions? $$\epsilon(x,t) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} e^{at} e^{ik_m x} \ldots \ldots \text{(1)}$$ I realize that the the Euler's formula $e^{ik_m x}$ describes a circle. Clearly the multiplicative amplitude factor $e^{at}$ either "grows" this circle or decreases it whether or not $e^{at}$ is greater than 1 or not. I would like to describe that as a `Manipulate` or a `ListAnimate` in _Mathematica_ but I don't understand which function to use. So far I have understood that `PolarPlot` and `ParametricPlot` draw this circle in 2D. **Parametric Plot example**               ParametricPlot[G {Re[Exp[I x]], Im[Exp[I x]]}, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]},       PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ByXKJ.png) **Polar Plot example**               PolarPlot[{Re[Exp[I x]], Im[Exp[I x]]}, {x, 0, Pi}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QW20n.png)
