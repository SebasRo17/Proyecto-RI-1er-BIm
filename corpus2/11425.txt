I'm relatively new to Mathematica and I've tried searching and reading through the Mathematica documentation but I'm not able to find a good place to start. I want to model a simple, second-order negative feedback loop between two parties. I would like a) to have a visual animation of the system (this can be crude) and b) for there to be a plot of the amount of each party there is over time (this should obviously be some sort of periodic function depending on the parameters of the system). Finally, I want to be able to see the change in behavior as a function of the delay in response of party A from party B. If the delay is long it should take a long while for equilibrium to occur after a shock. A lot of the specific functionality I've mentioned is something I'm willing to try and figure out later, I just want a good place to start learning how to model such a system. Thanks!
