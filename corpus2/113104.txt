I once had this crazy idea that I might learn COBOL. COBOL developers are getting older and retiring, but there's still a lot of legacy code hanging around that needs maintaining. People have told me that this has lead to an under supply of COBOL developers, resulting in a lot of available work and could be potentially very lucrative! (not my only motivation, honest!) Is there any truth in this or is it a bit of a myth?
