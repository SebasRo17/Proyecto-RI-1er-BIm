EDIT: I should clarify. THe particular terms I listed below I fully understand. I also understand w3schools doesn't have the greatest information. These are just examples. I don't expect everybody to understand what an example is, but I hope the majority do. Does anybody have any resources listing terms related to programming and web development, or care to pitch in? Things like: Runtime   Build time   Framework   Library   Normalize I'm primarily a PHP developer so anything about that. I really am looking for general terms and specific terms related to web development, PHP, SQL, CSS, HTML. Appreciate any input. Couple I found: http://www.w3schools.com/site/site_glossary.asp   http://docs.roxen.com/pike/7.0/tutorial/fundamentals/concepts.xml
