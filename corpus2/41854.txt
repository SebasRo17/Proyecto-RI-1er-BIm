I know to check for/use asserts and carefully examine any assembly components, but I didn't know if anyone out there has a fairly comprehensive or industry standard check-list of specific things at which to look? I am looking more at C and C++. note: There are some really helpful answers, I'm just leaving the question open for a couple days in case some folks only check questions that don't have accepted answers.
