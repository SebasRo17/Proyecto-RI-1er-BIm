I'm doing something where the most sensible approach seems to be to open a file and write to it as I process data from some large tables. Old school. While testing the program, I remembered the low level write statements I use to use to do this kind of thing in FORTRAN and how fast they seemed to be, and I wondered how `WriteString` compared, so I did a little test. It took 10.875 seconds to write 1,000,000 records with record number, "Hello World." That seems pretty fast, but how does that compare to other languages? I use only Mathematica these days so I can't easily do any comparisons.               funit = OpenWrite[NotebookDirectory[] <> "writetest.csv"];     Timing[Do[WriteString[funit, i, ",Hello World\n"];, {i, 1, 1000000}]]          (*  {10.875000, Null}  *)
