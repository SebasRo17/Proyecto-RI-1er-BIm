This question is, perhaps, related mostly to **web developers** who, like myself, code enterprise applications and use high level languages like **Java, C#** mostly. Due to nature of enterprise web-apps, which essentially do **CRUD** operations, and since we rely heavily on libraries that the language provide, **what is the significance of learning algorithms?** I know the web is filled with articles profoundly stating that "code is algorithm", but when was the last time anyone wrote _quicksort_ algorithm in such an application? I see far more benefits in learning Design patterns and anti-patterns, which are used a lot.
