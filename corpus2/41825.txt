I've been trying to figure out a way to either draw a curve in the domain of a complex function in one plane and then show the result in another plane (simultaneously?). Actually, just plotting circles and lines (any line, even just y=x) in the domain and showing their corresponding image in the other plane would be great too. For example, if the function were e^z, then this program would send horizontal and vertical lines in the domain plane to rays and circles in the other plane. I'm not sure where to even start with this...
