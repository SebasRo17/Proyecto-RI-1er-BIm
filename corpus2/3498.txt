I want to call the `NMinimize` function for my own defined calculations but I got an error. Below is a simple example.               NMinimize[x^4 - 3 x^2 - x, x] returns     {-3.51391, {x -> 1.30084}} but          f[x_] := x^4 - 3 x^2 - x;      calling `NMinimize[f, x]` gives an error > `NMinimize::nnum: The function value f is not a number at {x} = > {-0.829053}.` What's wrong with this approach?
