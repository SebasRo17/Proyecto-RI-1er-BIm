From what I understand, genetic algorithms try out multiple variations and evaluate the fitness of each variation. Then they select the best variations, change them a bit and continue the process with the next generation. But what if we have unlimited computation resources? Can we then just try out all possible variations and evaluate their fitness without resorting to the complex process of breeding new generations? In other words, are genetic algorithms only needed when computation is expensive and when a brute-force method is impossible? Or do they add other benefits as well?
