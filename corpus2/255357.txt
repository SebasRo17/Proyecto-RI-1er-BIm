Myself Rameez. Today I successfully complete my 5 years experience in VB6 platform as programmer. I want to know from expert that Is any demand of VB6 programmer remains in market and in future? And also I want to know Which technology I have to switch and Way to change it successfully? More about my technical skill set is I have learned ASP.net,c#, core java in my academic year. I have also knowledge how to write the code in these technologies. But I dont have any industrial project experience in these language. I have faced some interview in earlier for .net developer but can not go further. Because of not having experience in .net. So please show me a right way. Your feedback is very valuable for me. Its really help me in my future. Thanks in advance.
