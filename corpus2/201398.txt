In a method, i have calls of single method of another object that returns field value, like `foo.value()`, which is defined like `Field value() {return this.value;}` Is it better to make a local variable, like `Field value = foo.value()` and use it. Or use many method calls of a single method? Why? How does it correlate with number of method calls, like for 3, 5, 10 what will be better and why it may be a concern? Edit: field doesn't change anyhow during the flow of a method, just the same value all the time. Edit2: does it depend on programming language? If it's important, it's java.
