I will be honest I don't really know much about MVC other than the stuff you can read online in 5 minutes. Unfortunately this doesn't really tell me whether its suited to smaller projects or not. I also read this related question and its chosen answer, but the business perspective is not a concern in this case for me as I am the only one making it. The next answer proceeds to say why it is more flexible. Sure, that's great. But my question is again, if its an ideal choice for a small project. For example I would rather use winforms to make a simple mockup of a small desktop program than do it on WPF because of the overhead of custom styling. So I have a project that will essentially have about 6-8 pages that read excel files and user input use that to pull a bit of data from databases and output resulting excel files. I will be the only one working on this project. If I used webforms I would expect it to take no more than 2-3 weeks. Now I am 100% comfortable with webforms. And I know its easy to do a small project in webforms. But I have only heard good things about MVC so I am seriously considering it.
