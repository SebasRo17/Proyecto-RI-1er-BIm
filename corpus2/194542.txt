I'm currently on a medium-sized team of web developers. We're using jira for bug tracking. We're working on a product with frequent layout changes. A lot of times bugs are filed about a bug in the layout in some browser. Sometimes, by the time we get around to dealing with a low priority bug, the layout has already changed and it is no longer relevant.   * What should we close it as?   What I mean is how we should _treat_ these issues? While Jira is the bug tracking software we use, I'm more interested in how to handle these sort of issues in general.   * Does it even matter? (We _might_ return to the layout later, but it's very unlikely)
