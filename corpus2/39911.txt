I am having a problem saving a long complicated string with Unicode characters in it. I have boiled the problem down, I think, to this minimal example:               hw = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 8594, 32,          87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33};     str = FromCharacterCode[hw]      which assigns a _hello world_ string with a right arrow (the Unicode 8594 character) to `str`. If I then               ExportString[str, "Text"]      I get a different string, as the second line in ![right and wrong hello world strings](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Za1tj.png) instead of the first line. I have a program that reads cells from a Notebook and custom converts it to a LaTeX string. I just cannot save the string. What am I doing wrong?
