After our product backlog is created and prioritized, are we meant to briefly estimate all the stories in the product backlog? I assume they have to be in order to create a product burndown chart, however if you have a lot of stories this could take a long time initially. Additionally, should a user story have acceptance criteria when added to the backlog or are those criteria added when the story transfers from the product backlog to the sprint backlog? It would be harder to estimate without them.
