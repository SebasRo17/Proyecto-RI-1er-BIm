I have a 24 character long id which is guaranteed to be unique. I would like to shorten that to 7-10 (or even shorter) characters long. If I generate an short id randomly then I would have to check every time if that shortid is available. Is there an one-way hash algorithm that could return back 7-10 character hash from passing in the 24 character id. Are there any other ways to guarantee that the generated short id is unique without checking?
