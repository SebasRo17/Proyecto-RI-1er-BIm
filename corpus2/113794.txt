Itâ€™s become an annoying factor of working with large teams: how do you manage checkins and prevent feature conflicts and manage dependencies with source control properly? Currently at my workplace we use TFS 2008 and we're migrating to TFS 2010 in early December. Firstly any source control is better than none but what approach has anyone found useful to prevent multiple checkins and rollback all over source control history? Is a volatile trunk the best way to go or branch off when your implementing a new feature and once you're happy merge back into the trunk? I'd really like to hear other people experiences and perhaps some best practices to managing source control.
