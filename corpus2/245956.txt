I'll change my personal code often and not worry about going back and changing the associated variable names. Should variable names be maintained in case of meaning changes?               var accountCurrentValue = x;     var accountYesterdayValue = y;     var accountValueChange = accountCurrentValue - accountYesterdayValue;      \--> `accountPastValue` becomes instead the previous month's value               var accountCurrentValue = x;     var accountLastMonthValue = y;     var accountValueChange = accountCurrentValue - accountLastMonthValue;
