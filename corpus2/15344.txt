I currently have a two lists. The first list contains independent variables $x$, and the second list contains dependent variables in the form of $\{\{f[1][x]\},\{f[2][x]\},...,\{f[n][x]\}\}$. I want to combine them in the form $$\{\{\{x1,f[1][x1]\},\{x2,f[1][x2]\},...,\{xn,f[1][xn]\}\},\{\{x1,f[2][x1]\},\{x2,f[2][x2]\},...,\{xn,f[2][xn]\}\},...,\{\{x1,f[n][x1]\},\{x2,f[n][x2]\},...,\{xn,f[n][xn]\}\}\}$$ ...an easy format for `ListPlot`. For some example data:               a = Range[10];     b = a^2;     c = (a + 1/2)^2;     fa = {b,c};      Now one can easily do this with `Table`:               Table[{a[[j]], fa[[i, j]]}, {i, Length[fa]}, {j, Length[c]}]      but knowing _Mathematica's_ many functions I thought there might be an easier way. I tried this as well:               Transpose@MapThread[Tuples@{{#1}, #2} &, {a, Transpose@fa}]      but with the multiple `Transpose` calls, I figured there would be a slight performance hit. And there was (2.854 vs 3.261 seconds for vectors with 1MM elements on my machine). Is there an easier and more efficient way to combine these lists?
