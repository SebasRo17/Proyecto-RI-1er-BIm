I want to use `Manipulate` (I am open to other alternatives) to apply one of two different functions `f` or `g` to a set of values. The issue is that, I want to update the evaluation only when the user clicks on one of the button `f` or `g`. I came up with the following work around but I wonder if there is a better/standard way to implement such a thing?               Module[{val},      Manipulate[       val = Switch[op, "f", op = ""; f[x], "g", op = ""; g[x], "", val];        val, {x, {1, 2, 3}, Setter}, {op, {"f", "g"}, Setter},        TrackedSymbols -> {op}]      ]      As a side question: is there any way to tell `Manipulate` to ignore the current evaluation and keep the last evaluated value?
