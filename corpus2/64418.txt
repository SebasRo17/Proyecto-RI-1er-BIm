I'm working on an ERP Project where two Members(Freshers) in my team are not performing well (for small tasks). Their work is littered with bugs and other issues. As I'm a Team Lead in this Project, I end up having to write their code/tasks. This may be creating a heavy burden for me as I have to speed up things everyday to do my work and then theirs! > What would you do in this situation. Actually, I'm feeling comfortable in this position as I'm learning many things, but some times I cant tolerate this!
