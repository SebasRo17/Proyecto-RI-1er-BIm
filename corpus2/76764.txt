I'm in a student team that is focusing on web development. My teammates are interested in Python and I'm the only one that has learned it, so I was asked to give an "introduction to Python" talk next week. I'd like to listen to your advice about what to talk about to make the talk interesting instead of just a bunch of grammar things. PS: my teammates are familiar with PHP and .NET
