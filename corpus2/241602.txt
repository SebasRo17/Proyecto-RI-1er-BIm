I have list of video files (loaded from database), each with start and end time of requested interval:                 # file   begin  end       v1.mp4   1:01   2:01       v2.mp4   3:02   3:32       v3.mp4   2:03   5:23      And I need to create single video file containing these intervals:                [0:00]---v1---[2:00]---v2---[2:30]---v3---[5:50]      I preffer usig ffmpeg, since it is installed on server. Caller program is written in PHP. It is easy to cut one input to one output (argument escaping removed for clarity):                 exec("ffmpeg -ss $begin -i $input_file -ss $begin -c copy $output_file");      I there any easier way than executing ffmpeg for each interval and then execute it once more to concatenate prepared clips together? I really do not like to have a lot of temporary files or dealing with complex process handling.
