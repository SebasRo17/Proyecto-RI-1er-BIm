I've just released a small Java library that offers only a few classes and methods. Since I built the project with Maven, I immediately used several third-party libraries to achieve my goals, specifically:   * **commons-lang3** (for some general Java stuff)   * **slf4j-api** (for logging)   * **commons-io** (for a tiny bit of file stuff - literally reading a file once, I think) I don't want my library to appear bloated in the eyes of others. Should I be trying to remove my reliance on these libraries to minimise my footprint? Any advice on what types of libraries would be best to avoid when considering using more in the future?
