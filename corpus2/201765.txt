I just had a doubt in my mind. The following subroutine(to search an element, in a list, for example) has a return statement at the end:               list *search_list(list *l, item_type x) {       if (l == NULL) return(NULL);       if (l->item == x)         return(l);       else         return( search_list(l->next, x) );     }      I cannot get the significance of return statement at the end (i.e. return search_list(l->next, x) ). It would be really helpful if anyone could explain this concept, using stack model.
