I would like to have a function that will create a word (always the same word) for a given sequence number based on a given alphabet.               word(0, [a,b,c]) = a     word(1, [a,b,c]) = b     word(2, [a,b,c]) = c     word(3, [a,b,c]) = aa     word(4, [a,b,c]) = ab     word(5, [a,b,c]) = ac     word(6, [a,b,c]) = ba     word(7, [a,b,c]) = bb     word(8, [a,b,c]) = bc     word(9, [a,b,c]) = ca     ...      I was able to recursively create all permutations of a given length but starting with length 5 it already gets quite big in memory.
