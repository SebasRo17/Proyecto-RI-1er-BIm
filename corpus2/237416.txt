This occurs as a programming language independent problem to me. I have a file with the content               aaabddd      When I want to insert `C` behind `b` then **my code** needs to rewrite `ddd` to get               aaabCddd      Why can I not just insert `C` at this position? I can not do this in Java, Python, ... . I can not do this in Linux, Windows, ... . Am I right? I do not understand why `C` can't simply be inserted without the additional writes. Would someone please explain why this is so?
