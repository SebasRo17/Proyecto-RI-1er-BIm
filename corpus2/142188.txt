I have wrote a small method in a program to do one thing my method looks like this:               public static void removeExpiredAssignments(Module module){         module.removeExpiredAssignments();     }      So the method is called like:               removeExpiredAssignments(module);      When the desired operation could be done by saying:               module.removeExpiredAssignments();       Which is easy to understand from the code point of view?
