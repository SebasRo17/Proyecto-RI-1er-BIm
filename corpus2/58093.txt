I have two neighboring (complicated) polygons that I want to be displayed with thick boundaries, however the two shapes border one another, and as EdgeForm places the line centered upon the polygon's boundary, the border of one shape overlaps the other. I would like the boundary lines to lie interior to the polygon's boundaries. Here's shape 1, shape 2, and then the two shapes shown together: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/B81Zm.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ls4vr.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NlojD.png) Obviously one could just shrink the shapes by a little bit, but this is not very exact. I was thinking a clever EdgeForm definition might be able to "offset" the boundary to the shape's interior.
