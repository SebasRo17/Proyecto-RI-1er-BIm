I've got a grid of buttons that each display an image from an array. When a button is clicked, its image changes.               DynamicModule[{g = Table[Image[RandomReal[{0.5, 1}, {16, 16, 3}]], {19}, {19}]},       Grid[Table[With[{i = i, j = j},         Button[Dynamic[g[[i, j]]], g[[i, j]] = Image[RandomReal[1, {16, 16}]],           ImageSize -> Full, Appearance -> None]],         {i, 19}, {j, 19}], Spacings -> {0, 0}]]      The problem is that it is very slow. I presume this is because all the buttons get updated when only one is changed. This raises the general question as to how can you dynamically change only the control corresponding to the changed element in the list? I've already come up with a workaround for my particular problem:               DynamicModule[{g = Table[Image[RandomReal[{0.5, 1}, {16, 16, 3}]], {19}, {19}]},       Pane[ClickPane[Dynamic[ImageAssemble[g]],         (g[[19 - Floor[#[[2]]/16], Floor[#[[1]]/16] + 1]] =           Image[RandomReal[1, {16, 16}]])&],         ImageSize -> Full]]      This splices together a single image, works out where you clicked on it, then changes the appropriate element in the list. It doesn't answer the original question, but it's lots faster. ### Additional note: I'd quite like `g` to be available outside the grid. Then you could have multiple grids doing different things. Or some other view of the data.
