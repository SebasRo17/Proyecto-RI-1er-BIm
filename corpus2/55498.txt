I'm finding a curious behavior for Mathematica 8. The code               (x^3)^(1/3)      does not want to Simplify or FullSimplify. I'd prefer not to make a rule for this, because trivial extensions such as               (x^3 y^3 z)^(1/3)      should also be able to simplify (to $xy(z)^{(1/3)}$), which is not so straightforward for a rule. I suspect this may be related to this unanswered question.
