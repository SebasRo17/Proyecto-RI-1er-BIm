I am clueless when it comes to design but I am proficient in programming. If you are a programmer who lacks visual design skills, what has worked best for you -- to pair up with a graphic designer or to do all the programming and then piece out specific work? I have done some piecing out of work but I am not completely satisfied because I see too much of my influence come out in the design. I guess this happens since I have to be explicit in what I want with contractors, and they are limited in creativity by the architecture I have created. It feels like having a partner would allow for greater collaboration, but I have read plenty of entrepreneur books that warn against partnerships.
