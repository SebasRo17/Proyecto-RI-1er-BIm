We have a lot of documents associated with our software development. These include things like requirements, design documents, external PDFs, customer files, testing instructions, etc. Currently, these documents are scattered all over the place (wiki, "some place on the network", a local developers hard drive(!), and even worse places). What's the best way to keep track of them? Since we use visual studio (2010) for our development, and we don't really have any non-developers on the project, I thought it'd be a great idea to store them within the VS "solution", which would allow them to be source controlled, and universally accessible by all the developers. However, VS really doesn't seem to be built to do this. If you edit any document file, even one that is setup with the build properties "None", "Do not copy", VS must will rebuild the software before it will run again. There is no way to create a "Documentation Project" within the solution. (We use an Empty C# project for this). Visual Studio and Word/Excel flat do not do source control well. You can't view a checked-in file, and then decide to make a change without first closing the file, going to the project, and manually checking it out before making the change. It's slow and tedious at best. Anyway this is the best our team has come up with, but I really wish I had a better (free) solution.
