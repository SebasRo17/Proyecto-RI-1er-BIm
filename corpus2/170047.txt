I'm a big StackOverflow fan, but I think this question belongs here, correct me if I'm wrong. So basically I'm trying to localize my plugin in as many languages as possible. I posted a section on the docs to reach people that wants to help translating but I only got one contributor that attached a German translation. So far I got 4 languages, English, Spanish, French and German. So my question is, how do you guys translate your projects? Where do you find people interested in contributing? Does anybody use Google translate to do the job?
