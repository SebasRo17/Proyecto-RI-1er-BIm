I have a question as to the proper best practices and ethics revolving forking code. I've taken code base licensed under Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 and brought significant changes to it to suit my needs. I feel as though my version could benefit others and wish to redistribute it. I'm unsure what liberties I have for redistribution or what is ethically and morally accepted. Can I rename the projects? Should I start a new v.1 or continue from the original version number? What is considered giving proper attribution to the original author? Should I consult the author and ask permission before releasing (although he is already aware)?
