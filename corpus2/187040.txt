I remember that in our first programming class with Java, while explaining data types, the following occurred (kinda): > **Professor** : So, what data type would you choose if your program needs to > store the user's gender? > > **Someone** : How about a boolean? You know, true for male and false for > female. > > **Professor** : Sure, that may work, but some people may hesitate about > that. There have been disputes about calling men "true" and women "false" in > the past... > > * _laughter_ * He ended up recommending us to consider chars (like `'m'` and `'f'`) although booleans should be fine. I tried searching a bit if there has been any kind of historical entry regarding a major dispute based on this programming practice with no luck. I'm not asking what data type to use for gender nor if it is fine or not to use booleans. I'm asking if, **historically** , there has been a dispute regarding the usage of booleans to determine the gender in programming because of the apparently "wrong" (I'm not saying it _is_ wrong - I don't care about that) behavior of calling a woman "false" as the professor seemed to suggest. Searching around related questions, the results happen to be only about software efficiency.
