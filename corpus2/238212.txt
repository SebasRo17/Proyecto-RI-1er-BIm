I have come to this web page from Sony: http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/scripting_in_vegas_pro_and_sound_forge > We suggest you use C# for your scripts, since although you can currently > write scripts in Jscript and Visual Basic.NET, those two languages have been > deprecated by Microsoft, meaning they may cease to be supported at some > point in the future. AFAIK VB.Net is pretty healthy, and I have been unable to find any other source for that claim. FWIW, the page seems to be pretty old (screenshots have a 2008 date in their names). Can anyone shed some light on this?
