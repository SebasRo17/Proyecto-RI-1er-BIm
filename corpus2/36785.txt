I want to solve the system of non-linear differential equations given below numerically. $$y''(t)+500y'(t)+100y(t)=-33\cos(500t)-66\cos(1000t)$$ $$300x'(t)=1000y(t)+500y'(t)-35\tanh(50x'(t))$$ Notice that there is a derivative of $x$ inside $\tanh$. I tried the code below, but many errors appeared.               sol1 =        NDSolve[{y''[t] + 500 y'[t] + 100 y[t] == -33 Cos[500 t] - 66 Cos[1000 t],         y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 0}, y, {t, 0, 30}];     sol2 =        NDSolve[{300 x'[t] ==          1000 First[Evaluate[y[t] /. sol1]] + 500 First[Evaluate[y'[t] /. sol1]] -          35 Tanh[50 x'[t]], x[0] == 0}, x, {t, 0, 30}];     Plot[{Evaluate[x[t] /. sol1], Evaluate[y[t] /. sol2]}, {t, 0, 30}, PlotRange -> All]      How can I solve my system of differential equations using _Mathematica_? ### Edit I found the answer! thanks to Nasser. The solution for $x(t)$ is like below. I just need to adjust the axis ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LtCye.png)
