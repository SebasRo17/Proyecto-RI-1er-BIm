> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Books or websites containing easy programming problems? Are there any resources that offer small programming exercises? I am looking for problems that are relatively small but taxing in some way or another. It would be nice if the problems focussed on specific areas of skill - i.e. algorithm, logic, problem solving, performance etc. So that they can be picked for purpose. I am looking for one program for every few days that I can use to better my programming skills. Also I am trying to learn tdd and these excesses will help me this too. I am struggling to think of problems every few days and would prefer exercises that are known to push specific programming skills forward.
