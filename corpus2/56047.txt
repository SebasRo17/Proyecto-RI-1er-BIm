Here is my problem: I have two very large lists of intervals (stored as many couples in the form `{{"start point", "end point"}, ..., {"start point", "end point"}`), and I want the result of the intersection of those lists. Here is an example :               intervalsA = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 7}, {8, 8.5}};     intervalsB = {{1.5, 3.5}, {4.1, 6}, {9, 10}};      The expected result is: `overlap = {{1.5, 2}, {3, 3.5}, {5, 6}};` I tried using `Interval`, `IntervalUnion` and `IntervalIntersection`, but nothing worked. The only working method that I found uses `Piecewise` functions where each interval is set as 1. By multiplying the two piecewise functions, I have something similar to the intersection, but the solution is very inefficient. I hope I am clear and precise enough.
