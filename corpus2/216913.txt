What is your strategy for naming conventions for the keys in language files used for localization? We have a team that is going to conversion of a project to multiple languages and would like to have some guidelines to follow. As an example, usually the files end up being a series of key/value pairs, with the key being the placeholder in the template for the language specific value.               'Username': 'Username',     'Enter Username': 'Enter your username here'
