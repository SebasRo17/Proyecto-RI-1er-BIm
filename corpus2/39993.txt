I have data generated from two functions given below. How can I go about finding a fit of the form:               y'[x] == -(a + b/(c + d  y[x] + e F[x] ))      where a,b,c,d,e are to be determined?               F[x_] := If[x < 37.5, 2.80 + 0.0036 x, 117.86 - 6.314 x + 0.0865 x^2]          s = NDSolve[{y'[x] == -(0.0595 + 3716/(11780 + y[x])) y[x],         y[0] == 650000}, y, {x, 0, 60}]               data = Table[{x, Evaluate[y[x] /. s], F[x]}, {x, 0, 60, 1}]
