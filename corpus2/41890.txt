I have seen a couple of similar questions but have not been able to figure out a solution for my particular problem. I have a probability density function of two variables `p[x,v]` which is an interpolating function. What I really want to do is to generate a set of random `{x,v}` values based on this distribution. I tried:               dist=ProbabilityDistribution[p[x, v], {x, -4, 4}, {v, -4, 4}]     RandomVariate[dist, 10]      but get the error: > RandomVariate::noimp: "Sampling from ProbabilityDistribution[<<1>>] is not > implemented." Any ideas how I can get this working?
