I have a function, `Dx[s]` (defined in a module) which I can plot:               Plot[Dx[s], {s, 0, GetLatticeLength[]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GqfJM.jpg) However if I try to integrate it, I get nothing:               NIntegrate[Dx[s], {s, 2, 3}]      > > >>     NIntegrate[Dx[s], {s, 2, 3}] >>   Note that the function has quite complicated form with many `If`-statements, hence can't be easily represented symbolically (e.g. `Dx[a]`). Still, for any numerical value I tried it gives a definite answer. Also, it seems from the plot that there are no wild singularities etc. Why doesn't `NIntegrate` work? Shouldn't it be just numerical evaluation of the integrand? I mean, the plot works, why shouldn't `NIntegrate` work as well?
