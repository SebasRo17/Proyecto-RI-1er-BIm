I am a year away from finishing graduate school, and the campus drives in my college are about to start. It's mostly big names that come to campus, but I am really interested in a specific small company. I applied, and then after a series of telephone interviews and online tests, they seem to be interested in me. But, I don't want to start work until after I graduate. However in the meantime, if I make a commitment to join them, they plan on providing training assistance and some small assignments, in exchange for staying away from future recruitment drives. They want a written assurance from me that I'll join their company, but how can _I_ be assured that after graduating, there will still be a job for me? For example, if they decide they don't need my expertise anymore or if they shut down. Is it reasonable to enter into such an agreement with a company prior to the actual hire?
