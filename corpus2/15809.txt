I have made this function which outputs the equation of a nth degree polynomial:               polynomial[degree_] := (       result = 0;       For[count = 1,             count <= degree,             result +=         ToExpression[FromCharacterCode[96 + count]]*x^(degree - count);             count++;         ];       result)      This works fine until you set a variable named `a`. Now the `a` in the equation gets replaced by the new value of `a`. How can I stop this from happening so that `polynomial[1]` always would result in `a` and not the value of `a` even if it is defined. I would prefer the output of `polynomial` to be an expression and not a string and a would also prefer not to clear the variables. Example:               polynomial[1] (* == a *)          a = 2;     polynomial[1] (* == 2 *)     fixedPolynomial[1] (* == a *)
