Is there a mathematical way to get the following: For the the number 777,888,999 so 777 million and etc etc getMillions(777888999) should return 777 only getThousands(777888999) should return 888 only getHundreds(777888999) should return 999 only This should be done **without using regex and without text processing** but should be achieved using **only mathematical operations**. I'm trying to solve a problem that may be familiar to some which is converting a number expressed in digits to words so 1 -> one, 10 -> ten, 100 -> one hundred etc My thinking is that if I can convert a number up to 999 then the problem is pretty much solved as the rest will only append the words millions and/or thousands so 777888999 will covert to the words: 777 million and 888 thousands and 999 hundred of course the above numbers will expressed in words. This originally was given to me as part of a job interview process about a year ago. I am absolutely not using the solution here for a job application. But the above question is about number manipulation which I'm very interested in.
