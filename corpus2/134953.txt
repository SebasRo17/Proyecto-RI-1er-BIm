I am new to web development. While studying the Play framework and JSP, I noticed that they both give an option to place script (in jsp scriptlet) inside HTML, but in both books I am reading they both say it is bad practice and don't give an explanation as to when should I use scripts, only writing not to. My question is, if both frameworks supply such an option, when would it be ok to use scripts inside HTML? Please note, I'm talking about server side scripts for creating dynamic HTML (i.e. JSP scriptlet).
