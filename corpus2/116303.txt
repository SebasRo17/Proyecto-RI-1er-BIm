I want to compare the performance of two search trees of integers (an AVL tree and a RedBlack tree). How should I design/engineer the tests to accomplish this? For example, let's consider the _insert_ operation; what steps should I follow in order to state that on average this operation is faster in the RB case? What considerations should I take to correctly measure CPU time? Should both implementations be optimized, or may I compare an optimized implementation of AVL vs a straightforward implementation of RB? Any links or papers would be very helpful.
