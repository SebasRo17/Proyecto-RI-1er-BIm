We "use" JIRA as our ticketing system, but "use" is a real stretch. We have no standards, no templates, no "best practices" documentation for writing a proper JIRA ticket. So I'm spearheading the movement to create such a doc. It's bad. Real bad. Sometimes, the reporter just copies-n-pastes a stacktrace and submits the ticket without providing any context, backstory, or directions to reproduce. I was wondering if anybody had some good input for what format/template we could use and enforce so that I never get a lousily-written ticket assigned to me ever again! Thanks in advance!
