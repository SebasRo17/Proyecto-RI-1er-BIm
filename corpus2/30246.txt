I was wondering whether someone can give me an idea on how I can solve a set of non-linear equations with an unknown exponent This is what I have:   * Known values: N, R   * Unknown values: λ, α, J   * Equations              J = N1 + a*R1^λ       J = N2 + a*R2^λ     J = N3 + a*R3^λ      The α, J, λ should be approximately the same in every equation Additional info The only thing I know according to the author of the paper is that "... by solving the three unknowns J, a, λ with a least-square solution scheme" I know about least-squares, but not how to apply it when the exponent is unknown along with sum of `N`.
