I'm working in a little firm about 10 developpers, we are working a kind of agile way but knowledgeless and without formalism. I think be aware of what are agile method, what can they afford to us, may render more productive our products. However there is a lot of agile method, which could be the simplest to "learn"?   * Rapid Application Development   * Dynamic systems development method   * Scrum   * Feature Driven Development   * Extreme programming    * Adaptive software development   * Test Driven Development   * Crystal clear
