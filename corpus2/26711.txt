Counting Stochastic Processes and displaying relative value I have two watermarks and multiple stochastic processes given. I want both to display and count the stochastic processes which are below the two watermarks, namely watermark and watermark2: Furthermore I also want do display the relative proportion af all processes below watermark and watermark2 to all processes. In order to count the processes I used first generated a random matrix to get a little bit familiar with the counting fucntion the code is:               dataX = Table[RandomFunction[             GeometricBrownianMotionProcess[0.1, 0.2, 10], {0, 10, 0.1}]["Path"], {3}]      Then:               processesX = Transpose[dataX[[#]]][[2]] & /@ Range@Length[assetsX]      Then I just wanted to count the process values beyond 20 by this code:               Count[Flatten[dataX], _?(# >= 20 &)]      this worked so I tried to apply it for my code, however, I have some problems and I am not sure if I have allpied it properly. I would be greateful for any help. my code:               Manipulate[SeedRandom[seed]; meanvector := Mean[assets];      assets =        Table[RandomFunction[          GeometricBrownianMotionProcess[μ, σ, S0], {0, time,            0.1}]["Path"], {P}];      processes = Transpose[assets[[#]]][[2]] & /@ Range@Length[assets];      processesposition =        Flatten[Position[         Min[processes[[#]]] & /@           Range@Length[assets], _?(# > watermark &)]];      processesposition2 =        Flatten[Position[         Min[processes[[#]]] & /@           Range@Length[assets], _?(# > watermark2 &)]];      watermarkedassets = assets[[#]] & /@ processesposition;      watermarkedassets2 = assets[[#]] & /@ processesposition2;      watermarkedmeanvector = Mean[watermarkedassets];      watermarkedmeanvector2 = Mean[watermarkedassets2];           (*Counting Stochastig processes below watermark and watermark2*)      StoProcbelowwatermark =        Count[Flatten[assets], _?(# >= watermarkedassets &)];      StoProcbelowwatermark2 =        Count[Flatten[assets], _?(# >= watermarkedassets2 &)];      (*Relative proportion of assetes belos watermark and watermark2 to \     all assets*)      RelProportionwatermarktoall = StoProcbelowwatermark/P;      RelProportionwatermark2toall = StoProcbelowwatermark2/P;           (*Functions and Plotting*)      G1 := ListLogPlot[assets,         GridLines -> {{}, {{watermark,             Directive[Green, Thick]}, {watermark2,             Directive[Orange, Thick]}}}, Joined -> True,         AxesLabel -> {"Time", "St"},         PlotLabel ->          Style["Forecasted Stock Price\n (Brownian Motion)", Bold],         PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> Directive[{Thin, Lighter@Gray}]];      G2 := ListLogPlot[{meanvector, watermarkedmeanvector,          watermarkedmeanvector2}, Joined -> True,         PlotStyle -> {Directive[{Thick, Darker@Red}],           Directive[{Thick, Darker@Blue}], Directive[{Thick, Black}]}];      Show[G1, G2], {{S0, 100, "Initial Stock Value"}, 1, 500, 0.5,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {{μ, 0.08, "Drift μ"}, 0.01, 0.2,        0.01, Appearance -> "Labeled"},           {{σ, 0.2, "Standard Deviation σ"}, 0.01, 1, 0.05,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {{P, 6, "Paths"}, 1, 20, 1,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {{time, 10, "Time t"}, 1, 20, 1,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {{watermark, 75, "Watermark"}, 1, 500,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {{watermark2, 70, "Watermark2"}, 1, 500,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {{seed, 1, "New Random Case"}, 1, 100, 1},           Button["Set Initial Values", {S0 = 100, μ = 0.08, σ =          0.20, P = 6, time = 10, watermark = 75, watermark2 = 70},        ImageSize -> 150],       Dynamic["Mean watermarked processes = " <>         ToString[watermarkedmeanvector[[-1]][[2]]]],       Dynamic["Mean watermarked2 processes = " <>         ToString[watermarkedmeanvector2[[-1]][[2]]]],      Dynamic["Mean of all processes = " <>         ToString[meanvector[[-1]][[2]]]],      (*Displaying Processes below the two watermakrs*)      Dynamic["Processes below watermark = " <>         ToString[StoProcbelowwatermark[[-1]][[2]]]],      Dynamic["Processes below watermark2 = " <>         ToString[StoProcbelowwatermark2[[-1]][[2]]]],      (*Displaying relative proportions Processes below watermakrs in \     relation to all processes*)      Dynamic["relation processes below watermark and all processes= " <>         ToString[RelProportionwatermarktoall[[-1]][[2]]]],      Dynamic["relation processes below watermark and all processes= " <>         ToString[RelProportionwatermark2toall[[-1]][[2]]]],      ControlPlacement -> Left]
