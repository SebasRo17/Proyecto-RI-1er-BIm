Sometimes, after having done a very thorough analysis/research, you can think of a number of solutions to a problem, but they all have considerable downsides. What do you do in such a situation? For example, I can think of a number of options:   * Randomly choose one of the solutions.   * Postpone the issue, do something else in the meanwhile, and revisit the problem a few months later.   * Find someone who is willing to take the decision (and therefore also the responsibility) for you?   * Obstinately keep on looking for alternative solutions.   * Find people to discuss it with, and hope for a moment of clarity.   * Leave the current situation unchanged; that is: don't solve the problem at all.
