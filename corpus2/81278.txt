If I have `n` rows in a database, and I want to compare every row against each other, how many loops (or processes) would I need to do. Is it **n 2**? (so if I have 30,000 rows then it would be 900,000,000) Or is it:               for (i = 0; i < 30000; i++) {         for (j = i + 1; j < 30000; j++) [              // Process         }     }      If it is the later, then how many processes is that (and is there an equation to work it out, given `n`)? Also if I have to process each row `y` times, how does that affect the calculations? I need to check a database of companies for possible duplicates. To check, they want to do a similarity check on common fields like business name, phone number, etc. If a field difference is under a certain percentage threshold, then mark it as a possible duplicate. I can code this fine by my self, but I am curious about he performance ramifications.
