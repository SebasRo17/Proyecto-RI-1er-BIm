I came across this article Work for Free that got me thinking. > The goal of every employer is to gain more value from workers than the firm > pays out in wages; otherwise, there is no growth, no advance, and no > advantage for the employer. Conversely, the goal of every employee should be > to contribute more to the firm than he or she receives in wages, and thereby > provide a solid rationale for receiving raises and advancement in the firm. > > I don't need to tell you that the refusenik didn't last long in this job. > > In contrast, here is a story from last week.

Has anyone here worked for free? If so, has it benefited you in any way? Why should(nt) you work for free (presuming you have the money from other means to keep you going)? Can you share your experience? Me, I am taking a year out of college and haven't gotten a degree yet so that's probably why most of my job applications are getting ignored. So im thinking about working for free for the experience?
