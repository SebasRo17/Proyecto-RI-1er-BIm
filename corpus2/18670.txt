I make different controls(InputFields,Text,panel, etc) in my code for which the corresponding code is below.                 inputFieldValue = 10;       (*Markers*)       markers = Row[{                     Column[{                     MouseAppearance[                                    Style["\[FilledUpTriangle]", Bold, Black, {15,15},ShowStringCharacters -> False],                                     "LinkHand"                                     ],                     MouseAppearance[                                     Style["\[FilledDownTriangle]", Bold, Black, {15, 15}, ShowStringCharacters -> False],                                     "LinkHand"                                   ]                            },                           Spacings -> 0,                           Alignment -> Center,                           Background -> RGBColor[0.65, 0.65, 0.65]                          ](*Column is CLosed*)                     },                    BaselinePosition -> Axis                   ];        (*InputField*)        field = Dynamic[Row[{InputField[                                 Dynamic[inputFieldValue],                                 Number,                                 ContinuousAction -> True,                                 ImageSize -> {50, 20},                                 Alignment -> Center                                      ]                             },                             BaselinePosition -> Axis                           ]                        ];      I want to find exact `ImageSizes` of the controls for accurate placement in another grid. I am listing the options that I have with me here. case1:                    Rasterize[markers][[2, 2]]      case2:                   Rasterize[field][[2, 2]]      and also,I arrange this controls in different formats.like, arrange1:                userField = Row[{                 markers,                 field                 },             Frame -> False             ]      arrange2:                    panelRow =                  Panel[Row[{userField, userField, userField, userField, userField,                        userField, userField, userField, userField, userField                          }],                        FrameMargins -> -3, Appearance -> "Frameless"                      ]      case3:                Rasterize[userField][[2, 2]]      case4:               Rasterize[panelRow][[2, 2]]      if you evaluate `case1`,the `ImageSize` is ({9,23}) which is wrong as I have already mentioned `size` of markers is `{15,15}`. Based on the options provided here, I did try to use the `Rasterize` function with no success. My idea is to figure out the `Imagesize` and span them across a layout whose pixel or unit value is 10. Also, if I have an image of an odd dimension, for example, like `ImageSize -> {67, 38}, I want to set my values for the control object to next closest higher multiple of span value, which in the case of my example is {70, 40} so that my control object will not suffer due to insufficient spaces. Yet another option that I did try was to use `Options[markers]` which also does not give me the value of the size of the control objects. Right now, I am putting my control objects into `Pane` with scroll bars to accommodate for different sizes of the control objects without compromising the size or display of the control objects.
