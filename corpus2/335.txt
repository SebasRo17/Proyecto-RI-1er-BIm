There is an example in the `Alignment` documentation (it also appears in the `Grid` documentation):               Grid[{{Graphics[Rectangle[], ImageSize -> 20],         Graphics[Rectangle[], ImageSize -> 30]}, {Graphics[Rectangle[],          ImageSize -> 40], Graphics[Rectangle[], ImageSize -> 50]}},       Alignment -> {{Right, Left}, {Bottom, Top}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fH8Dr.png) The `Alignment` documentation indicates that numbers can be used for the alignment. Therefore the example above should be able to be re-written as               Grid[{{Graphics[Rectangle[], ImageSize -> 20],         Graphics[Rectangle[], ImageSize -> 30]}, {Graphics[Rectangle[],          ImageSize -> 40], Graphics[Rectangle[], ImageSize -> 50]}},       Alignment -> {{1, -1}, {-1, 1}}]      However this has no effect: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/70XD4.png) So what is the correct way to use numbers for `Alignment`?
