I'm trying to get the following simple code to work. (The code is just supposed to graph the norm of the second derivative of a vector function).               z[t_] = {1, t^2, t^3}     Plot[D[D[Norm[z[t]], t], t], {t, 0, 5}]      Nothing appears on the graph, and I get errors like "General::ivar: ... is not a valid variable". I read that these errors can be avoided if one uses the Evaluate command:               Plot[Evaluate[D[D[Norm[z[t]], t], t]], {t, 0, 5}]      This code doesn't result in any errors, but nothing appears in the plot. Interestingly, the code that reverses the order of operations and graphs the second derivative of the norm works fine:               Plot[ Evaluate[Norm[D[D[z[t], t], t]]], {t, 0, 5}]      I tried using DiscretePlot as well, but that didn't help. What am I doing wrong? I suspect the problem somehow relates to evaluation, but I can't figure it out. Thanks in advance for any help!
