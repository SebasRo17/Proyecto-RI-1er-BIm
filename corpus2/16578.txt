> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Computing and plotting a spectrogram in Mathematica I have a notebook that reads in some time-series data and calculates a spectrogram of it using Mathematica 9.0's spectrogram function. This makes a 2D color contour plot of frequency vs. time (colors give the amplitude function). I would like to extend this to a 3D spectrogram plot [for example, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spectrogram.png]. The necessary data is already in the existing spectrogram function, but how do I pass this to something like Plot3D to get a 3D plot of amplitude vs. frequency and time?
