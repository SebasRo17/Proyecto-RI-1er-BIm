I'm a junior developer and am trying to learn by reading open source code (AutoMapper). My approach would be to first understand the requirements of the software/feature. Then look for specifics on how each requirements were implemented and dive deeper into the code until I've reached the end. I would reiterate until I've covered each requirement. I understand my question does not have a "best" answer. Please give me some input on what works for you guys. Thanks!
