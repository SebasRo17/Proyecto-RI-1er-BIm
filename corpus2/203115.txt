I just finished the data structures and algorithms course in school , I took it during the summer so 6wks course vs a 16 wk course during the regular semester. So not only was the course hard but it was really really really fast. My question is what do I need to know about data structures in the real world? I understand what they do and how they work, for the most part, but I had a real tough time coding them , I wouldn't be able to write the code for a binary tree class or a balanced tree class from scratch .... Is that bad? should I retake it , or is knowledge of how they work sufficient, without being able to write the classes from scratch?
