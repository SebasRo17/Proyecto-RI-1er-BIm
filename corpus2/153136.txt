This Scenario: User copies large files to a local folder. I want to watch that folder and when a new file is dropped then go and copy it to Database, so later when coping is done I can actually use it in my application. ( A C# WinForms App). It would be awesome to also find a way to somehow get notified in the Application that hey copying the file to DB is finished and ready for use... I am using C#.net, Windows... What solutions/architecture do you suggest for this? For example having a windows service running all the time watching that folder, when something copied goes and write it to DB ... then how about getting notified? MSMQ is something I can use? don't know much about it yet. Thanks.
