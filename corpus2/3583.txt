Consider the function               f[x_] := x Sin[Pi/x]      I want to prove that this function is increasing for $x\ge 1$. This can be done with the first derivative. We have to prove that $f'[x]\ge 0$ for $x\ge 1$. First I tried               FullSimplify[f'[x] >= 0, x >= 1]     (*Out: x Sin[\[Pi]/x] >= \[Pi] Cos[\[Pi]/x] *)      Then I realized that Mathematica probably doesn't know about the inequality $\tan(x)>x$ for $0<x<\pi/2$. So I tried:               FullSimplify[f'[x] >= 0, x >= 1 && ForAll[y, 0 < y < Pi/2, Tan[y] > y]]     (*Out: x Sin[\[Pi]/x] >= \[Pi] Cos[\[Pi]/x] *)      This inequality seems to be easy, I tried replacing `x >= 1` with `x >= Pi` and I get the same result. How can I properly use Mathematica to prove some theorems like this one? EDIT: The main point of the problem is not trying to prove that the function is increasing (that is the motivation of the problem) , the main point is trying to prove that $x\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})\ge\pi \cos(\frac{\pi}{x})$ for $x\ge 1$ using that $\tan(x)>x$ for $0<x<\pi/2$, i.e. i want to use the proving features of Mathematica.
