I have been developing applications (mostly web-based) for almost 10 years now and have learnt pretty much everything I know through experience (and the internet!). I wouldn't call myself an advanced programmer, but I am quite proficient in several languages (C#, Javascript, Ruby, HTML/CSS etc) and spend a quite a bit of time working on personal projects and reading countless books & articles. I am looking to emigrate to Canada, hopefully Vancouver (im from the UK) and one way would be on a student visa, if I was going to be studying for a minimum of 2 years. Having never been to university or achieved anything higher than A-Levels I am quite tempted by this path. The thought of learning is more exciting to me now than it was 10 years ago! What would be people recommend as a good undergraduate course to take that would complement this career path? Would Math be beneficial, if so which area of Math? TL;DR What undergraduate course/area of study would complement 10 years of (mostly web-based) programming experience?
