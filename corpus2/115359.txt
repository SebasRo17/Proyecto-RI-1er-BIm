> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is there a list of common usernames to reserve in a new system? I'm working on a site where users will have a custom URL e.g.: http://domain.com/username I want to avoid the situation where a user registers and creates a username that I later need, e.g. if I want a page at domain.com/about and someone's already named themselves 'about'. Does anyone have a list of generic words that could be added to a blacklist for this?
