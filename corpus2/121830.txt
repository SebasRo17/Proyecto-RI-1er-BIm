I just started with functional programming (with JavaScript and Node.js) and from the look of things it looks as if the code I am writing would grow to be one hell of a code base to manage, when compared to programming languages that have a sort of object oriented paradigm. With OOP I am familiar with practices that would ensure your code is easily managed and extensible. But am nore sure of similar convention with functional programming.
