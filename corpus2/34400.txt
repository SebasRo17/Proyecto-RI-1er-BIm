One of my cells contains some Text and Input:               some text 3+5,      so the expression underlying this looks like               Cell[  TextData[{          "some text ",          StyleBox["3+5", "Output"]             }],   "Text"]      I now wish to select only the "3+5", using commands, as to be able to evaluate that part _in place_ , as if one uses the command "Evaluate in Place" of the Evaluation menu (and using the notebook end to manually select 3+5). I've tried using Cases[ ... , StyleBox[__]], but this gives an empty set. What am I missing here? Once again, thanks for all help!
