I have only heard the term "design pattern" being used for object oriented code, and the GoF patterns include only OOP design patterns, but design patterns are elegant solutions for commonly occuring programming problems, right? There is nothing in there saying that they must be limited to OOP, is there? I would like to see some examples of design patterns _outside_ the realm of object oriented programming. Do you have any? Do such even exist (no book, like the GoF book, must necessarily have been written, they should just be used; that is enough)? They can be specific to some programming language(s), but general (paradigm- level) patterns are preferred, of other paradigms than the object oriented one.
