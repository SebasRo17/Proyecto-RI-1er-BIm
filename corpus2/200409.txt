I understand all the advantages of Daily Scrum and my team does it when we are working on stories. But sometimes we just have bugs to fix for days, while we're waiting for new stories, and when this happen we put daily scrum aside. Some of developers says that "There's no need to do a Daily Scrum when we have nothing to discuss". I don't know if a Daily Scrum when we don't have any new story to develop is necessary. Is there anything interesting we can do on a daily scrum when we just have bugs to fix?
