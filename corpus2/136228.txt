I'm independently developing a physics-based game using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript; I've used no external code at all (including physics or game engines), and my code is about 5000 lines in length. The development is almost complete, and now I want to release it. I am planning to release the game as a paid app on the Chrome, Android, and Apple app stores, but I also want to release the code under an open source license - one which allows free reading and gleaning of ideas from my code, but does not allow more than a couple lines to be copied. Basically I want people who know where to look and how to use to find free code, and the general public to buy it, while preventing piracy or the development of a near copy. Is this possible with an open source license? What license should I use?
