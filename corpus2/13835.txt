Given that $$X = \\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 |\, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2(xy + xz + yz) = k\\}\,,$$ where $k$ is a constant. Also given that a group $G$ is represented by $$\langle g_1,g_2,g_3|\, g_1^2 = g_2^2 = g_3^2 = 1_G\rangle\,.$$ $G$ acts on $X$ such that $$g_1 \cdot (x,y,z) = (2(y+z) - x,y,z)\,,$$ $$g_2 \cdot (x,y,z) = (x,2(x+z)-y,z)$$ and $$g_3 \cdot (x,y,z) = (x,y,2(x+y)-z)\,.$$ So given $(x_0,y_0,z_0) \in X$, how do I go about plotting the orbit of the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, ie $$\\{g \cdot (x_0,y_0,z_0) \,|\, g \in G\\}\,,$$ on a 3D graph? Would `ListPointPlot3D` be useful to plot all the points? How about other plotting functions?
