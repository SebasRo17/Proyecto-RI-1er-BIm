Our department has been hit by some layoffs over the past year and we're running a skeleton crew. They got rid of most of our support staff. The remaining team members would rather worry about what others are doing rather than work as a team and figure out how to improve their own situations. The one co-worker (who does network administration) spends long hours in the office. Part of it is due to the workload but another part of it is due to bad time management (his own fault and management). He'll walk past my desk and make snide remarks like "working hard?" and "do something". If I offer to help, he acts like he doesn't need it. He's kind of the insecure type and likes to do everything himself and then hold it over everyone else. I'm afraid he might end up burning out. Another guy has been bitching about his workload. He spends as much time worrying about what others are doing than getting stuff done himself. He thinks he's too good for "grunt work" and wants to be a manager. When his plate is full, he makes sure everyone else knows it when he has to do get stuff done. They're not bad guys but the stress seems to be getting to everyone. I'm the only one left who knows how to code so a lot of time is spent on programming projects but also have support duties. I can't get a whole lot done due to the interruptions. The guys in the office don't consider what I'm doing to be "work"....and seem to think that I should be helping them with support and not programming. So basically they think I'm supposed to work on IT support and then go back to the office to work on programming projects while they surf the internet. I don't whine and moan and complain like everyone else does so they assume that I don't have enough to do. So now I get to listen to snide remarks about my workload. Management likes my projects because they save the company money. What is the best way to deal with this situation?
