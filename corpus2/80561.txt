I'm reading a book that has a section about processes. In it is this sentence: > The next method to enumerate processes is the `GetProcessById` method. This > method does exactly what its name implies: it will take a process ID and > return information about it if it's found. This doesn't sound right to me. Google dictionary has this as a definition > Enumerate - Mention (a number of things) one by one - for ex. "there is not > space to enumerate all his works". I think of enumerate as exactly that, "mentioning", but in the context of walking through a list. If you are getting something by ID, that doesn't sound like "enumerating", that sounds like "retrieving". Am I wrong? Should I broaden my sense of "enumerate"?
