I am designing an API which mostly involves refactoring the original code. So Right now I have a method which has two big chunks which are seperated by an If-else condition, which in my opinion is not exactly the best idea. The code looks like               do_something():          if (isTrue):              #Large block of statements.          else:              #another large block of statements.      The reason I have them both under a single function is because both the chunks do the same thing but with some slight variations, which introduces the ugly if-else block. I wanted to know what would be the best idea to refactor this code in a better way, if it is possible to do that using OOP, that would be even better. I am not going with the obvious defining two methods way because at the moment both the chunks are doing the same thing.
