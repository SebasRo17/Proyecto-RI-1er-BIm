I'm writing a brief for a new starter at the company.   I've pointed out the aims of what I want to achieve and now I'm writing some suggested (but not concrete) solutions. For each of the aims, I'd like to suggest a fast, dirty method, and a slower, but more robust solution. I don't mean 'dirty' as in uncommented and untabbed code, but simply as in faster, hackishy code. I'm happy that the new starter takes whichever pathway they feel are necessary, and I feel my use of the word 'dirty' is going to put them off that particular solution. They're probably going to try to impress the management, and I don't want the 'dirty' solution to be a turn-off if that's what they're most comfortable with. Can you help me decide on a slightly better terminology than dirty? I aim to contrast between the hacky/fast solution (which is still valid) and a more robust, scalable solution. For a project as trivial as the one we're producing, then either method will be accepted.
