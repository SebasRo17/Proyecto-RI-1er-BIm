Can someone confirm good performance using PHP + Java webservice (for heavy duty tasks) running on NGINX (or Apache) because PHP is slow in completing some heavy tasks and I want to make a web service in java to communicate with PHP via SOAP or REAT or JSON. The fact I'm asking this question is that I already know PHP at a very good level (and Java and I don't want to start learning ASP or Ruby) and HTML5, CSS3 and I want to develop a big portal that will have increased number of requests (1000 / 2000 request/sec) **and I don't want to code the whole application in Java** (cause PHP has more sense), I only need the heavy work to be done by a webservice. **For my project PHP is slow in doing some Math computation and I/O file access every second. It consume a lot of memory and a lot of CPU. At the rate of 1000 req/s it almost crushes.** Is this a good practice? Is there another solution?
