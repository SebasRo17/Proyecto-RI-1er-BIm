I my c# program I have to perform 5 steps(tasks) sequentially. basically these five should execute one after the other only the previous task performed is success. Currently I have done it in following style. But this is not very good code style to follow.               var isSuccess=false;     isSuccess=a.method1();          if(isSuccess)         isSuccess=a.method2();          if(isSuccess)         isSuccess=a.method3();          if(isSuccess)         isSuccess=a.method4();          if(isSuccess)         isSuccess=a.method5();      How can I re factor this code. What is the best way I can follow?
