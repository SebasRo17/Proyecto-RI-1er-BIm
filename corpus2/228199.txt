In an attempt to solve one problem I encountered another. I would like to have an easy and memorable way of creating unique error numbers, across projects and across developers. The scheme I came up with was to use the initials of the developer, find their position in the alphabet, and append the date and time. Example: lets say the developer Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (initials MEZ) writes code that throws an exception on Feb 8th 2014 at 12:54AM. The error code would be: 8526020820140054 This works brilliantly on 64 bit machines, but the resulting integer is too large for 32 bit computers. Does that make this a bad idea? How common are 32 bit servers, and do we expect them to slowly disappear completely?
