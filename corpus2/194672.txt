We have several years of customer data that has been collected over time. I'd guess that 95% of the data (Names, Business Names & Addresses) is in all UPPERCASE format. The data entry tool used within our organization offers an "Export as Proper Case" function. We do not have the ability to modify this data import function. It's an all or nothing switch. We flipped this switch on in January 2013 and since then have discovered numerous data abnormalities:               Original Data          Proper Case Import     -------------          ------------------     McDonald               Mcdonald     MacDonald              Macdonald      O'Neil                 O'neil     My First LLC           My First Llc     my.email@test.com      My.Email@Test.Com     John Smith III         John Smith Iii      Our data is stored within a closed environment on an iSeries. We have a web interface that allows for single record changes to the data. Unfortunately I do not have the ability to run an update database query to update our data and make mass changes. What are the **Best Practices** that you have adopted within your organization with regard to maintaining Proper Case Data vs UPPERCASE Data? I've got two or three people in the organization that are pushing for Proper Case data on the system. The majority of other people want UPPERCASE data on the system. I'm trying to put together a presentation that states how unrealistic it is to move to a total Proper Case data environment. What are some good talking points or arguments that support all UPPERCASE data?
