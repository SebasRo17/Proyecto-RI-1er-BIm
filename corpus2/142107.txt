This syntax will be used inside HTML attributes. Here are a few examples of what I have so far:               <input name="a" conditions="!b, c" />     <input name="b" />     <input name="c" />      This will make input "a" do something if `b` is not checked and `c` is checked (b and c are assumed to be checkboxes if they don't have a `:value` defined) * * *               <input name="a" conditions="!b:foo|bar, c:foo" />     <input name="b" />     <input name="c" />      This will make input "a" do something if `b`doesn't have `foo` or `bar` values, and if `c` has the `foo` value. * * *               <input name="a" conditions="!b:EMPTY" />     <input name="b" />      Makes input "a" do something if `b` has a value assigned. * * * So, essentially `,` acts as logical AND, `:` as equals (=), `!` as NOT, and `|` as OR. The `|` (OR) is only needed between values (at least I think so), and AND is not needed between values for obvious reasons :) `EMPTY` means empty value, like `<input value="" />` Do you have any suggestions on improving this syntax, like making it more human friendly? For example I think the "EMPTY" keyword is not really appropriate and should be replaced with a character, but I don't know which one to choose.
