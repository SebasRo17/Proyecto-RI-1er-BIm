Looking for a way to create an `ErrorListPlot` `(x,y,error)` with the radius of the `PlotMarker` determined by the magnitude of the error (which in my case is symmetrical), no actual error bars desired. I want the size of the points to reflect the standard deviation of the datum, rather than `Small,`Large`or any`AbsolutePointSize` values. I can probably approach this a variety of ways (`BubbleChart`, `ListPlot` with custom `PlotMarkers`, or `ErrorListPlot` with custom `ErrorBarFunction`) but I can't make progress. All of my efforts are being foiled by the relative scaling of `PlotMarkers` to the width of the plot, rather than the magnitude of the data values.
