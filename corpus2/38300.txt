So I am completely new to Mathematica, so sorry if this is a dumb question. I have a set of 3 coupled nonlinear differential equations. They are (a,b,c,D,L constants): $$mx''=Dx'\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2+z'^2}+L(az'-by')$$ $$my''=Dy'\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2+z'^2}+L(bx'-cz')$$ $$mz''=Dz'\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2+z'^2}+L(cy'-ax')$$ And I have initial conditions for $x,y,z,x',y',z'$ Will I be able to solve this for x,y,z? Any help is appreciated!
