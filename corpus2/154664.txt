I am attending a Computer graphics course after the summer. I have read lots of good things about the book "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice in C" for people who are willing to put in some work. My school does not focus on C/C++ until next year, so I have decided to learn Python this summer and get good at Python this following year. How language dependent is this book? Can I work through it in Python?
