I have some function which take `List` as input.               f[l_List]:=someActions[l]      I need apply this function to a list of lists. Now I use this approach               lst = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};     f /@ lst     (*{someActions[{1, 2}], someActions[{3, 4}]}*)      But as we know `Map` over list is slower than using function with attribute `Listable`. When I set attribute `Listable` to my function I get not expected result:               SetAttributes[f, Listable]     f[lst]     (*{{f[1], f[2]}, {f[3], f[4]}}*)      How can I use attribute `Listable` with function which take a list of lists as input?
