Recently I went to an interview for a C development position. Instead of asking me questions, they just gave me 20 code snippets to find out two logical errors on each one. I just couldn't complete all of the 20 since it took me time to go through each of these code snippets. My question is: Is this the right way to judge a candidate? If yes, how can I improve over my error detection skills so that I don't need to waste a lot of time in the next interview? If possible, please, suggest me some links where I could find lots of samples of such questions (mainly in C). Thanks and regards, Maddy
