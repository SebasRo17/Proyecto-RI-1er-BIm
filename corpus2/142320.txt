I'm working on Language level interfaces to web API's. These libraries are of course built around existing HTTP Request/Reply interfaces. I see myself as having a few options submit method on the request object e.g               my $req = Request->new( ... );          my $response = $req->submit; # returns response          my $res2     = $req->submit; # sends the same request again      lazy request accessor               my $req = Request->new( ... );          my $response = $req->response; # returns a reference to the response          my $res2     = $req->response; # doesn't send again, just returns the reference          $req->clear_response;          # clears the response value          my $res3     = $req->response; # sends again because no response exists      These are the 2 options I'm thinking of. I have seen more examples of the former but I'm not sure if there's a reason why. Do you have any preferences on which style interface? or are there other ways I'm not thinking of? Overall I'm trying to discern what the best API is to retrieve the response.
