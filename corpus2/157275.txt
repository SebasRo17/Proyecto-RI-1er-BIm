So I read up on the ordering of your includes, and this guy suggested you include your local header first so as to make sure it doesn't have prerequisites. Ok, I get that. I'm on board. The whole compartmentalization thing is good. But I've got this file, file.c which includes it's `file.h`, which declares functions to save files. Which passes around the `FILE*` type used by `fopen` and friends. If I include `file.h` before I include `stdio.h` then there's an obvious parsing error when it's building `file.h` because it doesn't know about the `FILE*` type. I know I've got to be missing something dirt simple, but I can formulate this into something google can use. Should I be doing something different in `file.h`? Is this simply something that needs to be included in a specific order? Thoughts?
