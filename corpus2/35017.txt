I have to optimize some contrained functions and I am trying to use `NMaximize`. I have the following problem (see code below). I use `NMaximize` for the first function `f1` (constraints `c1` and variables with start intervals `vs1`) and get what I want to get. After that I use `NMaximize` for the function `f2` (with `c2` and `vs2`). After this second numerical optimization I run again the very same optimization for `f1` again and get a different result although I have not changed the start intervals. Could you please explain this? The only way I have found to solve this, is to restart everything with `Quit` but maybe you know an easier way to restart only the command `NMaximize`. I have also tried to set the `Method` for all optimizations but it does not make any difference, the results still vary.               f1 = 1445250/(13229 - 4223 Sqrt[30] (v1 + v2));     c1 = Sqrt[30] + 30 v1 >= 0 && Sqrt[30] + 30 v2 >= 0 &&         Sqrt[30] + 30 v3 >= 0 &&         2 + 45 v2 v3 + 45 v1 (v2 + v3) >= 2 Sqrt[30] (v1 + v2 + v3) &&         v1 + v2 + v3 <= Sqrt[(2/15)];     vs1 = {{v1, 0, 0.01}, {v2, 0, 0.01}, {v3, 0, 0.01}};          f2 = 1445250/(13229 - 8446 Sqrt[30] v1);     c2 = 45 v1 <= Sqrt[30] && Sqrt[30] + 30 v1 >= 0;     vs2 = {{v1, 0, 0.01}};          NMaximize[{f1, c1}, vs1]     NMaximize[{f2, c2}, vs2]     NMaximize[{f1, c1}, vs1]          Out[8]= {190.206, {v1 -> 0.121716, v2 -> 0.121716, v3 -> -0.0111781}}     Out[9]= {190.206, {v1 -> 0.121716}}     During evaluation of In[1]:= NMaximize::cvmit: Failed to converge      to the requested accuracy or precision within 100 iterations. >>     Out[10]= {190.253, {v1 -> 0.121759, v2 -> 0.121754, v3 -> -0.0111782}}
