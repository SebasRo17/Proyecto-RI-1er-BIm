From what I've learned last term on SWE courses, a big part of it is writing documents, so it seems that a software requirements specification (SRS) should earn points for my end-of-course project. However, I will be more comfortable if I use prototyping, i.e., I make a small thing that works for the most trivial of situations and gradually add up features and improvements. LVS 68:1996 doesn't seem to recommend mixing these two things together. Is it possible to still maintain my preferred approach to development, and have some usable requirement specification document?
