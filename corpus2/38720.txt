Is there any way to have the same syntax coloring with `SyntaxInformation` that `Block` has?               SyntaxInformation[func] = {"ArgumentsPattern" -> {{__}, _},                             "LocalVariables" -> {"Solve", {1, Infinity}}};     func[vars : {__}, body_] := {};      After evaluating the above definition, the following two lines have different coloring:               func[{parameter, variable, constant = 0}, parameter + variable + constant]          Block[{parameter, variable, constant = 0}, parameter + variable + constant]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CsS5y.png) As you can notice, any local variable with an initial value is not highlighted as local. I use the default syntax coloring, no changes were applied. `SyntaxInformation` accepts the following values: `{"Table", "Solve", "Integrate", "Limit", "Plot", "Manipulate"}` none of which produces the same behaviour as `Block` does. Perhaps someone knows about an undocumented option value?
