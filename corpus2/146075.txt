The challenge proposed to me as to create a widget to apply in other sites that makes a website compliant with the cookie law[1]. Can I do this without changing server code? I mean, if there's code on server-side that writes an affiliate cookie to the response and my JavaScript widget deletes it after on window.load event: will the site still be cookie law compliant? Then comes the Google Analytics and share buttons cookies. How would I stop those scripts and iframes from being executed in JavaScript?
