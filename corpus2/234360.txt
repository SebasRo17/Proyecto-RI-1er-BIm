We have to class of points `red` and `green`. We create neurone with discrete binary activation function. **How to choose weights so the neurone will return 1 for`red` points?** **How to choose weights so the neurone will return 1 for`green` points?** I am asking for general practice how to decide for which "side" the NET will be greater or equal to 0 -> if I am right about it. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UT1i3.png) NET >= 0 towards red points ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/12Kxe.png) NET >= 0 towards green points
