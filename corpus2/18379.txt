Any tips for a group needing to start code reviews? We have no real software engineering processes currently. I have been working as software engineer for 7 years and have never seen any real processes implemented at the various places I have worked, though many books espouse all kinds of engineering methodologies. The management supports the idea of enabling new processes, though there is some resistance from the senior engineer who has over 20 years of software engineering experience. We are a set of two programmers, with no software engineering manager. We report direct to the managing director of the Company. But we work on numerous software projects. The real reason why we have to begin performing code reviews is because of PA-DSS requirements. Therefore, I am pushing for us to do code reviews all around - not just on the payment application software.
