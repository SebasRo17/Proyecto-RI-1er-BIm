I would like to have rounded ticks in my Mathematica plots. They look much better for thick frames               Plot[ {Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 3 Pi}, Frame -> True, FrameStyle -> Directive[Black, Thick]]      gives ![plot with square tick ends](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AN7Ep.png) but I would like to round them, to get something like ![plot with round tick ends](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F3jUQ.png) There is a function `CapForm["Round"]` but it is not clear how to use it with plots.
