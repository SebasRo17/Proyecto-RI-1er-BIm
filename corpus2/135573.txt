For a mobile, e-commerce site, that follows the client-server model, where all the views are json-ajax calls to return data from a secure service, is it safe to also pass the "checkout" process through an ajax call? The entire site is presented by making json-formatted ajax-calls to the service (which is controlled). If the service will return responses ONLY from the client-server (i.e. lockdown on the IP-range) would that make it secure? Are there other considerations? **EDIT:** JSON-based ajax is to give context to the mobile-site setup. Client-server model is more accurate, where the business logic / authorization is handled via another server. But because it's using JSON-Ajax, the calls are easily read in javascript (or through a http proxy for the transaction). SSL Certificate will be installed. I'm just trying to find out if there are specific security holes to protect against in this setup.
