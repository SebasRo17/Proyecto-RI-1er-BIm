A friend of mine has a developer (possibly the "mad genius" type) that has built a substantial system on which their small business is critically dependent. They'd like to get away from their current guy and replace him with someone more reliable, but the question comes up of how to know that the person they replace him with is a competent developer himself. As a developer, I know what questions _I_ would ask and how to interpret the responses, but how would you advise a company void of development background to go about identifying the ones who know their stuff?
