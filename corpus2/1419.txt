I have a matrix, for example, 5x5 matrix `Partition[Range[25], 5]`. And I am given a list, for example:                {1, 1}, {2, 1}, {3, 1}, {4, 1}, {5, 1}, {5, 2}, {4, 2},       {3, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {3, 3}, {4, 3},       {5, 3}, {5, 4}, {4, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 5}       and I need to trace the path from the element in `(1,1)` to `(2, 1)`, and then from `(2, 1)` to `(3, 1)`, etc., from `(4, 5)` to `(5, 5)` and end there. How can I draw this graphically with an arrow indicating each of the transition?
