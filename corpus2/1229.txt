I would like to generate images such as the four below. That is: some text of different length fit within a `Rectangle[]` using `Graphics[]`. But I don't know how to "go to the next line" at the edge of the `Rectangle[]`. The text could either be a random length of "Lorem Ipsum" or alternatively some random text. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hYJT3.png) **EDIT** Provided kguler figured out my plan, here it is : I need to fit the text as below. I have yet not been able to place any solution well in my Graphics[], code below. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T3PdA.png)               c0 = {RGBColor[23/85, 29/255, 142/255], RGBColor[244/255, 1, 59/255],            RGBColor[1, 0, 32/85], RGBColor[18/85, 72/85, 197/255]}               Graphics[{       EdgeForm[Thickness[.005]], White,       Rectangle[{0, 0}, {160, 90}],       Black, Opacity[.7],       Rectangle[{0, 0}, {80, 63}],       Opacity[1],       Flatten@({Flatten@(Table[            RandomChoice[{GrayLevel[.15], c0[[#]]}], {3}] & /@           Range[2, 4, 1]),       MapThread[        Function[{Xs, Ys},         Rectangle[{Xs, Ys}, {Xs + 16, Ys + 9}]],        {Flatten@Table[Range[0, 32, 16], {3}],          Flatten@(Table[#, {3}] & /@             Range[63, 81, 9])}]}\[Transpose]),       Black, Thickness[.005], Line[{{0, 63}, {159, 63}}]},        Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True},       ImageSize -> 500]
