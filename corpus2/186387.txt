When using a MVC pattern for server side code (in my case django), the model definition is defined once in the model component. When using a client side MVC based library(in my case backbone) the model definition or some subset is **redefined**. If I were to make a change to my server side model definition, let's say add a field to a model, then I would have to make a similar model change to my client side model definition to include that new field. Is this a violation of the DRY principle? Should server side model definitions auto-generate client side javascript based model definitions or is this an acceptable violation of the DRY principle?
