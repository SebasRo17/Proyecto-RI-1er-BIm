I am not sure how to specify my datatype as datetime or timestamp, I think I will need both of them but on the different events. My website sells products and services worldwide and also have an account system for user to login. Please clarify the following:   * Current date and time customer buys products from my website: Datetime?   * Delivery date and time based on their location and date/time purchased, calculated from our system: Datetime?   * Last time they logged-in on their account: Timestamp?     1. What is the code in php to store purchasing date (current date) and then store in the database?     2. Please elaborate how to use each of them as after reading plenty of explanation on the internet, I still don't quite get it.
