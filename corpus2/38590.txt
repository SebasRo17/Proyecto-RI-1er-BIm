I am 15 year old student looking to buy his first car and thought I could earn some extra money by learning to program since I like messing around with the computer all the time. I have been reading a lot of the posts here and have come up with a list of books I think would be beneficial to me, however, I do not know which information is most important to know first or if I have everything I will need. Here is what I was thinking: 1: Learn a programming language in depth. I am about 1/2 way done with the Step-by-Step book 2\. Learn about object oriented design and design patterns 3\. Learn about software testing 4\. Go practice these skills on websites like projecteuler, topcoder, and try and do simple projects on freelance websites like rent-a-coder. Is there anything else you think I may need or should look into? Thank you.
