The `string` type is immutable. We can use the `const` keyword with `strings` in high level language like .NET. My understanding of 'const' means constant (it remains the same, we can't change the value). Are `strings` not always `constant` (IMO the term `constant` should not be applicable in the same context if the type has to be recreated each time it means for the values life time, it was constant)? In high level languages, specifically .NET (although I'd be interested in Java too), is this due to general memory management/tracking of objects or is there another reason?
