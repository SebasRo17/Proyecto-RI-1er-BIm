How can I export a table to Excel - to specific cells, e.g. D1-E2? Background: I want to compare results, and it's easier to have the results on one spreadsheet. I'm using _Mathematica_ 6. This is my notebook so far:               ResultsV = Grid[{  {"result1", result1},  {"result2", result2}}]      Export["results.pdf", ResultsV]      This table should appear twice in the spreadsheet, as some parameters differ. Thanks a lot!
