I have a list of members of a team, and I want to create a visualization on a world map. I want to plot them on a map, to see some clustering. The fields are: `Person Name`, `City`, `State`, `Country` City and State may be blank. I'm envisioning using color intensity on the country to reflect how many of the members are on a given country, plus a circle on the cities, with circle size proportional to the count of people on that city. Appreciate any help from the Mathematica experts on this forum, as my last usage of Mathematica is quite dated (v4 or 5) Thanks! * * * **EDIT** The fields I was referring to on the original question are on a spreadsheet. After I started trying to work out a solution, I settled on the following format:               a = {{{"","","India"},25},{{"","","China"},22},{{"New York ", "NY", "United States"},     10}, {{"San Francisco ", "CA", "United States"},      8}, {{"Boston  ", "MA", "United States"}, 4}, {{"Arlington", "MA", "United States"},      2}, {{"Arlington", "VA", "United States"}, 1}, {{"Cambridge", "MA", "United States"},      1}, {{"Needham", "MA", "United States"}, 1}, {{"Acton", "MA", "United States"},      1}, {{"Brooklyn", "NY", "United States"}, 1}, {{"Los Altos", "CA", "United States"},      1}, {{"Miami", "FL", "United States"}, 1}}      As you can see, some records will come with a blank city and state, only country.
