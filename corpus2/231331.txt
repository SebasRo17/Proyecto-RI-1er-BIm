What are differences between Enumeration and Iterator This question is from early ages of interview , I have not seen this question on recent interviews but it was in 2012, now days questions like implementation of HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap etc has take its place, nonetheless its very useful to know fundamental difference between Iterator and Enumeration. Some time its also asked as Iterator vs Enumeration or Enumeration vs Iterator which is same. important point to note is that both Iterator and Enumeration provides way to traverse or navigate through entire collection in java
