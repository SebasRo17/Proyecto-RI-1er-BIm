Each time I see a question posted on Stack Overflow on C#, I see at least one or two answers posted that solve a problem with LINQ. Usually people with very high reputation seem to use LINQ like pros. So my question is, **what problem domain is LINQ supposed to be used for?** Also on side notes: Are there any purposes in which it should be avoided? Does the size of dataset affect the performance of LINQ queries?
