I have a table with data, for example               MT = {{1, 80.3, 1, 4, 68}, {2, 80.5, 1, 5.5, 102}, {3, 80.0, 0, 4.2,          78}, {4, 80.4, 0, 3, 17}, {5, 80.2, 1, 5, 180}};      I can plot column 1 against column 2 with               L1 = Table[MT[[i, 1]], {i, 1, 5}];     L2 = Table[MT[[i, 2]], {i, 1, 5}];     ListPlot[Table[{L1[[i]], L2[[i]]}, {i, 1, 5}]]      Now I want to do is the following: I want to plot column 1 against column 2 if the entry in column 3 is == 1. (So that only the points of rows 1,2,5 are shown) Does anyone know how to do that? Thanks alot!
