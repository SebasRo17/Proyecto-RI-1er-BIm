I have a problem where I have to change all the Xs in a 2D array into 0s, and I have to calculate the minimum steps (where a single step consists of changing an entire row or column) required to do so. For example, in an array like-               [[X, X, X],          [X, 0, 0],          [X, 0, 0]]      The minimum number of steps required here is 2. I thought of a brute force approach (where I am checking row-wise once and column-wise thence and then comparing them to check which takes minimum number of steps) but that would give me an answer of 3, which is not the desired output. Any help, or clue, regarding how I should approach this problem would be appreciated, thanks!
