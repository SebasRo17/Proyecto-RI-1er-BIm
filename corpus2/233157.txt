Is it possible to determine the creation date of the email supplied with the authentication process flow; Or at least determine that the email was/was not created the same day as signup (or specifically after confirmation)? A use case is to flag such accounts for closer scrutiny as part of a risk management system. What general considerations do you think come into play in approaching this problem? I imagine that solutions might be specific to different email providers but if I could determine this information for the major ones it's a good place to be. Would love specific answers in any language or pseudocode assuming this is solvable within ethical principles. _Disclaimer: I have asked this question on Stackoverflow. Some nice person said that email providers would not allow it for privacy reasons. Completely acceptable, but IMHO I think that the age of an email has little to do with personal privacy. Also there are too many smart people using the stack* forums for me to just lie down and die._
