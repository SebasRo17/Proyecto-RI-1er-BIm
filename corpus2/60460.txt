Well, I have a certain dispute with a colleague of mine. We have a software design where we build all of our widgets server side and send them client side as html. Most of the time it's better and easier to control and add stuff to. But sometimes it just is not that good; it makes the client side act "retarded" regarding the situation at hand. Another major flaw is that it gets really slow for unapparent reasons. So what would you do in this case? **Edit:** When I say "retarded" I mean the client side is not aware of any changes made by the server side, it just gets a string of functions it supposed to call to if something goes wrong with loading one of the resources that is passed from the server side(f.e. an image or another script) the client side is limited when in need to handle the errors. This situations are handled very poorly since the client side does not have a "clear view" of the state at hand. Of course you can handle the situation from the server side(in a twisted way), but then again why bother so much when it is so much more simplified when dividing the rolls.
