I believe learning C is one of the most important aspects for any programmer. It's a beautiful combination of a high and low level language. Some universities are moving to stop teaching C in the introductory stages and are using Python instead. Will this move to Python, from C, degrade the quality of CS students? If you miss out on some of the aspects of a low level language, are you missing something important from you CS degree?
