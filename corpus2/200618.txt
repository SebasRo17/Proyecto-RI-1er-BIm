I'm looking for patterns or architectural guidance for an upcoming feature I'm designing. Basically, it's an export feature with multiple export targets, and I'm looking to find a way to make it generic enough where plugging in new export targets don't require a lot of core changes. By export targets, I'm simply referring to different types of output, whether that be PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, RSS, etc. I have a base set of data, which is represented in JSON and XML. This data are used to construct images (using any number or export types [e.g., PNG, JPG, GIF, etc), graphs, textual representations, tables, and more. I'm trying to find a way to abstract all the rendering and layout into some kind of rendering or layout engine that handles the addition of further export targets. Any help/suggestions/resources as to how to approach this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. For a pictorial representation of what I'm trying to achieve. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aAvE9.png)
