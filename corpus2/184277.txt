I was wondering, there are so many articles about what the best coding languages are. C, C++ Go Haskel lisp java ML F# etc etc. But rarely i see an article about the most human like programming language. It doesn't need to be fast but be closest to the English (or other natural) language. Once it was a goal to create such languages it was seen as a form of AI. But these days AI went a different direction Now there is Siri etc, but those are application not coding languages themselves. Out of curiosity is there still somewhere a language that understand basic English to code with ?
