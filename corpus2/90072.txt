Let's say I have a class that just stores data:               ClassData         Field1         Field2         Field3      Now let's say I have a function that uses Field1 and Field2:               public void DoStuff(string field1, string field2){         if(field1 == "something"){              //Do something         }         if(field2 == "somethingElse"){             //Do something else         }     }      vs               public void DoStuff(ClassData data){         if(data.field1 == "something"){              //Do something         }         if(data.field2 == "somethingElse"){             //Do something else         }     }      It seems like this is a type of "more art than science" type thing, but I have a few thoughts also. Passing specific fields shows you the required information right from the get-go, which can make it easier to read and understand the function. Sending just the data object does have advantages because it makes the code look cleaner. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm missing pros and cons for both and would be interested in hearing what you think. Thanks!
