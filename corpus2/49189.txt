I'm looking for considerations of the questions "Can code be beautiful?" and "What makes code beautiful?" Examples would include:   * This academic paper: Obfuscation, Weird Languages, and Code Aesthetics   * This blog post: Hamon or the Skin Deep Beauty of Code Please note that I'm not trying to start a discussion here, or asking for opinions about what makes code beautiful, or for code you think is beautiful; I'm trying to find stuff that has already been published. Thanks for your help.
