I would like to solve $dx/dt=\sqrt{1 + (I x)^3}$, where x is complex, for some initial condition like $1 - 5 I$ and plot the imaginary part of the solution versus the real part. (A somewhat similar problem was posted earlier in different topic) I have used this code:               s = NDSolve[{x'[t] == (1 +(I x[t])^3)^0.5, x[0] == 1 -5 I}, x[t], {t, 0, 10}];     ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{Re[x[t]], Im[x[t]]} /. s1], {t,0,10}]      and I have tried it for different initial points, the results are not satisfactory. I expect to obtain closed contours for every initial condition in the lower half plane of complex plane, excatly like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U3MD4.png) (As a side and not very important remark x plus, minus and zero are where the square root vanishes) I appreciate if one could help me to fix it! P.S.: Can this problem be due to branch points?
