**Context** In my field of research, many people use the following package: healpix (for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization) which has been ported to a few different languages (F90, C,C++, Octave, Python, IDL, MATLAB, Yorick, to name a few). It is used to operate on the sphere and its tangent space and implements amongst other things fast (possibly spinned) harmonic transform, equal area sampling, etc. In the long run, I feel it would be useful for our community to be able to have this functionality as well. As a starting point, I am interested in producing Mollweide maps in Mathematica. My purpose is to be able to do maps such as ![Mollweide projection of the Milky Way](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BygyL.png) which (for those interested) represents our Milky Way (in purple) on top of the the cosmic microwave background (in red, the afterglow of the Big Bang) seen by the Planck satellite. **Attempt** Thanks to halirutan's head start, this is what I have so far:               cart[{lambda_, phi_}] := With[{theta = fc[phi]}, {2 /Pi*lambda Cos[theta], Sin[theta]}]     fc[phi_] := Block[{theta}, If[Abs[phi] == Pi/2, phi, theta /.       FindRoot[2 theta + Sin[2 theta] == Pi Sin[phi], {theta, phi}]]];      which basically allows me to do plots like               grid = With[{delta = Pi/18/2},                 Table[{lambda, phi}, {phi, -Pi/2, Pi/2, delta}, {lambda, -Pi, Pi, delta}]];     gr1 = Graphics[{AbsoluteThickness[0.05], Line /@ grid, Line /@ Transpose[grid]},                    AspectRatio -> 1/2];     gr0 = Flatten[{gr1[[1, 2]][[Range[9]*4 - 1]],gr1[[1, 3]][[Range[18]*4 - 3]]}] //      Graphics[{AbsoluteThickness[0.2], #}] &;     gr2 = Table[{Hue[t/Pi], Point[{ t , t/2}]}, {t, -Pi, Pi, 1/100}] //      Flatten // Graphics;     gr = Show[{gr1, gr0, gr2}, Axes -> True]      ![initial image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4ue2x.png)               gr /. Line[pts_] :> Line[cart /@ pts] /. Point[pts_] :> Point[cart[ pts]]      and project them to a Mollweide representation ![Mollweide projection of initial image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SurTe.png) **Question** Starting from an image like this one: ![spherical Perlin noise, equirectangular projection](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4xyhd.png) (which some of you will recognize;-)) I would like to produce its Mollweide view. Note that `WorldPlot` has this projection. In the long run, I am wondering how to link (via MathLink?) to existing F90/C routines for fast harmonic transforms available in healpix.
