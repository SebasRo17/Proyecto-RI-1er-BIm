Imagine I have two lists of elements like the following:               listOne = RandomReal[{0,2}, {100,2}];     listTwo = RandomReal[{0,2}, {100,2}];      Let $f: X \to Y$ be a bijection or one-to-one correspondence between the elements in `listOne` and the elements in `listTwo`. I can shuffle the elements in `listOne` as follows:               listOne = RandomSample[listOne, Length[listOne]];      However, is there a way for me to perform the above shuffling operation while preserving the bijection $f$? In other words, can I shuffle the elements in `listOne` and `listTwo` in precisely the same manner?
