In college, teachers often say that some things are bad practices while they are not. I'm referring to the recent Why is naming a table's Primary Key column “Id” considered bad practice? question, or to the fact that my teacher told us that early returns are bad practice and must never be used. There are plenty of other examples everyone who have been in college remembers. Once learned, those things are hard to unlearn. When you deal with an intern who learned something wrong from her teacher, it's not always obvious to explain that the thing the teacher told is either not totally true or sometimes completely wrong. What makes those teachers mistakenly believe that things are bad practices, while in programming industry, most people would disagree with them? Don't they read programming books we, developers, read? Don't they talk frequently to developers?
