I'm not sure if this is an OCD trait or not, but I find that sometimes I get completely blocked unable to continue what I am doing when naming a class (or function, or namespace etc) that I believe is to be used outside of a given project. An API for example. Or a utility class library. If the naming isn't exactly right (in my mind) I just can't continue...I get stuck trying to come up with the right name. I've tried writing little apps that would use it to see what the names look like but that doesn't seem to help... I know it shouldn't matter, and it's against any programming mindset to assume you'd get it perfect first go...I just feel powerless to it... Any tips/ideas would be greatly appreciated...
