I understand that the "mm" suffix [in various GTK-associated C++ binding libraries] _means_ "minus minus," but where exactly does it come from? I understand that there is a _programming language_ called "C--," but if there were bindings (and I'm pretty sure I've seen some), they would be suffixed "--". TL;DR: **Is there some page ongnu.org that explains the "mm" suffix in various C++ bindings or is it just a _de facto_ standard adopted by the open source community with no reasoning behind it?**
