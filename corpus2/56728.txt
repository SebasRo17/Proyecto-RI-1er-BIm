There is documentation of the incompatible changes made to _Mathematica_ with each major release:   * Incompatible Changes since Mathematica Version 1 Unfortunately that documentation simply stopped with version 7. Therefore I ask: ## What incompatible changes have been made since _Mathematica_ 7? There are other questions on the subject but I wish to make this an exhaustive index for easy reference.
