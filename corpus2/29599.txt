My problem is: I would like to activate WholeCellGroupOpener on a cell containing hyperlinks. But when I do that, the hyperlinks are no longer active. Is there a way to change the order of the two, so that 'Hyperlink' is activated before 'WholeCellGroupOpener'. More precisely: I want the cell group to collapse when I click anything but a hyperlink. Does anyone know a way to achieve that?
