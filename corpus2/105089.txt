> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Open Source but not Free Software (or vice versa) I recently was at talk were Stallman was the keynote speaker, and he stated he hated the term open software, because it was geared to confuse people. Now, I have since then read on to understand his stance, but I am unable to draw a line where free software becomes open source, and which licenses can be considered in each group. For example I know that GPL, LGPL are free software licenses, but they are also open source licenses as well. Is there a pure open source license? like MIT license? or is it all shades of grey. Can a line be drawn? Thanks!
