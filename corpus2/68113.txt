I am a fresher. My job is not very demanding of me when it comes to exercising my programming prowess. So, I have started to write code on my own (a simple space invasion program, chat application, etc). I will be completing some of these in a few weeks, but what i am worried about is how I shall get my code evaluated/criticised . I am new and they say it takes years to become a good programmer, so obviously I am making mistakes. But who can tell me what mistakes I am making? The amount of code that I write at my company and gets checked or revised by senior developers is too small to make any significant impact on my career. Please help.
