I created this function:               AddStone[board_Graph, v_, s : white | black | empty] :=         PropertyValue[{board, v}, VertexState] = s      This function should change the VertexState property of vertex `v` in graph `board` to one of `white`, `black`, or `empty`. That's simple enough, right? Then I created a graph:               board = GridGraph[{5, 5}];      But then if I execute:               AddStone[board, 8, white]      I get an error: > "Set::setraw: Cannot assign to raw object PropertyValue[{ ... > ,8},VertexState]=white." where the "..." stands for an image of the graph `board`, which I obviously need not draw here. In the Documentation for `PropertyValue` it is stated that one can set properties this way. In fact, the code               PropertyValue[{board, 4}, VertexState] = white      does work without issuing any messages.
