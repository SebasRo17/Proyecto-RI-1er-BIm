I am having a problem using custom tick specifications along with `AspectRatio -> Full`.   The problem affects both `Ticks` and `FrameTicks`. An example of the problem:               x = MapThread[{#, #2, {0, 0.007}} &, {100 Range@5, {"One","Two","Three","Four","Five"}}];          p = ListPlot[Array[Log, 600], Ticks -> {x}, AspectRatio -> Full, ImageSize -> {250, 250}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tEn1a.png) Giving an explicit AspectRatio produces the output I desire:               Show[p, AspectRatio -> 1]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zyqiS.png) A plot without the custom ticks is not distorted:               Show[p, Ticks -> Automatic]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4kekp.png) I wish to understand what is causing the problem and find a way to work around it _besides_ specifying a numeric AspectRatio. I could add a routine to calculate the aspect ratio from the image size but I would rather find a way to make `AspectRatio -> Full` work as intended.
