I have a very basic game loop whose primary purpose is to check for updates & changes to a list. I have contemplated using event driven programming to replace the game loop/list idea with an ObservableCollection, however I just have this big cloud of doubt on event driven programming. I'm posing these questions to those with experience with event driven programming:   1. What are good ways to test & build an event driven programming design?  That is, how will I know that I cannot run into "a sequence of unfortunate events"? I want to avoid the events I didn't plan for.   2. Are there unit tests schemes to test event driven programming? Because I have little reputation at the time of asking this question, I can't post more than two links: Observable collections are found at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms668604.aspx
