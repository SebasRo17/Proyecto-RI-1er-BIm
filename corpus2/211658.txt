I am just learning computer networks so please forgive me if this question is naive. I know the TCP protocol binds itself to a port till the transfer of messages is over (port 80) and UDP is best effort (ie no binding). My question is if I try and access two websites at the same time (multiple tabs on my browser), assuming both websites are web servers, my questions are   1. Does my computer communicate with one webservice (website) first and then communicate with the other (serially). Also if this is the case is the time difference so small that I feel it loads simultaneously?   2. Suppose I have my own web server (tomcat) running on port 80, how can I communicate with other websites if it happens on the same port?   3. Do websites decide which protocol to use TCP or UDP?
