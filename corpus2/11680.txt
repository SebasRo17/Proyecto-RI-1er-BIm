This is related, but I'm thinking about something more like a chastity belt for keeping me from checking programmers.SE or my email every time I compile. Rather advice like "go take a walk and you'll feel more like coding", I just need something to augment my weak constitution - a net nanny for my geek fetish I guess. I'll take my answer off the air and I promise not to check programmers.SE for at least a day.
