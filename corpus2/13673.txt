Not sure if I asked this at the right place (it's development related). It would be great if you can direct me to the right place if I did ask in the wrong place. I was encouraged by hosts during some company tours to participate in the open-source software community if interested in software. The reasons include showing initiative to contribute useful components to a project while others can evaluate the quality of your design and coding practices. However, other than case studies of CUSP being bought out by Apple Inc., I can't think of other case studies showing the trend of interesting opportunities being attracted over the long term. Do you have any high-profile projects fitting this criteria that comes to your mind? Appreciate it in advance for your suggestions!
