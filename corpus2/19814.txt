In the document of FullGraphics, it promise to produce the same graphic result as the input one:               "FullGraphics[g] should display the same as g, though it may have a different internal structure."      but it has problem in the ticks and axes as the follow example, as they are too thin and the ticks position aren't the same as the original one.               g = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}]     Show[FullGraphics[g], AspectRatio -> 1/GoldenRatio]      I have two question:   1. What is the mechanism of axes, tick etc, why they are treated different from the graphics primitives in MMA? Could you explain how MMA convert the axes, ticks etc into the graphics primitives?   2. Is there any "easy" solution to make FullGraphics to reproduce the same result as the input image, or even write one's own version of FullGraphics? Thanks. Sorry I'm a novice and I can't post the figure.
