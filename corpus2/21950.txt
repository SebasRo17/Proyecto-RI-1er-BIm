I am trying to draw some graphics with _Mathematica_. The objects I want to draw are just a little bit more complex than a cuboid -- the difference being that the top and bottom faces are of different depth. Below are two examples of the objects I would like to draw.               p01 = RegionPlot3D[ y <= 1 - 0.5 z, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1},        Mesh -> None]          p02 = RegionPlot3D[        y <= 0.5 + 0.5 (z - 1), {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 1, 2},        Mesh -> None]       It would be great if I could make these objects using 3-D graphics primitives found in _Mathematica_. Then I would be able to make 3-D graphics, placing the objects in relation to one another. Below is an example of what I would like to do, basically creating a set of these 6-faced objects and stacking them in relation to one another.               cubeA = Cuboid[{0, 0, 0}, {1, 0.5, 1}];          cubeB =  Cuboid[{0, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 2}];          Graphics3D[{cubeA, cubeB}]      The example above uses the built-in `Cuboid` object. The objects I would like to make are (only so slightly) more complex than this. I can create the geometry I am interested in with RegionPlot3D, but I cannot easily combine these. For example, the following fails:               Graphics3D[{p01, p02}]      I tried to do this with Polygon function, but couldn't quite determine how to extend the examples provided to making a 6-faced objects. Any recommendations or suggestions would be welcome. Thanks.
