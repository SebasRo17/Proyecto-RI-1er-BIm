Well, forgive me if it is an off-topic question. I have no knowledge about web programming, so I apologize in advance, if it is a stupid question. I will start to build a web based application. To be more specific, I will make a webpage which will have components like buttons, textboxes and etc. It will use a database to store information. My question is, which one is better to learn for that purpose? Python's Django or Delphi's IntraWeb? I know both Delphi and Python(although I know Delphi better).
