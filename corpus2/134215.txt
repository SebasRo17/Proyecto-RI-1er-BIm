Where previously there was only relational databases, the data store world is now rife with options like Key-Value, Document, and Graph datastores. Unfortunately, every datastore likes to show how it can be used for _anything_ , but none of them really help people figure out when to use one model over another. So, the question is: **What "things" are graph datastores better at than relational datastores?** (ie. faster, simpler, more flexible, more powerful) **What makes them better at doing those things?**
