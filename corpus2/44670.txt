I have problem how to present the solution of the system of two differential equations in the form as in the case of one differential equation if I know the nature of roots. For example                DSolve[a y1''''[x] + b1 y1''[x] + k0 y1[x] == 0 ,y1[x], x]      gives the known and simple solution for the supposed                y1[x_] = A E^(s x);      with known roots                s11 = λ + I ω;      s12 = λ - I ω;           s13 = -λ + I ω;      s14 = -λ - I ω;      in this form generally (*)               y1[x] = E^(λ x) (C1 Cos[ω x] + C2 Sin[ω x]) +      E^(-λ x) (C3 Cos[ω x] + C4 Sin[ω x])      I want to simplify the solution in the above case for the system of two differential equations                DSolve[{a y1''''[x] + b1 y1''[x] + k0*(y1[x] - y2[x]) == 0,       a y2''''[x] + b2 y2''[x] + k0*(y2[x] - y1[x]) == 0}, {y1[x], y2[x]},      x]      supposing                y1[x_] = A E^(s x);      y2[x_] = B E^(s x);      Solution is long output with 8 unknown constants. Can I simplify the presentation of the solution as in example case (*) if I know that all roots are in the following form                s1 = 0;      s2 = 0;           s3 = I ω1;      s4 = -I ω1;           s5 = λ + I ω2;      s6 = λ - I ω2;           s7 = -λ + I ω2;      s8 = -λ - I ω2;
