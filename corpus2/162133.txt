_TL;DR_ Sort of brainstorming: why integrating systems by means of exchanging loosely- structured files (as opposed to XML web services integration) is a bad idea? _TL Part_ We're offering an online solution for enterprise customers (big ones) and in implementing this we often need to integrate with their internal systems (HR databases, CRM and ERP systems, you know the drill). One of the most common integration point is that we need to have information about their employees in our internal databases. To that end, we're advocating information exchange via XML Web Services with either us calling their WS Endpoint on a regular basis and asking for changes since `timestamp` or them invoking _our_ WS and supplying all the information required. Enterprisey and buzzwordy enough, sure. Now, what we're offered is: every week we'll manually export our HR data into an Excel workbook, email it to you and expect this data to be where it belongs. Slightly better option: automatically exported Excel file is shared on a network drive accessible over VPN. Naturally, this is error-prone and doesn't scale, but that's the only cost- effective option for our customers. We need somehow to persuade them to switch over to Web Services, but since the final decision on whether our system will be implemented or not is made by someone without technical background we need to either present non-techincal arguments or present them in a way that's understandable by a mere mortal.
