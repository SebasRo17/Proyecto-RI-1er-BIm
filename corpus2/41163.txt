Problem: Evaluate the following double integral $$\int \\!\\!\\! \int_D (14 x^2+61 xy+42 y^2)^{3} \, dxdy$$ where $D$ is a parallelogram between these four lines: $2x+7y=6$, $2x+7 y=-6$, $7x+6 y=6$ and $7x+6y=-6$. I have defined the lines as graphs of functions $a, b, c, d$ and plotted them in _Mathematica_. Lines $a$ and $c$ intersect at $x=-\frac{78}{37}$ while $b$ and $d$ intersect at $x=\frac{12}{5}$ according to my calculations. Then I try to integrate the function as follows, getting the answer $-4400.1$, but it is not correct.               NIntegrate[       Boole[-(78/37) <= x <= 12/5 && Max[a[x], b[x]] <= y <= Min[c[x], d[x]]]       ((14 x^2 + 61 x*y + 42 y^2)^3),       {x, -4, 4}, {y, -2, 2}]      What am I doing wrong?
