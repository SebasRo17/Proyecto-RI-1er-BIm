Aligning my images in `Grid` causes one of them to become smaller, despite specifying each of their sizes with `ImageSize`:               dat = Table[{x, y, RandomReal[]*x*y}, {x, 1, 50}, {y, 1, 50}];     img = ListContourPlot[Flatten[dat, 1], ImageSize -> {300, 300}];     oldspotlight =        Graphics[{}, Background -> Black, PlotRange -> {{1, 50}, {1, 50}},         ImageSize -> 300];     a=Show[img,       Graphics[{Circle[{90, 60}, 10]}, PlotRange -> {{1, 50}, {1, 50}},        ImageSize -> {300, 300}]]     b=ImageMultiply[img,       ImageAdd[oldspotlight,        Graphics[{ColorData["GrayTones"][10/20], Disk[{90, 60}, 10]},         Background -> Black, PlotRange -> {{1, 50}, {1, 50}},         ImageSize -> {300, 300}]]]     Grid[{{a,b}}]      Output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fxDPB.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z8vAq.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BgS8X.jpg) Please note that I don't want to use `GraphicsGrid`. (The reason is because it doesn't cooperate with `Dynamic`, which is an unrelated question.)
