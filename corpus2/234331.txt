I am a bit confused about the nomenclature for the parts of an _if_ statement. Consider the following example:               1:  if condition then     2:      statement_1;     3:  else     4:      statement_2;     5:  end if;      What is the "if clause" in this statement? Here are a few possibilities:   * Is it lines #1 and #2?    * Is it line #1?    * Is it line #2?    * Is is the _condition_ in line #1? And in the same example, what would be the "then clause"?   * Is it line #2?    * Is it the _then_ keyword, plus line #2?   * Is it just a synonym for "if clause"? My main reference is Code Complete 2nd Ed., but the author seems to use exclusively the term "if clause", with the meaning being lines #1 and #2 in this example.
