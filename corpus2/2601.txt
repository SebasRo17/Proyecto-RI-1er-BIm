Is there a way to force Plot and related functions to place the tick labels inside, rather than outside a frame? For example, consider,               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, Frame -> True]      When this line is executed, the tick labels are outside the bottom and left edges of the frame: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sE8YQ.png) Is there an easy way to move them to the inside? (Why place tick labels inside the frame, you ask? I would like to export plots to PDF in a specified absolute size, so that one major tick on the plot is exactly 1 cm on the printout. If the labels were not placed on the outside, padding the image, this could be easily done using `ImageSize`, as described here.)
