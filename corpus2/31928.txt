I am about to send a Mathematica notebook to someone and I would like to make sure it does not contain any information that could personally identify me. I would also like to produce pdf files from the notebook and would like them to be metadata-free. Do I need to 'scrub' the file from some intrinsic metadata (as you would need to do, carefully, say, for an MS Word file), or do they generically not include any such information? If they do contain metadata,   * what can it be?   * where is it? and   * how can I scrub it?
