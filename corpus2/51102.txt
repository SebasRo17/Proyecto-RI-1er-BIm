({{a, b}, {c, d}})      a, b, c and d are Lists of 300 length. Their first 4 elements must specify their position in the column (1 column, 2 column, etc) and the following 4 elements the position in the line (1 line, 2 line, etc) but this must be made in binary code and not a 2x2 Table but a 10x10. Also, they must only contain -1, 0 or 1. I was thinking about creating the vector with a smaller length and use `AppendTo` to put the position based on the table index and converting it to binary but couldn't find a final solution.
