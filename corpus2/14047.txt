I gave many interviews in the last few years and each time I found the interviewers are not satisfied with what I know. My first company only developed desktop Windows applications using .NET. They had nothing to do with features like: _Remoting_ etc. We also had limited use of _Generics_ , _Reflection_ and _Multi-threading_. When I appeared for the interviews, I was asked questions on above features even when I told them that I don't have real-life experience. Now the .NET interviews are even more complex. Seeing my experience, the interviewers target the latest framework. I have no real-life exposure to the new features and technologies like WPF, WCF etc. Please suggest me how to effectively prepare for the .NET interview. I have 3 years experience in .NET but I only developed Windows based applications. At present I work on .NET Framework 3.5. I never worked on ASP.NET, as in my present company I work on PHP for web-applications.
