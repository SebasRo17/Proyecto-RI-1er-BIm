I have a system of 6 non-linear (quadratic) coupled equations with 6 complex unknowns \begin{align*} |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + |x_3|^2 &= a\\\ x_1 x_4^* + x_3 x_5^* &= b + c i\\\ x_1 x_6^* &= d + e i\\\ |x_4|^2 + |x_5|^2 &= f\\\ x_4 x_6^* &= g + h i\\\ |x_6|^2 &= k \end{align*}               {Abs[x1]^2 + Abs[x2]^2 + Abs[x3]^2 == a,      x1 Conjugate[x4] + x3 Conjugate[x5] == b + c I,      x1 Conjugate[x6] == d + e I,      Abs[x4]^2 + Abs[x5]^2 == f,      x4 Conjugate[x6] == g + h I,      Abs[x6]^2 == k}      where $x_1$ etc. are complex variables, $x_1^*$ is `Conjugate[x1]`, $|x|$ is `Abs[x]`, and `a` etc. are real constants. The equations are probably underdetermined - if you break them into real and imaginary parts, there are only 9 equations for 12 real unknowns. Physically (since these equations solves for parameters in a model) I expect some phases in the $x_i$ are not physical (i.e. some $x_i$ are actually real numbers instead of complex), but I don't know a good way to parametrize the phases away. `NSolve[{eqns}, {vars}, Complexes]` has been running for more than 10 minutes (and still running!). I've never encountered numerical equation solving with coupled non-linear equations before, so I don't know what to expect. Is there anything I can do to optimize the process? What other numerical solving functions can I try? Also, probably off-topic here: I am under the impression that numerics is not _Mathematica_ 's strong suit; should I seek out other programs to solve this problem? Recommendations?
