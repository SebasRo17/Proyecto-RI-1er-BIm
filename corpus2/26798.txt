I have a 1000 by 3 data matrix in which for each person we have 3 scores. I want to cluster those persons into 8 cluster using Agglomerative method. I did the clusetring by:                class=FindClusters[data, 8, DistanceFunction -> ManhattanDistance,       Method -> {"Agglomerate", "Linkage" -> "Complete"}]      I want to find out how and which persons are classified into those 8 clusters.In other words, I want to have a vector of class membership for each person (similar to what we can get using `ClusteringComponents[data,8,1]`). As an example, suppose we have this data set:               data={{3, 2, 4}, {1, 1, 0}, {5, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 2}, {4, 4, 4}, {3, 2, 4}, {3,        2, 3}, {2, 1, 3}}      result of `FindClusters` is:               class = FindClusters[data, 3, DistanceFunction -> ManhattanDistance,        Method -> {"Agglomerate", "Linkage" -> "Complete"}]          {{{3, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 2}, {3, 2, 4}, {3, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 3}}, {{1, 1,         0}}, {{5, 2, 4}, {4, 4, 4}}}      through the output it can be seen that persons number 1,4,6,7&8 are classified in first cluster; person number 2 in second cluster and persons number 3&5 are in third cluster. I want to have a vector like:               {1,2,3,1,3,1,1,1}      then I can determine which person is located in which cluster and how many persons are in each cluster. I decided to use `FindClusters` because I didn't get reasonable results from `Agglomerate` function for hierarchical clustering. My main aim is doing hierarchical clustering with different linkage functions. Any help and additional ideas are appreciated. Amin.
