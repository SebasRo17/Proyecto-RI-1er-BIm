I would like to organize my company's software releases by platform. I've looked at how Mozilla, Perforce, and Apache organize their releases, and it seems that I should partition by OS and processor architecture. I was thinking of something like this:   * Linux (x86-32)   * Linux (x86-64)   * Neutrino (x86-32)   * Windows (x86-32)   * Windows (x86-64) Is it common to distinguish between versions of Windows, Linux, or OS X? For example, should I be specifying the Linux kernel version?
