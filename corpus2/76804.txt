What is the best way to explain floating point rounding issue to **_customers_**? I know http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html as well as the entries in the C++ FAQ and various other pages aimed at developers and scientists, but is there a web page, article or explanation, aimed at "regular" customers with limited mathematical or scientific background? (for which the above references fall flat). If it were maintained or coming from a well-known and well-recognized institution or corporation, all the better, given that, as some of you might have experienced, it can be a little complicated to explain that yourself.
