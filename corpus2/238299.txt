How must i change the Standard Implemplementation of the Serpent Algorithm that i can use it with the javax.crypto.CipherInputStream or javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream? I must implement/extends the Cipher class and when i do it, what must i change? The Original Implementation of the Serpent Algorithm is here http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html Exist a Implementation of the Serpent Algorithm that's implement Cipher? I found the Java implementation of the Algorithm on the Page of its Creator. The Problem in this is: i can't use it with javax.crypto.CipherInputStream or javax.crypto.CipherOutputStream. I try to use the ObjectOutputStream to write a Configuration File, but i would like to encrypt it with the Serpent Algorithm. The same is with the reading of this Configuration file. I don't want to use API's like the BouncyCastle and flexiprovider because they create a to heavy boilerplate which i don't need. What is the best practice to use a finished (final and tested) Algorithm that dont extends/implements Cipher and it should be used in javax.crypto.CipherXxxStream?
