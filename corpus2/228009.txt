I am the main developer of a library, licensed under the MIT license, and hosted on Github. The Github repository includes a LICENSE file. When someone sends me a pull request, do I have to list those as copyright holders in the accompaning license.txt, or should I list these in a special section there? Am I required to do it? Can I assume, that contributors agree to include their code with the license specified in LICENSE, when they send a pull request?
