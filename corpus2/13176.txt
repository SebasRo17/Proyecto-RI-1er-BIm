In a non-joined `ListPlot` one can specify that a filling line is shown for each point:               ListPlot[Table[{x, Exp[-x^2]}, {x, -2, 2, 0.1}], Filling -> Axis, FillingStyle -> Red]      ![1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eAUuX.png) But if the points are out of the plot range, the filling line no longer appears:               ListPlot[Table[{x, Exp[-x^2]}, {x, -2, 2, 0.1}], Filling -> Axis, FillingStyle -> Red,        PlotRange -> {0, 0.5}]      ![2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I9vYi.png) Is there any way to still show the line up the plot range, to show that there is a point there (but you just can't see it)? Or must I draw the lines myself with a `Prolog`?
