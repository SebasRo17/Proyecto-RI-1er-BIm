I have been trying to find a way to separate the various closed paths that can be output by `EdgeDetect`. For example, taking the output of:               ColorNegate@EdgeDetect@Graphics[Style[Text["8"], 400]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CRoh8.png) I'd like to be able to obtain a list like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BCn8u.png) I'd really love to show some progress I made on this, but to be honest, I'm stuck at the beginning. I really don't know how to attack this one. The na√Øve approach might be to take one black pixel, then go around it registering adjacent pixels as part of the same path, while erasing them from the original image. But I don't expect this to be anything other than painfully slow, and there probably are some Mathematica image manipulation functions that I could leverage. So, how would you advise me to start?
