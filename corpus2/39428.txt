For the command autocompletion, I can simply use `Ctrk`+`K` and then use `Return` or `Tab` to choose the completion. But when I want to autocomplete the local variables I have input, `Ctrk`+`K` works, but both `Return` and `Tab` fail to input the variable's name. I have tried to change this behavior with the **Interface** panel of the **Preferences** dialog , but there are no options I can change. Do you know some easy to make `Return` and `Tab` work for local variable autocompletion?
