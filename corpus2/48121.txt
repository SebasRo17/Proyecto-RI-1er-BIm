in = VertexInDegree[F];     out = VertexOutDegree[F];      I want both in and out to be ordered by in. Example: graph has nodes a,b,c with indegrees 1,2,0 and outdegrees 0,1,2. I want lists in = {0,1,2} and out = {2,0,1}. How do I do this? I tried               in = Sort[VertexInDegree[F]];     out = VertexOutDegree[F][[Ordering@in]];      , but this didn't give the expected result.
