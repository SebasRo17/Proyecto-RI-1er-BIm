How to force binary bit representation of a number, so BitNot does yield the 1s-complement? > BitNot[n] turns ones into zeros and vice versa in the binary bit > representation of n. I was unable so far to produce a number which Mathematica accepts as a binary bit representation. Is there a way (like casting) to convince Mathematica that some number has to be treated as a binary bit representation? Any help appreciated.
