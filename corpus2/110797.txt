My web server uses PHP as do 76.9% of web servers according to W3Techs: http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all The reason I use PHP is an inertia born out of seeing everyone else using it on web servers. What is it about PHP that would make it so ubiquitous on web servers? (Note that this question is similar to the following question but takes it in a different direction: Why isn't Java used for modern web application development?)
