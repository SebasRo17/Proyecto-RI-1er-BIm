I installed Apache2 and PHP5 last night on my fresh Linux Mint machine. I created a folder and created a simple `index.php` file with a call to `phpinfo()` to test out the installation and every works correctly. However when I open the file with Sublime Text 2 or any other editor, I cannot save my changes. I can use the `sudo nano` command to open it with super user privileges and I can save just fine. The same goes with Mercurial. I cannot `hg commit` because of permissions. I can only `sudo hg commit`. Is this how the basic workflow is supposed to be? If I run the `chmod` command and recursively give `777` permissions to the folders and files within Apache can run it just fine, but if it's a dynamically created file ( _created by my web app_ ) then it seems Apache cannot access or run it. I have to run the `chmod` command **again**! Any suggestions on what I should do? I feel like 30% of my time is spent on redundant processes that shouldn't be done at all.
