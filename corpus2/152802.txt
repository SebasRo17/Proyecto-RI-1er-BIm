For example: Say I have classes `A`, `B`, `C`. I have two interfaces, lets call them `IAnimal` and `IDog`. `IDog` inherits from `IAnimal`. `A` and `B` are `IDog`s, while `C` is not, but it is an `IAnimal`. The important part is that `IDog` supplies no additional functionality. It is only used to allow `A` and `B`, but not `C`, to be passed as an argument to certain methods. Is this bad practice?
