What is the preferred way to do the following with git, maven and jenkins: I am developping an application, which I would like to maintain "dev" and "release" branches. I would like jenkins to build both. It could be so that the release-artifacts would have versions like 1.5.2 and the dev-builds would just be 0.0.1-SNAPSHOTs. I would like to not have to have 2 different pom.xml files. I looked into profiles, but they don't seem to be able to change artifact versions. One way I looked at could be adding a 'qualifier' to the test- builds. Of course I could just rename the file, because the real artifact- information on this is not important, because the app is a standalone one. What would be the preferred way to doing this? Or how would you do this?
