By reading various source code, I see that there is different ways of binding an ICommand to a RelayCommand :   * From the constructor              MyAwesomeViewModel()  {         this._fooCommand = new RelayCommand((x) => Bar(x))      }        * Directly from the command property              private ICommand _fooCommand ;     public ICommand SearchCommand     {         get         {             return _fooCommand ?? (_fooCommand = new RelayCommand());         }     }      Which way is the better from your point of view ?
