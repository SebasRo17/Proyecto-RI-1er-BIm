In many languages such as C, C++, and Java, the `main` method/function has a return type of `void` or `int`, but not `double` or `String`. What might be the reasons behind that? I know a little bit that we can't do that because `main` is called by runtime library and it expects some syntax like `int main()` or `int main(int,char**)` so we have to stick to that. So my question is: why does `main` have the type signature that it has, and not a different one?
