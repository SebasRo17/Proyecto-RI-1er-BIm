While I was looking to the definition of some common terms in _en.wiktionary.org_ , I was surprised to what I found. It define the **programmer** as > One who designs software. - _wiktionary.org_ and **developer** as > A software developer; a person or company who creates or modifies computer > software. - _wiktionary.org_ I have a bachelors degree in IT and has a professional work in an IT department for almost a year, and I do always thought that their definitions are opposite. Is this the real definition of a programmer and a developer or is it just because it is shortly-defined _(but still, it seems to me like it should be the opposite)_?
