Basically I need a function that takes a list and gives all the possible permutations of it. The reason I can't use `Permutations` is that I have to apply another program that will score each permutation separately, based on certain criteria, and `Permutations[Range[14]]` gives entirely too much data. The function has to work for a list `Range[int]` up to `int = 14`, each permutation has to include all the members of the original list with no repeats, and the function has to produce all possible permutations. I will appreciate any help: I'm very stuck.
