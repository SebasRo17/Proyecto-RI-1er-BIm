A similar question asks whether a computer can learn to play optimally in chess by analyzing thousands of games. If a machine can look at the state of the board for a few games of chess (or a few games of checkers) in the beginning and after each move, can it be programmed to learn the rules of the game? If it can, to what extent (e.g., would it be able to account for castling or promotion) would this work? Which machine learning algorithms would make this possible?
