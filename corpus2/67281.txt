My university only recognizes academic papers as valid intellectual achievements. I would like to get a sense of how many Software Architect's, Software Engineer, Software Developers and/or programmers bother to publish their findings. Or as programmer do you feel your production should have academic merit as well? (oops!) I guess this is two questions.
