Sometimes when I start working on a project, I just can't think of a good name, or think of a good name that isn't already taken. As a result, I'll end up picking some sort of code name for the project. My question is, how do you handle name changes in your source code once you find a real name for your project? Should you continue to refer to the code name in your source tree, namespaces, binaries, etc?
