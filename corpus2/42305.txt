I'd like to compute an integral that depends on a parameter, but I'd like to exclude an interval from the computation. For concreteness, say I want to compute               Integrate[f[x,z],{x,-a,a}]      but I would like to specify that z is a complex number _not_ in the real interval [-a,a]. Any thoughts? If I let the integral run, I get a conditional expression that I think is correct, but I'd like to specify the exclusion ahead of time if possible. Thanks!
