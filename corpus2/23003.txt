I'm trying to illustrate the solutions to a textbook problem dealing with quadratic functions. This will involve plotting a quadratic and overlaying the plot and the image. Here is the textbook scan.....![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/La8Zs.jpg) The idea of the problem is to find several possible quadratic models that would go through the hoop. I imported this image into a variable, call it img1 I wanted to establish a "baseline" so I started with a simple plot, x intercepts of 0 and 18, and vertex at (9,14). I know, NOT a solution to the problem but I wanted to see how the plot and image would match up. I created the plot               g2 = Plot[-14/81 x (x - 18), {x, -1, 19}, PlotStyle -> Thick]      Then I put them together and tweaked the placement of the plot based on the image size.               ImageCompose[img1, g2, {983/2, 811/2}]      Which gives me this... ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gvgpf.jpg) The vertex is in the right place, but the axes don't line up. Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm not at all sure how I could get my plot to match the background image so the axes in the image would be the same as the axes in my plot.... Do I need to scale my plot, or scale my image.. or something obvious that I am missing. Any help is appreciated
