I’m mentoring FRC Robotics team and we’re buying a new computer. I’m looking at Lenovo Thinkpad W540. We’ll be using C++/WPILIB and SolidWorks for design. Anyone out there have experience with this laptop? Should we stick with Windows 7-64bit or go to Windows 8? I’m also curious to know whether anti-virus software interferes with performance … errr ... should that be separate discussion? Thanks!
