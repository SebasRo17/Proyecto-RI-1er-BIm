This seems like it would be an obvious "yes". However, I just want to be sure and I've tried googling around to no avail. I am learning Python/Django and uploading all of the projects I'm creating to GitHub. I'm starting to add in existing modules from other open-source projects that do not belong to me. Is it still okay to upload MY projects to GitHub, even though they include other people's open source modules as well? Should I give them credit in the README, or by commenting where their code is included? Thanks.
