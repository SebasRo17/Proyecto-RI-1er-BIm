Overheard at the watercooler yesterday: "Scrum has no place in defense contracting." I tend to disagree in the sense that I believe Scrum can be tailored to work in many scenarios and I can see defense being one of them. This sparked a huge debate amongst my colleagues (many of us work in defense contracting) with a fairly even split for/against. To make this a proper question: Has anyone successfully used (or has experience working with) scrum in a defense contracting situation? What worked well, what didn't work well and what (if any) modifications to vanilla scrum did you do?
