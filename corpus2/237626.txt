I want to write a simple markup language with its rendering engine. First, I am not completely sure **_when_** I should try this... I am only 12... But I am competent in C++ having learned through the Web and books. I am also good with JavaScript, PHP and HTML. I am currently learning Ruby and Haskell for a change. I understand all low-level and high-level concepts. But the only thing that had always confused me is how people design these parsers to understand and compile or interpret things like markup languages and programming languages. My question is when should I start writing a simple rendering engine for an even simpler markup language? More like the custom xml-like custom languages frameworks use for their interface (Qt uses a .ui file that is similar to XML to define their forms). Am I up to design something like that? Any good papers, articles or books to read? _Preferred Languages_ : C++, JavaScript, Haskell, Ruby
