This seems like a bug in `PositiveDefiniteMatrixQ` to me:               m = {      { 2, -1},       {-3,  2}     };          PositiveDefiniteMatrixQ[m]     (* => False *)          PositiveDefiniteMatrixQ @ SparseArray[m]     (* => True *)      This is for version 9 and above; older versions (6-8) don't seem to be affected.
