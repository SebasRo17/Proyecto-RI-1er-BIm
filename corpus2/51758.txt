Yes, I know they administrate databases. I asked this question because I'd like to get a further insight into the kind of day-to-day duties a DBA might perform, and the real-world business problems they solve. For example:   * I optimized a 'products' query so that it ran 25% faster, which made the overall application faster. Is this a typical duty? Or is there more to being a DBA than simply making things faster? In what situations does DBA work involve planning and creativity?
