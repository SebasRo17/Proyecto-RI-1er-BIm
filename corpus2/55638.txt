I download data from an online source, now I have a problem: the source code doesn't allow to differ between values of 10 (which actually stands for 10) and 10.000 (which is 10'000, but _Mathematica_ reads it as 10 as well). Now I'm thinkg about letting all values that include a period like `10.000` multiply with the factor 1000 and let all the values without a period remain the same. Lets say I have the following vector `a={10.350,20,20.000,10.700,30,40.522}`. What I want to do is to multiply all elements of `a` except the second (`20`) and fifth one (`30`). Is there a chance to distinguish between 20 and 20.000 ? Thanks for your help in advance!!
