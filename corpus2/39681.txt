**Example** Assumptions:               ClearAll[m, F, b, \[Omega], \[Delta]]     $Assumptions = x > 0 && m > 0 && F > 0 && b > 0 && \[Omega] > 0 && \[Delta] > 0;      In the following, $m$ is the mass of the mechanical system and $\delta$ is the phaseshift of the system.               m = 0.17869 + 0.01376/3;     \[Delta] = ArcTan[b/(m*(\[Omega]^2 - x^2))*x];      The experimental data:               data = {{0.7123448644,0.00246},{0.7324185582,0.00266},{0.7861292525,0.00328},{0.8523181889,0.00451},{0.9109116735,0.00647},{0.9282727060,0.00760},{0.9906639165,0.0114},{1.025928514,0.0152},{1.051970063,0.0222},{1.079096676,0.0131},{1.105138225,0.00865},{1.149625870,0.00549},{1.170242096,0.00455},{1.220155065,0.00336},{1.256504727,0.00267},{1.351990405,0.00184}};      The fitting function:               A[x_] := F/(m*\[Omega]^2*          Sqrt[   (x - \[Delta])^4                 + ((b/(m*\[Omega]))^2 - 2)*(x - \[Delta])^2                 + 1])      where $F$, $b$, and $\omega$ are parameters connected to the system. Determineing the missing parameters:               FindFit[data, A[x], {F, b, \[Omega]}, x]      > {F -> 0.00584067, b -> 0.972727, [Omega] -> -1.10514}               F = 0.005840667856395345;     b = 0.9727272619465833;     \[Omega] = -1.105138224999997;      Plot of data and the fitting curve:               Show[Plot[A[x], {x, 0.6, 1.5}, PlotRange -> Full], ListPlot[data, PlotStyle -> Red]]      > ![output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JhB1r.jpg) It is obvious that the fitting is all wrong. How do I get the correct fitting parameters? I know that the fit should give approximately               F = 0.03     b = 0.14     \[Omega] = 12      P.S. I would think that executing the first command would assure that $\omega > 0$ when finding the fitting parameters, but this is obviously not the case.
