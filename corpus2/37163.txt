I need to fit my data dropbox of the form `{x,y}` because I need the fit function for further derivative calculation. My derivative curve should be smooth. I tried                BSplineFunction[data, SplineDegree -> 5]      and also               Interpolation[data, InterpolationOrder -> 2]      but both derivates are not smooth. Therefore I ended up by using least square fit (LSF) by using a polynomial with varying the degree of the polynomial (DOP) to find the best fit:               DOP = 21;      LSF = Fit[data, Evaluate[Table[x^i, {x, 0, DOP}]] , x];      The problem is that even choosing a high DOP, the experimental data are not fitted very well in the important section of the curve (between local minimum and -maximum) ![fit vs experimental](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xf2uZ.png) (blue: experimental data; red: LSF) and/or the derivative seems to start to oscillate at the beginning or end of the curve (in this example at the beginning, pointed to by black arrow): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fPRxo.jpg) Zooming the experimental curve in the first section does not reveal something that could cause that error: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pvi5M.png) Has that something to do with Runge's phenomenon or how can I solve that easily?
