Ticks is an option for Gauges. I fail, however, to apply custom Ticks to Gauges. For instance, compare these two:                {ThermometerGauge[50, {0, 100}, Ticks -> Automatic],       ThermometerGauge[50, {0, 100}, Ticks -> {0, 50, 100}]}      What you see is this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D2vDP.jpg) _No difference!_ I also tried with the Horizontal- and VerticalGauge with the same success. _Do you know a workaround?_ EDIT 11.07.13: I have seen the answers to my question. They all are good and fascinating, and in another case I will certainly use them. They do not answer my question though. For this reason I would like to give some more explanation of what I am really after. I will give it within an example of a different problem, where it is easy to obtain such a result. So let us consider two simple plots. First is this               Plot[x, {x, -0.3, 0.3}, ImageSize -> 250]      second is this:                Plot[x, {x, -0.3, 0.3}, Ticks -> {{0, 3/16, 1/4}, Automatic},       ImageSize -> 250]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VBURg.jpg) Here you can see it. The y axis in both plots is automatic - do not look at it. The x axis of the first plot is automatic for comparison, while the x axis of the second plot is what I am after. I would like to achieve the same on the ThermometerGauge, if possible by easy means. The easy means are here important, since looking at programs below I feel that it is easier to draw such a Gauge from scratch. For example, like this:                 thermo[x_] := Show[{        Graphics3D[{Text[Style["-0.3", 12], {-0.15, 0, -0.3}],           Text[Style["0", 12], {-0.15, 0, 0}],          Text[Style["3/16", 12], {0.14, 0, 3/16}] ,           Text[Style["1/4", 12], {0.15, 0, 0.25}] ,           Text[Style["0.3", 12], {-0.13, 0, 0.3}]},          ViewPoint -> {0, -1.5, 0}, Boxed -> False,          ImageSize -> {120, 300}],        Graphics3D[{LightBlue, Specularity[White, 20], Opacity[0.5],           Sphere[{0, 0, -0.4}, 0.11]}],        Graphics3D[{Red, Specularity[White, 20],           Sphere[{0, 0, -0.4}, 0.1]}],        Graphics3D[{LightBlue, Opacity[0.5],           Tube[{{0, 0, -0.4}, {0, 0, 0.35}}, 0.05]}],        Graphics3D[{Red, Specularity[White, 20],           Cylinder[{{0, 0, -0.45}, {0, 0, x}}, 0.04]}],             Graphics3D[{Thickness[0.015],           Line[{{-0.07, 0, #}, {-0.09, 0, #}}] & /@            Table[i, {i, -0.3, 0.3, 0.1}]}],        Graphics3D[{Red, Thickness[0.015],           Arrow[{{0.09, 0, 3/16}, {0.03, 0, 3/16}}],           Arrow[{{0.09, 0, 0.25}, {0.03, 0, 0.25}}]}]        }]      Try it:               Manipulate[      thermo[x], {{x, 0}, -0.3, 0.3}]      It looks as shown here: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2MjjY.jpg)
