This may be a simple question. Please close it if it is already answered. I have a nested list               kr = {{35, 32, 27, 20}, {36, 33, 28, 21}, {37, 34, 29, 22}}       I want to use a function `flo[x_,y_,z_]` on each of the lists after modifying it. So the Mapthread on a given list `k0` (eg. {35, 32, 27, 20}) will look like this               MapThread[flo[L, ##] &, {Most@k0, Rest@k0}];      I want the output to look like this.               qfr = {{flo[L,35,32], flo[L,32,27],flo[L,27,20]},{flo[L,36,33],                 flo[L,33,28],flo[L,28,21]},{flo[L,37,34], flo[L,34,29],flo[L,29,22]}}      I tried to do the following without much luck. what am I missing?               MapThread[flo[L, ##] &, {Most@#, Rest@#}] & kr
