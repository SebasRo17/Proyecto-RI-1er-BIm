So. I'm working right now as an intern in a mobile game development company. I've used Unity quite a lot for 1 year now but, that's about all the experience I have with game design/development. Here's the things. I wanna go indie, the main reason is for fun, I really enjoy games and by making indie games I believe I can let my imagination fly and make personal personal stuff. Unfortunately I...I just don't know where to start! I'm interestes in making mobile and web games so what...should I download Stencyl? Construct 2?...XCODE for iOS, maybe a great plugin for Unity would be fine? What whould be your single best advice for someone like me? (programmer and interestes in design) :)
