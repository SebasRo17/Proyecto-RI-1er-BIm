From a conic equation obtained from a dot product, I want to plot its 2D graph, while being able to manipulate the variable.               Manipulate[        K = {Sin[t] Cos[p], Sin[t] Sin[p], Cos[t]};        oP = {x, y, 1};        noP = Assuming[Element[{x, y, z}, Reals], Simplify[Norm[oP]]];        nK = Assuming[Element[{t, p, x, y, z}, Reals], Simplify[Norm[K]]];        {(K.oP)^2 == (Cos[a]*nK*noP)^2},        {a, Pi/16, Pi, Pi/16, ControlPlacement -> Left},        {t, 0, \[Pi], \[Pi]/256, ControlPlacement -> Left},        {p, 0, \[Pi], \[Pi]/256, ControlPlacement -> Left}      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Umfmr.png) I do get the correct equation, but I am unable to plot it in any way when I take it separately.               ParametricPlot[ 1 == (1 + x^2 + y^2) Cos[\[Pi]/16]^2, {x, -14, 14}, {y, -14, 14}]      show the axes, but not the graph. Only when I try with the == function do I get the graph, which is not really useful... What should I change?
