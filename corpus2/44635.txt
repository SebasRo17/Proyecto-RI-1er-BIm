I have a .dat file. I would like to convert a big array of strings(that's what I havein the .dat file) into an array of numbers, for example               a = {{"3,-3,0,5,5,0.000208"}, {"-3,-3,0,5,5,0.000208"},{"3,-3,0,5,5,0.000208"}};      into               b = {{3,-3,0,5,5,0.000208}, {-3,-3,0,5,5,0.000208},{3,-3,0,5,5,0.000208}};      I tried to do               ToExpression[a]      but it does not work. How can I do it? Thanks
