I was recently made the team leader of a database (95% MS SQL Server, 5% misc- Oracle, Sybase, Access) development team that manages and develops a large number of databases in a corporate environment. I'm looking for resources (checklists, utilities, best practices, procedures, websites, books, etc) that will help me to implement fundamentals which have been lacking in this development group in the past, such as code reviews, cross training, documentation, enforcing standards, knowledge sharing, mentoring and so forth. Most of what I'm finding is general management skills resources, but I would like to find anything that might be specific to leading a team of developers. Corporate processes are "standard" waterfall type SDLC, so resources geared towards Agile are not nearly as relevant.
