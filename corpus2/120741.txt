Is there a service which could help me reward (pay) the contributors of an open-source project by their contribution to the project (Maybe using data from where the code is hosted GitHub)? Maybe by getting them to map their bank/paypal account to their account on a service like GitHub? How do projects currently reward their contributors? If I were to develop such a service, what would I need?
