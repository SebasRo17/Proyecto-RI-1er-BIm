I am about to start User story sessions in my team. It's quite new for them and I am also wrestling with certain things. For the current project we have some well worked out wireframes. I read a lot about the way of writing user stories. What the template should be like and about different aids like Invest The plan is to turn them around in user stories. Lets say I have a screen where a user could edit an order. There is a lot of detail on that screen. Now when creating a user story of this story. Will it suffice to say: > As an Admin I can edit a purchase order so that mistakes typed by the user > can be enhanced. Or should i specify each detail like: > As an Admin I can resend an invoice to the customer, so he can get a copy of > his lost one. > > As an Admin I can review the customer order so he has detailed information > about each purchase > > As an admin I can remove items forma on order so that in case the customer > made a mistake I can remove Items. * * * And how about the acceptance criteria. How should the be defined for a user story as such. Where do I define which fields need to be shown on an order detail page? Can this be part of the acceptance criteria?
