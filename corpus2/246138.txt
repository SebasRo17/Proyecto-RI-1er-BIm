Assume that the source file A contains the following license notice: "This code is Copyright 1234 by XYZ. It may be freely redistributed in its entirety provided that this copyright notice is not removed." Can I combine it with a project B published under the GPL version 3 license? In particular, does the lack of a permission to modify source file A ("redistributed in its entirety") prohibit that?
