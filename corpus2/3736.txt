I have a lot of data to inspect. An example of a number in my program is               123.189094      This gets displayed as               123.189      Unfortunately, most of my information is in the small digits, so, when visually inspecting this data, `123.189094` and `123.189263` are not distinguishable, in other words, a list like               {123.189094, 123.189263}      is displayed like               {123.189, 123.189}      and it looks like I have equal data when I don't. The only fix I have found for this is `FullForm`, but that explodes out all the structure (lists, rules, etc.) and makes the display very annoying. Imagine that my data were actually buried deep in some nested structure of lists and rules (and it is).               {123.189094, 123.189263}//FullForm     (* List[123.189094`,123.189263`] *)      is not what I want. I would have thought `N[#,10]&` or somesuch would work, but it doesn't               {123.189094, 123.189263} // N[#, 10] &     (* {123.189,123.189} AAACH! *)      `StandardForm` doesn't do it, `TraditionalForm` doesn't do it. I'm stuck. As usual, will be grateful for any advice or ideas.
