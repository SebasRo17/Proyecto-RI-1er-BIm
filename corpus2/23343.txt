I would like to save my _Mathematica_ notebooks as plain-text documents, so that I can keep them under `git` version control. I thought that `File > Save as...` + `Plain Text` would do what I want, but I'm having problems with it. First, I can't figure out how to "re-import" into _Mathematica_ (in a form that can be readily evaluated) a notebook saved this way. Second, the human-readable text content is overwhelmed by serializations of graphic objects, etc. Therefore, the output produced by `git diff` on two versions of such text files is a nightmare. Third, the human-readable text portions are not all that readable. Of course, some rich formatting cannot be easily converted to text, but I would like to preserve at least some of the indentation found in the original, if possible. Is there a better approach?
