I had a job interview today for a Job position as developer on an important site. They asked tonnes of programming language related questions, which I managed to answer without problems, but then they started asking question about how TCP/IP requests were made once I made a request on my PC to a web server. I did received those contents as a student, but I dont remember them well, because I'm working mostly in web development, my question is: As a software developer, mainly working on web applications, do I need to have **extensive** knowledge of TCP/IP and how routers manage requests or it's just black box knowledge to me?
