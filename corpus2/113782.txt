Having this sentence (consider many sentences in the future) > David Henderson Houston patented the first roll film for cameras in 1881. I can make questions like   1\. Who patented the roll film?   2\. When was the first roll film for cameras patented?   3\. What did David Houston patent (in 1881)? The answer will return some or all of the sentence above in a format of answering the who, when and what. My question (and what I am trying to achieve) is to separate this sentence in such a way that I can save it in a DB, smartly and efficiently. I thought of editing this sentence leaving only the main keywords/facts; let's say `David Houston patented the roll film in 1881.` After this, I thought I have to organize the words. So a solution may be to create tables for nouns, verbs, adjectives... separating the sentence in the correct table. Every word will have its unique ID. In the table `answers`, the answer will be saved in a form like 2,23,64,4 every ID is a word... and with some agorithm and sql magic (this is not my point now) it will return the `David Houston patented the roll film in 1881` on the question `who`. What do you think of my thinking of separating the sentences like I wrote above? What are your thoughts on how I should organize the words to access them through a database? Am I entirely off the correct path?
