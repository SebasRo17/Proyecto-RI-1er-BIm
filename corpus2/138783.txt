**Are there any software consortium to promote C# as a language?** I'm aware of Mono and see it as a sincere, valiant attempt. However, its unlikely they can continuously outrun Microsoft inside a 'catchup' model. A wider consortium means the roadmaps are joint and not 'catchup'. I compare C# to C++. C++ is incredible in that it can run on almost anything from ARM RTOSes, Linux, BSD, Windows etc etc. Of course, the expansive nature of the runtime platform (.NET) makes this a huge challenge. Not to mention that the language (C#) and the runtime have almost become synonyms. But I digress, back to the main question above ...
