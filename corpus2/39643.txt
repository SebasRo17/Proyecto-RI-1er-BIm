I am learning Mathematica in random order by reading its documentation. This approach is what I like most when learning new things. Consider the following 2 cases. Syntax A:               Format[Foo[x_,y_]]:=MatrixForm[{{x},{y}}]     Foo[1,2]      Syntax B:               Foo[x_,y_]:=Format[MatrixForm[{{x},{y}}]]     Foo[1,2]      My confusion is about why can we use `Format` on the left side? It seems to be counter intuitive as in most programming language, definition should be on the right side. Could you explain why?
