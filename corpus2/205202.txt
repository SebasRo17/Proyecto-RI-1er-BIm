I am trying to implement basic cons, car and cdr of SCHEME in C. I have made a simple program that allows me to cons two integers as shown in the main program. However, I want my program to be able to cons a 'consed object' with a digit as well as cons a 'consed object' with another 'consed object' as shows below:   * (cons 2 3)   * (cons 2 (cons 2 3))   * (cons (cons 2 3) (cons 2 3)) Since the limitation arises because the data in the struct is of type int, is it possible to have a variable accept multiple data types in C? If yes, how? If not, is there another way to deal with this issue? Here is my code:               #include <stdio.h>     #include <string.h>          typedef struct cons_object {     int data;     struct node* next;     } cons_object;          cons_object* cons(int x, int y )     {     cons_object* car = NULL;     cons_object* cdr = NULL;     car = malloc(sizeof(struct cons_object));     cdr = malloc(sizeof(struct cons_object));     car->data = x;     car->next = cdr;     cdr->data = y;     cdr->next = NULL;     return car; /*returns the pointer car*/     }          int car(cons_object* list) /*takes in a consed object*/     {     cons_object* car = list;     int y;     y = car->data;     return y;     }          int cdr(cons_object* list)     {     cons_object* cdr = list;     cdr = cdr->next;     int z;     z= cdr->data;     return z;          }          int main ()     {     int y = car (cons(33,42));     printf("%d\n",y);     int z = cdr (cons(3,4));     printf("%d\n",z);     return 0;          }
