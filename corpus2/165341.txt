So I'm thinking about applying for a entry level position in the software industry but my limited experience working and all my notable experience in college is with game technologies. Sure, the languages transfer over well but most of the technologies I have experience with are all related to graphics programming, engines of various types, and such, and do not transfer over at all. I feel like it would be inappropriate to just take my game programming resume and basically replace the word game with software for the reasons mentioned but on the other hand if I take them out I will only have languages and some technologies that I have some small passing experience with- which will obviously not reflect well on me. Should I leave them out or put them in, and if so how can I spin them to be appropriate?
