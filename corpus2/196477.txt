I need to implement some graph partitioning algorithms for my thesis. I have mostly Windows experience. I would like to know if it is hard to migrate c++ console program to Linux. I want to program it on Windows but I want to test and compile it on Linux as well. It will be pure cli application, with no use of windows APi or anything. I just need to use some external libraries. Specifically GNU linear programming kit and GNU scientific library GSL. I found out, there are windows versions of these libraries, what does it mean for me?, should I compile it on Windows with windows version package and on Linux with linux package. I would like someone to bring a bit clarity to this, I am really not very experienced programmer, so any advice will help. Also I would like to ask, if there is diference if I use Visual Studio for programming or some other IDE in matter of portability issues. Thanks in advance for any help.
