I have a simple For[] loop:               For[rPos = 0, rPos<=(2 N[Pi]), rPos += radiusInc,         zPotential = 0;         xPos = rDistance Cos[rPos];         yPos = rDistance Sin[rPos];         zPos = planeDepth;         AppendTo[zField, {xPos,yPos, zPos, zPotential}];          ];      The only line of the body that is executed is:               zPotential = 0;      At the end, zField has zero items. If I set a breakpoint on the second or third line it never hit. I know that For[] and Do[] loops are discouraged, but I do not see the cause of this problem.
