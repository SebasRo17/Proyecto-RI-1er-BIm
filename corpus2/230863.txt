I think I generally know what the Garbage Collector in Java does, but It's praised a lot, so I thought maybe I'm missing something about it's functionality. What I know is, that the GC takes care of erasing from the memory objects that have no reference to them, and thus are unreachable by the programmer. For example, if inside a loop I'm constantly creating a `new Object()`, the previous ones will eventually get deleted by the GC (correct me if I'm wrong). This is very useful for me as a Java programmer, and spares me a lot of headache that I assume C++ programmers have to deal with - manually deleting objects from the memory (again, correct me if I'm wrong). This feature is awesome, but is there anything more to the Garbage Collector? Am I missing something?
