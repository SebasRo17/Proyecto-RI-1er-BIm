I have a question about whether we should use different Data access layers for different database providers like SQL Server, MySQL Server, Oracle etc.. Is it not better to use a single data access layer with the ORM or like mappings so that the database specific activities are taken care of with less coding than complete duplication of code across different data access layers. Give me your suggestions along with references to use in case of C# programming language in .NET platform.
