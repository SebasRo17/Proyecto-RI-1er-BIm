For external usage, I set output in `MathMLForm` by using `$PrePrint=MathMLForm` Everything goes well but makes graphics rendered in `MathMLForm` as well. How could I make graphics rendered as image? > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WClu4.png) * * * New added: Thanks for @Kuba, But I am facing another problem when execute script like:               Table[Plot[f[x], {x, -2 Pi, 2 Pi}, Exclusions -> {1/f[x] == 0}],            {f, {Tan, Cot, Csc, Sec}}]      The final result is not a type of graphics, but it contains graphics. So it rendered in MathML finally. > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qOMsT.png)
