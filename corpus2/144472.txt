For example, `ISerializable` and the `Serializable` Attribute are both in the `System.Runtime.Serialization` namespace, but not the assembly of the same name. On the other hand, `DataContract` attributes are in the namespace/assembly `System.Runtime.Serialization`. This causes confusion when a class can have `using System.Runtime.Serialization` but still not have reference to the `System.Runtime.Serialization` assembly, meaning `DataContract` cannot be found. Should this be avoided in practice, or is it common for namespaces to be split over multiple assemblies? What other issues should one be careful of when doing this?
