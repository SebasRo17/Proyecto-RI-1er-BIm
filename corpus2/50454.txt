I am calculating approximations using wavelets but outside the multi resolution analysis framework; particularly, I am not using the built-in wavelet transforms. Still, I need to calculate coefficients and therefore I am wondering how to calculate the support of a given _wave_ in order to know where to start and stop calculating coefficients for `WaveletPhi[wave]` and `WaveletPsi[wave]` for a given resolution level. Therefore, I need to know the support for a given wavelet. I suspect that I could use `WaveletFilterCoefficients[wave,"PrimalHighpass"]` and, similarly for `"PrimalLowpass"`; but it is just a hunch, not sure how. Basically, I am after something along the lines of: `WaveletSupport[wave]` -> {a,b} support of given wavelet (For the moment just orthogonal wavelets, not biorthogonal). Thanks.
