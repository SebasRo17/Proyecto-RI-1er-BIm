Is support for non-english characters common in programming languages? I mean, technically, I would think it is feasable, but I don't have any experience in anything other than english, so I don't know how common it is. I know that there are non-english based programming languages, but can something like C#, C++, C, Java, or Python support non-english classes/methods/variables? Example in go (url, http://play.golang.org/p/wRYCNVdbjC)               package main          import "fmt"          type 世界 struct {         世界 string     }          func main() {         fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")         世界 := new(世界)         世界.世界 = "hello world"         fmt.Println(世界.世界)     }
