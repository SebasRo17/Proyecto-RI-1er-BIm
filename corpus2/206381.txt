I will be moving workplace in the near future and I believe they will be very interested in my experience of Scrum and how it may relate to their business. I am trying to understand if it will work in their environment. My current place of work we have a 2 products/2 backlogs/2 separate teams. These backlogs are obviously prioritised based on what the business thinks it most needs for a platform that we develop. The place I will be moving to however has many projects on the go all at the same time with (2/3 individuals working on each), small bits of work come in and are fixed on a daily basis and I imagine all the customer deliverables are roughly equally as important. So I'm wondering if anyone has experience of Scrum in a similar environment, what real examples have you got of things that worked? What didn't work? What considerations need to there for Scrum to work in this situation? There are a few aspects that I'm not sure how would work out well:   1. I believe people in teams will work across projects, and therefore potentially across scrum teams if broken down.   2. How do you go about handling priority on so many moving parts which are probably changing frequently and have their own timescales?   3. If you have a scrum team that works on several projects (some many only require 1 Dev) then how do you understand the context of the stand-up?
