So I have a relatively simple system. A **mobile client creates records in a sqlite database that I would like to have synced to a remote SQL server (that is shared with other mobile clients)**. So when I create a new record in the phone's sqlite table, I then push that change to my remote service through a RESTful API. The problem I'm having, is **how do I order the primary keys so that there isn't collisions in the data** (i.e. a record in the phone has the same primary key as a completely different record on the server). **What is the usual "best practice for referencing the record on the client, and for referencing the same record on the server?**
