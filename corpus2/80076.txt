I know Joel says that rewrites are always bad, m'kay, but that is assuming the person who wrote the code in the first place had some idea what they were doing. I've got a medium sized (for a single developer anyway, ~18k LoC) C++ project, which I started when I did not truly know C++. Therefore, there are several things that are just... wrong. Wrong is the only way to describe it. It needs to be rewritten, plain and simple. However -- I've spent a long freaking time doing the rewrite -- bugs in the original aren't getting fixed. However, some of the bugs themselves are problems with the architecture of the original tool -- and some of that is what I need to fix would require touching almost every line of code anyway. On one hand, I feel fixing the bugs in the old program is going to be a massive wasted effort, because those bugs aren't even possible with the new design I've been working on. On the other hand, I've felt that I've neglected users of my original program because it's not been updated in so long. What should I do?
