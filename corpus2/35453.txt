I am trying to use a compiled function in order to save time...               LegrendeTransform = Compile[{y},  MaxValue[Sin[x] - x *y  , x]]      Now I want to to evaluate and plot:               Plot[{LegrendeTransform[y]}, {y, 0, 1}]      But I get this error:               CompiledFunction::cfse: Compiled expression 0.9995462353179709` should be a machine-size integer. >>     CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at instruction 1; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation. >>      Could you explain the reason for this result? The number 0.9995462353179709 is so similar to 1 that I would have no problem if Mathematica decides to approximate it with an integer.... A.
