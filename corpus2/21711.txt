Here is my simple example, and in this case function `DeleteDuplicates` does not work as expected. I want to `FindRoot` of my function $\chi[\nu]$, and since function $\chi$ is very sensitive to initial guess I decided to generate many initial conditions and leave only those solutions which are distinct. For this purpose I want to apply `DeleteDuplicates` on the resulting list of solution. Here is the definition of my function:               χ[ν_] := 2*PolyGamma[1] - PolyGamma[1/2 + I*ν] - PolyGamma[1/2 - I*ν]      Here I generate many solution according to many random initial guesses               m = Table[v /. FindRoot[χ[v] == -1.2 - 0.2*I, {v, RandomComplex[]}], {i, 1, 10}]      And finally, I want to leave only distinct solutions:               DeleteDuplicates[m]      Unfortunately, the operation `DeleteDuplicates[m]` does not change the list `m`, although there are many identical values. Namely:               DeleteDuplicates[m]      > >     {1.06423 + 0.0968739 I, 1.06423 + 0.0968739 I, >      1.06423 + 0.0968739 I, 1.06423 + 0.0968739 I, 0.0250407 + 1.00352 I, >      1.06423 + 0.0968739 I, 1.06423 + 0.0968739 I, 1.06423 + 0.0968739 I, >      0.0250407 + 1.00352 I, 1.06423 + 0.0968739 I} >   I'm puzzled. Any help or suggestions are very welcome! Thanks!
