I have been teaching an OOP course for almost one year from now. The premise of the school is to use Java by using NetBeans for the programming part. I have seen the following scenarios:   * The students get overwhelmed by the amount of information about the different controls to use, so they lost focus on the programming paradigm taught (in our case OOP)   * They rely on their memory, mainly of the different Java GUI tools Is the best approach to teach the OOP topics by making use only of console and with little or no use of the Net Beans GUI? Could that help the students to focus more on the logic of the program and maybe to learn how to do quick tests? Thanks
