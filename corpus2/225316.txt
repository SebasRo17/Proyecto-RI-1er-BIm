Given that all else is equal, and there are no coding standards defining the best approach, what would be the recommended way in C++ to check that a value exists and return it if it does? For example, something like one of these declarations:               bool getMethod(double& ret);          double getMethod(bool& ok);          void getMethod(bool& ok, double& ret);          pair<bool, double> getMethod();          bool checkMethod(); // eg if (checkMethod())     double getMethod(); //        result = getMethod();      or something else, like return a struct The value may exist about 50% of the time. The existing code already does a lot of the last method, i.e. using a checkMethod() but I was wondering if that's really an efficient way to do it - via two calls (half the time).
