How to tackle 2-D and 3-D space in data ? lets say you are working on a power grid problem. You need to represent Towers; transmission lines; transformers and every thing else in a 2-D space. How would you design a Data Model for this 2-D space ? I can use a               class tower  {     int x_cor;     int y_cor;     string power_properties     }      But how to represent the ... say map of the power grid itself ? is there some standard solution to this ? some logical template people follow here ? i want to be able to slice this map by shape or area etc; i should be able to compose small maps to make a large one .. So what is the solution here ?? By the way i am not working on a power-grid project (LOL) so please keep answers generic .. P.S. non-noobs please help me make the question better.
