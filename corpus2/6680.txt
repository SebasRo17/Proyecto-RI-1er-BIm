I am dealing with a non-linear function of three variables, namely R0k, R1 and alpha. To find its maximum value, I divided the three variables into grids and maximized the function by plotting the maximum value of the function on the grid of alpha, on all the grid points of the two variables. Now I want the value of all those alpha at which the function attained its maximum value. How do I find it? Here is my code:               tbl = Table[       Flatten[{R0k, R1,          Max[Table[bTransp61[(i - 1) Pi 45/180/78]^2, {i, 0, 79}]]}],         {R1, 0, 21.43, .1}, {R0k, 2*(R1/R1el)^2*R0kel - R0kel, 19.71, .1}]     tbl >> "datafile.nb"     Export["tbl.dat", tbl]     tbl2 = Table[Flatten[tbl, 1], {1}]     ListPlot3D[tbl2, PlotRange -> {0, 0.0004}]
