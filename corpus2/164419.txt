Context: I'm taking several classes this semester in which I'll be coding. Here is a list of possible languages I'll be using:   * Java   * C (system and embedded level)   * C++ (contest programming)   * VHDL (for FPGA work)   * Python   * Scheme Is it possible to keep all these languages floating around in one's head? How can one code without having to look up reference material every time they start working?
