> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is the 80 character limit still relevant in times of widescreen monitors? I used to set a vertical line set at 80 characters in my text editor and then I added carriage returns if the lines got too long. I later increased the value to 135 characters. I started using word wrap and not giving myself a limit but tried to keep lines short if I could because it took a lot of time shortening my lines. People at work use word wrap and don't give themselves a limit.. is this the correct way? What are you meant to do ? Many thanks.
