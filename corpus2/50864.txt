I have a column vector of the form $\\{1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3\\}^t$ and an associated matrix that has the same number of rows as the column vector, $6$, and a number of columns that is equal to the maximum of the values in the vector, $3$. I would like to construct a matrix that has a specific value at the positions $\\{1, 1\\}, \\{2, 1\\}, \\{3, 2\\}, \\{4,3\\}, \\{5,2\\}, \\{6, 3\\}$ and zeroes everywhere else, that is, the row index corresponds to the row index in the column vector and the column index corresponds to the value at that row index. A solution using a loop is clear to me, is there also a nifty Mathematica trick that does the job?
