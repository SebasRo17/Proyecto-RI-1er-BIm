Consider the following example:               4.*Mean@Table[ Boole[Random[]^2 + Random[]^2 < 1], {10^6}] // AbsoluteTiming     (*{0.408023, 3.14105}*)          With[{n = 10^6},       4. Mean@Boole@Thread[(RandomReal[1, n]^2 + RandomReal[1, n]^2) < 1]] // AbsoluteTiming     (*{1.460084, 3.14276}*)      I expected the second method to be more efficient since it used vectorized operations, but it works slowly, and I don't know why. Is it possible to make it faster? I used Mathematica 9 on Windows 7.
