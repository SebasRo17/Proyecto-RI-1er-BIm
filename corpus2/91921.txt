Until recently, I've been getting along just fine with my Computer Science graduate degree from a respectable university, but now my employer has instituted a policy that employees in my position must carry a certification from a short list of possibilities. I've never had to care about this stuff before, and just Googling around leads mostly to scammy-looking sites trying to sell you "study software", sample exams, or just the outright test answers (supposedly). So, I have to choose a certification to go for, and have no way of knowing if any of them are worth more (to a real programmer) than the paper they're printed on. I could post a big list here and have people pick it apart, but I figure "teach a man to fish" is perhaps more useful. If you have a positive / negative experience with a particular cert, by all means let me know, but I'd really prefer to be better equipped to evaluate them myself.
