First let me say that I think that an agile process can work because of the following underlying principles:   * It brings focus   * Limits the noise which really brings focus Secondly I am wondering what are the initial conditions needed so that an Agile process can succeed? For example do we need to have:   * No existing bugs   * Fully automated test process or at least a highly automated test process   * People dedicated to the project   * More clearly defined new development   * Development that is not _make it faster or more stable_   * ? So what do you need to make it successful? Are there different Agile implementations that better handle not having some of these initial conditions?
