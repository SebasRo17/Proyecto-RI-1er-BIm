What's the best/easiest way to get into the MS BI stack on my own (preferably with a [kindle] book)? Specifically, I'd like to learn more about SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS in that order. I've tried looking at books on amazon, but I really have no idea. Some background: I just graduated with my bachelor's in computer science, and am going back for my masters in comp sci. I work right now as a C# developer, with some web and database background. I don't necessarily want to become a BI master, but I'd like to gain an intermediate-level understanding of the platform.
