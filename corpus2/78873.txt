I have a problem convincing my team mates why we shouldn't use (directly reference) the controller in the view when developing components in the spirit of MVC. I have invoked decoupling and natural intuition, but still those arguments didn't get through. They say, in their defense, that this is a normal compromise. What arguments are convincing? Or they are right? How can the practice of using the controller in the view could affect a project on the long run?
