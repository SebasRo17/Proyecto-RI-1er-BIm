To test a method that returns a clone of the object it is called on, i need to re-run the test suite on the newly created object if i am to ensure that full functionality is retained, i found my instinct was to clone the object then call all other test methods in sequence i order to reduce code duplication. However that approach now smells to me and i can't pinpoint why. Is there a better way to test this kind of functionality?
