`ByteCount` and `LeafCount` don't really work, as shown below. _Mathematica 9.0_ .. on a _32 bit Windows_ machine.               f[n_] := Block[{k = f[n - 1]}, {k, k}]     f[0] = x      `LeafCount[f[k]]` for particular small integers `k` returns the number `2^(k+1) - 1` e.g.   for `k = 3`, it returns `15`. But it returns the same answer for `k = 30`, `31`, .... It returns `2147483647`, which, probably not coincidentally, is `2^31 - 1`. `ByteCount` has a similar problem in running out of bits in its counter. Anyway, `ByteCount` also lies in a different way... because it doesn't take into account the sharing that (say) `f[70]` has. Without the sharing implicit in the formula above, I could not compute that -- it has $2.36 \times 10^{21}$ leaves. They are just not different leaves. Presumably techniques that produce expressions with smaller memory footprints should be preferable.
