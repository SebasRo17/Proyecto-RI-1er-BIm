**Problem** Using Mathematica's `Solve` operator can sometimes lead to an output involving a positive and negative root (say when solving for a variable such as `N^2`. **What Is Happening** Here I simply have a defined function `Radial` followed by implementation (`Solve`) of that function.               Radial[n_,l_,r_]:= LaguerreL[n-l-1, 2*l+1, ((2*Z)*r)/(n*a)] * ((Z*r)/(n*a))^l Exp[-((Z*r)/(n*a))];     Solve[Integrate[             N^2 Radial[1,0,r] r^2,              {r,0,\[Infinity]},             Assumptions -> {Z>0,a>0,{Z,a},Reals}           ]== 1,N]          Out[1]= {{N -> -(Z^(3/2)/(Sqrt[2] a^(3/2)))}, {N -> Z^(3/2)/(Sqrt[2] a^(3/2))}}      _Mathematica_ is kind enough to give me both positive and negative roots. **What I Want** I would like to suppress the negative root, leaving only the positive root solution, i.e. `{N -> (2 Z^(3/2))/a^(3/2)}` **What I've Tried** Here I include a couple things I have tried (some suggested by the kind people in chat).   1. Inserting `N>=0` into `Assumptions` : Resulted in two roots.   2. Inserting `N>=0` and `N` into the `Reals` section. : Resulted in two roots.   3. Inserting `&& N>0` following the `==1` combined with all possible permutations of Tries (1) and (2). : Resulted in no answer given (nor any errors). Hopefully there is a simple way of fixing this (and not some convoluted input syntax). However, for the benefit of the community, any suggestion is welcomed. For my particular case, the simpler the better.
