I am trying to place a curly brace within a plot such that the top/bottom of the curly brace line up with two horizontal lines in the plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yLqCe.png) I have not been able to find a way to make the curly brace have the right size without setting the size explicitly by hand. Insetting a Text object doesn't work as the font size is used to scale text, and guessing the right font size is a complete guessing game. I settled upon using "Pane" with the "ResizeToFit" ImageSizeAction set, however I am not sure how to then specify the Inset size or the ImageSize for pane to get the desired results. Here is the code I am using to generate this plot. ImageSize being set to "5" is just a guess to get approximately the right size, but ideally I want the top/bottom of the curly brace to exactly line up with the two horizontal dashed lines:               f = 1/x;     \[Epsilon]pl =        Plot[{f}, {x, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> Black,         PlotStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[1]];          \[Epsilon]1pl =        Plot[{f}, {x, 0.2, 0.4},         PlotStyle -> Directive[Red, AbsoluteThickness[1.5]]];     \[Epsilon]1dashed =        ListPlot[{{{0.1, f /. x -> 0.27}, {0.27, f /. x -> 0.27}}, {{0.1,            f /. x -> 0.3}, {0.3, f /. x -> 0.3}}},         PlotStyle -> Directive[Red, Dashed, AbsoluteThickness[1]],         Joined -> True];          Show[\[Epsilon]pl, \[Epsilon]1pl, \[Epsilon]1dashed,       PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 6}}, Axes -> False, Frame -> True,       ImageSize -> 600,       FrameStyle -> Directive[AbsoluteThickness[1], FontSize -> 24],       FrameTicks -> False, FrameLabel -> {"\!\(\*     StyleBox[\"r\",\nFontSlant->\"Italic\"]\)", "\!\(\*     StyleBox[\"\[Epsilon]\",\nFontSlant->\"Italic\"]\)"},       Epilog ->        Inset[Pane["{", ImageSize -> 5,          ImageSizeAction ->           "ResizeToFit"], {0.095, ((f /. x -> 0.27) + (f /. x -> 0.3))/         2}, {0, 0}, {Automatic, (f /. x -> 0.27) - (f /. x -> 0.3)}]]      Additionally, I would like to be able to scale the curly brace such that the original aspect ratio isn't maintained (i.e. the width of the curly brace will be a fixed value, but the height can vary). What is the best way to go about doing this?
