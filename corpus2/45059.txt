`ContourPlot3D[{x^2 + y^2 == z, 2 y == z, x^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 == 1}, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -0.5, 1}, {z, 0, 2}]` The above isn't what I'm seeking. I'd like to plot $x^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 = 1$ in 2D, so as a circle on the xy-plane ($z = 0$), in the same graph as the other two functions that I'd like in 3D. How would I do this? halirutan's answer nearly resolves this, but his plot still contains $x^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 = 1$ in 3D for all $z$.   I want solely the trace in the xy-plane, for the combined plot of all 3 functions.
