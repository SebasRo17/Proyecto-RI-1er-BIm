I have a problem that, admittedly, I have already solved using `Select` instead, but it is irking me that I cannot seem to construct the right pattern to solve it using `Cases`. I would like the output of               Cases[         {{{1, 2}, {3}, {4, 5}}, {{6}, {}}, {{}, {}}},         (* THE CORRECT PATTERN HERE *)     ]      to be               {{{1, 2}, {3}, {4, 5}}, {{6}, {}}}      In other words, I would like a pattern that picks up all the elements of the outer list that have at least one non-empty list as an element. Thanks in advance for your help.
