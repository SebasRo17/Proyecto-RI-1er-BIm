A simple example about what I need to do. For example, I have three functions:               t1[x,t]     t2[x,t]     t3[x,t]      and,               t3[x_,t_]:=t1[x,t]+t2[x,t]       What is the best way to create a function t4[x,t] that is numerically "equal" to t3[x,t] but is not function of t1[x,t] and t2[x,t] in order to avoid a circular reference in a While loop program? Regards!
