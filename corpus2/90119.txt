I'm working on a project and I've found that I've modeled the two largest components as trees. My main uses so far are:   1. Generically model physical containers (and sub containers, sub sub containers etc)   2. Model liquid samples (and sub samples, and sample derivatives - and subs of those, etc) I now need to model some events based on the shipment of samples e.g. collected at location X, when arrive at processing centre do Y It now seems natural to model the events as a tree to denote which events follow on from others. I'm starting to wonder if I am just seeing trees everywhere because I want to, or if its a legit approach? **Edit To Answer Some Points Raised** Everyone seems to agree with trees for the containers. For the liquid samples, although there are various types - what I really need to track is parentage so that given any sample, I can quickly find all things that derived from it in some way. I have been told I can assume that samples will not be combined so all sub samples (or derivatives) will have only 1 parent. As to the events, yeah I think I was just going for a tree for ease. It doesn't make much sense to me after reading comments and further thought. Thanks all for the input.
