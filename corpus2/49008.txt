I am running an animation with the following command:               files = FileNames[NotebookDirectory[] <> "*.dat"];      MTnumbers = FileNames[NotebookDirectory[] <> "MTnumbers.txt"];          data = Import[#, "Table"] & /@ files     MT = Import[#, "List"] & /@ MTnumbers               coords = {{#1 - (#3/2), #2 - (height/2)}, {#1 + (#3/2), #2 + (height/            2)}} & @@@ #[[All, 2 ;;]] & /@ data;          height = 2;          colors = {Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue,      Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue,      Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue,      Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue};     Animate[Graphics[{Sequence @@ {colors[[#]],         Rectangle @@ (coords[[#]][[t]])} & /@ MT[[1]]},     PlotRange -> {{-1000, 1000}, {-200, 200}},      ImageSize -> {1000, 200}], {t, Range[0, 7000]}]           Export["tubuli.avi", %];      As soon as I try to export this output Mathematica crashes. When I increase the number of rectangles to about 150 the simulation crashes without giving an output. Is my computer too weak or am I doing something wrong? EDIT: The data is in the following zip archive you just need the notebook and the data in the same folder and it should work. https://www.dropbox.com/s/iegdb1a031i4mn6/data.zip
