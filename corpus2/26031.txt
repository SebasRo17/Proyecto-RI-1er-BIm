I have a large sphere of radius $R_1$ which I would like to pack with $N$ smaller radius of radius $r_2<R_1$ arranged in a face-centered cubic (fcc) packing arrangement (i.e. Kepler's optimal sphere packing geometry). Is there a way for me to use Mathematica's built-in LatticeData functionality to accomplish this, perhaps with an after-the-fact pruning step? Can I do this for the other lattice types Mathematica has data for?
