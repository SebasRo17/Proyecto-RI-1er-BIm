A simple question but maybe also interesting for others. I have the simple differential equation:               a'[t] == -r      The quantity a has a physical meaning and can not be below 0. The ODE is of course simple to solve but I don't know how to tell DSolve to restet `a` to `0` if it is below zero. My approach now is to simple manipulate the result:               sol = DSolve[{a'[t] == -r, a[0] == 1}, a[t], t]     solspecial = sol /. r -> 0.1     Table[{t, Max[(a[t] /. solspecial), 0]}, {t, 0, 15}]     ListLinePlot[%, PlotRange -> All, Frame -> True,       FrameLabel -> {"time", "a"}]      ![fig 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y8TUZ.png) Is there a better way to do this and already state that `a` can not be below 0 in DSolve or NDSolve? edit: to clarify only negative values are reset to 0 and if `r=Sin[t]` the value should "come back". ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DScvI.png)
