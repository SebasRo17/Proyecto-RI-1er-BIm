I'm about to write some webservices from scratch and I'm a bit confused about the approach to take. The obvious choices were WCF and MVC 4 Web API, but I am having a hard time deciding. The two factors that are important are making it self-describing (eg, MEX etc.) and easy to consume (Maybe RESTful?). I'm struggling to pick which one to discard in favour of the other. The way things are going, I'm hearing more and more about REST so I should probably go in that direction, but apparently that's also possible to implement using WCF. I'm quite torn about how best to proceed, and there isn't a lot of information out there saying "Oh, these days developers always use X because Y" so it's tricky to judge the merits of each, and how easy those merits are to implement.
