I have a data set of `x,y,z` values and I fit a function of `x,y` to the data. This works, but I can't come up with a nice way to visualize the data. 3D plots are not very clear on paper and a contour plot of two data sets doesn't work either. What would be a clear and simple way to show the data and the fit?               data = Import["https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3538352/data.dat"];     fit = NonlinearModelFit[            data,             A*Exp[-(y - y0 - y1 Cos[2 (x/180*Pi)])^2/(w0 + w1 Cos[2 x/180*Pi])^2],            {A, {y0, 0.04}, {y1, 0.00}, {w0, 0.03}, {w1, 0.01}},            {x, y}           ];     Show[          ListPointPlot3D[data],          Plot3D[fit["BestFit"], {x, 0, 180}, {y, 0, 0.1}]         ]      **EDIT:** What I decided to do for now is using a `DensityPlot` of the data with the `ContourPlot` of the fit (similar to Rahul Narain's answer). This does not really show the quality of the model, so I will add other plots, candidates are   * residuals vs. predicted values (similar to chris's answer)   * distribution of residuals (chris's answer)   * Q-Q plot using `QuantilePlot[fit["FitResiduals"]]`   * the plot Rahul Narain suggested ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LlTpY.png)
