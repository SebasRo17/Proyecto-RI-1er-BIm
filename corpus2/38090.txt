I am trying to plot polygons for multiple countries, say `"UnitedStates"` and `"Canada"`. US data is generated thus:               coordsUS = CountryData["UnitedStates", "Coordinates"]      and Canadian data thus:               coordsCanada = CountryData["Canada", "Coordinates"]      I want to pass the combination of these two lists into the routines on this page. I cannot figure out how to combine these two lists into a single list of the same structure. The structure is:               {{{a,b},{c,d},{e,f}}}      I know how to combine lists of the following form:               {{a,b},{c,d},{e,f}}       but the extra depth is confounding me. I try putting the latter into a list thus:               l = {{a,b},{c,d},{e,f}}      z = {l}      but that does not work. `AppendTo` does not work either. Help is appreciated. Thanks! -Tony
