I want to make a simple demonstration using Manipulate in which I have one or two input fields show depending on whether or not another control is True or False. How can I achieve such functionality?               Manipulate["DoSomethig", {ShowMore, {True, False}}, WhatShouldBeHere?]      ![ShowMore is unchecked](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9S8Xv.png) ![ShowMore is checked](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QJLp5.png)
