I want to solve for P in this equation:               Integrate[1/((P/(M*V)) - r*g - c*A*(V^2)*p/(2 M)), {V, 0, 26.82}] = s      , where all constants are given except P. I've tried:               FindRoot [Integrate[1/((P/(M*V)) - r*g - c*A*(V^2)*p/(2 M)), {V, 0, 26.82}] == s, {P, 0}]      but I get this error: > FindRoot::nlnum: "The function value {Undefined} is not a list of numbers > with dimensions {1} at {P} = {0.`}." Any ideas on what I should try? I appreciate the help!
