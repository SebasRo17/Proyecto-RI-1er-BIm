I've read a blog(in Chinese only) in which the author had jeered at Java programmers who know little about C and system programming. The author illustrated how he had found the deep reason of a Java NIO Selector exception using his knownledge of C and Windows/Linux system API. The IOException is thrown with message "Unable to establish loopback connection" when calling java.nio.channels.Selector.open() too many times. What he had found was that for each opening of Selector, a pair of TCP connections were created in Windows and a pair of pipes were created in Linux. In another blog, he also mentioned that GNU Java compiler was a clever implementation than Sun Java. What he said seems completely new and interesting to me. But I am not sure if C/system knowledge is the only way to figure out such problems quickly. Is it really worth spending much time on learning those knowledges for Java programmers?
