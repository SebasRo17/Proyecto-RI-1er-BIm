The more I explore Github, the more I like it. I really enjoy how coding is becoming more social. I'm curious as to if there are _any bad practices_ that programmers should avoid in sharing their code with each other. And in naming bad practices, **what are the best practices for code sharing**? For example: Is it a bad practice for a single repo to have multiple scripts/projects named **'MiscProjects'**? Where this repo, as the name suggest, is a collection of miscellaneous small scripts and projects. This may resemble how a programmer organizes projects on his/her local storage, but it's possibly not optimal for code sharing? Maybe if a good README/documentation is done, it would be better? Or as long as it's well documented, anything goes?
