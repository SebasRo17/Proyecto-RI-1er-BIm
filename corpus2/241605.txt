I am writing the documentation for a piece of software which I have made but I don't understand what it means in some aspects. It asks me to write about backup procedures but what exactly does this mean? Does this mean like backing up the database on another hosting service or something else entirely? I am dumbfounded by what troubleshooting guidelines are as well. If you have any idea what this could mean feel free to give your insight even if you aren't 100% sure in case it could spark what it means inside of me. Thanks.
