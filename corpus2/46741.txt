In order to record animations more easily while using _Mathematica_ on _Linux_ , I would need to know how to get the position of three clicks. The following picture (main part generated by `Panel[Graphics@Disk[], ImageSize -> 200]`) shows the idea: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ryLAL.png) `Dynamic@MousePositon[]` shows the coordinates of the mouse within the _Mathematica_ window but how to save the position of the clicks? (knowing that `EventHandler` works only in the Output cell). Then the idea is to get `posi={xi,yi}` and to record the screen (using byzanz) automatically:               time = 5; delay = 2; path = "test";     toGIF = ToString@StringForm[       "byzanz-record --duration=`` --x=`` --y=`` --width=`` --height=`` --delay=``",       time, First@pos1, Last@pos1, Subtract[#, #2] & @@ (First /@ {pos2, pos1}),       Subtract[#, #2] & @@ (Last /@ {pos3, pos2}), delay] <> path <> ".gif"      Then `Run@toGIF` would produce the GIF.
