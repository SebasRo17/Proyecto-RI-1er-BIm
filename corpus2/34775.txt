The wiktionary has two different definitions: >   1. Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome > intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem. >   2. The actually useless activity you do that appears important when you > are consciously or unconsciously procrastinating about a larger problem. > This post defines it as: > yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some stupid, fiddly > little task that bears no obvious relationship to what you're supposed to be > working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal relations links what you're > doing to the original meta-task. I personally prefer the final definition because it contains the word "fiddly" which I think perfectly describes a typical yak shaving task. What is the best definition you've come across or can provide?
