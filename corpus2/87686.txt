Many projects combine languages, for example on the web with the ubiquitous SQL + server-side language + markup du jour + JavaScript + CSS mix (often in a single function). Bash and other shell code is mixed with Perl and Python on the server side, `eval`ed and sometimes even passed through `sed` before execution. Many languages support runtime execution of arbitrary code strings, and in some it seems to be fairly common practice. In addition to advice about **security** and **separation of concerns** ,   1. what **other issues** are there with this type of programming,   2. what can be done to **minimize it** , and   3. is it ever **defensible** (except in the "PHB on the shoulder" situation)? **Edit:** To clarify, this is _not_ about using more than one language for the job - That's a _good thing_ for any but the simplest projects. The issue is mixing languages _in the same file_ , such as magic strings for SQL, Bash & Perl `eval`, and the like.
