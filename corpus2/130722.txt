I'm a little bit confused about 'function' and 'lambda'. I've seen some examples showing that the scheme keyword `lambda` works very similarly to the JavaScript keyword `function`, but I really don't know how they are related. I'm told that 'function' and 'method' can be used interchangeably when speaking about objects in .net. I'm wondering if 'lambda' and 'function' similarly mean the same thing. I wonder if 'lambda' has some esoteric meaning, seeing that the Greek letter lambda (Î») appears in so many avatars on this site. To make things even more confusing, in .net, the functional parts of C# refer to function expressions passed to another function as 'lambda expressions', so the word really seems to be all over the place. I'm also vaguely familiar with the term 'lambda calculus'. What is the difference between a function and a lambda?
