Being interested in C++ performance programming there is one aspect I really have no clue about- and that is the implications of using floating point calculations vs doubles vs normal integer mathematics? What performance issues with these types of calculations should I consider? What other issues need to be considered when deciding which kind of operators to use? All I currently know is that doubles are probably the most expensive because they are larger, floating point is next and then integer calculations are usually the fastest on a CPU because they are much simpler.
