I have a result from _Mathematica_ for which want to have the exact expression, i.e. all of the arguments of type `#` replaced. It is given by:               { a > 0,        Inequality[ 0, Less, r, LessEqual, Root[a^3 #1^2 + a^2 #1^4 - 22 a #1^6 + #1^8 & , 5]]}      where `a` and `r` are the only two variables. What exactly does the `#1` mean here? To which variables does it refer? How do I make _Mathematica_ replace all these place holders with its corresponding variable?
