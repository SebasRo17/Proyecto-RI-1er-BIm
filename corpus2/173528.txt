I have a class named `GuestbookEntry` that maps to the properties that are in the database table named "guestbook". Very simple! Originally, I had a static method named `getActiveEntries()` that retrieved an array of all `GuestbookEntry` objects. Each row in the guestbook table was an object that was added to that array. Then while learning how to properly design PHP classes, I learned some things:   1. Static methods are not desirable.    2. Separation of Concerns   3. Single Responsibility Principle If the `GuestbookEntry` class should only be responsible for managing single guestbook entries then where should this `getActiveEntries()` method most properly go? ## Update: I am looking for an answer that complies with the SOLID acronym principles and allows for test-ability. That's why I want to stay away from static calls/standard functions. DAO, repository, ...? Please explain as though your explanation will be part of "Where to Locate FOR DUMMIES"... :-)
