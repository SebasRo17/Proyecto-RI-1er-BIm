I am here to ask a question that has been asked **many times** before. What programming language should I learn to become a intelligent conceptual programmer? Many people agree, you do not have to learn any one programming language; you need to learn programming as a concept itself (Most of us can become semi proficient in a language under a few weeks). Would it be better to learn procedure or event driven languages for conceptual purposes? Why? Let me be even more precise with my question above on this. I have written lots of basic code and program examples. I feels I have a firm root on basic concepts and now am ready to try some more complicated task like programming a graphic rendering engine or compiler. From what I understand C/C++ should teach me more of the important principles that I may carry over to fields like electrical engineering.
