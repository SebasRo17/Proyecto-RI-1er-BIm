First off this is a copy of my post on pm exchange PM Post. I believe that board is very new and I would also like input from my fellow developers that may not be watching the PM boards. Pasting the other message below. Thanks guys! ..... How do you handle telling your developers where to put the change wether it be a bug or new feature using JIRA? Here is why I ask... For Issues/Bugs I think the use of the Affects and Fix version fields are a no brainier if fix version is 2.5 I know the code needs to go into the 2.5 branch. However to me the wording at least doesn't fit these fields for stories and improvements. An improvement could affect a future version but it doesn't "Fix" something. Using the fields differently between bugs and improvements seems like a bad idea too? I think this would be confusing to the users? Here is an example of what I mean Bug/Issue: set Fix version to the versions you want this bug to fix. Story/Improvement: set the Affects version to where you would like this new feature to go. For both of these scenarios you are saying where to put the code. Using different fields... and if you want to start spelling out WHERE the bug exists (version 1 and 2 but not 1.5) you then use BOTH fields for a bug and one differently for an improvement.
