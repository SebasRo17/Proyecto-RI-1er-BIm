> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is there a canonical book on Ruby on Rails? I just finished working through Peter Cooper's "Beginning Ruby". So now I've got a reasonable grounding in the Ruby language and would like to move onto learning Rails. This question's answers give some good pointers, but I'd like to hear some specific reviews of books and online materials. I generally learn best by working through books with good practical/technical examples AND some passive reading content that breaks up the study between practical and reading sessions (this is what made "Beginning Ruby" great for me), but I'm worried that RoR is evolving fast and that any printed book I order might be obsolete by the time I get it and work through it. Is this a fair worry? Or can anyone recommend a good Rails 3 book that should be up to date at least for the next year or so? Also, I had a brief look at some of the online resources from the other questions, and Rails for Zombies seems to get a lot of praise. Has anyone here actually used it as their introductory guide to Rails? Basically I'd like to hear first-hand accounts of people who went through this "Ruby-to-Rails" learning phase recently and which materials were useful to you.
