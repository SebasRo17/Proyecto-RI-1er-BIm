I've got an issue with my MVC 4 website where iOS Safari is automatically sending the DNT header with the first request to the site. Here's my question on StackOverflow. Even though the iPhone has the DNT setting turned off, it still sends this header. So, my hack to fix this is to create an ActionFilter that will remove that header if it exists. My first attempt was to just add my custom ActionFilter to the FilterConfig.RegisterGlobalFilters method. That did not work (though I didn't have Fiddler in front of my at the time to see what was really going on). As long as my browser (iOS Safari) stays open, it will always remember me, but I want it to remember me between browser sessions. So my next thought is to try adding the removal of that header inside either the Application_BeginRequest, or Session_Start methods in Global.asax file. Here's a handy site that showed what methods were available in the Global.asax file and what order they process in. That leads to my question, at what point in the process of processing a request, do the headers (specifically the DNT header) get analyzed that are used by Forms Authentication [session/cookie]? It would seem that by the time the request gets to my ActionResult method, that the DNT header has already been read and "processed". I want to be able to strip it out at the earliest possible moment. Btw, I'm not at my home computer right now which is where my code is. I'm not going to be able to start working on this until the wife goes to bed (11:00pm) so I want to make sure I have all my eggs in a row before I start working so I can get as much accomplished as quickly as possible. I need to have a big production release tonight, and I'd LIKE to get this fixed as well... Thanks for any help/input if you're able... Edit: Any other suggestions for either this question, or the one that I have referenced/linked above on StackOverflow?
