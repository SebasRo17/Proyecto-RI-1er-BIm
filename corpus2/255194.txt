We all know GPUs are much faster than CPUs for a wide range of applications. When someone asks why we are not just programming for GPUs at all, one of the most common answers is that GPUs are not good for everything - i.e., they fail to do some things that CPUs do easily. Well, no wonder: after all, they are not **meant to be used for general computations**. GPUs are strongly tied to games and graphical applications, not only having specialized functions for those, but often being advertised for them. My question is: why, then, aren't we building and using processors that are **actually designed for parallel programs**?
