I have a list of strings in where each element of the list is in this form:               {"created_at":"Thu Aug 08 20:53:26 +0000 2013","id":365576505679568896,"id_str":"365576505679568896","text":"Who wears it better? #TBT http:\/\/t.co\/vAXNgiRmYo","source":"web"      I am trying to extract some specific parts of each element. I prepared this function:               extract[string_] := StringCases[string, {         "\"created_at\":\"" ~~ Shortest@x__ ~~ "\",\"id\":" :> x,         "\",\"id\":" ~~ Shortest@b__ ~~ ",\"id_str\":\"" :> b,         ",\"id_str\":\"" ~~ Shortest@c__ ~~ "\",\"text\":\"" :> c,         "\",\"text\":\"" ~~ Shortest@d__ ~~ "\",\"source\":\"" :> d,         "\",\"source\":\"" ~~ Shortest@e__ ~~ "\",\"truncated\":" :> e        }     ]      And then               extract/@listOFelements      But as example for the element above I get this result:               {"Thu Aug 08 20:53:26 +0000 2013", "365576505679568896", "web"}      Some elements like the text flanked by `"\",\"text\":\""` and `"\",\"source\":\""` are not detected from the string. How should I make it possible to detect it?
