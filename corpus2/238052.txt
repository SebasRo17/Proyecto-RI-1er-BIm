I want to implement a system which store the profiles of employee and the resources that they have. There are many types of resources, such as the documents they produced, the techniques they have...etc. I store the properties of nodes and relationships on MongoDB, and only store the relationship on Neo4j. But I face a problem, how could I link these two database? For example, when I want to find A's friends who get JAVA license in 2012, I have to find the id of people on MongoDB, and use this id the find the friends on Neo4j, and then I have to check who have JAVA license in 2012 on MongoDB... I think it is very complex and have some performance issue, how could I solve it? The probable solution I think is storing data both on MongoDB and Neo4j. When I want to do complex search, I can only use Neo4j. The point of having properties in Mongo is that it has better performance on search by properties, and I think it is better to manage data on MongoDB.
