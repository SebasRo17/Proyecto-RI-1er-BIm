I have a project for my main application and some projects for modules that are used by this application. Following I will reduce it to the main project and one module project. Both projects share some dependencies, but the module project is also a dependency of the main project. I thought that it would be best to create a parent pom that includes all shared dependencies. Additionally I wanted to create Project Aggregation as described on http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the- pom.html, to build everything in one step. But I would also have to declare the module project as a dependency of the main project. I don't think that this is a good approach and I am getting confused because the projects are referenced at many places. Do you have any solutions for creating a clean structure?
