I want to compare two XML files logically. That means that following text lines should be the same for the comparison tool: 1.               <test><hello/><test/>      2.               <test>                                <hello/>                         <test/>      I'm a Windows developer and tried some comparison tools now: Beyond Compare, WinMerge, Total Commander, but all of them compare XML like a normal text comparison tool. Are there any other tools or approaches I can take?
