In the past I did a freelancing project for someone where I wrote a couple of image filters. Nothing fancy, and a very very low cost project for them. I was wondering, if I wish to use these in a project of mine, would I legally/ethically be allowed to do that? If I couldn't use the exact code, could I at least use the general data I used to make them. (I modeled the filters in Photoshop and then coded a duplicate filter in a programming language.) My specific work was done through freelancer.com and we had no special terms or conditions.
