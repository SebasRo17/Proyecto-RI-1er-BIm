When I have to implement a new feature or fix a bug, I usually try to recreate the situation with a test. I sometime spend around 3 hours coming up with fixtures and writing the test. The actual feature implementation or bug fixing takes less than 1 hour. Does anyone else out there spend at least 3 times longer to write a test compared to actually implementing a feature or fixing a bug? What's the acceptable ratio of time spent writing test to writing code?
