In System Dynamics, if I want represent the relationship between Speed and Distances, I create a Flow (Speed) and a Stock (Distance) as you can see in this Insight Maker Sample . Heres an Image of how it looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dLHaq.png) Now, keeping a constant speed of 20 results in this nice Graph: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gPz7Z.png) I know how to represent that in Mathematica, it is easy:               speed = 20     distance = Integrate[speed, time]     Plot[distance, {time, 0, 20}]      That will get me this nice graph: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/22paN.png) Now I want to do something more complex, I want to add a **feedback loop** , I have already done it in InsightMaker too, it looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aTvlB.png)   * The flow Reproduction is configured as: 20*[Reproduction Rate]   * The stock E. Coli Bacteria is configured as: Initial Value: 1    * The variable Reproductino Rate is configured as: [ E. Coli Bacteria] So I get exponential growth : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ge40N.png) My question is: how do I represent this kind of system dynamics model with a feedback loop in Mathematica? **UPDATE** : Here is a table with the values generated by InsightMaker   * Hour 0 E. Coli Bacteria: 1   * Hour 1 E. Coli Bacteria: 21   * Hour 2 E. Coli Bacteria: 441   * Hour 3 E. Coli Bacteria: 9,261   * Hour 4 E. Coli Bacteria: 194,481 Would you be so kind as to please configure your answers to match this results? ( _I am learning as a hobby system dynamics & mathematica and my goal with this question is to understand how to translate a system dynamics diagram to mathematica, so I want to be sure I correctly understad how each part of a system dynamics diagram matches an equivalent mathematica code_)
