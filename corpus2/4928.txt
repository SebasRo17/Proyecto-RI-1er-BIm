Consider the following list of countries which I would like to highlight on a world map:               MyCountries={"Germany","Hungary","Mexico","Austria","Bosnia","Turkey","SouthKorea","China"};      From the documentation center (Country Data > Applications > Application 5), I know that               Graphics[{If[CountryData[#, "AntarcticNations"], Orange, LightBrown],          CountryData[#, "SchematicPolygon"]} & /@ CountryData[]]      works for all antarctic nations. I replaced `"AntarcticNations"` by `MyCountries` but it does not seem to work.
