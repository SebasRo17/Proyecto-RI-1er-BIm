I have mostly worked on simple java programs and compiled and run them with Eclipse on Windows. So, I have no experience of using command prompt for compiling Java projects and do not have much info about what actually happens beneath the play button in Eclipse. Now I have to submit a Java application which will have basic operation on XML. My project also will have (JUnit) Unit Test. My question is related to submission of this Project.   1. Which files would be necessary to submit the code. So, it executes properly?   2. Does choosing Eclipse as an IDE or junit as a unit testing framweork produces any dependenices i.e the executor of the program should have eclipse/libraries to execute the program on his machine?
