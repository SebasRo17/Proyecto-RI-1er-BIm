I am in high school at the moment and soon reaching stages where I would have to make choices. To introduce, I love programming. I had started learning programming a year ago and have some experience with ActionScript3 and Java + (the web languages like html CSS JavaScript. But php I have found a bit hard to understand). Other subjects which I absolutely love are mathematics, physics and chemistry. The professions related with these subjects that really interest me are engineering (piping engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer etc.). People say to me that I should choose the profession based on my interests. But I have absolutely no preference of one over another. My choice really depends on the demand of these professions in future. So my questions are -   * Is the demand of programming going to degrade in future due to a excessive number of programmers in future? Or is it going to remain a profession in high demand.   * Is engineering going to lose its demand? Almost everybody seems to be going for the profession of an engineer these days and it is scary to think what will happen of the world with the number of engineers there are.   * Which profession is likely to remain well paid in future too?
