It would be useful for me if I could write:               Grid[{{a, b}, {c, d}, {e, f}},       GridHeadings -> {{"r1", "r2", "r3"}, {"c1", "c2"}}]      just like               TableForm[{{a, b}, {c, d}, {e, f}},       TableHeadings -> {{"r1", "r2", "r3"}, {"c1", "c2"}}]      except that I don't want the two lines `TableForm` produces. How could I add this additional option to `Grid`?
