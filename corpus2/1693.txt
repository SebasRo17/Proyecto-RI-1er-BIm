I've been trying to write a little kaleidoscope-type manipulate, using images rather than graphics, and using `ImageTransformation` as a way in. However, I'm starting to suspect that my approach isn't going to work. Before I abandon it, though, I thought I'd ask here if it can be rescued:               im = ImageResize[ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Mandrill"}], 100]          Manipulate[      ImageTransformation[          ImagePad[im, {{x, -x}, {-x, x}}, Padding -> "Reversed"],          Function[{pt}, {ArcTan[-#2, #1] & @@ pt, Norm[pt]}],         DataRange -> Automatic, PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}},         Padding -> "Reversed"], {x, 0, 100, 5}]      ![a manipulated mandrill](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F2VW6.png) While the results are OK, it isn't symmetrical, and I'm not sure that the transform can be corrected to make it so? (Strictly speaking this is a teleidoscope, rather than a kaleidoscope...)
