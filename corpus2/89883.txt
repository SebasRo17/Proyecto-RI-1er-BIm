I always loved this article on JoelOnSoftware called "Getting Things Done When You're Only a Grunt" . I could especially relate when I was newbie (and still feel like I will ALWAYS be one). About #4, neutralizing the bozo's. What advice do you have for actually implementing this in real situations at work? It doesn't seem to be as easy (at least on our team) as simply logging a bug against someone's bad code. What works for all the rest of you out there?
