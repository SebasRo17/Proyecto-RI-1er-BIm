I am a COBOL programmer, desperately trying to learn and program Java. Although I understand the OO priciples and concepts, I am at a lost putting all together. I am trying to find some examples on how code will look in COBOL vs Java - something a bit more complicated than "hello world" [I am past that initial headache! :-)], that includes OO principles - basically, a decent 1000+ liner in COBOL, with the Java code to work through. After working through book after book, doing the examples, and even writing small java programs at work, I think working through an example I can compare will be the best way to getting my thinking cap converted, and being able to do in Java what I can do after 10 years with COBOL. Can anybody help?
