I wonder if it is possible to improve the front-end's autocomplete capability. Compared with some other more sophisticated editors/IDEs, such as eclipse, Mathematica's front-end does not provide a good autocomplete capability. The front-end provides an autocomplete feature through `(Control|Command)[+Shift]+K` key bindings. But it has several different shortcomings. First off, the key binding is not the easiest one to use. I really prefer `Control+Space` or `tab` key combination which is used in many other editors rather than the Mathematica's unique `Control+K`. However, one can modify the key binding to his own choice. Second, the function/variable name autocomplete feature, shows a list of options just over the line that you are typing rather than underneath the line. So, you cannot see what you have already typed in: ![Mathematica's AC](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VlsFD.png) Compare it with eclipse: ![eclipse AC](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vH21n.png) Another nice feature of eclipse, that Mathematica supports a simpler version of through `Control+Shift+K`, is the parameter suggestion feature. Once you choose a function/class name from the above list, it shows you another list with all possible function/constructor parameters, which makes the life much more easier. ![Parameter Completion](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8l70Y.png) Eclipse even provides camel case notation: ![Camel Case](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0SXJS.png) Is that possible to modify the Mathematica's front-end to support such capabilities? _Note:_ Here is a list of Mathematica functions/options that might be useful: `NotebookEventActions`, `NotebookSelection`, `CurrentValue`, `Names`.
