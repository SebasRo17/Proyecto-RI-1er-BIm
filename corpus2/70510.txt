I am in big dilemma what to do or not... Tomorrow have an interview on TeamViewer and Skype for a web developer position in PHP. They want to take my technical interview there, so I think they will give give me a PHP program to write. The thing is that PHP has vast variety of functions so its not possible to keep all the functions in mind or on finger tips: Google is really needed. I am aware about how to solve problems, but it may be the case that I don't know the exact syntax for questions they ask. So what should I do in this case? How can I convince them that I know how this can be accomplished but the exact syntax is not coming immediately to mind? Also, what type of question might they ask? _Some thing about me so that may be you can give your advice accordingly_ Am a junior web developer who has 14 month experience in PHP. My skills : PHP, Mysql, Magento, Wordpress, CSS, HTML, Javascript...
