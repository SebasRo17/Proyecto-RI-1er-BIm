Actually, I'm A Fresh CS graduate,who want to build a System for his Dad's Road Transport business. However,the issue is whenever I go to ask to him about : what are people involved in his business? whats their routine work? or how their business actually works? then he avoids my questions, and says, just give me system by utilizing your knowledge, to ease my transporting business,and rest all you think. So, I had brainstormed about it, but I still feel the need of viewpoint of my dad,as he is actually in that business. Hence, how can I get business requirements form him ?
