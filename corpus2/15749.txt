I am trying to reproduce the API of a function (written in R) that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments and handles it the same way as it would handle a single argument that is a list of different data sets. Is there a Mathematica idiom that allows a function to be defined so that:               f[ arg1, arg2, ..., argN ]      behaves the same as               f[ {arg1, arg2, ..., argN} ]      ?
