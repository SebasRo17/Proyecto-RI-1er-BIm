Is there a way to write `ListPointPlot3D` expression, so when given a list of points, the the color of the points plotted is a function of the index/element number of the list? Suppose `list` contains the points to be plotted and the color function is `Blend[{Yellow, Brown}, n]`, with `n` being the index a point in `list`, then `list[[1]]` should be yellow and `list[[-1]]` should be brown. I feel like I'm almost there, but I cannot manage to combine the pieces, hope someone can help me!
