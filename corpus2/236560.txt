I'm working on an Open Source software project (LGPL) which uses another LGPL- licensed software. To make it easier for users and developers I'm delivering and linking against the compiled thirdparty. As far as I know I have to include the sources and license-statements of LGPL software if I'm delivering and using it in binary form. However this would mean that I have to put the compiled version as well as the code of that thirdparty into my repository. Not only would that make the checkout take ages, it would also be somewhat redundant. Are there any techniques or best practices on how to solve this issue? My project is available on Github if that matters. Update:   * Link to Project   * Link to Thirdparty
