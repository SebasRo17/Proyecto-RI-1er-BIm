**Context** : I built an app which generates around **1000 domain names** based on user input. I need to check if they are **available or not** by matching against a huge zone file of parsed domain names which is around **2 GB**. I have an amazon micro instance and cannot store the text file in there due to space constraints. I am expecting around **100k - 200k** and more in **search queries** per month. **Naive approach** (Potentially): 1\. Store the text file in dropbox. Then get the contents of the file and search for the strings and spit out the available domain names on the EC2 instance. I only need to check if domains exist or not. **Should I have to store it in a database?** Some Info: There are currently 100 million dot com names registered according to Verisign. And my parsed domain names are one on each line. Like:   * GOOGLE    * APPLE    * FACEBOOK    * STACKOVERFLOW etc What is the best and practical way to deal with the problem? Ideally the checking should take only a few seconds. But I am fine with anything that works at this point.
