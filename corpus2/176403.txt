I have just started a C programming course and so far have only done the basics like `printf`, read a little on variables etc on the course book. The teacher has tasked us with writing a program that will take a value entered by the user, this will be the number of students in the class (25 at the moment but can be variable). It will then list the number of students randomly and place them in 3 columns. The purpose is to sort students into groups of 3 randomly, then display on the screen in columns. Now my question is not for the code that defeats the object of me attempting the exercise, but how to structure it. I can see that using an array can be used to display the list, but really after some pointers on how best to approach the problem in blocks, then I can attempt to program each block.
