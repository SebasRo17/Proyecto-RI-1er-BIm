I'm talking about SEI Software Architecture Professional Certificate. I've been web developing for 3 years and I'd like to move into Software Architecture. My work will probably pay the fees for this program if I ask nicely enough. But does the SEI have the reputation to make this "certificate" worth having? More importantly, is the training any good? Has anyone done this?
