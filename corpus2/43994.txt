I'm trying to do the following integral, but Mathematica won't evaluate it - it just spits out the actual symbollic integral (sorry I'm not sure how to copy the output into this post so it appears as it does in the notebook!).               a = 1;     b = 1;     c = 0;     d = 0.0001;          Integrate[((2*Pi*a^2)^(-1/4)*          Exp[-(k - d)^2/(4*a^2)])^2 * (Abs[           1 + ((k - d + (I*c/2) - (I*b/2))/ (k - d + (I*c/2) + (I*b/2)))]/          2)^2, {k, 0, Infinity} ]      Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Thanks
