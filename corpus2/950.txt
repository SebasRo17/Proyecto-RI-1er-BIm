How could I obtain the list of all the groups of 5 numbers taken from `Range[12]` such that the 2 lists have an empty intersection : `{{1,2,3,4,5},{6,7,8,9,10}}` would be a solution while `{{1,2,3,4,5}, {5,6,7,8,9}}` should be rejected as 5 is common to both. I am currently trying to do so using `Position` of empty `Intersection` very unsuccessfully.               allCombinations =       DeleteDuplicates@(Sort /@ Permutations[Range[12], {5}])          Function[base,       Flatten[        Position[         Intersection[allCombinations[[base]], allCombinations[[#]]] & /@           Drop[Range[792], {base}], {}], 1]] /@ Range[792]      With which I am trying to obtain the position of the lists in allCombination s, but I still get duplicates...
