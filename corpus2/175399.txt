Hey guys I am really new to the C++ programing I have a little knowledge in C and a bit more in C++, but I do not know them enough to call myself a programmer. I am working as a PHP Web Developer I like being a crafts man and creating things so that is the reason to combine the programming with web development. I think that I could really benefit from both of them and so... My question is:   * Is it a good Idea to learn C++ with Qt or not?   * Can you give me pros and cons of both? **Note** : _I do not want to become a programmer and give up the web development I want to combine them both._
