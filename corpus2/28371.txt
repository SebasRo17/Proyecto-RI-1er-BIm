We can write:               MorphologicalComponents[image] // Colorize      To assign a random set of colors to each component in some image. The example used for reference by Mathematica is a map of the United States: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Colorize.html?q=Colorize&lang=en My question is - is it possible to ask Mathematica to specify that any two adjacent colors should have some minimum threshold distance in in their hue or RGB values (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_United_States_vivid_colors_shown.png)? I believe asking for a four-coloring of a map is computationally non-trivial, but are there any built-in routines, perhaps with the graph analytics packages in Mathematica, to allow for this? Let's define two morphological components as adjacent if the line segments spanning the shortest distance between the two components fails to intersect any other morphological components. We can also include a distance $D$ cutoff for defining two components as adjacent. I'm certainly open to stricter definitions.
