I often see references to "paclets", for example the `PacletManager`` context, the `PacletInfo.m` file in some packages and next to downloaded computable data, `$UserBaseDirectory/Paclets`, etc. **Question:** What are "paclets", what is their relevance to end users, and how can one use them with packages? **Clarification:** Since I saw a `PacletInfo.m` file in several third party packages as well, I assume that they must be useful in packages and there must be some documentation on how to use them somewhere. I am hoping someone could point me to the relevant documentation.
