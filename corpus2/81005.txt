I have been tasked by my boss to look at a system where we create Python scripts and upload them to a server and store details in the DB. He also wants me to implement versioning, so that if any changes are made to a script then the updated version has an incremented version number. This is the area where I am not so sure about. How would you go about implementing a versioning tool? Is it simply a case of incrementing a field in the Database with the new version number? Or is it more complex than what it initially seems?
