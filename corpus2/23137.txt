I have created a bar chart with the below code. My $x$ axis labels have been cut in half for some reason. My $x$ axis heading is also missing. I tried using `Placed -> Below` instead of `Placed -> Axis` as proposed in an answer to a similar question about labels bieng cut in half but this does not seem to work at all with my version ( _Mathematica_ 9). When I resize the chart the axis labels eventually stop bieng cut in half when the chart is huge but my main $x$ axis heading is still missing. I can't use Labeled `[{xheading,yheading}, {position,position}]` becasue it is not a graphics object and I need my bar chart to be a graphics object so I can use it in `Show` later.               data = {{71.74887892, 75.81967213}, {75.81120944, 77.88018433},             {0.6600660066, 1.673640167}, {84.74576271, 79.34782609},             {76.4, 79.49790795}, {78.84267631, 80.11782032},             {71.51515152, 74.30249633}, {85.57692308, 79.37062937},             {71.875, 74.3772242}, {66.28477905, 64.25233645},             {1.490066225, 1.914414414}, {1.474926254, 1.763224181}};     dataLabel = {"DT401       ", "DT402       ", "DT403       ", "DT404       ",                   "DT405       ", "DT406       ", "DT407       ", "DT408       ",                   "DT409       ", "DT410       ", "DT411       ", "DT412       "};     label = "Truck";          BarChart[data, PlotRange -> {{0, 25}, {0, 100}},       ChartLabels -> {Placed[l, Axis], Placed[{"", ""}, Bottom]},       PlotLabel -> label,       AxesLabel -> {label, label}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUpuW.jpg)
