I would like to use Mathematica _programmatically_ to take snapshots or screenshots of any open notebook. For example, I would like to get from the notebook created with this command               CreateDocument[{TextCell["Need help", "Section"],        TextCell["Can you help?"]}, WindowTitle -> "MyNotebook"]      An image like this ![entire notebook screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oZayu.jpg) The output can be a file or an image. I use Windows.
