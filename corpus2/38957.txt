I've inserted a picture in one cell, however, when I exported the cell as HTML, the size of my image in the html tag was doubled(the image file in HTMLFiles was the same as the original image). I know what makes this happen: The reason is my global magnification value is 2. How can I control my image size? ## magnification=1               <img src="HTMLFiles/Untitled-1_1.gif" alt="Untitled-1_1.gif" width="800" height="427" style="vertical-align:middle" />      ## magnification=2               <img src="HTMLFiles/Untitled-1_1.gif" alt="Untitled-1_1.gif" width="1600" height="854" style="vertical-align:middle" />      * * * I like magnification=2, how can I control my image size in the cell, and make it the same as the width and height in the `<img>` tag. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUsVi.jpg)
