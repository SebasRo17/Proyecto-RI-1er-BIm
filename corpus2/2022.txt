Consider the following code:               ClearAll[x, y]     x = y;     y = 2;     ?x     ?y      This will store $x$ being equal to _the variable $y$_ , and $y$ having _the value of $2$_. Now switch the assignment lines:               ClearAll[x, y]     y = 2;     x = y;     ?x     ?y      the internal representation will be $x=2$, $y=2$, since at the time of the assignment $x=y$, _the value of $y$_ is known and used for the assignment, not the variable $y$ itself, as it has been in the first case. Now consider the case where I've built up a long code with complicated expressions being substituted into each other, and at some final point I would like to boil this down as much as possible. Stated differently: _How would I make sure $x$ is updated to the value of $y$ in the first example instead of still referring to $y$?_
