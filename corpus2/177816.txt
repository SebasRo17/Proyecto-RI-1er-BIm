The procedure in my team is that we all commit our code to the same development branch. We have a test server that runs updated code from this branch so that we can test our code on the servers. This test server is exposed on the internet so that we can test callbacks from third-party services like sendgrid. (where you specify a url for sendgrid to update you on the status of emails sent out) The problem is that if we want to merge the development branch to the master branch in order to publish new features to our production servers, some features that may not have been ready will be applied to the production servers. So we're considering having each developer work on a feature/topic branch where each of them work on their own features and when it's ready, merge it into the development branch for testing, and then into the master branch. However, because our test server only pulls changes from the development branch, the developers are unable to test their features. While this is not a huge issue as they can test it on their local machine, **the only problem I foresee is if we want to test callbacks from third-party services using our test server during the course of developing a feature**. How can we handle this problem? Note: We're not advanced git users. We use the Github app for MacOSX and Windows to commit our work. Setup: It is a PHP project. We do not have any form of CI setup and do not have the knowledge to do so. Eventually we want to use Jenkins but right now we're just focusing on getting our minimum viable product out.
