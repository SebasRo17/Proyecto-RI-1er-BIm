For most functions in `Mathematica`, passing them a list will call the function on each element of the list. For example:               ExampleFunction1[x_] := x + 1     ExampleFunction1[{1, 2, 3}]      (* {2, 3, 4} *)      But things change when you use `Max[]`. For example if I have this function:               ExampleFunction2[x_] := Max[x, 4]       If I pass this a single number `x`, it will return either `x` or `4`, whichever is larger, but, as documented, if i pass it a list like this:               ExampleFunction2[{1, 3, 7}]       It will return 7. Instead I'd like it to return `{ 4, 4, 7}`. How can I make my function so that `Max` uses an element of a list as its argument instead of the entire list?
