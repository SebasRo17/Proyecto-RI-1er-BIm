I'd like to export an output from MatrixPlot[], however, the output file size seems to depend on my specification of the ImageSize -> {..., ...}. How might I export a TIFF with all of the data in the $N \times M$ matrix being plotted? Presumably one could set the ImageSize to reflect the matrix dimensions, however, how would one appropriately pad for the axes and axes labels? The command I'm using for MatrixPlot[] export is:               Export["MatrixExportFileExample.tiff",MatrixPlot[...]];
