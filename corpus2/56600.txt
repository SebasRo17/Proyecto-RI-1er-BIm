I want to make a `RegionPlot` (or possibly a `ContourPlot`) in $x$-$y$ space that indicates which among a set of functions is the biggest value for a given $(x, y)$. Suppose I have (in this example) three functions assembled in a list:               f[x_, y_] = Sin[x*y]     g[x_, y_] = Cos[x*y/2]     h[x_, y_] = Sin[x*y^2/7 + 2 \[Pi]/E]     (*and possibly more...*)          list[x_, y_] = {f[x,y], g[x,y], h[x,y]}      and I want to paint a region _blue_ if `f[x]` is largest in that region, _magenta_ if `g[x]` is largest and _dark yellow_ if `h[x]` is largest. The end result would be collage of colors corresponding to largest among the functions. Is there a way using functional coding to do this? I'm looking for fastest fastest possible computing speed. Any hints on possibly helpful _Mathematica_ functions would be welcome.
