In web development the terms _"server"_ and _"client"_ are often refered to when discussing how pages are requested on the web. It is also used exstensively when talking about PC, phone, tablets, etc. The question that came to my mind was what qualified a computer to be considered a client? I took a look at this article from wikipedia and noticed that clients are considered _service requesters_ whereas Servers are considered _service providers_. If this is true couldn't all computers that request a service in a sense be considered a client? The stereotype I noticed is that a client computer is usually synonymous with a "consumer" computer, but according to wikipedia this is not entirely accurate. Any idea on how to draw the line in this common scenario?
