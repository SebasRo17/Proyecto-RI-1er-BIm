I have a custom distribution created to model some experimental observations. While too complicated to include in this question, I can provide an example and some illustrations to convey a sense of it. Take the following as representing the `PDF` of the distribution:               pdf = (0.334336 (E^(2.56822 (-4.1816 - Log[x])) Erfc[              3.54409*10^7 (-4.1816 - Log[x])] +             E^(0.904055 (4.1816 + Log[x])) Erfc[              3.54409*10^7 (4.1816 + Log[x])]))/x;      Which one can readily plot:               Plot[pdf, {x, 0, 0.05}, PlotRange -> {All, {0, 100}}]      ![PDF\[dist\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fsHsy.png) Defining the distribution, `dist` as :               dist = ProbabilityDistribution[pdf, {x, 0, ∞}]      I can generate `RandomVariates` of `dist` and plot them in a `Histogram`:               Histogram[RandomVariate[dist, 10^5], {0, 0.05, 0.0005}, "PDF",       ImageSize -> 300, PlotRange -> {All, {0, 100}}]      ![histogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I5Zsy.png) You can see that the histogram and plot of the PDF look pretty similar. So far so good. I have conjectured that if one takes sufficient observations the data will eventually converge to an exponential distribution. So, I thought to estimate an exponential distribution from (in this case) generating a bunch of random data using the original distrubtion.               Plot[{       PDF[EstimatedDistribution[RandomVariate[dist, 10^4],          ExponentialDistribution[λ]], x],       pdf}, {x, 0, 0.05},      ImageSize -> 300, PlotRange -> {All, {0, 100}}]       ![estimated dist converging](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kKj9A.png) I like this, BUT this leads to my first question: **Where do all those squiggles in the PDF of the exponential distribution come from?** Take a closer look: ![squiggle zoom](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qp5bU.png) Does this seem normal? Shouldn't I get a smooth curve? Hopefully someone will have an insight, but this got me wondering and led me to a second and maybe more interesting question: **Does Mathematica have a way to directly fit one distribution to another without (in the above case) the intermediate step of generating a set of random variates first?**
