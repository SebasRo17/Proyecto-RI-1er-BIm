I'm in the early phase of creating a Mathematica function (or package) that exports graphics such that they can be used with $\LaTeX$'s PSfrag. ## The goal Ideally, the function should take a graphic created in Mathematica, replace all text elements with labels and export the labeled graphic along with a text file containg the corresponding `\psfrag` commands. It should be possible to do all the layouting in Mathematica, preserving as much of the style, font size/weight/color and positioning of the text in the graphic. The only things that should be affected are the font family (so that everything appears in $\LaTeX$ font) and the typesetting of mathematical expressions. * * * ## Problem 1: Placing text in EPS Consider a plot that somewhere has the number 10000 as a tick (or frame tick). If you export this plot to EPS, and then import it again, the resulting Mathematica `Graphics` object features two text elements `10` and `000`. This makes replacing single numbers with PSfrag quite a lot harder than one would think. Is there a way to force Mathematica to insert `10 000` as a single text element? * * * ## Problem 2: Extracting frame ticks As a first try, I tried extracting all `Ticks` or `FrameTicks`from a graphic using `AbsoluteOptions`. This works nicely for many cases, but I encountered some strange behavior. Consider the two plots               frPlot1 = Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 1000}, Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> True];     frPlot2 = Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 1000}, Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> All];      Their output looks just as one would expect from reading the documentation of `FrameTicks`:               True    tick marks placed automatically on bottom and left edges     All     tick marks placed automatically on all edges      Determining the ticks for `frPlot1` using `AbsoluteOptions[frPlot1, FrameTicks]` works just fine. But trying the same with `frPlot2` results in an error:               Ticks::ticks: All is not a valid tick specification.      How can `All`not be a valid specification when the documentation states that it is? * * * ## Future Problems Depending on the answers to the two questions above, there will probably arise some new questions. I will keep this post updated. I can also post the code of my first try with automatizing the tick extraction, if that is wanted.
