I have some objects that I want to present in TeXForm. Thus, it is easily to do as follows:               YoungTableau/:TeXForm[YoungTableau[diagram_]]      However, what if I want to extend the functionality of TeXForm, but only when working with this particular object? Say that I wish to be able to specify if I want line breaks or not in the output. I can do it like this,               YoungTableau/:TeXForm[YoungTableau[diagram_],OptionsPattern[]]      but then `OptionValue[LineBreaks]` will not work, since I have not added this as a possible option. It IS possible to do it as follows:               Unprotect[TeXForm];     Options[TeXForm] = {LineBreaks->True};     Protect[TeXForm];      but this feels too intrusive. Should I just give up, and invent my own version of TeXForm which can take options? What alternatives are there that does something similar to what I want?
