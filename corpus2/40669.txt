Here is a minimal example:               s = 1 /(a + b[3]) + 1 /(2 a + b[3]);     s[[1]] = Sum[s[[1]] /. b[3] -> k, {k, 3}]     s[[4]]     s[[4]] = Sum[s[[4]] /. b[3] -> k, {k, 3}]      Output:               Out[143]= 1/(1 + a) + 1/(2 + a) + 1/(3 + a)     Out[144]= 1/(2 a + b[3])      > Set::partw: Part 4 of (1/(1+a)+1/(2+a)+1/(3+a))+1/(2 a+b[3]) does not exist. > >>               Out[145]= 1/(1 + 2 a) + 1/(2 + 2 a) + 1/(3 + 2 a)      I could only make the error occur when using `Set`. As the above code shows, both `s[[4]]` and `Sum[s[[4]] /. b[3] -> k, {k, 3}]` are well defined. I have been struggling with similar errors for days, can someone please explain exactly what is happening behind the scenes?
