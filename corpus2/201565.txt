From the texts I have read so far, the conventions talk about organizing `constructors`, starting with the `default`, if any. I am wondering, should all classes have a `default constructor` anyway. This will at least help to create a simple instance of the `class` on the fly, without having to use a `parameterized constructor`, which itself may require additional `imports` for specific parameter type.
