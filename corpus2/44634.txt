Assume I want to write a function which has to have an argument structure like               myFunction[variable_,parameters_]      for compatibility reasons. Where parameters should contain a variable number of parameters (myFunction has just two parameters however). I have been using rules lists to functions to solve this:               variable=0     parameters={param1->1,param2->2}     myFunction[variable,parameters]      which I accessed inside the `Module` as `param1 /. parameters`, etc. Now I am reading that this kind of substitution is disfavored for efficiency reasons and that it is better to use `With` or `Block` to insert values. So what is the recommended way to pass to and substitute in functions with given argument number multiple parameters? As an extra: Is there a way to do it which is compatible with `Compile`?
