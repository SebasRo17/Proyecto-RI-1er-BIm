Below, you see a triangle in which the incircle was inscribed. As we know, the center of this circle is the intersection of the angle bisectors. At this point, one could go further and find the points, where each of the angle bisectors intersect with the circle and create a tangent of the circle which will divide three new triangles from the big one. Each of the new triangles has again an incircle which can be created and cutting (from now on) only one triangle from each new one and repeating this process brings us to the picture: ![Right_Triangle_Incircles](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DytE7.png) First question: Is it possible create this figure in _Mathematica_? Unfortunately, I have no clue and cannot provide some code myself, but I have asked a similar question at TeX.SE and got some pretty nice answers. What I would like to do in the end is not only to create the figure; I want to _shoot_ random points at the figure and want to find out where the points hit the figure in a circle or not. I would be delighted to hear some ideas or if possible to collect sample code for my problem.
