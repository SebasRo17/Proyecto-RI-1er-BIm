I will be involved in a project where all the software design is made by a local team and these designs are sent to an offshore team for coding. This is the first time I face a project with this characteristics and for me it feels kind of odd: The managers expects us to make very detailed design documents so there's no space for error for the offshore team; from my perspective they are making us coding in paper while we can do it in an IDE. So, my question is is this approach good, or proven right? What are the main considerations our software process has to have to have success in our project?
