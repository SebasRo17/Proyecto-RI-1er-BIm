Consider a company that is proudly certified for some non-Agile methodology, uses it as a selling point to its customers to demonstrate accountability. How do you go about **introducing Kanban or Scrum progressively without breaking their whole system** and still making them confident that it **can still be just as accountable / auditable**? * * * I know this is possibly related to "How would you introduce an agile methodology like Scrum", but here I am wondering about ways to circumvent/work around the fact that the company imposes a certain way of managing the SDLC under the false pretense that it's the only way to have an audit trail.
