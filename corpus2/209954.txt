What is better practice: force user to extend abstract class or make class with configuration? Eg. pseudocode:               ClassA{      this.name      this.weight      this.height      this.width           constr(config){       this.name = config.name       this.weight = weight       this.height = height       this.width = width      }     }      or               abstract ClassA{      this.name      this.weight      this.height      this.width     }          ClassB extends ClassA{      this.name = 'Item'      this.weight = 12      this.height = 11      this.width = 14     }      Until now i was using configuration because most libraries use this method, but whats wrong with second method? I recently found that method with extending is producing clearer code but maybe I am missing something?
