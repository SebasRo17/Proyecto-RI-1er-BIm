I'm learning T-SQL. From the examples I've seen, to insert text in a `varchar()` cell, I can write just the string to insert, but for `nvarchar()` cells, every example prefix the strings with the letter N. I tried the following query on a table which has `nvarchar()` rows, and it works fine, so the prefix N is not required:               insert into [TableName] values ('Hello', 'World')      Why the strings are prefixed with N in every example I've seen? What are the pros or cons of using this prefix?
