I have started to see variable initialisations like that in Java libraries:               Class clazz = new Class();      or               Class klass = new Class();      Is there a particular reason for people to misspell the word "class" when declaring these variables, and to use a "kool boyz" sort of writing style? Also what is wrong with using something like `cls` or something similar?
