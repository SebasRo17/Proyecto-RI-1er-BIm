Can python be efficiently implemented in big data field? To be precise I am building an web app that analyses really big data in medical health care field consisting of medical history and huge personal information. I need some advice on how to handle very big data in python efficiently and with high performance. Also are their some open source packages in python available which have high performance and efficiency in big data handling? About users and data: Each user has about 3gb of data. Users are grouped based on their family and friend circles and the data is then analysed to predict important information and co-relations out of that. Currently I am talking about 10,000 users and will be rapidly increasing number of users.
