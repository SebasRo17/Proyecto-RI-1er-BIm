What would be a good first functional programming project? I am looking to finish with a bang on my bachelor project and I want to finish it with a functional programming project. We didn't study it in school but we are encouraged to try to learn new things ourselves, and I thought learning a new paradigm not only a new language would be a great exercise for me, and probably something interesting for the teachers to see too. The problem is I want to start a bit ahead of time on my project to take advantage of the summer holiday and get a better understanding on functional programming, and get familiar with one language. What would you say would be a good practice project that is a bit challenging, but also lets me learn the language, paradigm etc. And then what would you think would be a good project (a more advanced one) for my bachelor project? Suggestions for the best language to start with when going into functional programming would be appreciated too.
