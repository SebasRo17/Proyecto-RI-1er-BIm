I'm very curious about this: Lets say that you have to use the GPL in your library because some dependency uses it or (if your library is fork) the upstream library uses GPL. Now GPL doesn't play well with a couple of important open source licenses which means that some users simply can't use your librar because of licensing issues, which doesn't help anybody An option that I've been toying with is still using GPL to maintain dependency compatibility but telling users that I will not enforce it against open source software or (if that's way too broad) software that uses open source but not completable licenses like Apache, MPL, CC, etc. Would there be any legal ramifications of doing this? Would this put my users at legal risk?
