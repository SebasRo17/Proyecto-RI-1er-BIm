My datasource sends information in 100 batches of 100 records with a delay of 1 to 3 seconds between batches. I would like to start processing data as soon as it's received, but I'm not sure how to best approach this. Some ideas I've been playing with include:   * `yield`   * Concurrent Dictionary   * ConcurrentDictionary with INotifyProperyChanged   * Events   * etc. As you can see I'm all over the place, and would appreciate some tested guidance on how to approach this
