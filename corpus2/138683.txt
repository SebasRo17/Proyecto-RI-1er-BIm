I am considering implementing the following policy and would like to run it by the community before implementing it: All mercurial commits must have a bug id corresponding to our bug reporting database. All commits immediately preceding a push for a new feature must have a bug id (it's a new feature but the id is still a "bug id" in the database) This will do several things. First, it will ensure that an entry is always put into the bug database for all code changes. Second, it will provide a diff of each change made for each bug fix. This would also simplify commenting in the mercurial commits and put most details about the commit into the bug report. Do you know of any reasons why this would be a bad idea? Also, do you think I should make some additions to this policy?
