Mathematica evaluates the following integral as:               In[1]:= Assuming[p \[Element] Integers && p > 0,       Integrate[Sin[x]*Cos[x]^p/(Cos[x] + 2), {x, 0, Pi}]]          Out[1]= -2^p Beta[2/3, -p, 1 + p] + ((-1)^ p Hypergeometric2F1[1, 1, 1 - p, 2])/p      However, when I evaluate the resulting expression, I encounter a complex infinity. For example, for `p = 3`:               In[2]:= -2^3 Beta[2/3, -3,  1 + 3] + ((-1)^3 Hypergeometric2F1[1, 1, 1 - 3, 2])/3          During evaluation of In[96]:= Infinity::indet: Indeterminate expression ComplexInfinity+ComplexInfinity encountered. >>         Out[2]= Indeterminate      Did I make a simple mistake in `In[1]` that is causing this problem? Certainly $\sin x\cos^p x/(\cos x + 2)$ is real and finite over the whole real line, for $p\in\mathbb{N}$.
