I have an idea for a program that I think is a good one (Don't we all?). I am an amateur programmer and would like to recruit some more advanced programmers onto the project since there are some aspects that I am not skilled enough to do myself. Is it better to a) Develop the software on my own as much as I can, even though it will be amateurish, and then show a demo to potential recruits or b) Try and recruit some more advanced programmers and seek their advice and guidance before I get started so that it is done correctly from the beginning? I would especially love it if someone has any experience of being in a similar position, but sage speculation is welcome too.
