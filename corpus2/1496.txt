I'm aware that I can use `(* ... *)` to comment out stuff in a notebook. Many languages have a syntax for single-line comments, such as   * `//` in C, C++, Java, C#, ...   * `#` in shell, Python, ... For example, in C++ you can write               int x = 5;     // std::cout << "debug: x = " << x << std::endl;     return x;      in which the second line is commented out. Is there a way to quickly comment out just one line in _Mathematica_ , without having to type paired comment characters?
