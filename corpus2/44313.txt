im trying to solve a PDE-System, with the "periodic boundary condition"               c[t,0]==4*c[t,2pi]      But mathenmatica says: NDSolve::bcedge: "Boundary condition c[t,0]==4\ c[t,2\ [Pi]] is not specified on a single edge of the boundary of the computational domain." If i replace the 4 by 1 everything is fine. Anyone can explain this to me? And/or can tell me how/if mathematica can solve this? Thanks for reading!
