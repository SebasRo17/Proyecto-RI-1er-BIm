I want to be a web developer and because I don't want to get into designing (and stuff like that) so I thought I should become a backend developer (also more suited because of my course i.e. b.tech in computer science). So I have been searching the internet for a lot of things. But I am confused as what should I choose?   1. Python (attended a workshop on django looked easy but I think is a dying language as adoption of Python 3 is very slow)   2. Ruby   3. node.js   4. Java (Play framework)   5. .Net I am currently in my second year which means I have a whole 3 years to learn a language till I apply for a job. I want to learn something which helps me to build things on my own (to fulfill my creative mind's appetite) and something which gets a me good job also. So please guide. I am ready to do the hard work so it doesn't matter if the language is not very easy :)
