Say I have a function $f(x)$ that is given explicitly in its functional form, and I want to find its Fourier transform[1]. If $f$ is too complicated to have an analytic expression for $\hat f(k)$, how do I obtain it numerically? The naive and stupid way, which I currently use, is evaluating the integral for many $k$'s and then interpolating between them. This is outrageously inefficient, and I'm sure that FFT should be used, but I can't seem to find a good recipe for that. I keep getting the frequencies and the normalisation wrong. This task seems to be common enough so that advanced software like Mathematica would have a built-in function for that. Any ideas? * * * [1] Being a physicist, I use $\hat f(k)\equiv \int e^{ikx}f(x)dx$ as the definition of FourierTransform, but you can stick in $2\pi$ wherever you feel like if you're used to a different one.
