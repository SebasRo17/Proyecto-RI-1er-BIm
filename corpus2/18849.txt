I have been learning how to use _Mathematica_ for the past few weeks, and recently I have been trying to recreate something along the lines of this. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pTySV.png) Given a function, I want to create a 3d plot of an object as if the bounded regions of the function were to be extruded upwards in a certain shape. From this I hope to find a basic volume, instead of integrating. How would I do this? I have seen `ParametricPlot3D`, but I haven't been able to create what I want with it.
