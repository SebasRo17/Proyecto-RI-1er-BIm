I have a recursive expression, which is something like: $$ a(n,x)=f(x,y,m)\,a(n-1,x)+g(x,y)\,a(n-1,y) $$ where $f(x,y,m)$ and $g(x,y)$ are known. So the second $a$ depends on $y$ rather than $x$. I tried to get it into `RSolve` with:               RSolve[{a[n] == f[x, y, n]*a[n-1] + g[x, y]*(a[n] /. {x -> y}), a[0]==1}, a[n], n]      but the `/.{x ->y}` part doesn't seem to change anything. How can I do the replacement?
