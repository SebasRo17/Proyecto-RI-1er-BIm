I am trying to extract the data table itself from an RLink-generated RDataFrame:               Needs["RLink`"];     InstallR[];     REvaluate["require(datasets);"];     REvaluate["data(airquality);"]     airquality = REvaluate["as.data.frame(airquality)"]      ![RDataFrame Output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GHGHD.png) but now I would like to extract out the goodies like RNames and RData so that I may work with them independently. (BTW, TableForm on an RDataFrame is _awesome_!) I tried messing around with its InputForm, but I got stuck. How do I extract RNames, RData, etc. into standard _Mathematica_ lists?
