I'm working on a complex transformation sketch that I'd like to create via mathematica. I'm working with the mapping $w=z^2$, where its real and imaginary parts are $u=x^2-y^2$ and $v=2xy$, respectively. Now, I want to sketch the image under the given transformation of each branch of the hyperbola $$x^2-y^2=1\tag{1}$$ where the right and left branches (in blue) are oriented upward and downwards, respectively. For example, the blue branches of the hyperbola in (1) appear as such: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WFKIM.png) Similarly, for the hyperbola $$2xy=2,\tag{2}$$the left and right branches (in orange) are oriented upwards and downwards, respectively. **How do I sketch the images of these hyperbolas under $w=z^2$, while taking into account the orientation of their respective branches?** I expect the image of the hyperbola in (1), to be the line $u=1$, oriented updwards, and the image of the hyperbola in (2) to be the line $v=2$, oriented rightwards. Here's what I have so far; however, getting the orientation arrows requires that I load the **CurvesGraphics6** package from here. _If anyone could provide a method of providing orientation arrows for these curves via simpler means, that would be great as well._                r1 = ContourPlot[{x^2 - y^2 == 1, x*y == 2}, {x, -4, 4}, {y, -4, 4},       Axes -> True, Frame -> False, PlotRange -> Automatic,       Background -> White, Oriented -> True]      **[UPDATED CODE]** Courtesy of Eldo and Mark McClure, I was able to apply orientation arrows to the Hyperbolas without using the aforementioned package.               r1 = ContourPlot[{x^2 - y^2 == 1, x*y == 2}, {x, -4, 4}, {y, -4, 4},      Axes -> True, Frame -> False, PlotRange -> Automatic,      Background -> White]          Show[r1, r1 /. Line[pts_] :> Arrow[pts, 2]]
