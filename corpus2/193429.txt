I'm writing some code that sets cookies and I'm wondering about the exact semantics of the `Set-Cookie` header. Imagine the following HTTP header line:               Set-Cookie: name=value; Path=/%20      For with path does this set the cookie? `/` or `/%20`(unescaped) (`/%20` or `/%2520` escaped)? The reason I'm asking is that I should support non-ASCII paths. Since HTTP header must only be ASCII my plan was to URL escape the path value but the HTTP specification is not as clear as I'd hoped for. **Edit** I know what Path is supposed to do. My question is: Is the value interpreted as percent encoded or not?
