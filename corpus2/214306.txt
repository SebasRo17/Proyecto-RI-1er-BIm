**tl;dr** : I'm a grad, worried about not learning a lot and improving my skills if I join a startup where I won't have senior devs mentoring and helping me. I do have other offers. I'm in my final year of study, and I'm lucky enough to be in a course where all students do a final-year project with real-world commercial clients. So since March, 5 of my good friends and I have been building a system for a startup which is currently seeking funding, and planning to launch early next year. I should note that the product is not finished yet, and without it there is no business. We have already been told that, assuming they get the funding they're after, they want to bring all of us on-board ASAP, to continue building this thing. The reasons are obvious: we're all familiar with both the client and the product, and we're cheaper than more experienced devs. **If they get enough of us to sign on, we'll be the only developers involved.** So my question: **ignoring all of the usual startup issues of job security, pay, and all that** , I'm concerned about the issue of my continuing education and improvement as a programmer. I'm pretty confident in my skills, and most of what I know I taught myself rather than learnt in the classroom, because I'm passionate about coding, but I'm not so foolish to think that any grad doesn't have a hell of a lot left to learn. I already have a couple of offers from other larger companies, where I know that I'll be working under developers with a lot of experience, who hopefully can and will teach and mentor me, and I'm conscious of stagnating this early in my career by being at a company where it's only me and other grads, and **no one with 10+ years of experience to tell me when I'm totally wrong.** Is this an issue? Or can I learn just as much on my own if I'm really committed to it?
