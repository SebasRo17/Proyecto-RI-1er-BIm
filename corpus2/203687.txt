I'm writing a web app that requires the usage of drag and drop as well as other jQuery/HTML5 features. There are two options for saving a user's changes to a database   * Implicit: database save on the end of an event, such as drop, hover, ect.    * Explicit: save changes to local array and submit on submit button click event Currently, the only difference between the two is that implicit saves hooked to user events results in many more POST/GET data requests as compared to the explicit save. Other than that, is there a major distinction between the two, and what are the reasons for choosing either option?
