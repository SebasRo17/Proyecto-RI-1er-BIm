We are working on an ASP.NET-based XML Web Service that we will be using for our own purposes as well as using it as part of a product offering for our integration partners. Once it goes live we will be working on future phases of the project, and it occurs to me that the service's details may need to change over time (method signatures, object types, etc.) and since we are not the only ones using the web service, we will need to have some level of coordination with our partners. What I'm not sure about is the best way to do this. When we update the web service in such a way that the WSDL would be changed, should we deploy it to a separate URL? Should we overload the existing methods? Have differently named methods? Ideally we would just have everything coordinated and cut over to the new methods but I don't see that happening. Are there established good ways to handle this?
