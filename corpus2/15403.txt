> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  1 Plot, 2 Scale/Axis The title speaks for itself really. Suppose I have two functions of the same variable that I'd like to visualise on the same plot (with the same x-axis) but their units and scales are totally different. Is it possible to draw separate y-axes for them? Further, is it possible to use, for example, a log scale for one of the functions and a linear scale for the other?
