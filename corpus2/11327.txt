I wonder if it is possible to use Mathematica for helping myself to create school timetable. I have a feeling that it requires quite simple optimization algorithm, but I have never been into optimization, so I don't really know where to start. The task looks like that:   1. I have a given free class rooms at certain time points.    2. I have an information about how much time and places require certain lessons    3. Also I do have some teacher preferences - some would prefer mornings, some evenings etc. Is there any function that would help solve that matter?
