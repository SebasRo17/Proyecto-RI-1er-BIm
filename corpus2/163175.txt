I know how constructor and setter injection works in spring. Normally I use interfaces instead of classes to inject beans using setter and I consider it as interface injection, but in case of constructor we also use interfaces (I am confused). In following example I use `JobProcessor` interface instead of `JobProcessorImpl` class.               public class JobScheduler {         // JobProcessor interface         private JobProcessor jobProcessor;         // Dependecy injection         public void setJobProcessor(JobProcessor jobProcessor){             this.jobProcessor = jobProcessor;         }     }      I tried to find a solution by googling but there are different opinions by writers. Even some people says that spring doesn't support interface injection in their blogs/statements. Can someone help me by example?
