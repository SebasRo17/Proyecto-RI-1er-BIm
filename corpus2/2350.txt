I have the following set-up: > xaxis = Table[x, {x, 0, 10, 0.01}]; > > yaxis = Table [Sin[x] + Abs[RandomReal[{-1, 1}]], {x, 0, 10, 0.01}]; > > ListLinePlot[Transpose[{ xaxis, yaxis}]] ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3v921.png) My questions is how can I make a line that very simply envelopes the function coming up from the bottom. **The envelope coming up from the bottom should be jagged such that it is a tight-fit (or overfitted).** Perhaps this could be controlled by some sort of smoothing parameter where 1: very jagged, 10: very smooth. The figure below shows a plot generated from the underlying function itself which obviously results in a very smooth fit. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FNupO.png)
