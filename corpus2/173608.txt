I often get to positions in my code where I find myself checking a specific condition over and over again. I want to give you a small example: suppose there is a text file which contains lines starting with "a", lines starting with "b" and other lines and I actually only want to work with the first two sort of lines. My code would look something like this (using python, but read it as pseudocode):               # ...     clear_lines() # removes every other line than those starting with "a" or "b"     for line in lines:         if (line.startsWith("a")):             # do stuff         elif (line.startsWith("b")):             # magic         else:             # this else is redundant, I already made sure there is no else-case             # by using clear_lines()     # ...      You can imagine I won't only check this condition here, but maybe also in other functions and so on. Do you think of it as noise or does it add some value to my code?
