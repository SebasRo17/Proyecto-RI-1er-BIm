> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  When do you know it's time to move on from your current job? **Problem:** I had no prior experience when I interviewed, so I didn't know exactly what to ask _them_ about the company when I was hired. I've spotted a number of warning signs and annoyances since then, such as:   * Four developers when I started, with everyone talking about "Ben" or "Ryan" leaving. One engineer hired thirty days before me, one hired two weeks after me. Most of the department has been hiring a large number of people since I started.   * Extremely limited internet access. I understand the idea from an IT point of view, but not only is Facebook blocked, but so it Youtube, Twitter, and Pandora. I've also figured out that they block all access to non-DNS websites (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/) and strangely enough Miranda-IM.   * Low cubicles. Which is fine because I like my immediate coworkers, but they put the developers with the customer service, customer training, and QA department in a huge open room. Noise, noise, noise, and people stop to chitchat all day long. Headphones only go so far.   * Several emails have been sent out by my boss since I started telling us programmers to not talk about non-work-related-things like Video Games at our cubicles, despite us only spending maybe five minutes every few hours doing so. Further digging tells me that this is because someone keeps complaining that the programmers are "slacking off".   * People are looking over my shoulder all day. I was in the Freenode webchat to get help with a programming issue, and within minutes I had an email from my boss (to all the developers) telling us that we should NOT be connected to any outside chat servers at work.   * Version control system from 2005 that we must access with IE and keep the Java 1.4 JRE installed to be able to use. I accidentally updated to Java 6 one day and spent the next two days fighting with my PC to undo this "problem".   * No source control, no comments on anything, no standards, no code review, no unit testing, no common sense. I literally found a problem in how they handle string resource translations that stems from the simple fact that they don't trim excess white spaces, leading to developers doing: getResource("Date: ") instead of: getResource("Date") + ": ", and I was told to just add the excess white spaces back to the database instead of dealing with the issue directly. Some of these things I'd like to try to understand, but I like having IRC open to talk in a few different rooms during the day and keep in touch with friends/family over IM. They don't break my concentration (not NEARLY as much as the lady from QA stopping by to talk about her son), but because people are looking over my shoulder all day as they walk by they complain when they see something that's not "programmer-looking work". I've been told by my boss and QA that I do good, fast work. I should be judged on my work output and quality, not what I have up on my screen for the five seconds you're walking by So, my question is, even though I'm just barely at my 90 days: **How do you decide to move on from a job and looking elsewhere, or when you should start working with your boss to resolve these issues? Is it even possible to get the boss to work with me in many of these things?** This is the only place I heard back from even though I sent out several resume's a day for several months, and this place does pay well for putting up with their many flaws, but I'm just starting to get so miserable working here already. Should I just put up with it? **Edit:** I appreciate all the responses! First: I'm in the United States, and I'm salaried, and I'm about 5 days away from hitting the end of my 90 day probation. While it is my immediate boss sending out the emails I mentioned, I believe it is actually the department manager doing the majority of the arm-bending. He's also the only one with an office. My immediate boss is a nice guy, he is just complacent. As I mentioned, the Facebook/Twitter/Youtube makes sense from an IT (and management) point of view. Some people _do_ need to have these things limited, otherwise they would waste time on them. However, on occasion, I've come across Youtube videos that very well could be useful, such as when doing Android development (which I am). It would also be useful when it comes to the "research" part of the "R&D" department I work in. It could just be my naievity here, but I feel people should be judged on their work (speed and quality), not what they happen to be doing when you walk by. If I'm getting my work done, and the work is good, then does it matter what website I'm on? Related to above, but I _do_ understand the reasoning for limiting IM and/or IRC access while at work, and I do understand that they're paying me to be here and can dictate to me what I can and can't do. Though, again, judge me on my work not what's on my screen. Is this really so uncommon in a software development field? It is my understanding and my experience that staring at an IDE for 8 hours, typing all the while, is completely unrealistic. I can chat on IM/IRC, enjoying my time at work more simply because of this, without dumping my "short term memory", continuing to work on the problem in my head. I can't do that when Becky from QA stops to talk to me about lunch. I feel I did luck out with this job, and I'm glad I have it. This place does have it's positives: Lax on the dress code, lax on when we have to be to work (before 9am ideally, some leeway here), great benefits. But, I'd seriously take less money if it meant that I could enjoy my day more just in the simple things that, I admit, _are_ mostly me whining about. I just feel that if I'm going to be sitting behind a PC for 8+ hours a day, I'd like it to be as enjoyable as possible.
