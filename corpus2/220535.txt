I always read articles that suggest to not use presentational CSS class names. Currently I'm working on a small website project. The footer on this website looks like this: ![Footer](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FTdZl.jpg) Although it's pretty simple, I'm not exactly sure how to name the class names. At the moment, I'm using this grid system, which uses class names like "one- quarter", "one-half" and so on. Easiest way would then probably be to use a HTML structure like this:               <footer class="footer">             <div class="grid">                 <div class="grid__item one-quarter">                     <h5>Adress</h5>                     Lorem Ipsum<br>                     Lorem Ipsum                 </div><!--                 --><div class="grid__item one-quarter">                     <h5>Adress</h5>                     Lorem Ipsum<br>                     Lorem Ipsum                 </div><!--                 --><div class="grid__item two-quarters">                     <nav class="nav--meta">                         <!-- UL / LI for the navigation -->                     </nav>                 </div>             </div>         </footer>       But for several reasons I'll have to use SASS silent classes instead of using those classes like "one-quarter" directly in my HTML structure:               .classname {          @extend %grid__item;          @extend %one-quarter;          // ...     }      So I'm not sure how to name my different columns inside my footer. "footer_ _left" / "footer_ _right" are very presentational, so is "footer_ _adress" (content might change in future) / "footer_ _nav". Are there any best practices around or an article about CSS class naming in general? And I'm aware that this is mostly personal opinion, but I would still like to hear from others how they deal with it.
