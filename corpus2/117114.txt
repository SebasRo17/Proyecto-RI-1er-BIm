I'm currently a student in software engineering and I am very passionate in computer science. In my university we learn how to design an application with design patterns and a bunch of other techniques to have a good software. But I have a really bad problem: I want to know everything. I'm currently writing a little game engine in c++ while I write an application for iOS5 while building a website for a client while doing my homework, and my homework takes a lot of time for not that much learning. I Recently came to a conclusion: I can't achieve all my projects. Some of my friends tell me to drop university so I can learn faster because I will be able to work my other projects at my _fast_ rhythm. Do you think university is a good learning environment or is it better to be autodidact?
