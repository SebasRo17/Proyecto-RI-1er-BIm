I do not like the new default.nb style sheet in version 9, and would like to use the older one that was used in version 8 for any new notebook and for any notebook created since I started using V9. I saw in the `StyleSheets` folder that V8 default.nb is still there ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eq7pT.png) So I went to preferences and changed the following to say `Default_8.0.nb` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7i3GA.png) And restarted Mathematica. Now when I open a new notebook, it seems to be Default_8.0.nb since `Section` headers are in black and text font is times new Roman. So I thought that is good. Problem fixed. (even thought the Style sheet Default does not have the _check_ mark on next to the it, so I am worried I need to do something more) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vY5LQ.png) However, when I opened an existing notebook that I made some changes in since V9 was installed, I noticed that it still using V9 default.nb. Even though the Style sheet says `Default`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G3cLx.png) _Question is_ What is the correct and recommended steps to use Version 8 default.nb in version 9, so that any notebook that was used version 9 default.nb will now automatically use `Default.8.0.nb` (I really do not understand how can WRI make this change for users without asking them. I do not want someone changing the style sheet of my documents without at least asking me. This should have an option for the user to decide on) thanks
