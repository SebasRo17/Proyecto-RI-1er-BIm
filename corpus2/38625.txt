I have a list of graphics which are all the same width, and I would like to combine them into a single Graphics object that has them all stacked on top of each other, column-style, without changing their widths. The help page for GraphicsColumn lists `Alignment->Full` as the option that would do that, but I'm having some trouble implementing it. To take one of the examples in the help page, entering               GraphicsColumn[Table[Graphics[Disk[], ImageSize -> 10 i], {i, 1, 5}],        Alignment -> Center, Frame -> All]      will produce the following column. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PkQzE.png) I would expect changing `Alignment->Center` to `Alignment->Full` to provide a column with five circles of equal width. Instead, it returns the error message > GraphicsGrid::optv: "Value of option Alignment->Full in GraphicsGrid[{{ > [...] },{ [...] },{ [...] },{ [...] },{ [...] }},Alignment->Full,Frame->All] > is not valid. " This seems to me to be a bug, which came up here/here, and which I will report shortly. I am running Mathematica 9.0.1.0 on Linux x86 (64-bit), Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS; I also observe the error on Mathematica 9.0.0.0 over Widows 7. ### In the meantime, is there a practicable workaround? * * * To provide a bit more detail: the circles above are a MWE; my actual problem is more complicated. I have a table of similar plots, some of which have "stuff" on top added in using `FrameTicks`. A MWE that's closer to my actual situation is               GraphicsColumn[{       ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, ImageSize -> 200,         PlotLabel -> Graphics[Circle[], ImageSize -> 100]],       ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, ImageSize -> 200]       }]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XJ4lB.png) * * * The objects in the question are a MWE, my actual problem is more complicated. I have a table of objects which are _already_ the same widths (and therefore the same `ImageSize`s), but they have different aspect ratios. Setting their `ImageSize`s constant would not do anything. Perhaps a more representative example of my situation is:               GraphicsColumn[Table[Graphics[Rectangle[{0, 0}, {1, i}]], {i, 1, 5}],        Alignment -> Center, Frame -> All]
