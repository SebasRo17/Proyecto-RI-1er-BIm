Recently I have a discussion with some of my colleagues at my work because they said that it's better have in a .DLL a string connection encrypted. And I said why just don't use the string connection defined in the web.config encrypted? it's the same and it's better because entity framework, for example looks for the name of the connection in the web config of the application, Now i want to know from a security point what's better or what's the best practice??
