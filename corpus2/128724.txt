I've been thinking about an application that I want to develop for a while now. In short, I want this application to perform some crud operations. The application will be for a law firm so overall security is going to be very important. My primary programming language is php but I wouldn't mind learning some Java or possibly Objective C to make my application os-x and iOS native. Back to my question, what are the pros and cons to developing a gui application as opposed to just developing an app for the browser? The reason I ask is because if there are some benefits to developing an gui app in, say, objective c, then I guess I need to start focussing on learning the language. Important considerations about the application I want to develop:   * Database connectivity   * Security(Very important)
