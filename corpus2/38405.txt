I am currently working with a list containing around 20 strings which contain around 30,000 characters each. The strings are imported from PDFs and the list containing all the strings is assigned to a variable. So far so good. However, when I evaluate the list (e.g., evaluate variable, then evaluate subsequent output) I get the following error message:               Syntax::tsntxi: "<<1>>" is incomplete; more input is needed.     Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed .      I have tried the same procedure on other computers running Mathematica, but I get the same result. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a minimum working example, so I'll be happy to provide any additional information that might help.
