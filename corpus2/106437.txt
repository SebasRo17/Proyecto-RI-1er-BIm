Given that the reviewer is not part of the project, but was assigned to review because he has done some coding for the application being updated/enhanced. Is it the reviewer's job to ensure that the requirement is complete and correct? Or is this the QA and business tester's responsibility? If the developer and the reviewer misses a requirement which is discovered in UAT, is the reviewer also at fault (probably to a lesser degree)?
