$clean = array();          $email_pattern = '/^[^@\s<&>]+@([-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,}$/i';          if (preg_match($email_pattern, $_POST['email']))      {      $clean['email'] = $_POST['email'];      }      The example code above (Source) uses an array called `$clean` to store the filtered value from `$_POST`. It's considered a security good practice. What are the advantages of using such an approach?
