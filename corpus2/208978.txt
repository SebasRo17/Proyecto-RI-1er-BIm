It is always said that the `include directive`s should be placed at the beginning of a script. The main reason is to make the functions available throughout the script. Regardless of this fact, is it bad to place an `include directive` within the main function where it is needed? For example,               #include <stdio.h>     int main() {     #include <mysql.h>     }      Instead of               #include <mysql.h>     #include <stdio.h>     int main() {     }      I was unable to find any different in performance or compiled file size, but it is difficult to judge about this fact based on simple scripts. I wonder if it has any effect or drawback, or any reason to avoid this non-standard approach.
