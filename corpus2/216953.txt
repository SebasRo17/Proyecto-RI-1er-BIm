I have a question about making a class diagram for an MVC based college senior project. If we have 2 actors of users in my system, lets say `Undergrad` and `Graduate` students are the children of abstract class called `User`. (Generalisation) Each actor has his own features. My question, in such case, do we need to have these two actors in separate classes which inherits from the abstract class `User`? even though, I'm going to implement them as roles using one Model called `User Model` ? I think you can see my confusion here. I code using MVC pattern, but I've never made a class diagram for this pattern. Thank you in advance!
