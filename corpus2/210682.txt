I'm trying to rebuild a simple c# time tool that displays certain statistics about time worked for the web, however, I don't have access to a server so I can't use server code like PHP which I would do if I could and this task would be a doddle. The employee's work information is stored on an intranet site that the C# tool could access by scraping that site and grabbing what it needed. How can I do this (scrape the intranet site) without using server code and only client-side things like HTML, JavaScrit/jQuery? **Edit:** Forgot to mention the Windows machines don't have .net installed
