I am about to start with an application using JSF 2, Seam 3, Hibernate and Hibernate search with the following characteristics:   * Users will be uploading documents (pdf, doc).   * There can be millions of documents.   * The application will be deployed in the cloud. Here are my questions:   1. What will be the best place to store the documents: a database or a content management system (CMS)?   2. If choosing a database, should I go with document oriented db?   3. Is there any integration between Hibernate and document oriented databases or CMS to fetch the documents and index it in Lucene? Basically I am looking for an approach that will be good for storing documents in the cloud, easy accessibility of documents for indexing and keeping performance in mind. Any suggestions / experience or link on this will be good.
