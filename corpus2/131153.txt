Developing big applications requires huge effort. There may be teams for each phase of development and they must use different design patterns and go through the whole SDLC. I have two years of experience as a software developer on small applications and I'm interested on what are the common approaches & practices for big applications? Especially from a project management perspective. How can I adopt such working practices?
