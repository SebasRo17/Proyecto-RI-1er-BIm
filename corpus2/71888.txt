We have an opportunity to hire an awesome web dev for our team. Problem is, he is leaving for S. America in 6 months. We will still have him onsite for six months. We are thinking of having him work remotely after that, but we have our concerns. Ours is a 4 person Chicago-based team that uses scrum. Our office is a war room where we are in constant collaboration. How could we include a remote worker in such a process? What technologies and techniques can make this work? Or is it a lost cause? This thread lists some tools, but I'm hoping for some real world experiences.
