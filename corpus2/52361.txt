SSD harddisks have been on the rise lately. And I've been wondering if it's worth buying one as a programmer. Being able to save five minutes when starting my PC is fun but won't convince my boss. How does it impact a typical visual studio project containing hundreds of files? Compile times, accessing files, waiting for visual studio to do its thing... Are there any benchmarks that checked this? And ideally, how much time would one win each week by upgrading?
