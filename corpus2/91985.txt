This is a multi-part question. I am writing a computationally intensive program that will perform computations on very large numbers, on the scale of factorial(100) . I'm considering using Java or C++ (that's all I know, and C++ only slightly) but I'm not sure which would be better to use in this context. I know C++ will be faster, but Java has a built-in utility for large numbers, the BigInteger class, and I don't know of any equivalent in C++. So here are the questions...   1. Is C++ so much faster than java as to make it worth it to learn and find a way to handle large numbers?   2. If I should use C++, how would I handle the large numbers?   3. Is it possible to just specify a new data type in C++ that represents a number, but with larger bounds than the int?
