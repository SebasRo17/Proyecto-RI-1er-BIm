Also I have an application that basically consists of a lot of screen so user needs to navigate a lot (like go from A>B>C>D) etc. I have been thinking how to implement this (mainly hold the structure of the menuj) as it needs to be on-screen menu (custom, no menu strips etc.) and did not find any solution. Now I realized I could use a database for that, which would allow me also to change strings later with no impact. My idea would be to have a table for each level (1-5) with options available. Once the user selects an option, the program will select any items in the table (CurrentLevel+1) based on its ID. Seems really a good solution to me but I am not a programmer (rather than an analyst). Or even I could use specific table names and hold the table name in a specific column, for example: > User selects Settings > > Program checks that with Settings, there is a table associated "SETTINGS" > and query this table for all items available Makes sense?
