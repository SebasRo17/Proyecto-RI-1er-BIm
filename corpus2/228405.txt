Some team members just wait until the stories they are most likely to work on will be discussed and only then they participate. Otherwise they just play with their phone and don't listen. In some way I understand this position. Why listen to a discussion about a feature you are unlikely to help develop in the Sprint or ever? What do you think we should do?
