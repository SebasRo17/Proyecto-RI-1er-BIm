Recently I had a discussion with a developer who mentioned that during program development, they routinely create and delete tables and columns on a regular basis while working on new features and justified things by saying that this is normal when using an agile development process. As most of my background is in a waterfall development environment, I wonder if this is actually considered proper under agile development, or if this might be a sign of an underlying problem, either with the program architecture or with their following of the agile process.
