I'm sure I am not alone in this issue so I wanted to see what others do to handle this problem. Whenever I have to reinstall my IDE, one of the first things I do is go out and look for addons. It starts out just grabbing whatever I plan on primarily doing but ends up with getting anything that looks interesting or may find useful in the future. "But it's addtional functionality _for free!_ " In the end I just end up with a dev environment with a lot of bloat. Also happens over time so you reinstall only to start the cycle over again... Is there a good way of handling this?
