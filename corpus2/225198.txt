I have some javascript that creates a canvas image that I want users to be able to share. I simply need to save the image somehow. Nothing else. I've been contemplating using bits and pieces of ruby and activerecord, or perhaps sinatra but I feel like both would be over kill for this simple task. Ideally I'd like to do it with JavaScript but I don't feel like including all of node. Any suggestions?
