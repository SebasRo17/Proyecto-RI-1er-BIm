I'm trying to make an animation of a time-varying 2D vector field. However, I'm got a difficulty in that _Mathematica_ normalises the length of the vectors with each call to `VectorPlot`. A (very simple) example:               myField = {Cos[2 Ï€ t], 0};          Animate[             VectorPlot[myField /. t -> TT, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}],             {TT, 0, 1}]      Expected result: The arrows grow and shrink in time The actual result: The arrows remain the same size, but flick direction Is there some way to fix the length of the arrows relative to the field value?
