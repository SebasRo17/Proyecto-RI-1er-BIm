I'm trying to calculate: $$ \lim_{\beta \to \infty} \tanh \left( \beta A \right) = \mathrm{sgn} \left( A \right) $$ for $A \in \mathbb{R}$, $\mathrm{sgn} \left( \# \right)$ being the sign function. The problem is that Mathematica evaluates the integral to something different:               In[1] := Assuming[Element[A, Reals], Limit[Tanh[\[Beta]*A], \[Beta] -> Infinity]]     Out[1] := 1      which is clearly not true for negative values of A. Am I overlooking something really obvious? Is it a bug?
