Are there any conventions to use if I were to distribute the source for a C++ library I built? The plan is to use CMake as a build system, but for the rest I was wondering what are the standards in terms of file/folder/subfolder naming, inclusion paths etc. What I got so far:   * Put everything in the `$prefix` folder under `$prefix/bin`, `$prefix/include/libname` and `$prefix/lib`.   * Don't use caps for libname. Should all internal includes contain the `libname` folder? E.g. say there are two files in the project: `principal.h` and `secondary.h`. In `principal.h`, should the inclusion statement for `secondary` be : `#include "secondary.h"` or `#include "libname/secondary.h"`? Are there other standards that should be followed? Why?
