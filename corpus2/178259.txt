I'm looking for process-relative information on open-source Swing projects:   * how the task was described   * how many developers were involved   * how much time the solution was taken   * etc. Are there any open source (online) chronicles in that direction? I strongly prefer projects that include the authors' names. I watched this project and it seems fine but still I couldn't find any information concerning some current project task(s), its developers group, some chronicles (tips, milestones, feedbacks etc) For example if I see this swing component I'd like to know the above information.
