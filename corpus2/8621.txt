Mouse motion heat map is an great way to study spatial attention distribution, styles of movement, reaction, etc. I am trying to design a code that visualizes such heat map. The requirements: 1) It must be real fast and 2) it must run for long time - no memory overload, etc. Simply collecting data points from 'MousePosition' in a list would probably run into a memory and slow interpolating graphics problems (unless you guys can prove otherwise ;-) ). So I came up with the idea of collecting data in an 'ArrayPlot'. This is pretty fast:               Manipulate[      IC = If[MousePosition["Graphics"] == None, IC, "fake",        Chop@Mod[IC + splash[100, 20] @@             Floor[{100 - #2, #1} & @@ MousePosition["Graphics"]], 10^6]];      ArrayPlot[IC, PlotRange -> All, PlotRangePadding -> 0,        Frame -> False, ImageSize -> 400, ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap"]      , FrameMargins -> 0, AppearanceElements -> None      , Initialization :> (        IC = SparseArray[{{1, 1} -> 0., 100 {1, 1} -> 0.}];        splash[n_, r_][x_, y_] :=          SparseArray[Flatten[Table[{1 + Mod[i, n], 1 + Mod[j, n]} ->               1. Exp[-((i - x)^2 + (j - y)^2)/(n/10.)], {i, x - r,               x + r}, {j, y - r, y + r}]~            Join~{{1, 1} -> 0., n {1, 1} -> 0.}, 1]])]      This is an insight into how handwriting proceeds through time, where the hand spends more time, which part are more difficult to draw: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ol80G.png) And here some very basic type of further analysis or visualization:               Column[ListPlot[#, PlotRange -> All, PlotRangePadding -> 0,          Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 600, ColorFunction -> "DarkRainbow",          Joined -> True, PlotStyle -> Opacity[.3],          AspectRatio -> 1/5] & /@ {IC, Transpose@IC}, Spacings -> .05]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Swsu1.png) **My questions are: is there more efficient and fast approach? what interesting Mathematica stats we could try? what cool apps we can make (games, writing, etc.)?** All approaches are welcome.
