I am finishing up a decently sized Python/Shell project, and I'm wondering if there's a 'best practice' list of things to do when finishing up development. So far I've done:   * pylint   * pycallgraph   * grep'ed for :TODO: and :FIXME:   * find orphan code   * some more documentation   * install scripts for client and server   * make sure comments match the reality (before I forget the finer points) What other things do you do, generally, or Python-specific?
