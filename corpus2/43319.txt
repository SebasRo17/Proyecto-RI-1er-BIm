Here I have one problem how to solve numerically equation for different values of one parameter x. I used just two digits because of length, but for x=0.57 I should have one real root and for others 0.6, 0.7 ... complex roots. These seven points I want to plot in complex (Re,Im) plane with line. The first problem is that NSolve doesn't work, with Reduce I can obtain some results with problems. Another problem is to understand what's happen when x-> Infinity                     x = {0.57, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.1};                NSolve[1/Sqrt[y]           0.02 (1.`5. I (64.`5. + 2.10 Sqrt[y]) Sqrt[-64.`5. +            4.21 Sqrt[y]] + (64.`5. - 2.10 Sqrt[y]) Sqrt[           64.`5. + 4.21 Sqrt[y]]) Sqrt[-64.`5. + 4.21 Sqrt[y]] Sqrt[           64.`5. + 4.21 Sqrt[y]] + 0.03 Sqrt[y] - # == 0, y] & /@ x
