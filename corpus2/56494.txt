I have this matrix:               mat = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}, {16,          17, 18, 19, 20}, {21, 22, 23, 24, 25}};      and here are its second row and second column:               {mat[[2]], mat[[All, 2]]}     (* {{6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, {2, 7, 12, 17, 22}} *)      When I tried to change its second column to all zeros, this method works:               mat = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}, {16,          17, 18, 19, 20}, {21, 22, 23, 24, 25}};     mat[[All, 2]] = 0;     mat // MatrixForm      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yY2WN.png) But using the method to change the second row, the entire row become a big zero:               mat = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}, {16,          17, 18, 19, 20}, {21, 22, 23, 24, 25}};     mat[[2]] = 0;     mat // MatrixForm      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/efWeD.png) * * * **My question is:** **1)** Why would the replacement of a row versus a column in a matrix different? **2)** Why would setting the list of all column elements to zero automatically set each of them to zero? Setting a list to a single number doesn't seem to work in isolation:               {a, b, c} = 0      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/usAWS.png)
