I have an open-source project, which I would like to commercially license to various types of businesses. xGPL licenses do not work for me since they don't allow any conditional addenda. What I'm seeking to achieve is:   * require commercial licensing for businesses   * allow use and changes under some OSS license for individuals   * allow free use (same as above) to specific business branches on individual selection basis (e.g. educational institutions). I'm really confused about how to achieve this and don't violate the terms of the OSS part of license at the same time. **Edit** : I'm looking for an existing free license, which doesn't explicitly forbid dual licensing like GPL family does.
