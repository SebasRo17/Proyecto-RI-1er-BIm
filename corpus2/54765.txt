What is the most elegant way to draw a timing diagram from a "0 and 1" string list? Here I started to draw the clock pulse diagram, and like to continue to draw the timing diagram for a given 0 and 1 string list, say, `{11011011,11100110}`. The result is supposed as the figure shown below. Pls help.               clockWidth = 0.2;     pulseHgh = 0.1;     rowHgh = pulseHgh + 0.1;     pNum = 8;     diagWidth = 2;     yb = 0;     clock = Table[        Line[{ {xb,            yb} , {xb, yb} + {0, pulseHgh}, {xb, yb} + {clockWidth/2,             pulseHgh}, {xb, yb} + {clockWidth/2, 0}, {xb,             yb} + {clockWidth, 0}}], {xb, 0, clockWidth*pNum, clockWidth}];     txt = Table[        Text[Style[n, 12, Italic], {n*clockWidth + clockWidth/2,           yb + 0.13}], {n, 0, pNum}];     Graphics[{clock}, Epilog -> {Text["Clock", {2, yb}], txt},       PlotRange -> {-0.2, 0.2} ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CAEiE.gif)
