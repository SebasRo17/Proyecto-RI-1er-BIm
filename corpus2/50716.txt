This question may have a simple answer, but I can't find it anywhere in the documentation. I'm trying to find a function that tells me whether a list is a permutation of another list. So the function should behave like this:               TestPermutation[{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 2, 4}] (* Should return True *)          TestPermutation[{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 1, 2, 4}] (* Should return False *)      What sort of works is to use `FindPermutation[list1, list2]`, and then catch the error that says e.g.:               FindPermutation::norel: Expressions {1,2,3} and {2,1,2} cannot be related by a permutation. >>      But that isn't a very nice solution. Is there a neat way do do this?
