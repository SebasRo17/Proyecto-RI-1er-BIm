So I got an email "interview" with questions to be answered. I'm not too sure only about one of them, so I wanted to google the answer. Of course in a real interview I can't do this, so should I say "I don't know", or research it? I mean, if I were on the job, I'd research it, so it can't be frowned upon? Right?
