I have some lists that will always contain non-negative values, sometimes all zeros. Whatever non-negative values appear in the list, I would like the plots to appear without a negative y-axis. I'll use constant arrays instead of real data for the purpose of this message:               ListLinePlot[ConstantArray[0, 640], PlotRange -> {Full, {0, Full}}]      ![zero case](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xco0U.jpg)               ListLinePlot[ConstantArray[1, 640], PlotRange -> {Full, {0, Full}}]      ![one case](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dS6VW.jpg) Ignore the aspect ratios... Doesn't the `{0, Full}` portion of `PlotRange -> {Full, {0, Full}}]` specify that I don't want to see anything under y == 0? If so, why does the first plot (zeros) produce a negative y-axis and is there any way to suppress it?
