Some software (commonly the commercial ones) producers provide minimum requirements, some examples: Skype, Diablo III, Ubuntu-Server and OpenOffice. I wonder how those minimum requirements are determined, especially RAM, CPU frequency in general? Is there a logic behind it or is it just determined by testing the program with different hardware to find out what would be okay for the end user? If there is a logic to determine such parameters, e.g., how could I prepare such requirements for a C or JAVA code (assuming that it has >10k line)?
