Sometimes, I use Mathematica to do some hypothesis on homeworks to make the question easier. For instance, when I have to compute big sums when $n\to\infty$ and Mathematica can't give the exact answer, I set $n$ to a very big number and I get an approached value. Is it possible with this value to get possible closed forms just like in Wolfram Alpha (which by the way runs Mathematica's kernel) ? **Example :** I have to find out the sum of all $\frac{1}{2p!}$ when $p$ goes from $0$ to $+\infty$ and let's say Mathematica doesn't directly say it's $\frac{e}{2}$, but it gives 1.66 for a big value of $n$. Is there a function which can figure out which constant is near this number ?
