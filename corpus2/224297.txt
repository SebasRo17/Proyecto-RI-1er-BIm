If I have an array that has more info than I need and I want to pull out a subset of its name value pairs I have come up with 2 methods. Both rely on this:                 $detailkeys=array(title,summary,subtitle,url,imgsrc,description);      The method I came up with on my own:                 foreach ($detailkeys as $keyname) {         $details[$keyname]=$data[$keyname];       }      The method I found online:                 // get just the desired parts of $data and put them in $details.       $details=array_intersect_key($data, array_flip($detailkeys));       The second method, with a decent comment, is what I chose, but wanted to see what anyone else had to say about it.
