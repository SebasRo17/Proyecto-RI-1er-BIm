This question is related to this quesion. The goal is to use `ParallelMap` to map a function to a nested `Table` to get the FinestGrained distribution of calculation. But after that, I want to recover the original nested data structure instead of a flat one. For example, say I have a nested `Table` like this               Table[      Table[{line, honeycombnum, distance}, {line, 1,         honeycombnum + 1}, {distance, 1, 4}], {honeycombnum, 2, 5}]      as you can see, this nested table structure is **not of equal length** . Then **what is the general way** to recover the data structure after using               ParallelMap[f[#[[1]], #[[2]], #[[3]]] &, Flatten[Table[        Table[{line, honeycombnum, distance}, {line, 1,           honeycombnum + 1}, {distance, 1, 4}], {honeycombnum, 2, 5}], 2], Method -> "FinestGrained"]      **By the word "general ", I mean the method should be suitable for arbitrary complex`Table` structure.**
