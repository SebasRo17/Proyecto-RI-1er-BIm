How to display data in a Dynamic Pane   without exponents? Some data:               data = Range[1, 1000];        Slider data has to be added to data:               Slider[Dynamic[n], {0, 10000000}]        A Dynamic Pane:               Dynamic[Pane[Pane[TableForm[n + data],100], ImageSize -> {200, 200}, Scrollbars -> True]]        Plane numbers without exponents are wanted in the Pane.   . **UPDATE** Build a file with 10.000 records.   (File could have an arbitrary number of records)   Make each record a string 50 bytes in length.   The content of the records does not matter. The method gives a Slider and a Pane.   The Slider allows to pre-set to a rough record position   in file. It sticks always to a record boundary.   The Panes Scrollbars allow to see through the   chunk of records loaded into the pane. The Question is: How to modify the working of Module[] so its functionality is   preserved and the display of the StreamPosition value avoided. This value is visible right above the Slider object.   Only the Slider, the Pane and the Panes   content should be visible.               (* txt data file 10.000 fixed length records 50 bytes each *)       infil = "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\test 10T fixed.txt";            (* a stream onto the file *)       str = OpenRead[infil, BinaryFormat -> True];            (* a table to build up the shown record numbers *)       panebias = Range[1, 200];            (* a table with a delimiter sign to separate the Pane panels        first and second column *)       deli = Table["|", {200}];            (* the last StreamPointerPosition to go to fit the last record       into the pane. 10.000 records times records bytes plus 2 bytes       for taking into account BinaryFormat *)       last = 10000*52 - 200*52;            (* preset the Slider position for its StreamPosition *)       n = 0;            Module[{},      Column[       {Dynamic[SetStreamPosition[str, n]],        Slider[Dynamic[n], {0, last, 52}, ImageSize -> 450,          Appearance -> Small],        Pane[Grid /@           Dynamic[Transpose[{n/52 + panebias, deli,              ReadList[str, Record, 200]}]],         ImageSize -> {450, 200}, Scrollbars -> True]}       ]      ]        ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x5V6n.jpg)
