I need help creating a plot that I can manipulate the variables for the volume between three surfaces. I am trying to make it look like this example here: http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ExploringCylindricalCoordinates/ but with the volume I need. It is volume that lies within the cylinder x^2+y^2=1, above the plain z=0 ,and below the cone z^2=4x^2+4y^2. I converted to cylindrical coordinates (z,r,theta). Here is what I have so far.:               Show[RevolutionPlot3D[2 r, {r, 0, 1}, {theta, 0, Pi}],       ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[u], Sin[u], v}, {u, 0, Pi}, {v, 0, 2}]]      thank you
