I am very new to web development. I have been a C,C++ programmer for 5 years and I'm starting to get into the web development, writing web services, etc. I understand that basic concepts of web services. I know .Net web services can be written in VB or C#. Working with C,C++ will help getting used to writing code in C#. I do not have experience in .Net framework. I'd like to quickly get into writing .Net web services and learning on the go, without extensively spending a lot of time learning .Net framework (if possible) Any suggestions? Update - I know my way around databases and sql express in Visual Studio
