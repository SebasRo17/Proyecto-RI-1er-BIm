I am doing a small software project on my local PC. I'm the only person working on this. I'd like to back this up to the cloud every day so that if anything happens to my HDD I have a various copies going back in time. I have a box account although that seems to want to sync continuously and with constant file changes with code I don't really want this. Can anyone recommend any site or software that will allow me to back up to an external location online? I'm happy to manually kick off this process at the end of each day.
