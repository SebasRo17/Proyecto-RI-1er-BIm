I'm a Unix programmer and I need to write a (hopefully simple) program for Windows that does the following: (1) Installs from a USB drive (2) Somehow integrates with the OS at a low- level in such a way that it can filter/shape all network traffic in/out of the machine (a la IPSec) I can write in C, asm, Python, Java, but I have no idea about Windows' methods for doing this sort of thing, nor where to start learning. (I could easily do the above with Linux using a kernel module.)
