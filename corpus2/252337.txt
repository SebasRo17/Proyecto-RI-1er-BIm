I am trying to implement boolean data type in C. Basically, I am working with sets. The following code can be used to access each bit but I am unsure whether I can represent sets using this method. Can somebody clarify this for me?               struct SET {     unsigned int b0     :1;     // bit 0 single bit     unsigned int b1     :1;     // bit 1 single bit     unsigned int b2     :1;      unsigned int b3    :1;      };      I can define two structures s1 and s2.. and I will be able to access each bit of these structures (treated as boolean strings). I will have to perform set operations like UNION, INTERSECTION and MEMBERSHIP. Is this even possible in C? Note: I cannot use Java, only C.
