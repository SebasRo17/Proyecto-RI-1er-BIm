As the software I'm writing is using instrument I/O, I cannot use virtual machines to test my software in different configurations. Therefore I'm looking for the best way to make snapshots at different states, and restore them quickly for tests. What tools do you use? Right now I see:   * Windows system restore   * Clonezilla (not in love with it, sometimes failed for me)   * Acronis TrueImage What are your advice?
