I know what a Web API is.   I've written API's in multiple languages (including in MVC3).   I'm also well practiced in ASP.Net.   I just discovered that MVC4 has "Web API" and without going through the video examples I can't find a good explanation of what exactly it IS.   From my past experience, Microsoft technologies (especially ASP.Net) have a tendency to take a simple concept and wrap it in a bunch of useless overhead that is meant to make everything "easier".   Can someone please explain to me what Web API in MVC4 is exactly? Why do I need it? Why can't I just write my own API?
