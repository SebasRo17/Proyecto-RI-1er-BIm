I want to convert a code from _Mathematica_ to Python. I am using the following code to convert a code to hexadecimal, binary and so on:                   BinaryWrite[*file*, 8192, "Integer16"]      But I'd like to see the hex representation, so I am using this code:               BaseForm[8192, 16]      So I get the following answer: $2000_{16}$ I am trying to convert this program to Python. If I use `hex(8192)` I get `0x2000`. Is _Mathematica_ writing the hex file as `2000` or `0x2000`? Can I just use `hex(number)` in Python?
