If I copy a piece of code from somewhere that looks like so               $blah = array(1,2,3,4);     foreach ($blah as $i)            echo ($i);      and rename the variables but forget to do it correctly like so               $apple = array(1,2,3,4);     foreach ($blah as $i) <--- notice $blah instead of $apple            echo ($i);      Then my NetBeans IDE doesn't complain and I get an error at runtime when I run this. Is there a way to catch errors like this without running the code? Which IDE does it? Which plugin? Or the whole PHP development world is living without this?
