Is it possible to have a custom distance metric defined to determine the distance between two clusters in Agglomerative clustering in Mathematica? I have a 3 dimension data with string values along all three dimensions. I want to define my own way of measuring the distance between any two clusters (Strings here...) Also, I want to stop the clustering when the distance between two clusters is greater than a particular threshold value "T". Is this available in Mathematica?
