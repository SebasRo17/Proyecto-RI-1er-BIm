I have a website with quite a lot of registered users, they are stored in a PostgreSQL database. I also running Google Analytics on the website to track the users. Is there a way to individually combine the GA data with the registration data from the website, e.g. finding out the e-mail address of a user we found in GA? Also, is there a way for non-technical people to access the SQL database without knowing SQL? Thanks!
