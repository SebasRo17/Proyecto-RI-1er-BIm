As titled, take ASP.NET/Perl/PHP for example. Because I don't have chance to work with UI Designer/or know anyone like that, so I really wonder do they use any tools to do the UI design? I don't mean tools like PhotoShop or Flash to make the graphic, but I mean like writting CSS, Table layout/color, Div, JQuery animation etc. I know for ASP.NET Visual Studio have some support on UI design, but is very minimum compares to like ExpressionBlend for WPF/Silverlight. I have been still typing everything when I do the UI Design for ASP.NET. So I wonder do people use any tools to help doing UI Design? Or everyone take it like a man to type everything else like what we did back then with NotePad?
