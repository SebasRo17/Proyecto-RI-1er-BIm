I've had experiences in the past working with (traditionally back-end) developers, whose occasionally cross into the front end realm. The resulting code would typically involve:   * global namespace pollution (many many global functions included inline without flexibility or re-use in mind)   * many one-off implementations of functionality which is already supported, or may be more easily implemented with the assistance of an already-included library (raw JS implementations of AJAX/DOM-related functionality)   * mass groupings of inline styles As a (relatively) seasoned front end professional, I've had some success conveying best practices to colleagues who were interested in learning. However, that success was largely based on trust and open-mindedness. What one's options are when it comes to responding to questions asking to why some accepted "best" practices are genuinely better in a way which gains said trust and interest?
