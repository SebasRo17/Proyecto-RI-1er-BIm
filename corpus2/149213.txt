I'm a new programmer (only been learning for about a year) and in my goal to become better at it I have just recently learned about TDD. I wanted to get into the habit of using it since it seems very helpful. I wanted to check and make sure I'm using it correctly. What I'm doing:   1. Think of a new method I need.   2. Create a test for that method.   3. Fail test.   4. Write method.   5. Pass test.   6. Refactor method.   7. Repeat. I'm doing this for EVERY method I write, are there some I shouldn't bother with? Later on I usually think of a way to test my already existing methods in a different way or situation. Should I make these new tests I think of, or since each method already has a test of their own should I not bother? Can I be OVER testing my code I guess is my main concern in asking this. **EDIT** Also, this was something I was just wondering. When doing something like making a GUI, would TDD be necessary in that situation? Personally, I can't think of how I would write tests for that.
