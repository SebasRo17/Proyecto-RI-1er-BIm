I'm trying to construct the matrix by using matrices which are already defined. For example, I would like to construct the following matrix 1 0 0 1 And each elements are 2-by-2 matrix like 1 is for 2-by-2 identity matrix and 0 is for 2-by-2 zero matrix. If I already defined the identity matrix and zero matrix, is there any way to construct the above matrix in terms of these matrices? I really don't want to type like 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 .... to build my matrix.
