I have the following function:               normalSpheres =       Table[Sphere[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 10], 3], .2], {500}];          Manipulate[      Graphics3D[normalSpheres, Background -> Black, ViewAngle -> 1,        ViewVector -> {{50 Sin[t], 50 Cos[t], 0}, {0, 0, 0}},        ImageSize -> Large], {t, 0, 2 Pi}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/la3jJ.gif) I want to imbue this with a feeling of depth though. The best way I can think of is by creating a blur effect for each `Sphere` that increases the further away the object is from the `ViewPoint` (or `ViewVector[[1]]` in this case). Does anybody have any tips on how I could achieve this? P.S. sorry if the GIF makes anyone dizzy... Keyword: depth of field
