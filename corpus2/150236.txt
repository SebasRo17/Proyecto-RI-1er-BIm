I'm about to undertake a project. This requires me to write code, and tons of it. The client's requirement is to hand in all source code at the end of the project. My question is: How do I quantify the price for source code and the software product? Is there any metric that one follows to determine pricing? How would I quantify the software product? _Extra info:_ The application must run anywhere, in any OS, including tablets (iPad, Galaxy tabs, etc.), Smartphones (iPhone, Android phones, etc.) and also on the web. _(Now, imagine how much code this will be)_.
