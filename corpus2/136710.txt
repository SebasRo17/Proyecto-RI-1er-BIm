I recently picked up a macbook and want to start doing some apps for my ipad. I have a chat client written in c# that interfaces a game I play. What I would like to do is write an app for the ipad that would communicate somehow with my c# app. What would be the best approach to this? I have never used JSON but is this where I should be looking? I don't want to spend a ton of time looking in the wrong place, hoping someone here could point me in the right direction.
