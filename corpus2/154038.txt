I just watched a presentation about simplicity by Rich Hickey at InfoQ where he goes over the constructs programmers use to produce artifacts and how those constructs make various trade-offs when it comes to achieving simple artifacts. I think that most programmers would agree with a lot of what he says but at the end of the day I don't know how many development shops are actively practicing development processes and using tools that allow them to make simple artifacts. As an interview candidate I would like to work at a software development shop where producing simple artifacts is a top priority. What are some questions I can ask to figure out if the place that is interviewing me is actually such a place.
