I would like to do the opposite of what is described here. So rather than add a menu item I would like to programmatically remove one (or more). So given a knowledge of the structure of the menu *.tr file ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MKQAu.png) ...I am looking for something like `RemoveMenuCommands` such that if I wanted to remove **Format > Clear Formatting** I could enter something like this:               FrontEndExecute[RemoveMenuCommands[{"Format", "Clear Formatting"}]]      Does anyone have any thoughts?
