I have be developing in c# for the last about the last 8 years.   I feel that i am quite experienced and knowledgeable in the whole .net platform. I have got to the point where i want to start learning objective-c. I have been watching dev videos, reading books and researching online. So far i am getting a good idea of the development principals. BUT. I have not written 1 line of code. For some silly reason i have some type of mental block about writing code. I keep thinking: But what if i am not as good as when i do c# coding.   This leaves me in a endless spiral where i cannot code. If you have been in this kind of situation what was the best way to get out of it.
