We develop a closed source product and customers want to add two parts:   * Calendar    * Contacts Tine 2.0 would provide this, but we want to use it as a library. Since Tine 2.0 uses the AGPL licence, we need to open source our code, if we would use some kind of linking. How can we use Tine 2.0 in our closed source software product, without violating the AGPL? The solution I have in mind is this: Our product and Tine 2.0 could communicate over the database. All HTML views get done by our code, and mobile sync stuff gets handled by tine20. (I would like to open source our product, but my boss does not).
