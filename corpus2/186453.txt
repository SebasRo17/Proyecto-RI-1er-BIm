I wrote a sync tool to synchronize folders/files from Alfresco to Windows.   PROBLEM:   * In Alfresco, /files/can/have/very/very/very/long/filepaths/like/this.txt   * The Windows API prevents me from creating a path with more than 260 characters. In addition to telling the user there is a problem, what is the best practice in such a case?   1. Shorten the file's name?   2. Skip the file?   3. Create a sort of "folder's carriage return", a special folder from which the path can continue?   4. Something else? Files need to be 100% usable by other applications. If necessary directory names can be modified, I can keep a mapping.
