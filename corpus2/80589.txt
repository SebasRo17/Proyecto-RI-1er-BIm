I am intending to work as an independent contractor, writing software for a client based in another country. My work will be provided electronically so I won't need to relocate. However, there is a legal dilemma, as I see it:   1. If the draft contract stipulates that governing law is the law of the country where the client is based, I will find it very difficult to find a lawyer willing to review the contract. (This has been my experience.)   2. If the draft contract stipulates that governing law is the law of my country, the client will face the same problem: _they_ will find it very difficult to find a lawyer willing to review the contract. Right?   3. _There is no realistic third option_. The contract has to stipulate a choice of law - anything else would be ridiculous. Let me go into more detail on why option 1 is difficult:   * Lawyers in my country, who know only my country's law, will simply throw up their hands and say "Can't help you - unless you get the stipulated law changed".   * Expatriate lawyers from the client's country, working in this country, even if they are from the right state or province, will probably be too busy working for corporate clients to be interested in my (from their perspective) petty little contract review.   * So, it looks like my only option remaining is... hire a lawyer based in the client's country? And interact with them by phone/VOIP, email and fax? Is this possible? Will it even be _legal_ for them to take on me as a client? How can I get a recommendation? Is there anything I'm missing?
