I have this simple 3d data points:               v = {{0.`, 0.016821`, -0.5`}, {0.353553`, -0.75`, -0.353553`}, {0.`, -0.75`, -0.5`},         {0.353553`,  -0.013361`, -0.353553`}, {0.5`, -0.75`,         0.`}, {0.5`, -0.020719`, 0.`}, {0.353553`, -0.020719`,          0.353553`}, {0.353553`, -0.75`, 0.353553`}, {0.`, -0.020719`,          0.5`}, {0.`, -0.75`, 0.5`}, {-0.353553`, -0.020719`,          0.353553`}, {-0.353553`, -0.75`, 0.353553`}, {-0.5`, -0.020719`,          0.`}, {-0.5`, -0.75`, 0.`}, {-0.353553`, -0.043838`, -0.353553`}, {-0.353553`,          -0.75`, -0.353553`}};      and                polys = {{2, 3, 4}, {4, 3, 1}, {5, 2, 6}, {2, 4, 6}, {8, 5, 6}, {6, 7, 8},                {10, 8,  7}, {7, 9, 10}, {12, 10, 9}, {9, 11, 12}, {14, 12,                11}, {11, 13, 14}, {1, 3, 15}, {15, 3, 16}, {14, 13, 15}, {16, 14, 15}};      Same data, in 2d representation: following are 2d points                uv = {{0.2505`, 0.500001`}, {0.2505`, 0.624988`}, {0.009907`,           0.500001`}, {0.00005`, 0.624988`}, {0.2505`,           0.375013`}, {0.012311`, 0.375013`}, {0.2505`,           0.250026`}, {0.012311`, 0.250025`}, {0.2505`,          0.125038`}, {0.012311`, 0.125038`}, {0.2505`,          0.00005`}, {0.012311`, 0.00005`}, {0.2505`, 0.874962`}, {0.2505`,          0.99995`}, {0.012312`, 0.99995`}, {0.012312`,          0.874963`}, {0.019862`, 0.749975`}, {0.2505`, 0.749975`}};      and                npolys = {{1, 2, 3}, {3, 2, 4}, {5, 1, 6}, {1, 3, 6}, {7, 5, 6}, {6,                 8, 7}, {9, 7, 8}, {8, 10, 9}, {11, 9, 10}, {10, 12, 11}, {13, 14,                 15}, {15, 16, 13}, {4, 2, 17}, {17, 2, 18}, {13, 16, 17}, {18, 13, 17}};      I am trying to find corresponding vertex order from 3d to 2d. Coordinates are different in both 3d and 2d view. is it possible to do in mathematica?
