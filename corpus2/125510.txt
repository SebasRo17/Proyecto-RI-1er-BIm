I'm working on a project loosely following the scrum model. We're doing two week sprints. Something I'm not clear on (and don't have a book to consult) is exactly what is supposed to happen between sprints: there should be some "wrap" process, where the product gets built and delivered, but:   * how long does this typically take?   * should the whole team be involved?   * does it strictly have to finish before developers start working on the next sprint items?   * is this when code review and testing take place? There are three developers, adding up to about 1 FTE. So the sprints are indeed very short.
