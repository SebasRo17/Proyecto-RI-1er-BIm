I have a case where I need to use one computer's sound card to play sound but I want the sound to be generated at another computer that's on the same network as the other. Ideally the program that does this would only run on the computer that was generating the sound, though I'm fairly certain that isn't possible based on the research I have been doing. What ever I do with it though the solution would need to be such that the computer actually playing the sound would be secure. Thanks for any input.
