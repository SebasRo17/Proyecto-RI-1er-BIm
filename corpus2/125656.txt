The company I am currently working for has me developing a bunch of internal mission critical software. I have one other person that works for me but he's more of a testing guy and not really a developer. The company is concerned about some of these projects and what happens if I am hit by a bus. How does the company pick back up after something like that when there is only one person that knows the code base. One person that knows the current status of the project. I explained that with my documentation and with the documentation with in the code that they would really only need to hire another programmer that understands the languages that were used and that they could be up to speed pretty quickly. They suggested an outside firm that might be "kept up to date" on a monthly basis that could "take over" in the event something happened. I just don't see how this could be helpful beyond paying someone for the sake of paying them. Worse I envision a day a month being wasted discussing the project with this consulting firm. I see how this could be helpful I just don't see it as anymore helpful than hiring a programmer after my untimely demise. Thoughts? Similar situation and how its currently being handled where you work?
