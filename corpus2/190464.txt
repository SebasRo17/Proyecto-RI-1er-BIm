Well I don't want to make it open-source! That's the problem. But I do want to use it on my current job. Company did not agree to sign any alternative license with me and told me to rewrite everything from scratch so they will own it. :( So how can I do it in a safe way so later on the company don't come back to me and say that I am using the code I wrote for them, which will be similar to the first version I wrote and own the copyright, on my personal projects or even on another job? How would you rewrite a second version of a hash map without making it look like the first version? This sounds kind of hard to me. :(
