I'm creating an app that currently allows users to create topics, vote in topics, follow topics, and chat in topics. Currently working on creating a News Feed like Facebook or Twitter that brings users topics that are related to what they've interacted with in the past. I understand this a complex topic, but I would appreciate any answers anyone might have to working towards a solution. Current solution: Point system where topics will be added +1 to +1000 points for user activity. For example: > If user creates topic, then add +50 points to topic. Topic is more likely to > show up on the user's news feed. Another example: > If user "follows" topic, then add +25 points to topic. Topic is more likely > to show up on the user's news feed. Another example: > If topic was created in the past 24 hours, add +24 -(number of hours since > creation) to the topic. Hoping to learn if there's a more practical approach to figuring this out.
