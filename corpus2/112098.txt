People who are used to garbage collected languages are often scared of C++'s memory management. There are tools, like `auto_ptr` and `shared_ptr` which will handle many of the memory management tasks for you. Lots of C++ libraries predate those tools, and have their own way to handle the memory management tasks. **How much time do you spend on memory management tasks?** I suspect that it is highly dependent on the set of libraries you use, so please say which ones your answer applies to, and if they make it better or worse.
