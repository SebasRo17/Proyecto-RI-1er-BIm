I am still having a issue getting over a small issue when it comes to TDD. I need a method that will get a certain record set of filtered data from the data layer (linq2SQL). Please note that i am using the linq generated classes from that are generated from the DBML. Now the problem is that i want to write a test for this. do i: a) first insert the records in the test and then execute the method and test the results b) use data that might be in the database. Not to keen on this logic cause it could cause things to break. c) what ever you suggest?
