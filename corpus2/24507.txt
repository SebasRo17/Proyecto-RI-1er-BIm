I'm attempting to indicate that there is a point-source of light at some position in a Graphics3D-generated image. Is there any built-in tool to do this? My patch-work solution thus far has been to imagine a sphere of radius $r$ centered at that point, and to generate a large set of diameter-length chords inside of the sphere. Surely there must be a better way that doesn't involve creating so many line or cylinder primitives?
