This is probably a simple problem, but I'm having a lot of issues with it because I'm unfamiliar with _Mathematica_ syntax. I have a list               S = {{-1 + x + y}, {x^2 + y}, {x + 2y}}      I am trying to create a function `f` which returns a sorted list _after_ substitution, I've tried variations of the following:               f[x_, y_] := Sort[Evaluate[Table[u, {u, S}]]];      but it simply returns the original list. Any help would be much appreciated!
