If one picks the menu option Format->Edit Stylesheet and then one opens the "Default.nb" link, the newly opened notebook has a header that reads "Deafult.nb" style definitions. In one navigates down in the page, that header stays in place. However, none of the header styles defined in Default.nb produce that specific header. What is the style to produce that type of static header? What are the menu commands (if any) to dock cells?
