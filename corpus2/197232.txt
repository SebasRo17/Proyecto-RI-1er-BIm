I am new to Clojure. I can understand the code I write but it becomes too difficult to understand it later.   It becomes difficult to match parentheses. What's the generic conventions to follow regarding naming conventions and indentation in various situations? For example I wrote a sample de-structuring example to understand but it looks completely unreadable the second time.               (defn f [{x :x y :y z :z [a b c] :coll}] (print x " " y  " " z " " a " " b " " c))       In case of de-structuring, is it better to do it directly at the parameter level or start a let form and then continue there?
