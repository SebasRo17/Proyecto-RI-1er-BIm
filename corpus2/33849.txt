I need to call a DLL that requires two real number inputs to get one real output back. I can get one of the simple example uses of `DefineDLLFunction` to work, but I don't understand what the syntax would be for using two inputs. I am not familiar with C++, C#, Visual Basic, so if any of that is required I'll need to be spoon fed. The dll I'm trying to use is from Refprop. It provides real fluid property data. Here is what works in MATLAB:               temp=200;     p=1000;     fluid='methane';     rho=refpropm('D','T', temp, 'P',p,fluid)      This will return the density (D) for methane with a temperature (T) of 200 and pressure (P) of 1000. refpropm is the name of the dll.
