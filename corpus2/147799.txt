Well, I started using some CSS3 animations a couple of days ago. After hardcoding I've started trying different tools like Adobe Edge Preview version. I made a short animation to get the functionality of the tool http://things.eyemade.ch/css3edge/ After that someone at Twitter took a look at it and said that it is wrong using divs to paint things like these. But I'm not sure about that. Things changed over the last years and if we keep in mind this stuff is going to be used in many web/mobile games, is it really wrong to use divs this way nowadays?
