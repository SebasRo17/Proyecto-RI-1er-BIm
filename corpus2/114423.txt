I'm working with a DB2 database and I can't help but notice - these table and column names are really confusing! I realize that good names are important in every facet of software development, and it's quite possible that the non-intuitive names are unique to my experience, but someone told me that DB2 places severe restrictions on table and column names. **Is this true?** Or could it be that DB2 admins have traditionally followed a certain naming convention that seems foreign to SQL Server veterans like myself?
