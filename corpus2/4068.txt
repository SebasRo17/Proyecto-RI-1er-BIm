I really appreciate it if anyone helps me with this: How can I solve this ODE and plot the answer for $x$ on $[0.6,5]$: $$ \begin{align*} -2xy'[x] = y''[x]+ 47.21 (-.0025 x^6 & + 0.0614 x^5- 0.6087 x^4+ 3.048 x^3-8.0588 x^2 \\ & + 10.586 x - 3.9582)^2\operatorname{Erfc}[x] \end{align*} $$ With the following boundary conditions: $y[0.6]=0$ and $y[\infty]=0$ I used `NDsolve`, but its answer was: > Cannot find starting value for the variable y'[x] * * * Original source of the equation:               -2xy'[x] = y''[x] + 47.21 (-.0025 x^6 + 0.0614 x^5 - 0.6087 x^4 + 3.048 x^3                               - 8.0588 x^2 + 10.586 x - 3.9582)^2 Erfc[x]
