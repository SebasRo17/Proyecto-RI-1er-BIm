Is it possible to attach certain pieces of code to certain controls in a Manipulate? For example, consider the following Manipulate               Manipulate[      data = Table[function[x], {x, -Pi*10, Pi*10, Pi/1000}];      ListPlot[{x, data}, PlotRange -> {{start, stop}, Automatic}]      , {function, {Sin, Cos, Tan}}      , {start, 1, Length[data]}      , {{stop, 300}, 1, Length[data]}      ]      Generation of the data is expensive but it only needs to be done if I change function. So, I'd like the line               data = Table[function[x], {x, -Pi*10, Pi*10, Pi/1000}];      to only run when I change the function control...i.e. I want to attach that line of code to the 'function' control. As it stands, the data is generated when I move the plot range too which is not what I want. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OHJeN.png)
