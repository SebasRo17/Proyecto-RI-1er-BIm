I use .Net and C#. I have the following code in some module:               DateTime validFrom = Convert.ToDateTime(validFromTxt.Text);      This makes (in my opinion) the implicit assumptions   * that there is text in validFromTxt.Text   * that it is possible to convert this into type DateTime. My question is, may the module make these implicit assumptions (due to "knowledge" of context of the page) or would it be better to check them before the command?
