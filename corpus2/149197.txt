Part of our ERP system is a sub-system for running background jobs. We track a variety of meta-data about our jobs in a table including timestamps for submitted, started, and end times. I'm creating a report showing the performance of our job system, detailed by day. One KPI is maximum # of jobs running at once. The algorithm I'm currently using is:               dim cnt as integer    'number of overlapping jobs     dim max as integer    'maximum number of jobs running at one time          for each Job where               Job.SubmitTs = today            'bJob is a 2nd instance of Job       for each bJob where                bJob.SubmitTs =  today and                bJob.StartTs  <= Job.EndTs and                bJob.EndTs    >= Job.EndTs         cnt = cCnt + 1       next            if cnt > max then max = cnt     next      The problem with this algorithm is that it is very slow due to all the looping. I was wondering if there is a faster way to implement this? **Edit** I cannot use SQL queries to access the data.
