I have a problem with a numerical integration. I have a 4x4x4x4 array that has for each entry an integral and I want to use `NIntegrate` to evaluate it. It gives me no problem, it's actually pretty fast. But if I increase the size of the array to 9x9x9x9 I get this message: > NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one > of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly > oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small. I increased the working precision already but it didn't help. **EDITED:** I put here a simplified version of my code:               B9b = Array[Nspher[#2, #4] &, {9, 9, 9, 9}, {1, 0, 1, 0}]      where               Nspher[l_, k_] :=       NIntegrate[       SphericalHarmonicY[l, 0, θ, φ] SphericalHarmonicY[k, 0, θ, φ]*Sin[θ],       {θ, 0, π}, {φ, 0, 2 π},       WorkingPrecision -> 50, AccuracyGoal -> 10, MaxRecursion -> 30]
