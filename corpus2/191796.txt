I normally work by myself as a freelancer, and the setup I use has worked pretty well for me so far. I'm not sure if it's the optimal setup for a team though. I develop on Windows, and I setup a Linux VM on my local machine, running the same OS/stack as our production machines (CentOS, Nginx, PHP-FPM). I setup Samba, and map my webroot to a drive in Windows. Locally, I setup host shortcuts such as `http://someproject.local/`. To share with the team, I use my IP address or an internal DNS name such as `http://brandon/someproject`. I was thinking a possible change to this workflow would be to move the VMs onto one of our internal virtualization servers. One of the sysadmins could spin up a new one based on a VM image and that way all devs are using the same setup. Also means everything is backed up properly. Another one I've read about would be a single dev VM, where each dev gets a folder full of projects they map to their local drive, and any other dev could see the project by going to `http://thedevbox/developer_name/project_name`. I dislike this approach though, as I would not be able to play around with the server stack if I wanted/needed too. What setups to you use at your job?
