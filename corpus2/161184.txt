On this wikipedia page I have found the following sentence regarding closures in C++11: > C++11 closures can capture non-local variables by copy or by reference, but > without extending their lifetime. Does this mean that an existing closure might refer to a non-local variable that has already been de-allocated? In such a case, is there any special care / best practice that one has to follow when using captured non-local variables inside a C++ closure?
