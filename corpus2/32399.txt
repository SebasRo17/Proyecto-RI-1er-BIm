Approximate the minimum value of $2e^{x-2}-6x+xe^{x-2}$. Is my input correct? If not can you please correct it?                               In: MinValue[2 E^(x-2)-6 x+x E^(x-2), x]      I also read that you can find this answer by writing a program to to take the derivative to find this answer. Is this how you do it?                                   In[1]: f[x]= MinValue[2 E^[x-2]-6 x+x E^[x-2]      then it would give you the out[1]. Then you would do this:                                 In[2]:f'[x]      then it would give you out[2]. This is what I know. Can you please help me with the rest? I am trying to learn this by myself and it would be nice if you could help. I also did some research and this is what I came up with.
