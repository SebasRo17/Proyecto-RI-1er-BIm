The following code hangs               Clear[S, Ext, k, α, β, γ, δ, f, a, b, c];     S[k_] := α β^(f - k) γ^(f - k)^2 δ^(f - k)^3;     Ext[k_] := a + b k + c k^2;     Solve[{S'[km] == Ext'[km], S''[km] == Ext''[km], Ext[km] == S[km]}, {a, b, c}, Reals];      This sort of algebra was going to get really ugly and I was really hoping Mathematica could handle it... any ideas on how what might be causing Mathematica to get stuck in the "Running..." state? My goal is is a solution for {a,b,c} in terms of {α, β, γ, δ, f, km}.
