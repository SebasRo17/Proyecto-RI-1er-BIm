Currently I'm an IT student and I'm wondering what is still important in C++ today, what for is it used? I completed basic C++ course in my university but I can't imagine where can I use my knowledge and in which direction should I go learning C++. In other words what should I learn to become a successful C++ programmer? Currently I'm learning Java just because I don't see clearly in which area C++ could be useful today, but I clearly know which kind of work I'll be doing as a Java programmer. But I still hope that C++ isn't dead.
