Assume a simple SPA (Single-page application), _maybe a dashboard_ and these basic conditions:   * The **Model** contains methods for accessing and displaying data;    * The **View** contains methods to load templates and apply model.data to template;    * The **Controller** manages the user commands;   * The **Router** handles the navigation; In our example, we will make sure that the user can configure the dashboard to update itself every _N_ seconds pulling new data from _back-end_ ( _pullFrequency_ ). In which component is proper set up the _pullFrequency_ parameter:   1. Model?   2. View?   3. Controller?   4. Router?   5. Somewhere else?
