Always, when I try to start new project, with what I think new ideas, first of all I search the web to try to find some thing same, most of the time (if not all) I find that my ideas of new project have been implemented hundred of times. I think everyone in software industry feel this every day. The question is:   * when should I approve an idea and start building it, although it's implemented hundred of times around the world?    * how I can make my way in trying of build something new?
