I am specifically interested in SQL Server, but the same question applies in general. When creating a new application, the way I see it, there are two options:   * Create a table called "Users" and store the user name, password, etc. Set up one database user called "application" (and possibly more users for various components of the system).    * Set up each application user as the database user. This may allow for easier single log on setup on Windows-based systems. Which approach is generally preferred? Why? What are the drawbacks and benefits?
