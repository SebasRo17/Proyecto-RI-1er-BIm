This video clip by NASA says that data from Curiosity relayed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) would be stored for a few hours, then transmitted to Earth (apparently taking about 14 minutes), after which it would take _hours_ for engineers to decode the data. From what I've read, it seems that the MRO can be used as a backup communication device for Curiosity if needed. In the case of Curiosity's landing, I figure the MRO would have store the data until it orbited around the red planet and had a direct line of sight with Earth before transmitting it (then again, I'm only speculating here), which I can understand. But then why would it take NASA engineers hours to decode the signal relayed by MRO after it is received here on Earth? ( _Bonus point: Does it normally take hours to decode MRO signals?_ )
