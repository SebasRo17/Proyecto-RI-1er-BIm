I was playing around with Go, and found this particular interesting code for the abs function in the math package: http://golang.org/src/pkg/math/abs.go               14 func abs(x float64) float64 {     15      switch {     16      case x < 0:     17          return -x     18      case x == 0:     19          return 0 // return correctly abs(-0)     20      }     21      return x     22  }      Why do we need to have the special case of x == 0? What will happen if I delete line 18 and 19?
