I am trying to make a cookie cutter that will extract a small square from a much larger bitmap with a click of the mouse. The `LocatorPane` appears to be a useful way to move the cookie cutter around, but I'm not having much luck in drawing the small dynamic rectangle over the bitmap. I would like to change the appearance of the locator icon to a small rectangle, or just make the locator icon disappear. The `LocatorPane` option `Appearance -> Graphics[Rectangle[]]` didn't work. Beyond that there is the question of how to capture a point value with a mouse click. This is my first use of `Dynamic`. I suspect I am going about this all the wrong way and perhaps I should be doing something with mouse functions and cursor images. If so, I would appreciate it if someone would point me towards a pertinent page or two. I have not been able to find one. This script draws the locator on a bitmap labeled "background":               Clear[background]               background = Image[Graphics[{LightGray, Rectangle[]}]];     DynamicModule[     {pt = {180, 180}},      LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt], background]     ]      But when I add code for the dynamic rectangle, I find that it draws outside the background bitmap.                DynamicModule[ {pt = {180, 180}},         {LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt], background],         Graphics[           {EdgeForm[{Thick, Red}],            FaceForm[], Rectangle[Dynamic[pt]]}         ]}        ]
