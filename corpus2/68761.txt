I have a few friends who are small business owners (~100 employees) and I've had good luck turning their Excel spreadsheets and the like into actual applications. It works great for them and is rewarding for me. You guys might laugh, but you'd be surprised the money and personnel time it saves them. The work isn't complex, per se, but I really love it. Why do I love the work?   1. I work directly with the person who pays me and who gets to see the results.   2. I'm working in whatever framework/platform I fancy, so I can stay abreast on new technologies.   3. I get to pick and chose what projects I want to work on. This is great, but I'm getting to the point where I need to get extra income and I'm finding it _really_ hard to branch out and get more clients. Mostly, small businesses seem to really leery of something they don't understand. Any idea how to penetrate this market? Is this something, someone is doing right now? Are there certain industries where this is more amendable than others? This is really my dream, so any advice is appreciated.
