Using the Wolfram Workbench 2 (and Mathematica 9) to build HTML documentation for a package I am developing, I am ending up with HTML pages that contain a lot of text elements that look like this: > Div[{class -> MCap}, {Change a few exchange reaction flux bounds to reflect > an aerobic minimal glucose medium.}] or > Div[{}, {XMLElement[a, {href -> javascript:input('i_9'), onmouseover -> > javascript:return(true);}, {XMLElement[img, {src -> Files/Constraint-based > modeling/I_10.gif, height -> 35, width -> 447, alt -> Click for copyable > input}, {}]}]}]Div[{name -> i_9_out, id -> i_9_out, class -> IFL}, {}] It looks a lot like a shadowing error and indeed a new `Div` function has been introduced to Mathematica 9. Is there a way to work around this for the moment? The HTML documentation builds fine with Mathematica 8.
