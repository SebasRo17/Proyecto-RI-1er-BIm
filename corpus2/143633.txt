I've got an SVN repository of a PHP site and the last programmer didn't use source control properly. As a result, only code since I started working here is in the Repo. I have a bunch of old copies of the full code base saved in _files_ as "backups" but they're not in source control. I don't know why most of the copies were saved nor do I have any reasonable way to tag them to a version number. I _do_ have the dates the backups were made, all backups have proper file system timestamps. Due to upgrades to the frameworks and database drivers involved, the old code is quite defunct; it no longer works on the current server configuration. However, the previous programmers had some _unique_ logic, so I hate to be completely without old copies to refer to what on earth they were doing. Should I keep this stuff in version control? How? Wall off the old code in separate Tags/branches?
