I am lost I just can't seem to get my head around backtracking/recursion approaches. I understand how simple recursion problems like factorials work I can even trace those by hand. But when it comes to backtracking problems I am so lost. I keep trying. its been 5 hours I have been reading various approaches on forums and stack exchange but nothing has clicked. For instance say I have a array with `[1,2,3,4]` and my destination value is `5`. I am trying to find all possible combinations that equal to my destination value. I broke this problem down further to make it even more simple for my self to understand. First I can find all possible combinations of the array and then pass them to another function which checks if the sum of that array equals destination value and then only does it print it. Can someone advice how to approach this? I am not looking for code/answer I want to be able to think and imagine this in my head clearly.
