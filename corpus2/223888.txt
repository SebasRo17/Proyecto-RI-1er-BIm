I made a search on google to find out who are the people in Oracle responsible for updating the Java API in other words who are those responsible for adding new classes and methods to the API and updating the Java Documentation. I could not find an answer to this question which leads me to the next question, what if I had some classes that are not found in the API which I wished to share with others, how do I get Oracle to add those classes for me?
