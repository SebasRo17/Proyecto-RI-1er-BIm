Given the following interface               interface Modem {         public void Dial(string pno);         public void Hangup();         public void Send(char c);         public char Recv();     }      Uncle Bob writes > However, there are two responsibilities being shown here.

Can anyone explain to me how is the highlighted statement true? Why would I have to recompile code that calls the sending/receiving methods if the connection signature changes? I could have injected a ready made connection to the code using it.
