I am trying to understand how a radio button is created in a Dynamic field by reading from an XML using Netbeans 7.0. I know the radio button is created because of the XML being read from database, but I cannot see **how** the radio button is created. Also, since I don't know where to place the break points, I can't see how I would debug the creation of components on the Dynamic Editor. Maybe I am trying a wrong approach or something, so how do I efficiently debug an application like this?
