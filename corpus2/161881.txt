When looking at examples of definitions of done in various sources, they usually include points like   * code completed   * unit tests run   * code peer-reviewed or paired   * code checked in   * documentation updated   * â€¦ In our team, we have a similar list, but nobody ever looks at it because those points seem so blatantly obvious that it wouldn't occur to anyone to skip any of these steps. So we were wondering whether that's mainly a tool for teams transitioning to an agile process and whether we shouldn't just get rid of it. On the other hand, lots of literature claims that all high-performing teams have a strong definition of done. This kind of hints that we might miss an opportunity to improve here. So what are examples of strong definitions of done of a mature team? What kind of points do they include typically?
