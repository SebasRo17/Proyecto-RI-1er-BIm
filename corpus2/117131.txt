We currently have a 'global catch all exceptions' section in our application. When an uncaught exception is thrown, the stack trace is displayed and the application continues running. More often than not, this leaves the state of the application invalid going forward. Especially with NullReferenceExceptions, and threading exceptions being the cause. I decided to have the application log the exception in the 'global' section and shutdown and restart. This was met with criticism from management - who asserted that the user should choose to select whether or not to restart under these conditions, since it never shut down before. ( _Though I tried my best to explain that the issue was allowing the app to continue running in the first place)_. I am looking for things to watch out for now, and specific approaches I can take to handle code that is now allowed to continue to run while in an invalid state.
