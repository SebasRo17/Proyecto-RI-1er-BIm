While answering another question I discovered that `TriangleWave` does not automatically evaluate when given certain fractional values, specifically fractions with a denominator of 20:               TriangleWave[ Range[8] / 20 ]      > >     {TriangleWave[1/20], 2/5, TriangleWave[3/20], 4/5, 1, 4/5, > TriangleWave[7/20], 2/5} >   These are reduced by `Simplify`:               TriangleWave[ Range[8] / 20 ] // Simplify      > >     {1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 1, 4/5, 3/5, 2/5} >   This appears to be the only denominator under 10,000 that does not automatically evaluate:               Cases[TriangleWave[1/Range[1*^5]], _TriangleWave]      > >     {TriangleWave[1/20]} >   Is there a reason to believe that this behavior is anything other than a bug in `TriangleWave`?
