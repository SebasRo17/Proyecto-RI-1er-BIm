I installed Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 Then, I installed Mathematica 10 trial version. I did:               Needs["CCompilerDriver`"]          $CCompiler = {"Compiler" -> GenericCCompiler,      "CompilerInstallation" ->      "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\\VC\\bin",      "CompilerName" -> "cl.exe"};          Compile[{{x}}, x^2 + Sin[x^2], CompilationTarget -> "C"];      I got:               CreateLibrary::badcomp: Compiler specification "Compiler" -> GenericCCompiler does not specify a compiler driver listed by CCompilers[Full]. >>          Compile::nogen: A library could not be generated from the compiled function. >>      How can I set up c compiler which I installed for Mathematica?
