I understand that Singelton helps to instantiate only one class AT A TIME. I try to learn how to Design for Singleton function in java. I want to know it better to understand Kernel. So I try to do this following, but I like to know if it's the only way to come up with private constructor.               public class Singleton {         private static Singleton instance = null;              private Singleton() {   }              public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {             if (instance == null) {                         instance = new Singleton ();             }             return instance;         }     }
