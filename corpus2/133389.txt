I have to develop an application for a gas agency where a database will store consumer numbers, names, addresses, and date delivered for a town with nearly 20,000 people. I only know PHP, MySQL, CSS, jQuery, and other web based technologies. Is it possible to deliver a package to the client using these technologies that can be installed on a computer and used locally? This application will run on a single PC for a single user. I'm familiar with tools such as XAMPP, but I do not want to run a web server locally. Both the application and database will be securely running on a particular computer. In the future, if this application must be on multiple computers, I want the database and application to be portable. I have searched for similar questions on Stack Overflow and I did find some recommendations like Jetty, Adobe Air and the recent Web SQL database. Is PHP GTK also a viable tool for building professional applications? I would like a recommendation specific for this kind of app.
