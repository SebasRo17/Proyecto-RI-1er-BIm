I have problem to draw in _Mathematica_ a plot like this:               Plot[{Sum[a^10*(-1)^(x-a), {a, 1, x}]}, {x, 1, 10}]      The problem is that on the plot there is no graph. As it can be calculated, there should be some values plotted. When I try to draw this equation in _Mathematica_ as               plot (sum(a^10*(-1)^(x-a),a=1 to x)), x = 1 to 10       everything works fine, so I think I did something wrong with the first command in Mathematica, but I can't find the mistake.
