When I enter               Integrate[1/Sqrt[(y1)^2 + (y2)^2 + (y3)^2]*1/(1 + (y3)^2)     * Exp[-2*((y1)^2 + (y2)^2)/(1 + (y3)^2)],      {y1, -\[Infinity], \[Infinity]}, {y2, -\[Infinity], \[Infinity]}, {y3, -10, 10}]      into Mathematica, I get the result               ConditionalExpression[(      E^((2 y3^2)/(1 + y3^2)) \[Pi]^(3/2) Sqrt[y3^2] (-1 + Sqrt[1/y3^2] y3       + Erfc[(Sqrt[2] y3)/Sqrt[1 + y3^2]]))/(Sqrt[2] y3 Sqrt[1 + y3^2]), Re[y3^2] > 0]      However, this is a function of y3, which can't possibly be right. Apparently when other people execute this, they get a different and more sensible result. Does anybody know what setting in Mathematica might be causing this? If it helps, I am using Mathematica 9 on Ubuntu 14.04.
