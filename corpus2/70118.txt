I need to develop a Windows desktop application (win32 API) which will use drag & drop extensively in many formats, including my own. I need to test it, for example, with CF_TEXT dragging, CF_RTF, CF_DIB, CF_METAFILEPICT, and many others. The tool needs to have the following features:   1. Displaying the content of DataObject dragged into it with all available format viewers.   2. Allows preparation of a few samples of different clipboard formats together in a single DataObject, ready for dragging into my app.   3. Allows including my own format names into the formats list of the testing tool.
