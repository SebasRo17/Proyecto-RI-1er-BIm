As of recent I have becomne very interested in serious gaming. Today I ran into this little gem: visual studio achievements and it got me thinking. I actually think it could be very helpfull and stimulating to add such a gaming component to an IDE to improve code quality and basically make it more interesting to write better code and put your IDE to good use. Any thought on this? **Edit:** Just to be clear here: the link contains a funny take on it. I'm interested in the entire notion of adding a gaming element to an ide, with for instance achievements that stimulate the use of best programming practises. Not so different from what StackOverflow is doing.
