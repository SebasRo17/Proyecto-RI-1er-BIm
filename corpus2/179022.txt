RFC: > Request for Comments (RFC) is a memorandum published by the Internet > Engineering Task Force (IETF) describing methods, behaviors, research, or > innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected > systems. At the end of this Intro to REST video, RFC2616 and RFC3986 are mentioned as further reading. After watching the video, I googled those documents and, as the title suggests, I'm not sure how to use them. Do I read them in their entirety and make notes or do I use them more as a reference for when I don't understand something or have a problem?
