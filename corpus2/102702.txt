We are planning a new project and we want to go with a services oriented architecture. Everyone agrees that this is the way to go but how does this fit in with starting the development using agile methodologies? I do not have any experience with SOA, although I have some experience with TDD (test driven development). The team I work with thinks that we need a framework in place before we can even start looking at developers doing work with TDD. In others we spend weeks getting a framework in place (a SOA framework) and then the developers can build on this framework to do their work. From a TDD point of view, I would have expected each developer to just flesh out the functionality using MOCKs etc whilst the framework is being developed (although I have no idea what a framework in SOA would involve). Then we could plug in the actual framework calls when we need to. Not sure if this right but it feels the correct way.
