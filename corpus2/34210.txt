I wrote the following to generate a multiset with the same number of items over a fixed range:               ConstantArray[#, 3]& /@ Range[9] // Flatten      > >     {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, > 9, 9, 9} >   This approach uses four named functions (`Range`, `Flatten`, `ConstantArray` and `Map` (`/@`)) and one pure function (ending with `&`).   Is there a way to do the same thing with fewer functions? Also, if I wanted to have variable numbers of items in my multiset how would I do that?   For example, let's say I wanted a multiset like `{ 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8 }`. By a "variable number of items" I do not mean random, I mean a specified variable number.
