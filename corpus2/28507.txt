So I'm literally just starting a start-up in the Education Industry. A very broad summary that leaves out the vast majority of the idea is that it's a true education management system, one that doesn't just act as a fancy (and very expensive) agenda but helps them along the way. And one that works with school, rather than instead of it. **But my question is where could I find developers who will work for shares of the company, regardless of my age (I'm 15)?** I've begun some very minimal work on the idea itself, designed some of the Teacher Client and part of the database I can't do a whole lot very quickly, and this needs to get going fast because I'm sure there's already people out there doing something very similar. I'm aware of current solutions such as Blackboard or WebAssign and it's very different from those, however for reasons I cannot say without the other party signing a NDA edit: Holy shit I was not expecting this many replies, after posting this question and asking around a few more places the general consensus seems to be that I should do it myself, because at this point I'm in the same boat as those business-types who have good ideas but they just need programmers, however I don't think I have the knowledge to go as far as I want with it by myself, especially in the beginning. What I was really hoping for was finding people who have some free time alongside their primary job who would want to work on an idea on the side but those kinds of people seem to be scarce. I can do this by myself but just not really quite as well as I want On a sort-of-unrelated note to this question, could I also get some help finding some decent Software Design guides? I really don't have a structured plan at all and it's sort of been start programming and design as I go
