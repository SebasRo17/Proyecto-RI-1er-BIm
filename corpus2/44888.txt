I have a function that outputs a complex number               Func[x_,y_]:= blah blah;      I have constructed a table of all possible values of this function.               Bar = Table[Func[x,y],{x,1,N},{y,1,N}];      I do this so it can be faster accessed in the next step. I need to compute the following matrix/table of all possible values of two of these functions multiplied by each other.               result = Table[Bar[[x,z]] Bar[[y,w]], {x,1,N}, {y,1,N}, {w,1,N}, {z,1,N}];      And this actually takes quite some time, because this table would have around `150^4` entries for `N=150`. How can I speed this up? It currently takes around 1 hour using `ParallelTable`. What is the fastest way to make a table of this size and store it to memory to be accessed in a calculation? EDIT: `Bar` has the following symmetry:               Bar[[x,y]] = Bar[[y,x]]
