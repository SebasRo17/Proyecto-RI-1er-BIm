I am reading about `Dynamic Programming` from Cormen.   In the beginning of the chapter it says (relating to the term Dynamic Programming): > "Programming” in this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing > computer code. I can not really understand what this statement means.   I mean, I understand that the dynamic programming algorithms look up solutions, but I get a feeling that this point here defines something fundamental on the Dynamic Programming that I am not grasping.   Any help?
