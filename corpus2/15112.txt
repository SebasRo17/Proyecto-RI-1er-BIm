A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets. Given two lists: `{1, 2, 3}` and `{x, y, z}`, where some of the elements are connected:               {{1, x}, {1, y}, {1, z},{2, x}, {2, y}, {3, x}}      I want to draw a bipartite graph with the numbers `{1, 2, 3}` on one side, the letters `{x, y, z}` on the other, and with edges connecting those which are paired together. **How can I draw such a graph?** Furthermore, **how can one generate bipartite graphs?** All I was able to find in the _Mathematica_ documentation is `BipartiteGraphQ` that tests whether or not a graph is bipartite. I found nothing on how to generate one. Is there a way to do this without the `Combinatorica`` package?
