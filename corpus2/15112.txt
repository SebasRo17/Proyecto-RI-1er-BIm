I'm currently working on the following types of web sites and apps:   1. ecommerce like Amazon   2. Reservation system (think of a hotel receptionist checking rooms availability)   3. Invoice management like Freshbook On Amazon, I didn't notice any breadcrumbs, just facets from the left panel. However, newegg is using both breadcrumbs and facets. In a management system like hotel reservations or invoice management, you usually have unique reservation or customer number that you search through your system. Each reservation can then expand to more sections, for instance:               Reservations         > Reservation #123456             > Guests             > Room             > Airport pickup             > Payment      In each unique reservation page, I'm using breadcrumbs to show the location of the current page relative to the site. Is that a good method to present that kind of information? Should I use tabs or other techniques?
