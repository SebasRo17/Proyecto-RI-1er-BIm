I like to give subscripts to my variable names when the variables are related. I.e.,               Subscript[r, i] = 3      > 3 A problem arises when I later assign `r` to a value and want to use `Subscript[r,i]` again.               r = 6      > 6               Subscript[r, i]      > Subscript[6, i] Is there any way for me to get the value I assigned to `Subscript[r,i]`? Is this the wrong way to use Mathematica?
