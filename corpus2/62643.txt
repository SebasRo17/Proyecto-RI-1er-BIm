Use of EL in JSP's is the proper way to code logic according to the Sun tutorials and samples, which also recommend against the use of Java scriptlets. Yet searching job listings for EL | "expression language" in the SF bay area on craigslist yields 0 hits (vs 144 for jsp, 8 for jstl and 678 for java. this is searching ad text not the titles) so it doesn't seem to be a skill of interest. Also 0 hits on programmers on the topic and I had to create a new tag ;-) What's good or bad about EL and why the low interest? As a java technology you would expect a lot more.
