Is it possible to detect the highest order (or generally all orders) of derivatives in an expression? Consider               eqn = D[a[x,t],t] == D[a[x,t],x,x]      How would I go about detecting that the highest order of the partial derivative in x is 2 in eqn? I was thinking of using MatchQ, however this               MatchQ[Derivative[2, 0][a][x, t], eqn]      just returns False. Thank you!
