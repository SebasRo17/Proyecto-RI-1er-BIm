I have financial data (list of time-values pairs). There are more than `13000` elements.               data = FinancialData["KO", "OHLCV", {1000, 12, 31}];      I need extract from there some part of data which fall into the time interval. These parts are much. I use function `TimeSeriesWindow`, but it`s too slow. For example on this data               TimeSeriesWindow[data,{{2013,8,22},{2013,8,26}}];//AbsoluteTiming     (*{0.618035,Null}*)      Is the any faster function with the similar functionality? Or how do that operations fater?
