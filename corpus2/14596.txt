My manager has talked with me and says that the quality of my work is excellent, but I need to step up the quantity of how much I crank out. I've only been working for a couple of years, so I still feel like I have a lot to learn. Which route do I take (or is there another?): Quantity: If they want crap, I can give them lots of it. Quality: Ignore the request, and hope that my productivity will increase with experience.
