Does anyone have any tips, thoughts, warnings, or general wisdom for a application/database developer who is moving specifically from a start-up sized company to a large organization? Examples thoughts would include things such as:   * How might I interact differently with the management chain?   * Do you see trends in quality or speed of development that differ between large and small?   * Thoughts on team developent.   * Social Aspects.   * Anything else. **Addition:** Does anyone have any personal stories and experiences to share with a similar move? Please let me know if I can clarify in any way. I appreciate any thoughts!
