I originally asked this question here but didn't get a satisfactory answer. > I am using Mathematica 8.0.1.0 on Ubuntu 11.10. I created a 3D plot from an > `NDSolve` output and when I tried to move it about with my mouse, > Mathematica completely crashed and reported a `SIGSEGV` error. > > This error is totally reproducible. What is the reason for this? Is this > version of Mathematica not stable for Ubuntu 11.10? > > Any suggestions? It doesn't really matter what I try to plot. Manipulating said plot with my mouse crashes mathematica. `Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}]` for instance would crash if I moved the resulting plot around with my mouse pointer. Edit 1: The answer on stackoverflow "works". However, it makes mathematica run real slow for some reason. I have submitted a ticket (TS 3197 in case there is someone here from Wolfram mathematica....) to the people at wolfram and have also tried pressing the issue but haven't received an answer.
