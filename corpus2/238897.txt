I considering making my application open source on github. I don't intend to sell it (neither in binary form nor source code form). It probably isn't even useful to a lot of people except maybe for learning purposes. The application is developed in .NET 4.5 (WPF). It doesn't use any external libraries. Only pure .NET libraries as provided by Microsoft. However, it is dependent on Microsoft Sql Server Express 2008. I would like to license the application under the GPLv3 but I don't know if that will work because of the SQL Server requirement. If not, what would you recommend? Sorry, but English isn't my first language and hence I'm having difficulties understanding all this legal stuff. Thanks for your time.
