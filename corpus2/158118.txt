I am struggling hard to learn the application of Object Oriented Programming since last 2 years. I am a developer in PHP technology, I am aware of almost all the basics of OOPS, but still cannot find out the way to apply those concepts over a procedural programming. I do it in very orthodox way, but I don't know why I am coding it in that way. I never have reasoning to justify my oops applications, which has inferred me that I am worst in OOPS, Please help me guys to learn to think over the application of OOPS.
