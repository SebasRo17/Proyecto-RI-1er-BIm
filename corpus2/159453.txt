I have a need to make a somewhat custom change request system (very high auditing requirements). Instead of completely reinventing the wheel I was wondering if there's an open-source change request system, considered decent that I could write a custom module for? I've done some searching but the ones I have found don't seem to encapsulate what a change request system should be (no way of recording test plans or work streams). In my experience a change request system has (does) store test plans / technical specs and a log of work.
