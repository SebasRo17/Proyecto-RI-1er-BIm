I developed a Windows software about an year ago. Part of it was to monitor few configuration files for manual changes by user and if any of these change restart a particular service. So, I used the simplest approach. I load them as a string in memory and after few seconds, I read the latest file and compare it with the one in memory. Since, the files are very small (less than 500KB), the program doesn't consume much memory. I am using that application since it is developed and have not experienced any performance problem due to that. But, few days ago I noticed that the program ranks at highest for `I/O Read Bytes` in task manager. After few hours of uptime of PC, the `I/O Read Bytes` by this program become significant higher than the rest of processes. So, My question is should I worry about high value of `I/O Read Bytes`. Is this have some downside effect (maybe on Hard Disk) that I am missing. Is implementing the functionality of monitoring file changes using Windows API have some benefits that are worth the effort required to implement it?
