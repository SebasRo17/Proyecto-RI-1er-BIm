I would like to solve a difference equation, a Lotka-Volterra difference equation. I tried a model from http://www.stolaf.edu/people/mckelvey/envision.dir/nonDE.lotka-volt.html Using their parameters:               a = 0.04; b = 0.0005; c = 0.2; d = 0.1;      I obtain the following:               eqs = {r[n + 1] == r[n] + a*r[n] - b*r[n]*f[n], f[n + 1] == f[n] + b*d*r[n]*f[n] - c*f[n]}     RSolve[eqs, {r[n], f[n]}, n]          (* RSolve[{r[1 + n] == 1.04 r[n] - 0.0005 f[n] r[n],                f[1 + n] == 0.8 f[n] + 0.00005 f[n] r[n]}, {r[n], f[n]}, n] *)      Mathematica does not give any clue, what is wrong. Can anyone help me find out where the problem is?
