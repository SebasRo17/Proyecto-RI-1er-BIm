I have a program, where I want to create a new instance of the object depending on a value, I take the value and then search the list and using that list I create a new instance. Well, it goes perfectly well. But there is a problem, that I have to write them all manually and it takes a long time. I wanted to know whether there is a better way of doing this or not, here is the C# code I am having               public Account (int userId) {         // here is look for the account         // inside a List<Account> which returns the account         // then I update the values for that instance,          this.AccountLockedSince = account.AccountLockedSince;         this.AuthenticationToken = account.AuthenticationToken;         this.CreateDate = account.CreateDate;         this.IsLocked = account.IsLocked;         this.IsVerified = account.IsVerified;         this.PasswordResetDate = account.PasswordResetDate;         this.PasswordResetToken = account.PasswordResetToken;         this.RequireEmailVerification = account.RequireEmailVerification;         this.TokenExpires = account.TokenExpires;         this.UserId = account.UserId;     }      .. as you can see, these are all the properties of the Account class and I have updated them, but this is not the efficient way of doing this. Any built- in feature in the C# .NET framework to handle this?
