I have a personal web project I cut my teeth on learning how to program. I wrote it in PHP and learned as I went. I eventually I re-factored it to use MVC and removed all mixing of php/html. Right now it has no users, save myself, and it makes no money. I have a strong desire to rewrite the entire app. Which really isn't that large of an app. I have a lot of reasons why I should not rewrite it. I know that I should move forward. It's a working app now and it will only set me back to rewrite it. But I can't shake this feeling that I would be better off using a different programming language in the long run. That I'd enjoy it more. That I'd feel comfortable with it. I feel like my one good reason to rewrite my app is that I have a gut feeling that I should. PHP seems like a hack thrown together. I want to use a language that feels more elegant to me. Any feedback you have would be welcome.
