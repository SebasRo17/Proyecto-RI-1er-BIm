When you're in Python or Javascript, you should always put binary operators at the _end_ of the previous line, in order to prevent newlines from terminating your code prematurely; it helps you catch errors. But in C or C++, this isn't an issue, so I'm wondering: Is there any reason for me to prefer the second version to the first?               return lots_of_text            + 1;      versus               return lots_of_text +            1;      (For example, does one of them help prevent other kinds of errors? Or is one of them considered more readable?)
