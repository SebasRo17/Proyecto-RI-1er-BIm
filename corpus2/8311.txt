This might be slightly off topic, but I'll risk it, as the site is about _Programmers_ ! Programmers are good at constantly learning new programming languages, but how good are they at learning a new spoken language ? Have you taken up a foreign language (French/Spanish/etc) **as an adult** and mastered it? Was it easy? I ask because I have been trying to learn French for quite some time now, and I'm still at the annoying "Je parle un peu de Fran√ßaise" stage. I've attended two French courses, one where the majority of the class were programmers, and one where they weren't and the difference in ability was quite apparent. Does a mathematical / logical inclination hinder learning a spoken language where grammar is not in ones and zeros? Or am I just transferring blame instead of simply accepting that I am not good with languages. _[It is important that you have not been taught the language in school, as early exposure really gives you the upper hand. I've picked up and got quite good at languages I've been exposed to under the age of 10.]_
