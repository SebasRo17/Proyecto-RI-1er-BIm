I am developing a new set of API methods for carpooling/cab booking, so if a developer needs to develop an app or webportal for carpooling, he can call my JSON API. Basically making it easy for developers. My API current has:   * `AddVehicle`   * `AddJourney`   * `SearchJourney`   * `SubscribeToThisJourney(journey)`   * `SubscriberList(journey)` to get list of people who have subscribed for this journey   * `AcceptSubscription(subscriber)`   * `AcceptedSubcriberList`   * `SubscriberList` to get list of providers I have subscribed to I need help with replacing subscriber with something else. It's difficult to remember, and confusing when you see 3 methods that mean very different things: `SubscriberList`, `SubscribedToThisJourneyList` and `AcceptedSubscriberList`. Confusing to remember.   * One is a list of who I have subscribed to   * Who has subscribed to me   * Whose subscription I have accepted How can I name these methods to make them easier to understand and remember?
