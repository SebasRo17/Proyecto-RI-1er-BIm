I want to visually demonstrate the manipulations made to a graph. For instance, I have a graph `g` where using the command `LayeredGraphPlot[g, Bottom, VertexLabeling -> True]` I get this figure as the output: ![g1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TDjyd.png) After adding an edge and using the same command I get this one: ![g2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hmqdH.png) I want to show a smooth transition between the two figures so that the user can track the addition of the edge. Is there any easy/general way to do such an effect in Mathematica.
