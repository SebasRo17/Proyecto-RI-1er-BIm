Is a coding style principle - e.g. the single-exit principle - really a good thing? Always, or just sometimes? How much difference does it really make? Whatever your opinions, these are obviously subjective questions. Or are they? Has anyone attempted to make an objective, scientifically rigorous study of coding style principles? I can't imagine how anyone would do a double-blind study of readability, but maybe double-ignorant might be possible - use students who don't know about the principle being studied as subjects, and non-programmers to administer the study.
