According to Roy Fielding (one of the principle authors of the HTTP specification) in his seminal thesis _Architectural Styles_ when discussing REST, he mentions: > [E]ach request from client to server must contain all of the information > necessary to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored > context on the server. By "stored context" he's referring to _application state_ e.g. what the page number for the next page is vs. _resource state_ e.g. any data store, image etc. - which is arguably the _whole point_ of REST. Is it fair to say that most attempts at _pure_ rest (hereby defined as an implementation that conforms to the above thesis) must fail due to their reliance on storing session data on the **server** (persistent or otherwise)? The concept of a session is common - in particular to Web developers - but is it RESTful according to the above definition?
