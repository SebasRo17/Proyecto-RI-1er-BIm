I am working on a project and would like to expose some rest services. The technologies used are RestEasy, EJB and JPA/Hibernate. I have structured my app so that there is a clear delimitation between the service layer and model layer. A typical service that retrieves data from the database have a signature like this: `getWhateverList(idForWhichTheListWillBeRetrieved, start)` \- so pretty basic.   What I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around is how to bring together the stiffness of the service layer with the flexibility of the rest layer. Say for example that I would like a typical GET method producing a json array support operations like:   * filtering - use a query param to get, for example items that have a property of type date greater/lower than the param that I provide   * sorting - rest api should support asc or desc    * limiting the fields that are returned from the GET operation How would one go about designing this?
