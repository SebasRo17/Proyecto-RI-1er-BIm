We just got into mobile development at our company and see some potential even for a company like ours which is mainly engineering. I'm not talking about cad on the mobile platform I'm mainly suggesting we can make use of mobile for internal applications like a content management system / CRM / internal apps in general. Suddenly I am getting email from a company called Appcelerator: http://www.appcelerator.com/. Our mobile architecture is mainly for our android environment as we are dealing with android phones. However, our API's return data in json format which I believe apple / window / any gadget can clearly understand. The folks at appcelerator continue to email me saying mobile development is a beast and writing a "mobile tier" is a huge burden. I'm not sure what this guy is talking about, our API's are already written (doesn't matter what language, but they are written) and our systems / devices make use of that API as if they were black boxes. For instance, our mobile devices and our actual asp.net application make use of the same data without writing any code (they merely call web methods). The web methods simply return the results in json format. They continue to harp about how great their product is and how we need it. But their own video seems to show that they merely take a data source (Doesnt matter if its sql-server, oracle, or sap, etc.) and convert the data to json format. Which we already do...see their video here: http://www.appcelerator.com/platform/video/?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonuK%2FNd%2B%2FhmjTEU5z16uglWK6%2Fi5h41El3fuXBP2XqjvpVQctqNrHYDBceEJhqyQJxPr3DL9YN1N13RhnlCQ%3D%3D Specifically the second one called "Great mobile apps, quickly at scale". I watched that video (its rather short) but notice how they mention pulling data in different formats is difficult because devices don't understand the format. Then they slam the appcelerator logo on the video and pump out little json widgets as animation - but we are already doing that. Does anyone use appcelerator or can give me any reason why we would need this. Aside from analytic s as we are not at that point already. **Folks I am not asking about how to get out of this e-mail / spam. I am asking if our mobile strategy (At least from the sounds of it) is okay...I mean there system seems to take a dataset and spit it out in a common format (namely JSON)...we are doing this..so were did I go wrong? Again please don't think I am asking for a recommendation on how to get a salesguy to leave me alone.**
