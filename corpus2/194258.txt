Heapsort is a sorting algorithm that has a time complexity of O(nlogn), and performs sorting using O(1) space complexity. However, I know that because it's unstable, it doesn't find many applications (f.e. compared to other sorting algorithms). I know it's used for interval scheduling. **What are some practical applications of heapsort?** **EDIT:** As @AProgrammer pointed out, quick sort isn't stable either.
