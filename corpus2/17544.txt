i've the following problem: because it's not possible to plot complex numbers (or is it?) i created my own "function":                   complexPlot[cn_] :=            Plot[0, {x, -100, 100},                 PlotRange -> {-500, 500},                AspectRatio -> 1,                  AxesLabel -> {Re, I },                Epilog -> {Background -> None, PointSize[0.03],                 Point[{{Re[cn[[1]]], Im[cn[[1]]]}, {Re[cn[[2]]],                       Im[cn[[2]]]}, {Re[cn[[3]]], Im[cn[[3]]]}}]}       ]      with complexPlot, I can plot my complex Numbers, but i want to have one graphic for all my number pairs.                   myPlots = Table[                         complexPlot[linPolesAll[[n]]],                         {n, 1, 16}]              Show[myPlots]      Does not work, it overlays all Plots with the last one (tried it with Show[myPlots[[1]],myPlots[[10]]]) any ideas? Thanks!
