The Web industry is shifting / has shifted towards using OAuth when extending API services to external consumers & developers. There is some elegance in simple....and well, the 3-step OAuth process isn't too bad ... i just find it is the best of a bad bunch of options. Are there alternatives out there that could be better, and more secure? The security reference is derived from the following URLs:   * OAuth 2.0 bad for the web?   * OAuth 2 without signatures bad for the web I've come across this over on the IT Security stack exchange and thought it was poignant from a security point of view:   * OAuth / OpenID / Facebook Connect .. Crazy? Maybe SAML 2.0 is an alternative? What about OpenID? The purpose of this question is from a programming point of view. Is OAuth the **best** option that exists today ...? Do alternatives options exist which allow me to extend my Web Application to consumers that are better from a security point of view, implementation point of view, longevity (wont require rework in a few months), and enabling the support of mobile applications consuming my web application.
