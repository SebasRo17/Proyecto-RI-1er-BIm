By time sensitive I mean for example a script that only runs once a month or a script that runs continuously but gives a certain output only once a month. Obviously you can unit test for a lot of cases but there are exceptions ( in my understanding). A recent example I ran into was setting up a cron job to run on the second to last day of every month. This required using a shell script with cron tab to get the correct day of the month for cron, something like: `1 0 [shell command] * * [my script]` I was unfamiliar with the script and unfamiliar with shell scripts in general and so had no good way to test it other than waiting for the end of the month to come and seeing if the script executed correctly (actually my solution was to find a co-worker who knew a lot more about cron and shell scripting that I did). So I am curious if there are any useful work arounds for testing time sensitive scripts.
