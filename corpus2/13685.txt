Let me just start by pointing out I'm a new StackExchange user as well as a new Mathematica user (started today!) I mention this as a context to my ineptitude :) I am attempting to read through a list with the names of files I want to open, import data from them and plot that data. Here is the code I'm trying to use:               testfiles = ({"aspirina.txt", "silicio.txt", "silicio20.txt",         "silicio20luz.txt", "tio2.txt", "vidro.txt", "vidro2.txt"})          Do[{data = Import[path <> ToString[i, StandardForm], {"Table"}],        Print[path <> ToString[i, StandardForm]],        Print[ListLinePlot[data]]}, {i, testfiles}]          (*     Out[500]= {aspirina.txt, silicio.txt, silicio20.txt, silicio20luz.txt,       tio2.txt, vidro.txt, vidro2.txt}     *)      > >     Import::nffil: File not found during Import. >> >     ~/Desktop/TCOEM/Espetros Raman/aspirina.txt >   etc. The directory and file names are correct, so much so that when I try this directly by just typing the exact same directory I get the desired result. Firstly, I changed the `FormatType` setting of `ToString[]` to `StandardForm` because the default (`OutputForm`) would give me an extra whitespace on either side of the full stop in the file names. Why does it do this? Secondly, why is it that even when `Print[]` seems to indicate the directory is correct I get the exception saying the file cannot be found during Import? I specifically did not format the names of the files in the testfiles list individually as strings (using "" around each one) to allow for the case where I have hundreds of such files and just want to copy and paste their names via whatever file manager I happen to be using. Any help will be greatly appreciated!
