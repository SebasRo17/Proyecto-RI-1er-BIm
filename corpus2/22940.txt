Background: I've worked in a quantitative financial consulting position for the past 4-5 years (financial modeling with Matlab, VBA, Excel mostly). I have a degree in Computer Science (BA) and Math (BA). I'm want to join a startup company to realign my career with my passion: technology. I lack the official "software development" (SDLC) experience but have very much programmed for work and personally (Python, PHP, C++, etc). Question: How competitive are software engineering positions in startup companies? Will I be hard pressed to find someone who will hire me not having "official" software development experience? Does anyone have any tips for me in achieving my goal?
