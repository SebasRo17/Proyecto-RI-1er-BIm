Is there a rigorous way to classify programming languages ? If so, can the various "dimensions" be quantified ? (degree of purity) For instance, I just went on the Shade language website (I am not affiliated with it in any way) and saw :   * "semi-functional" -> But how much is that language semi-functional ? -> quantification need   * "full type checking" -> So type checking can be partial -> can be quantified too ?   * Objectif model / no object model...
