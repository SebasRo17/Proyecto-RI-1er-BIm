I was wondering why the default select tag of HTML, for example:               <select name="company_name">         <option value=""></option>         <option value="1">Company 1</option>         <option value="2">Company 2</option>         <option value="3">Company 3</option>         <option value="4">Company 4</option>         <option value="5">Company 5</option>         <option value="6">Company 6</option>     </select>      is not searchable by default. Of course this is a browser feature, but it is just really weird that none browser (as far as I know) doesn't have it. Am I missing something here? Is there any browser that actually have as default a searchable select tag? Is it so complicated to achieve it, or is it just that people doesn't want it? Is this a problem with OS? I know that I can achieve that easily with JavaScript (e.g. Jquery Chosen plugin... e.t.c.) but I was wondering if there is any plan for popular browsers like firefox and chrome to have it as default. The result that I am expecting is like the below image on Windows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wyzpv.png)
