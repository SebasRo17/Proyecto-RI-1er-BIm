Do you care if the person you're interviewing has created or contributed to Open Source projects? From the pool of people we've interview over the years at my workplace, I haven't found one person who contributes to an open-source project. In fact I'm the only person in the office that is really interested in the (.NET) OSS scene, but I don't believe that makes me any more competent, and it possibly reflects on my social life more than anything. Does OSS participation make your ears prick up if you see it on a CV/Resume? Or are you apathetic towards it? _(This is what made me think of the question)_
