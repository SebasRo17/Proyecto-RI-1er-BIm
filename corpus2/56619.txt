Let's say I have this graph (The code to generate the graph is at the end) ![sample graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/B0JH4.png) How can I extract all the leaves comming from, let's say "cluster3"?, i.e. {100, 92, 87, 89} ![sample graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ON89L.png) I guess I have to first extract the subgraph with "cluster3" as root vertex ![sample graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oyNJ0.png) and then filter the result. This last part should be easy. What I'm finding hard to get is extracting the subgraph. I tried using the Subgraph functions doing like: Subgraph[myGraph, UndirectedEdge[_, cluster3]] But I don't get what I want ![sample graph 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mhwlW.png) Probably this is trivial and I'm just not seeing it. Any kind of help would be super useful. Thanx! This is what I used to create the graph               Needs["HierarchicalClustering`"];          MakeClusteredTree[data_,leaves_,opts:OptionsPattern[]]:=Module[{clusters,expr,ett,edges,optsGraph=FilterRules[opts,Options[Graph]],optsAgglomerate=FilterRules[opts,Options[Agglomerate]]},clusters=Agglomerate[data->leaves,optsAgglomerate];expr=(i=1;Replace[clusters,Cluster[a_,b_,___]:>Symbol["cluster"<>ToString[i++]][a,b],{0,Infinity}]);ett=SparseArray`ExpressionToTree[expr];edges=UndirectedEdge@@@(ett[[All,All,1]]);Graph[(UndirectedEdge@@@edges),GraphLayout->{"LayeredEmbedding","RootVertex"->(UndirectedEdge@@@edges)[[1,1]]},VertexLabels->"Name",optsGraph,ImagePadding-> Full]]          data = {100, 43, 87, 1, 49, 32, 79, 42, 89, 92};          MakeClusteredTree[data, ToString /@ data, {Linkage -> "Average"}]      ====Final Notes==== The MakeClusteredTree function is completely based on this post (highest of high fives to kguler). I just changed it a little bit for my original purpose and another little bit for this post (I'm using more complicated data, huge trees and originally, I only visibly label the leaves. I changed the VertexLabels for this example so I can show you the names of all nodes.
