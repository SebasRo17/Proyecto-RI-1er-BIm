I accepted a new job offer recently as a programmer. I get there on the first day and people are non engaging and didn't really smile. By the end of the first week they reviewed my code and tore it apart, and one of the devs said that they are going to try to mentor me to code better. The description for the position was recent experience in current frameworks but nothing on there about what I would be doing half of the time which would be supporting an older system one minute and bleeding edge the next. I can tell that there is going to be a high probability that I may butt heads with at least one person, since they tend to think that performance is the only thing for code and that should be obvious to everyone. If the code is not acceptable to this person, it doesn't go out( at least that's the impression that I got when I saw their code reviews). One dev told me that the project she was working on was complicated to change and that she wouldn't have done it that way. I come from a background of develop it fast, Refactor to the language standard when its practical to the timeline, but most importantly get it out the door without it breaking. Here its about coding in the fewest lines possible, most efficient code in addition to just getting it done(taking the hill). What do you folks think about this? 1.) Have any of you encountered/worked in a position like this before? 2.)Are there diminishing returns to having to be a jack of all trades, supporting old and developing the bleeding edge?
