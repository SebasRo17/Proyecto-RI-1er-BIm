Is there still demand for developers who crate software without GUI's in the industry? Are jobs still in demand? I only ask because I write a lot of software for myself in C. I mainly use FreeBSD without a GUI. My software is for data mining, automation and marketing purposes most of the time as this is the field I work in. I find that a GUI is not needed and I feel comfortable working within a console. I've never worked for a company as a programmer, but in the industry do you have dedicated programmers who work exclusively on the GUI's and other who write the logic?
