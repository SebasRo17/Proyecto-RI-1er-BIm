I am in the process of trying to learn Ruby, however after spending nearly 10 years in the MS stack I am struggling to get by without intellisense. I've given RubyMine a try which does help however ideally I would like to go free which would mean no RubyMine. How have other people learnt to cope with remembering everything instead of relying on Ctrl-Space? Any advice is appreciated at the moment as I am feeling very stupid (no jokes about MS devs please ;))
