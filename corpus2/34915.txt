I have a C++ program that outputs a set of numbers at each time step. A blank line separates successive time steps. Here is an example of my data format:               0.2 42.8     0.4 12.3     0.6 32.1     0.8 37.3          0.2 44.2     0.4 17.8     0.6 39.0     0.8 30.1      I want to import this into _Mathematica_ with the following format:               data = {       {{0.2`, 42.8`}, {0.4`, 12.3`}, {0.6`, 32.1`}, {0.8`, 37.3`}},       {{0.2`, 44.2`}, {0.4`, 17.8`}, {0.6`, 39.`},  {0.8`, 30.1`}}       };      i.e., the data for each time step is in one list. How do I do this?
