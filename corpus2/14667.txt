I want to know how much wall-time it takes to display a `Graphics` For example this one:               ballGrid[n_] := Module[{lines},       lines = Line[Flatten[Table[{            {{i, j, 0}, {i, j, 1}},            {{i, 0, j}, {i, 1, j}},            {{0, i, j}, {1, i, j}}},           {i, 0, 1, 1/n}, {j, 0, 1, 1/n}], 2]];       Graphics3D[{Sphere[Tuples[Range[0, 1, 1/n], 3], 1/(10 n)], lines},         Boxed -> False]]      First of all note that running `ballGrid[50]` and `ballGrid[50];` takes significantly different wall time to run Just using `AbsoluteTiming` does not give accurate representation (I assume it only measures kernel time):               In[]:= AbsoluteTiming[ballGrid[50];]     In[]:= AbsoluteTiming[ballGrid[50]]     Out[]:= {0.082963,Null}     Out[]:= {0.029378,<<Graphics>>}      I answered my own question, but I'd like to see other solutions too, and know why/if the `Print` workaround can be trusted
