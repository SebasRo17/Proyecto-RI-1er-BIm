I'm approaching the 1 year mark as a leader of a small development team (4 members, including myself) inside of a small software company. I'd like to give my team the opportunity to evaluate how I am doing as their team leader who is also a developer on the team. I find it's hard to get good feedback with an open ended 'How am I doing?' question, so what specific questions are the most important to ask? Ideally I'd like to be able to provide 3 simple questions that my team would be able to answer. Which are the most important parts that you would like to give your team leader feedback on? My initial thought was to allow my team to answer these questions anonymously? Is this a good idea?
