When an application is created which need to store data, an SQL database is used very often. So did I in a lot of asp.net applications. The resulting applications have often an ORM like the entity framework and maybe a business layer. So when such an application needs to be extended(let's say you have to add a comment property to an object), you have to change/extend the database, then the ORM and the business layer and so on. To deploy the changes you have to update the target database and the application. I know that things like code first and fluent can make this approach easier. I tried mongodb, I only used the standard driver and I had to extend some objects and all I had to do was changing the code. So it feels that such approaches are much easier to realize when using mongodb. I don't have much experience with larger applications an mongodb. I know that a SQL database or mongodb doesn't fit for all needs and both have their pros and cons. I want to know if my feeling is right, if yes I would choose rather choose mongodb than SQL database.
