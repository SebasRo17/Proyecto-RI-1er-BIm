So far I've been using IPB and my custom scripts all coded in PHP but I am really disappointed of the long term performance of it. I would like to move to native coding, the learning time to put into doesn't matter at all. Ive found CppCMS and it seems to be the exact solution i was searching for. I would like to know from anyone who has chosen this way, what have you done? Is CppCMS the best one in term of performance? If yes, with what webserver should I run it with and any special configuration? I am really searching for the best way to go in term of performance (learning time and coding time does not matter).
