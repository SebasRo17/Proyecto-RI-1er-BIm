I have a paid Android app that I made by myself this past summer and I've been working on it throughout the year. The app is geared toward a professional niche market (but there are people all around the world who would buy it,) so it's priced highly. It is   * Mostly C++, some Java   * Built heavily on Qt (in the C++ code)   * 15,000+ lines of code   * Well commented in some places but not others I enjoy working on it, but find I no longer have time to slog through the more "menial" coding work of maintaining it, and instead want to focus on building new components and taking it to the next level, where I think I would really get bigger returns. In order to do that, I'm looking at contracting out some programming work to someone else. My app makes some money, but not enough to hire anyone steadily - instead I'll have to just give them smaller jobs to do at a time. I might have to hire someone in a lower economic status country as well, because I expect that rates, say, here in the U.S. won't be affordable to me. My knee-jerk reaction is to go to vWorker.com (formerly RentACoder) where I did a lot of work several years ago. Is this going to help me or cause more headache than help? Here are some more specific questions I have - feel free to answer any that you have thoughts on. Also, please let me know how I can improve this question. Thanks in advance.   1. How can I find a person with the **right skill set**? Is asking for **Qt** and **Android SDK** experience going to increase the price a lot?   2. How can I protect my **copyright**? Is this enforceable in less economically developed countries? Or can someone easily get away with stealing my code and selling it themselves?   3. Are there any other issues you foresee in hiring this person, and how might I address those?
