As a young software engineer, I often hear other colleagues talk about the days of punch cards and "computers as big as the room." The earliest memories of computers that I have involve MS DOS and Windows 3.1. My question is, are there still any companies, academic centers, or government agencies that still use mainframes from the 1960s-70s in their daily operations? If so, can you think of a place that would allow visitors to observe such a machine at work? I know that there are several museums out there that possess such pieces, but I cannot think of a functioning one.
