My Android application is almost done and I spend much time creating a set of very precise help pages in HTML that I display using WebViews. I am now ready for the next step, which is _i18n_. Translating my app is no problem, the strings.xml is not that long and I can easily ask friends to translate it. My problem is about these help pages. When I'll update my app, I'll probably have to update the help pages as well. I saw that it wasn't that simple, even with one language. I need your opinion on how to perform such a massive work (which is not at all my job as a developer). Do I need to:   * Manually update every language help page when I update the app, which means asking all of my translators to provide a new version of their work each time I change anything.   * Provide help only in a default language (probably English, even though the default language is French. French people would still have the French help ;-D).   * Google-translate the help pages, even if it _"not well English is"_. I don't know any way to do it automatically.   * Do something else, which you probably thought of long ago. Thanks for your answers, tips and tricks.
