Following the fundamental theorem of algebra, I can (as stated here in Sec. 1.1.4) factor an $n$th-order linear ordinary differential equation $$ a_n \frac{d^n x}{dt^n} + a_{n-1} \frac{d^{n-1} x}{dt^{n-1}} +\cdots+a_1 \frac{dx}{dt}+a_0 = 0 $$ into $$ a_n \left( \frac{d}{dt} - r_1 \right) \left( \frac{d}{dt} - r_2 \right) \cdots \left( \frac{d}{dt} - r_n \right) x = 0 . $$ The Mathematica representation of the former is trivial, and I would represent the latter as               difOp[t, r] = (Dt[#, {t}] - r) &     an difOp[t, r1][ difOp[t, r2][x[t]] ] == 0      Is there any way to get the Mathematica kernel to connect the two, e.g. to compute the second from the first?
