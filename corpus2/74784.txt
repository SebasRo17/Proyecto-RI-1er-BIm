So I am designing a webpage which will be used for global users, includes users from Canada, US, India, UK etc. I need to apply validations for this phone number field, but I'm not sure the best way to go about this. Some of the valid formats I can think of are:   1. 1800123456 (India)   2. use of "-" in US phone numbers I am a bit confused about what special characters I should allow a user to enter (eg.`- / ()`). How have others solved this in the past?
