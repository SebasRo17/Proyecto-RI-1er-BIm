Searching by closest and position I wasn't able to find an answer--but found `Nearest` by guessing. `Nearest`, however, returns the closest number itself, not the position. After some more looking around, I learned about `MapIndexed` and `Rules`, and came up with this:               NearestPosition[haystack_, needle_] := Nearest[haystack, needle] /. MapIndexed[Rule, haystack];      Is there a more efficient way, in general? (And what if it's guaranteed the list comes sorted--can that be leveraged?) The reason I'm concerned about efficiency is that I intend to use `NearestPosition` in a `DynamicModule` where it may be triggered by every `mouseover` event. (I'm still trying to solve this problem.)
