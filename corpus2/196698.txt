I work for a large bureaucratic (and security paranoid) organisation that provides SVN for its development teams to use. I am working with a 3rd party vendor (at their site) and we currently share code via SVN export and patch files. The only way I have for transferring files is by a FTP drop box or email. I would like a better way to work. I am currently lobbying to get some kind of DCVS system setup, ideally cloud hosted. Failing that I want a better way to manage keeping SVN repositories in sync. In the meantime (or if I fail to get DCVS) how do I keep two SVN repositories in sync? How do I best manage exporting the repository? How do I manage incoming changes?
