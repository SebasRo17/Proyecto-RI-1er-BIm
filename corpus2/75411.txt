I work in a shop that lives by its CI process. We have traditionally used SVN and are considering moving to git (want to leverage its ease of branching, stashing, etc). Thinking in terms that a distributed source control system, by its very nature, seems to put the need for a central repository as a secondary concern, does git create any challenges for a CI process? As long as the developer performs a "commit" then "push", does the concept of a central repo as I would have known it with SVN still exist, making CI builds just a different config (pull from git rather than svn)? Any cultural issues (developers pushing to main repo less often and instead only committing locally perhaps)? Would love to hear success/failure stories from a group that uses CI with git.
