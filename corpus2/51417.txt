I just started using mathematica and I'm facing a problem that I just can't solve. I want to solve the following equation: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/71VXO.jpg) Code:               eqn = {(ao)/((c*Exp[a*(n - o)/n]) (-Log[(c*Exp[a*(n - o)/n])] + Log[c] + a)^2) == m,             ao*1/2 < n};          Solve[eqn, n, Reals]      Program says ' This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Solve.' Can anybody help me with this?
