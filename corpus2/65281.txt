As I understand , in Java, Stack memory holds primitives and method invocations and heap memory is used to store objects . Suppose I have a class               class A {            int a ;            String b;            //getters and setters     }        1. where will the primitive 'a' in class A be stored ?   2. Why does heap memory exist at all ? Why cant we store everything in stack ?   3. When the object gets garbage collected , is the stack associated with the objected destroyed ?
