have been thinking about getting a treadmill desk for awhile now but I just don't know if it is possible to code at one. I can see doing a normal computer job while walking very slow but I just don't know if you can write code do it. Like a lot of people I could stand to lose weight and I am just not in shape anymore. I sit at my computer for at least 12 hours a day and then I am on my laptop for a few more hours. I need to do something to help my health. I also have been seeing a lot of reports about the long term health issues related to desk jobs. Like this. Before I drop a few hundred dollars on a new desk I am wondering if anyone has tried a treadmill desk and if so which one?
