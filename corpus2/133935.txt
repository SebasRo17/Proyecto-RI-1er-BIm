I'm writing a Java framework to manipulate a large amount of data in-memory, where many "cells" that are near each other will have the same value. I'm looking for algorithms and/or techniques specially designed to eliminate those duplication _while maintaining fast in-memory read access speed_. That is, techniques that keeps an O(1) _read_ -access speed. My data is store in immutable objects, to allow fast multi-threading. The data itself can be anything, from 4 bits-per-cell to doubles to arrays of beans, etc.
