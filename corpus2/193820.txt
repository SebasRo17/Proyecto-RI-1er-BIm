As background, I've been programming for about 5 years, and feel like I'm somewhat "up to speed" on industry best-practices and techniques (for web development, specifically), as well as software development fundamentals. However, I know I have a lot to learn. Recently, many free online classes, MOOCs, have been made available from multiple initiatives, including many universities. A number of these courses are in software development, theoretical computer science, mathematics, and other fields that are generally relevant for programming. I've been taking many of these MOOCs, learned a lot, and had lots of fun in the process. However, the time that it takes for me to complete the material **leaves little room for doing much of anything else** , including diving deeper into the subject matter or applying the material in the form of a project (I'm usually taking 3+ courses at once). Thinking about this, I've come up with a few questions:   * From a purely skill-oriented perspective, _what are the pros and cons of taking classes / working on projects?_ Will working on projects help me improve my real programming skills faster? Will I miss out on some deep insight by not taking courses?   * From a career perspective, _what do employers value most?_ (I suspect that I already know the answer) Will a multitude of (open source) projects or a plethora of coursework be most convincing?   * Finally, assuming courses are deemed as a "net positive", _how much formal education is enough?_ If I continue taking MOOCs, when should I take a break and work on a project?
