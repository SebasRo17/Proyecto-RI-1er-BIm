I have an integral which I can solve, but integrate cannot:               Integrate[ Exp[-b^2 m^2 x^2] Erf[c m (x+y)], {x, -Infinity, Infinity},        Assumptions -> b > 0 && c > 0 && m > 0 && y \[Element] Reals]      The solution is               Sqrt[Pi]/(b m) Erf[Sqrt[b^2/(b^2+c^2)] c m y]      but _Mathematica_ only returns the input (at least in version 7 which I am using). Now I have a calculation where this type of integral appears very often and I want integrate to recognize it and solve it. Using replacements does not work because it often appears in combinations that don't match the pattern directly, e.g. something like               Exp[-U1^2 m^2 - (X1^2 + X2^2) n^2)] n^2 m^3      * (Erf[(U1 + V1) n] - Erf[(U1 +V1- X1) n])(-(2/Sqrt[m^2 + n^2])      + Erfc[U1 n]/Sqrt[m^2 + n^2] + Erfc[V1 n]/Sqrt[2 m^2 + n^2])      where integration would be over `X1`, `U1` and `V1`. If I try replacements on this, _Mathematica_ does not recognize that the above pattern is hidden in this expression. Of course I can always do it by hand, but this is cumbersome. The most elegant solution would be to teach integrate how to do this, but I would also be happy with a newly defined function that recognizes the pattern and replaces it by the solution.
