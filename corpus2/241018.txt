I'm a hobbyist programmer, so no professional experience. People here often talk about doing maintenance of software at work. The author of this question talks about doing 90% maintenance and 10% development at his job. My question is: what is 'software maintenance' anyway? Is it mainly about fixing bugs? If so, does that mean that people spend most of their time at work fixing bugs? Or does 'maintenance' include other things, other than bug fixing?
