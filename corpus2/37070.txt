I'd like to plot a number of functions that are linked by two parameters. However, the evaluation of these functions over the defined interval should be carried out only for certain values of these parameters. More precisely, this is what I'm looking for:               Manipulate[      Plot[{1, (1/c + 0.5^2/q + (1/q)*(x^2 - x))},        **if[c < 1, {q^(0.1)*c^(0.1)*(0.87 + x)^6.95,          0.2 + q^(0.1)*c^(0.1)*(1.81 - x)^10}, {c^(0.1)*(0.87 + x)^6.95,          0.2 + c^(0.1)*(1.81 - x)^10}],** {x, 0, 1},        PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 2}}, Filling -> Axis], {c, 1, 5}, {q,        0.01, 0.99}]      The bold-highlighted part is what I'd like to evaluate. Now my question: is it possible to use conditionals in `Manipluate` & `Plot`? Thank you very much for your help in advance. Best, Esco
