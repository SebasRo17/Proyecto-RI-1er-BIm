One method for doing quadrature, called the trapezoidal rule, improves accuracy by connecting the points on the curve corresponding to the points of subdivision with line segments, forming trapezoidal approximations of the area in place of rectangular approximations. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fKYwE.png) I tried to use this method to caculate the integral of $x \ln(x)$ over $[1,2]$. Here is what I have:               area[a0_, b0_, n_, function0_] :=        Module[{a = a0, b = b0, Δx, xStart, function = function0, result},         Δx = (b - a)/n;         xStart[i_] := a + i Δx;         result =            N[(Sum[2 function[xStart[i]], {i, 1, n - 1}] + function @ a + function @ b) Δx/2]]          area[1, 2, 100, x Log @ x]      Unfortunately, it doesn't give the result that I want. Where have I gone wrong?
