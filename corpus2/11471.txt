I'm trying to solve the following differential equation numerically:               s = NDSolve[{           (z + 2 r[z] r'[z]) (1 + r'[z]^2) -z r[z] r''[z] == 0,            r[0.01] == 0.0001,            r'[0.01] == 10          },           r, {z, 0.01, 10}         ]      But, when I set the initial condition to $z=0$, there are singularities, so I tried to set it as 0.01. Also, for $r(z=0.01)=0$ there is a singularity, so I set $r(z=0.01)=0.0001$. However, when I try to solve the equation for any value that I put in the boundary conditions, I'm getting "step size is effectively zero; singularity or stiff system suspected." Is there any method to sort this out?
