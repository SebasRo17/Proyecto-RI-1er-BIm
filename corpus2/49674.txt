What is the best way to build an open source database? I would like to build a database of all vehicles and their related maintenance information (i.e Oil Weight, Quantity, Tire Pressure, Windshield wipers etc). Currently this information is fragmented or just not put on-line in an easily accessible manner. As soon as collection begins, I would like to import this data into the DB and make it available freely to anyone. Is there a process (site or group) that I can start gathering this information in a reliable and verifiable way? In addition to this, are there any issues that I should be aware of?
