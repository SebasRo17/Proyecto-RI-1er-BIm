I was looking at Project Euler Problem 48: > The series, 11 \+ 22 \+ 33 \+ ... + 1010 = 10405071317. > > Find the last ten digits of the series, 11 \+ 22 \+ 33 \+ ... + 10001000. In Python I can do this with a single line :               sum((x**x for x in xrange(1,1001))      But the assembly equivalent of this would be 100 lines and a real challenge. Should I be doing some of these puzzles in assembly to gain some insight into low-level programming and understand how the computer actually works?
