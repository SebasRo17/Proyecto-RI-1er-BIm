A while back I saw a comment on a Stack Overflow question that surprised me: > No one can write an operating system in C. It is not possible. What one can > do is write an operating system in a C-based/C-like language that > adds/defines a considerable amount of non-standard capabilities on top of C > core. Is it useful to define C so narrowly? People say Linux, or a GPU driver, or an embedded system was "written in C", not "written in C-with-some-extensions-to- accommodate-the-hardware." Is it incorrect to do so?
