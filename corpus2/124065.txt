I like the concept of System.Tuple in that it allows me to return multiple parameters in a single function call without instantiating a new class, however does this defy any good programming practices such as Microsoft Patterns & Practices, SOLID Principles, etc. I'm just trying to gauge how liberally I should use this feature or if I should only use it in edge case scenarios when necessary.
