I know that this has been discussed here (How do I clear all user defined symbols?), but my case is somewhat different. How does one unload packages during runtime that were loaded with the start of _Mathematica_? Occasionally, for deployment reasons, I would like to revert my system to the default state, to check whether a function works in that environment as well. I have a package that starts when _Mathematica_ starts, and it contains some modified system symbols too (e.g. extended usage messages for options). Should I include `CleanSlate`` in the same `init.m` file before loading my own package and then later refer to it when I want to return to the default _Mathematica_ state? Would it revert modified `System`` context symbols too? At the moment I manually have to edit the `init.m` to remove package loading and then the kernel must be restarted. This is quite tedious.
