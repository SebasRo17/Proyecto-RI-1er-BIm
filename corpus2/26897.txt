In many cases, `FindClusters` and `ClusteringComponents` provide similar results. Options for hierarchical and agglomerative clustering are available for both of these functions. So, would you please help me to understand clearly the differences between them? Just to be clear,my main question concerns about choosing appropriate function for different research questions and anlysis. That is, it's not important if the two functions (or other similar functions) produce different outputs with the same meaning rather I want to know when to use which function and why. Also, please post any tutorial for cluster analysis in Mathematica if you aware of.
