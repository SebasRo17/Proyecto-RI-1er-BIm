in my application, I have a request type associated with variety of API calls I make to the REST server. when the response from server comes in the same delegate method for web engine's response, I have to check the API type in the request object passed as a parameter to the delegate method and then take the corresponding action. The problem is there are around 10-12 different API request types. So the switch case that checks the different enums associated with API Types, takes action based on it. How to get rid of this switch 'tower' ?
