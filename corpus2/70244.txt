I started learning and using Javascript now for about six months. First i started by following different tutorial on the internet. Testing them, playing with them and trying different variation. Afterwards i picked up up a couple of intermediate Javascript book and learned valuable thing from them. And now i am interested in the following:   * If someone can recommend a Javascript project from where i can learn the structure of a serious Javascript application and a project that will give me an a idea how Javascript application should be written.   * Example:realworld uses of prototyping, anonymous(lambda) functions, general program structure, how to write OO applications, what is the appropriate task to use a closure   * etc.. Further explanation: I'm working on my college final paper, on the subject of graph visualization. So im looking at project that will help me realize good patterns, so i can apply them in my project and also to see viable examples of Javascript design patterns Regards, FJ
