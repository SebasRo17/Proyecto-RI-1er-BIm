I'm looking for hints and suggestions on a design for a multi-threaded URL fetcher in java. Specific requirements are:   * To fetch each one of around 1,000 URLs periodically   * The interval between each fetch will be URL specific   * Intervals are likely to be 2 mins to 1 hour I'm imagining I will need a bunch of fetchers each running in their own thread that get pushed the next URL to fetch when in a "ready" state. I will need to handle errors, e.g quit querying a specific URL if it repeatedly times out or 404s. Any ideas much appreciated. Thanks
