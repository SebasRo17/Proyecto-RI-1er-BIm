An apostrophe `'` is often used when we want to distinguish two variables. For example, if we already have a variable `t` and we may want define another variable `t'`. What I found weird is that, in *Mathematica` it is legitimate to define a variable with apostrophe but it just can't clear a variable which has an apostrophe in the usual way. For example, if we write the following               t'=8      and `3t'` will correctly give `24` but `Clear[t']` will prompt an error says > Clear::ssym: t' is not a symbol or a string Can anyone help?
