Alan kay in his paper, The power of Context pdf link, page 8, enumerates some of his motivations for dynamic objects. Some of the influences like Paper on lisp, early paper on the design of functional computers, Moleculer biology of the gene (he envisioned objects as biological cells) are somewhat clear and I see the point. However, some of the influences like   1. Paul Halmos, Finite-dimensional Vector Spaces,(Clue: Algebra in the Large, he says). I want to know how has algebra influenced dynamic objects? Are there any examples of algebraic structure in the objects?   2. Carnap, Rudolf, Meaning and Necessity, A Study in Semantics and Modal Logic. How's modal logic helpful in defining dynamic objects. How was this work helpful?   3. Kleinrock, Leonard, Communication Nets: stochastic message flow and delay. It seems like this work influenced early implementations of smalltalk. Has it git something to do with analogy between messages. Any explanation would be really helpful. In short, I want to understand how these works influenced design of dynamic objects as envisioned by Alan Kay. I'd really appreciate any help on this. I understand that viewpoints are highly subjective,but I'd also appreciate new insights/guesses as to how you think these works would have helped.
