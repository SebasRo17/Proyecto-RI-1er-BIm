I am trying to have the value for a vertical slider display next to the indicator arrow for a vertical slider. However, my attempt is slightly wrong; the coordinates are scaled to the entire frame of the vertical slider (and not the coordinates), so at the minimum and maximum values, the location of the label is slightly off. How can I get this to work correctly? When I don't use Scaled, the label goes way off of the vertical slider, but when I do used it, it scales to the wrong values. Code:               Manipulate[      Grid[{        {         Style[" Sample ", 12, Bold, Underlined]},        {VerticalGauge[length, {0, 100},          GaugeFaceStyle -> LightGray,          GaugeLabels -> Placed[Automatic, Scaled[{0, length/100}]]          ]         }        },       Alignment -> Center],      {length, 0, 100}      ]      ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/uoYfVhh.gif)
