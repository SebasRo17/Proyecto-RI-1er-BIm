I realised the other day that I don't know how to talk about anonymous methods. It's easy enough to talk about named methods (`The X method takes a Y1, Y2 and Y3`) and classes (`The X class has A, B and C methods`), but it's harder with anonymous methods. **How does one go about talking (and writing) about them**? From the number of parameters they take, to the types of those parameters to the method signature? * * * For this anonymous method signature, how would you read it aloud?               int -> int -> bool -> double      I would say `"int, int, bool to double"`. What about calling it? How would you read this?               (A ,B) => A*B;      I would say `"A B goes/is to A times B"`.
