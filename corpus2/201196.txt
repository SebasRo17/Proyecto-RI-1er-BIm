I've noticed an increase in mobile applications being released that offer high value features, but without any corresponding web based version. Was just reading about a new medical app for iPhone that allows doctors to share medical images, and had this idea been done 5 years ago it surely would have been a web application. Now it's released purely on iPhone without any web alternative. It's been years since I've had a client request a desktop application, and everything has been web based, but today all future projects involve some kind mobile solution. How much longer should I recommend clients to continue investing in web based applications?
