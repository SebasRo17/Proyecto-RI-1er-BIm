I am developing a Java application. While using the application, data would be generated that needs to be stored on disk. I am looking for an embedded database appropriate for a average use-case of the application. Initially I planned to use XML for storing information. But, then after some articles, I found a general opinion that XML is not a very good way for adding information due to I dunno why :P This is roughly the XML format, if I use it. It will give you a brief overview of the data-structure.               <A>       <B>          <C>something</C>       </B>       <B>          <C>some other thing</C>          <C>one more thing</C>       </B>     </A>      The data generated would be mostly elements/objects of type C. The data would seldom be deleted. It would be mostly be added or searched upon. In such a scenario what would be a good choice for storing the data.   1. XML.   2. Embedded Database.   3. Something else. I also looked up some embedded database options. The ones that I found most used are **H2** and **Java DB** (I guess same as Apache Derby?) and SQLite. Which one in your experience has given you better results.
