I'm doing some high-level sketching of a system that will require users to register, when they do they get an account and can invite others to that account. To be clear, an account would be similar to a private workspace, and the users will belong to that account and cannot exist outside of that account. The users will be identified by a unique username (likely their email) and this will give them access to the account on a one (account) to many (emails / users) basis. Each record generated in that account is visible only to those users who belong to that account. Is there a good pattern for modeling this type of system? Being extremely new to programming, I'm imagining a field in each table that references the account #, but this makes virtually every entity a one to many. Is there a better way?
