I'm finishing up a personal project in which I've implemented a library that I expect others may want to use. Without going into too much detail, the library provides a cross-platform interface for parsing a particular type of file, where none had existed before (at least in this language). The project was fun and rewarding in itself, but I think it would be a shame if it were never considered by other developers due to ignorance. How can I appropriately spread the word about this library? My current plan is to:   * Host a webpage with source, documentation, usage, and/or samples   * Respond to SO questions asking the question "where is this tool?"   * Contact a few key members of the related field and give them a heads up Do you think these steps are reasonable? What else might you do yourself?
