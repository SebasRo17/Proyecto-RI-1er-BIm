I hope I can explain what is troubling me. Example: I have an object basket with a list of fruit objects. So normally I would build my routes like this baskets/{basketId}/fruits/{fruitId). But fruit is an interface and there are different implementations like apples and oranges that all require their own resource representation. So how do I build my routes now? Like one of those?:   * baskets/{basketId}/fruits/{fruitId}/apple,   baskets/{basketId}/fruits/{fruitId)/orange and so on   * baskets/{basketId}/fruits/{fruitId}/apples/{fruitId} , baskets/{basketId}/fruits/{fruitId}/oranges/{fruitId}   * baskets/{basketId}/apples/{fruitId},   baskets/{basketId}/oranges/{fruitId} What would be the restful way?
