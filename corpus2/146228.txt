I have read somewhere that the cost of resolving bugs increases if it is not resolved at the initial stage. My question is: Which approach should I take while creating programs:   1. Divide program development in modules. Complete coding one module. Fix ALL bugs of that module before starting coding other modules.   2. Divide program development in modules. Complete coding all modules. Then start fixing bugs in the whole program. Please let me know your experiences in which approach you found better.
