At the moment, the only times I try solving programming puzzles are:   * When I'm bored   * When I happened to find an interesting puzzle, while not actually searching for such (e.g. someone asked about such a thing at SO) I would probably get better effects (become better at them) if I solved them routinely. Do you solve puzzles routinely (e.g. one problem at Project Euler or somewhere else per day) and/or would you recommend others to do so? What is your "programming puzzle solving routine"?
