This is a question specifically for web applications developers. In recent years I spent most of my time on SaaS products, which leads you dig deep into more back-end stuff, like how to use less memory resources, make session working with load balancer, write efficient SQL queries, performance tuning, solving technique difficulty. There is no web designer working with us, generally what we get is a snapshot of what the system should look like, but nobody here cares how you produce it. Since now the company plan changed and they are going to change and the SaaS product will reach end of life soon, and I just feel I lack of those HTML/CSS knowledge, I mean I never got a chance to check those things as a whole stuff, but only learn from what I need to work out. All those above seems made me out of fashion about front-end skills, I seems tend to ignore learn things about it. Till just now I realized that might be a mistake I made, for instance I still tend to use table layout in HTML and just realized how bad practice that is recently. I start wondering if I were going to find a new job, how good should I be on front-end coding compare to back-end skills? Is it OK for now as more and more web designers or user interface designers are hired so we don't need to worry about Html/Css too much? Or should I pause my back-end skill improvement and jump back on front-end a while and then make it half and half? Sorry English is not my native language so there might be something expressed not that clear. Thanks for reading this long post!
