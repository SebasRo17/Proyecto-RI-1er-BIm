I'm looking for a User Guide how to write a JIRA Issue. I'm aware of http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Creating+an+Issue The problem I have is that this documentation is targeted at people having no problem creating Issues and does not explain how to write good Issues and how to decide for example which Priority to use? I'm looking for something like a common sense approach what belongs in an Issue (or any kind of Ticket) in general. I don't need a "definitive" Guide, just something to get the ball rolling and there are common circumstances that apply to (mostly) all development environments "provide context" "provide all necessary Information / don't refer to Information that might not be available / accessible later" that kind of stuff.
