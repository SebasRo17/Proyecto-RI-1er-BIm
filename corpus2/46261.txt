Prompted by a comments conversation here, here's an interesting (and often performance enhancing) use of `Extract`:               target = Join[Range[100], {{1, 2, 3, Range[20]}}];          Rest@Extract[target, {{{}}, {2 ;; 10 ;; 2}, {-1, -1, 1 ;; -1 ;; 2}}]          (* {{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19}} *)      Prepending the `{{}}` to the extraction list appears to suppress the error message one would otherwise get attempting to use `Span`, and it appears that most any valid position/span construct can be used in the extraction list. The extracted list has an empty list as first element (hence the use of `Rest`). Prepending just `{}` makes the first element the original list. I've often found this useful instead of mapping over a list of spans (and faster). This seems similar to the undocumented extension to `MapAt` As noted by Mr. Wizard, this does not appear to work in V7, I'm curious what versions it works in.
