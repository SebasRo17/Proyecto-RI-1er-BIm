As x goes to 0, the limits of x^0 and 0^x go to 1 and 0, respectively. Some say that the best value for 0^0 depends on context, others say that the value of 0^0 should be 1. I'm interested in knowing what your language implementers say. There doesn't seem to be a consensus. For example, in ActiveState Perl 5.12.0:               C:\>perl -e "print 0**0"     1 While in Mathematica 6.0:               In[1]:= 0^0             During evaluation of In[1]:= Power::indet:             Indeterminate expression 0^0 encountered. >>     Out[1]= Indeterminate I'm also interested in knowing your opinion on the matter: What should 0^0 be? And also whether you have ever introduced a bug into a program you were writing (or had a hard time debugging a program) because of the way your language handles indeterminate forms?
