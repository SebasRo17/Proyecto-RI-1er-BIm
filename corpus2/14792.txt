Is there a way to find an existing error message in the `System`` context, that is used for a certain case? I want to include a message in a custom function that compares all the arguments of the function, and checks if they have the same length. I'm pretty sure that there is one such, but I can't seem to find it. And I don't want to insert new symbols or messages to the namespace if I can use existing ones. Now I am looking for a method that is general; i.e., it can be applied to other cases, not just this one with argument lengths. For example I am looking for a message that works like this:               General::badlen = "The length of arguments `1`, `2`, `3` must be the same.";          myFun[x_List, y_List, z_List] /;        If[Length@x == Length@y == Length@z, True,          Message[myFun::badlen, x, y, z]; False] := x*y*z;
