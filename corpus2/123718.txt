In my ample (NOT!) spare time, I'm fiddling with Lhogho and wondering how to go about morphing it into a script engine for web browsers, viz               <h1>My First Web Page</h1>          <script type="text/lhoghoscript">        print [Hello World]     </script>          </body>     </html>       Any suggestions where to start? For Windows, I suppose Microsoft Windows Script Interfaces - Introduction. What about Linux and Mac? On the way there, I'm also trying to figure out how to make Lhogho into a server-side language, rather like PHP or ASP, viz               <head>     <title>Lhogho Preprocessor</title>     </head>     <? print [Hello world] ?>          <body>     </body>     </html>      I figure that'll be slightly easier. Maybe.
