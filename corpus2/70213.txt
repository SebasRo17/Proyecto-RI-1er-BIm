I want to be very specific in my question to avoid duplicate question. Hopefully this is adequate. I am working with non-programmers on a project. They are adult and in IT but they may not have the math background or any programming or heavy computer experience. What are the quickest ways to teach them programming concepts. Just the concepts so that they quickly get programming (as much as they can). Let's say that you have 2 weeks to understand X programming language oriented technology. And these are adults not students. What are some of the best ways for them to understand some of those concepts? What are some solid techniques that really help a non-programmer get the big picture quickly? And I was trying to avoid talking about specific language implementations. **Notes:** I see two major hurdles with non-programmers, (1) They don't understand what a computer really is. To them, it may seem like a magical device. (2) They don't have the time to hack out or even learn programming. There are just some concepts like recursion or understanding data structures that may take at least one all-nighter. They don't have the time to debug and test out a solution. I have worked with people and gone through a programming task (editing properties) and gone through that task step-by-step and asked them to repeat those steps exactly. This works but once they miss a step, then they can't recover. Basically, they aren't understanding what is going on.
