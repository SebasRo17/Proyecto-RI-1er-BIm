Doing unit testing for the first time at a large scale, I find myself writing a lot of repetitive unit tests for my business logic. Sure, to create complete test suites I need to test all possibilities but readability feels compromised doing what I do - as shown in the psuedocode below. **How would a well written, readable test suit look like?**               describe "UserEntity" ->       it "valid name validates"         ...       it "invalid name doesnt validate"         ...            it "valid list of followers validate"         ..
