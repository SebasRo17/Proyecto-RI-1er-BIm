As a beginner programmer I find myself spending hours and sometimes even days on my desk reading code, writing code, focusing, getting headaches and whatnot. I've documented myself on computer health and such, purchased an ergonomic keyboard & mouse, however since I wish to take a career in programming, this question keeps coming in my mind. We all know programming is a tough job especially from a health point of view. Programmers spend hours and sometimes don't even sleep, they develop health problems and eating disorders because they _have_ to get the job done. My example could be purely unique. The question however is not necessarily for health as it is for productivity. I've read articles which said therapy music could help your brain think sharper and be more productive. The real question is, as the title suggests (hint hint): how to improve programming environment for optimal productivity? Are there any specific rules I should be following when programming to help me focus and keep my mind sharp so I develop better code?
