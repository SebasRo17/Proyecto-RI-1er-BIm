I saw lot of code (for example some Android source code) where fields name start with a "m" while static fields start with "s" Example (taken from Android View class source):               private SparseArray<Object> mKeyedTags;          private static int sNextAccessibilityViewId;      I was wondering what "m" and "s" stand for... maybe is "m" mutable and "s" static? Since it seems that is a largely adopted pattern do you know if there some literature about this kind of naming convention?
