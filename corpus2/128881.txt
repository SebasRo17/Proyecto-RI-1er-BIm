I've recently started to work on some iPhone apps, starting from a base where I had essentially no programming experience (I studied Maths & had very few programming modules) I worked my way through Beginning Mac Programming: Develop with Objective-C and Cocoa and found it useful, while it gave me the feeling that I needed to quickly address my lack of a real foundation in programming. For the forseeable future my work will involve developing iPhone apps - I want to have a real grasp of objective-c before things get more pressurised in the coming months. Is my best bet to study c first of all, before worrying about the finer points of objective-c? If so has anyone had any experience teaching themselves through an online resource? It would be great if someone could recommend a website with which to self-teach c. Sorry if this covers some old ground but nothing in the similar questions quite answered my question. Any help is greatly appreciated :)
