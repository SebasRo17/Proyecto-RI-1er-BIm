I am trying to simulate a stochastic differential equation in time and space, but I'm unsure if this can be done in Mathematica. The sde that I would like to study is: $$ dN[x,t]=N[x,t](1-N[x,t])dt+\sqrt{N[x,t]}dw+\partial^2_xN[x,t]dt $$ With an exponential decreasing (in space) initial condition N[x,0]=Exp[-|x|]. Is this possible to simulate with ItoProcess? Thank you, Best, Andrea
