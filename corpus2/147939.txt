I used to write C++ extensively between 8 and 10 years ago. I have since moved on to C# for professional reasons. However, from time to time I see statements like > "If you're still manually tracking pointer references, you're doing it > wrong" or > "C++ is perfectly safe as long as you're using modern concepts like RAII and > not manually allocating memory like a recovering C developer." Both of those were standard procedure a decade ago. I have seen that C++ has been improved considerably in recent times; C++ 0x in particular seems like it has some new capabilities. What's the best resource for a "C/old C++" programmer to get caught up on "modern" C++ patterns and practices?
