Scrum master is a facilitator for the delivery team and acts as a bridge between Project Management and the team. In course of time if he realizes that his team is not delivering the deliverables perfectly possible w.r.t competency of his team, can he question his team members why it is not happening? It is more like a show-cause notice to them. He knows why it is not happening eg:- spending time on social sites or wasting time on less important issues. Is it okay for him to say "reprimand" the delivery team on their style of working? Or should it be escalated and left for the functional managers to deal with it? Important thing to note is that usually in an Org, the scrum master is a good friend with his team and so it makes all the more awkward to react to such a situation.
