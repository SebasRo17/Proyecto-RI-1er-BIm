I don't know this is correct question or not,but I have a doubt. I have two `Lists` names are `list1` and `list2`                list1={a,b,c};      list2={10,20,30};      I want to assign `Part[list2,1]` value (10) to the `Part[list1,1]`.that means `Part[list1,1]` act as `Variable`. after assigning, If I evaluate `list1`,it will shows `{a,b,c}`, if I evaluate `list2`,it will shows `{10,20,30}`. if I evaluate `a`,it will shows `10`. I want like this.. Is it possible like this?
