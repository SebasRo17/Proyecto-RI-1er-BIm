I've learned javascript at school but since I'm working with it and study about it every day, I've found very particular aspect of javascript that I didn't know about. Which at first, was very hard to understand for me and finally, I found it very usefull and easy to implement. And in the final, it gives to my code some kind of "beauty". An example I've once seen:               function getter( input )     {         result = {             foo1 : 'bar1',             foo2 : 'bar2',             foo3 : 'bar3'         }[input] || input || "default";              return result;     }      **Do you guys have other examples of particular use you make of Javascript ?** Thank you **PS:** I use the term _particular use_ because it might be unusual for any Javascript beginner. I believe this question is most likely to belong to the community wiki.
