I am making a notebook that is a variation to the traditional 1d random walk problem. The normal 1D random walk can be simulated easily by               Map[Accumulate, {RandomChoice[{-1, 1}, {100}]}] // Flatten      > {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, > 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, > 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, -2, -3, > -2, -1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, -2, -1, -2, -1, 0, -1, 0, > 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2} As shown, this returns a list of positions along the x-axis for each of the 100 steps. However, instead of choosing a set number of steps, I would like to discontinue the walk when a certain points is reached. This, of course, would make the length of the list of locations vary between each run as it will take a different number of steps to reach x = 10, for instance. How can I do this (without a For loop)?
