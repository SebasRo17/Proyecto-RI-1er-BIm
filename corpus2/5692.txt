I have created a subset of arrays:               b = Subsets[Range[10], {5}]     (* Out= {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 8},              {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}, ..., {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}} *)      This command shows the combinations I wish to evaluate with. How can I add the elements of each subset in the list above to get an output like:               {{15}, {16}, {17}, {18}, {19},..., {40}}
