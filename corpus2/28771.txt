I have been working in `webMathematica` with Application server(Geronimo 3.0.1) in windows, It was working fine. Recently I have changed to Linux(ubuntu 12.04). I have installed mathematica in Linux and made it work then I have installed Application server(Geronimo 3.0.1) and it is working with with sample JSP applicaiton and try to deploy webMathematica 3.2.0 in Application server. I need to change MSPConiguration file to access `mathekernel` like               <KernelExecutable>/home/niren/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/Executabales/MathKernel.sh</KernelExecutable>      But it is not working. For windows I used like               <KernelExecutable>C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\9.0\MathKernel.exe</KernelExecutable>      It was working for windows. Suggest me how should I refer `MathKernel` in `MSPConfiguration` file of `webMathematica` in Linux. Note: I can deploy sample `jsp` application in application server and made it work. But can't make `webMathematica` work.
