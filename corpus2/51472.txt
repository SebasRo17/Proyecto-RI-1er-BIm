I'm very excited about the brand new `Dataset` function. I have played with it in Wolfram Cloud, and haven't figured out how can I add a new column into an existing `Dataset`. Here is an example:               data={<|"col1"->1,"col2"->2|>,<|"col1"->3,"col2"->4|>,<|"col1"->5,"col2"->6|>};     ds=Dataset[data]      Now I can play with `ds` columns. For example, I can easily make calculations between columns using their names like:               ds[All, (#col1+#col2&)]      > {3, 7, 11} Another way is:               ds[All, <|"col3"-> (#col1+#col2&)|>]      > <|col3->3,col3->7,col3->11|> Now, how can I update `ds`, to append the brand new calculated column as "col3"? I tried:               Join[ds,ds[All, <|"col3"-> (#col1+#col2&)|>],2]      without success. It would be magic if I could just do something like:               ds[All, "col3"]=ds[All, (#col1+#col2&)]      But it does not work either.
