I would like to generate dynamic Manipulators for each of the selected buttons in a ToggleBar. How can I keep the state of each Manipulator in a variable? I would like to later access the values of the Manipulators for each of the selected buttons. Thanks.               DynamicModule[{stakes = {}},       Column[{TogglerBar[Dynamic[stakes], {1.5, 3.5, 7, 15, 30, 60, 100,                                            200, 300, 500, 1000}],               Dynamic[Grid[({#, Manipulator[Appearance -> Labeled]}) & /@ Sort[stakes]]]}]]
