We (2 developers) are developing a cakephp app that is running on a remote server. In NetBeans we both have project set up as "PHP application from remote server". The problem is that whenever one of us modifies any of the files, they get instantly updated on the server, but not in the other developer's IDE. We have git + bitbucket set up, but that still looks somehow confusing So I see two possible ways of doing it and please let me know if I am wrong. First one: 1.) We keep on developing the project as "PHP application from remote server" 2.) Once one of us is done with his part, pushes it to the repo 3.) The other fetches, and pushes his commits for the other to fetch But this way it is very confusing in the middle of a sprint, since the other develop had made changes to the script, and you see the system acting depending on those changes, but you cannot really see what exactly has been changed. Second one: 1.) Develop separately on localhosts 2.) Push and fetch the changes 3.) Upload the project to the server This way we loose the usage of server when developing. And it may bring a lot of trouble debugging once the changes are updated on the server The questions are: are both of the views correct and we have to choose one, or do we skip/not know something that would help us in the proccess. Any help, guidance or suggestions are much appreciated.
