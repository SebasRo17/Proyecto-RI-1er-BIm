I've been a longtime PHP web developer. But now I've reached the limits and web doesn't fascinate me anymore. I am interested in learning cross-platform development. I have learned Java for almost a year and know much of its OOP concepts but I would like to develop high-performance cross-platform programs and I find Java to be somewhat slower unless you have a beast hardware. Searching for programming books on C and C++, I have only found that they only covers the basics which are same for every language. Datatypes, Loops, Conditionals, Operators etc. But the languages are no more this minimal. C++ provides STL and I've yet to find a book which shows you how to develop real- world programs using these standard features. I know PHP very well, I have known ins and outs of MVC and Singleton Design Patterns, but then I stumbled upon Qt Framework and some of the apps it has powered: Skype, VLC, KDE and they all are rock-solid. I've NEITHER faced any bugs or crashing issues with these applications on Windows NOR on Linux. **My request** _How should I approach learning Qt?_ The biggest difference I'm encountering is C++'s static typing which is very different than the dynamically-typed languages (PHP, Python etc.) I have already worked with.
