Issuing messages takes a very long time in version 9 and version 10. Can others reproduce this? Is there a fix? **Update:** This is slow only when using the front end, but not when running the kernel from a terminal. System-messages tend to be faster, but not nearly as fast as they were in v8. (`Message[General::args, "boo"] // AbsoluteTiming`) * * * ### Version 8 Version 8 is fast. The second invocation of `Message` is _much_ faster.               In[1]:= $Version         Out[1]= "8.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) (July 22, 2012)"          In[2]:= mysym::mess = "message";          In[3]:= Message[mysym::mess] // AbsoluteTiming          During evaluation of In[3]:= mysym::mess: message          Out[3]= {0.110727, Null}          In[4]:= Message[mysym::mess] // AbsoluteTiming          During evaluation of In[4]:= mysym::mess: message          Out[4]= {0.000389, Null}      ### Version 9 Version 9 is slow               In[1]:= $Version         Out[1]= "9.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) (January 24, 2013)"          In[2]:= mysym::mess = "message";          In[3]:= Message[mysym::mess] // AbsoluteTiming          During evaluation of In[3]:= mysym::mess: message          Out[3]= {0.364160, Null}          In[4]:= Message[mysym::mess] // AbsoluteTiming          During evaluation of In[4]:= mysym::mess: message          Out[4]= {0.220693, Null}      ### Version 10 Version 10 is slow just like version 9:               In[1]:= $Version         Out[1]= "10.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) (June 29, 2014)"          In[2]:= mysym::mess = "message";          In[3]:= Message[mysym::mess] // AbsoluteTiming          During evaluation of In[3]:= mysym::mess: message          Out[3]= {0.343261, Null}          In[4]:= Message[mysym::mess] // AbsoluteTiming          During evaluation of In[4]:= mysym::mess: message          Out[4]= {0.271947, Null}
