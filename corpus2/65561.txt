I am becoming a little desperate. I am 23 and for the last three months I've been working as a software developer for a British Company who develop a leisure management system. Prior this job, I was never a developer and just did some minor university projects and one ASP.NET project which I didn't complete. I was programming in C# but now I have moved to VB.NET, since most of the project in this company are VB-Based. I know my knowledge is very limited, in software design, development, databases and all. The responsibility here is quiet heavy for a newbie, I am the only developer who is developing the whole package (7 programs, all desktop applications) and the thing is while I am getting better at fixing bugs and adding tasks now I need to add a whole component to two of their systems and now I feel I am hopeless (We did a new release while I was working in this three months). I think I have weakness in Data Binding which is causing me the slow progress of adding that component! While I love coding and I wouldn't get tired of it at all (When I go home I have my home coding for fun too), it came to my mind maybe I am not intelligent enough for this job. Can experienced Developers help me on this issue and provide me some advise for getting better and better? What did youselves do at your first carrer in development? What were the problems?
