We are building a large, modular application that is intended to run across multiple processors. I need to develop a method to estimate how long it will take to run all of the functions. I already have the function's execution time on a single processor. Now I need to find a way to account for the communication overhead. I also need to identify if there is a difference in execution time based upon particular functions being spread across a number of processors instead of remaining on the same processor. How should I simulate the overall application in order to identify the communication overhead and to provide an estimate for what the total execution time would be?
