I have following method in my presenters which validates the user inputs on the UI. Basically to capture the value of the text property of the text box, it uses sender object which was passed in by the event fire on the form. **PRESENTER**               _View.ValidateInPut += new EventHandler(_View_ValidateInPut);          private void _View_ValidateInPut(object sender,  EventArgs e)     {         var controller = (TextBox)sender;         var text = controller.Text;              If (text is InValid)         MessageBox.Show ("The value in the Text box is invalid");          }      **VIEW**               private void txtACNo_Validating(object sender, CancelEventArgs e)     {         ValidateInPut(sender, e); // Firing the event     }      Will this lead to unexpected errors? If so please let me know a better way to do this?
