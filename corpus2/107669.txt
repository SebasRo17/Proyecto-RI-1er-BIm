Consider a parameterless ( _edit:_ not necessarily) function that performs a single line of code, and is called only once in the program (though it is not impossible that it'll be needed again in the future). It could perform a query, check some values, do something involving regex... anything obscure or "hacky". The rationale behind this would be to avoid hardly-readable evaluations:               if (getCondition()) {         // do stuff     }      where `getCondition()` is the one-line function. My question is simply: is this a good practice? It seems alright to me but I don't know about the long term...
