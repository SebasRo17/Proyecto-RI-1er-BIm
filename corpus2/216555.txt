I'm writing a grails application and am not sure what the best practice is with regard to comments outside of method blocks. I've done a bit of research and there seems to be conflicting views on how and when these sort of comments should be used. In lots of source code I have seen there seems to be comments above every method detailing what that method does. I'm not sure if grails should be differnet? My question is should I have a comment above each method in my controllers, services and domain objects? i.e               /*     * This method displays the index page     */     def index(){     render view : "index"     }
