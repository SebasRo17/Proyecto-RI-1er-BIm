I want to solve and plot the solutions of the following system on the triangle simplex:               x'[t] == x[t]*(2*x[t] - 2)     y'[t] == y[t]*(2*x[t])      z'[t] == z[t]*(2*x[t])      It is assumed that `x[t] + y[t] + z[t] == 1` for all times `t`. I am looking for output similar to this: ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Koz3AP0.png) I;m also interested in plotting the frequency changes of `x[t]`,`y[t]` and `z[t]` over time. That is, given an initial value, I want to find how the frequencies vary over time?
