It's not very rare programming question, but it's about a work of a freelance programmer and I think you can help me so maybe it's ok to pust it here? So one dev-company asked me for doing a programming consultation. It's should be like this that the company can call me and ask questions and gets answers how to do this, how to do that and so on. I never did this kind of work and I think what is the best way to deal with this kind of cooperation. Should i charge per hour? It can be short questions, by phone or e-mail and it can be not easy to calcuate and take a grip on the time and cost. Or should I charge per consultation? And if something will be not-worth mentioning and there will be more short questions but plenty of them? Or should i charge montly? Did you do some kind of "programming consultations"? Heck i don't even know what is the right name for this kind of job. Do you know any sites or keywords that could help me get more info on the topic of this kind of cooperation ?
