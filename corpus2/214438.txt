Is it legal to use a third party library in a software project that is itself licensed under MPL 2.0? So some potential project hierarchies would look like this   * Library Project [MPL 2.0] (Open Source, Distributed)      * Third party library [Proprietary] (Closed source, not distributed) * * *   * Someone else's project [MPL 2.0] (Open source, distributed)      * Library Project [MPL 2.0] (Open Source, Distributed)        * Third party library [Proprietary] (Closed source, not distributed) * * * My practical feeling is that this is fine otherwise there could be no use of this license on many platforms whose base libraries are proprietary, like on iOS for example. The only difference being that these libraries are distributed to registered developers.
