Sorry for the vague title, but I wasn't sure how to phrase this. I was using _Mathematica_ to solve a fairly simple algebraic equation, but when I tried to substitute the solution into the original equation as a check, I can't seem to recover my original answer. Minimal example:               eq = a == (1 - b)/Sqrt[1 - 2 b]          sol = Solve[eq, b]          FullSimplify[(1 - b)/Sqrt[1 - 2 b] /. sol, a > 0]      The final line outputs > >     {(a (a + Sqrt[-1 + a^2]))/Sqrt[-1 + 2 a (a + Sqrt[-1 + a^2])], >      (a (a - Sqrt[-1 + a^2]))/Sqrt[-1 + 2 a (a - Sqrt[-1 + a^2])]} >   even after I've specified that a is positive. So `FullSimplify` is not enough to make this last line output `a`. What am I missing?
