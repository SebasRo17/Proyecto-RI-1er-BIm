Can I set global preferences that are accessible via "Edit"->"Preferences" programmatically from within a notebook? As learned from this question, turning off anti-aliasing can make a huge difference in the maximum allowable `ImageSize`. This can be done via menu: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jV486.png) The slider is setting the value of `HardwareAntialiasingQuality` that can be found with the option inspector: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gmKrK.png) Question: Is there a way to set/reset the value of `HardwareAntialiasing` (and others) programmatically? IÂ´d like to set this with a line only in those notebooks that benefit from this setting and have proper antialiasing for the rest. Footnote: this answer does help with setting the rendering method directly within a `Graphics3D` expression, and as @Sjoerd's answer shows this also works in more global way.
