I'm programmatically generating some formatted output that generates a cell in the form of a `Cell[]` expression. For instance, the output might be               cell = Cell[TextData[{"Function ",         Cell[BoxData[FormBox[RowBox[{"f","(","x",")"}],             TraditionalForm]], FormatType->"TraditionalForm"]}],        "Subsection"];      (where $f(x)$ will actually be some complicated expression). **How can I get the rendered`Cell` expression displayed in the notebook temporarily during evaluation?** I can display it (permanently) in the notebook using `CellPrint`: ![CellPrint](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nT9Cu.png) I can display text temporarily using `PrintTemporary`: ![PrintTemporary](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pOVpD.png) But combining them doesn't work, because `PrintTemporary` assumes its argument is an expression to print rather than a box structure: ![PrintTemporary doesn't work](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9mqEH.png) Adding `DisplayForm` doesn't work; it seems `DisplayForm` only works for boxes when not wrapped in a complete `Cell` expression: ![DisplayForm doesn't work](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4EBMo.png) So I really need a `CellPrintTemporary` function.
