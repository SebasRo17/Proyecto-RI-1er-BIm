How do you identify users when a programming pair checks in code? I heard a complaint that, often a junior dev will be at the keyboard, using his/her account, but is not going to be the best person to ask questions about the code being checked in (the more senior dev is likely to have the best answer). Is this really a problem? Seems like a programming team could think of some way to identify pairs and get the necessary information in their version control software. I also think they're not benefiting from this process if both programmers don't know what their code does.
