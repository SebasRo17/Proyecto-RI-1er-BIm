I was wondering if someone can point me to some good resources in regards to learning Smalltalk. Total "newb" here :) so I'm looking for like a foundation tutorial. I saw a few videos on Youtube, but most seem to deal with specifics. I'm looking for more of a high-level overview of the language, as I'm trying to learn the principles/best practices behind OOP. From reading here, Smalltalk seems to be a good foundation. Thanks in advance for your help!
