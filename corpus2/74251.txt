Where I work McAfee On Access scan is enforced to be on for all our machines. Visual Studio 2010 isn't exactly the speediest program at times but combining a large website, several build configurations and mercurial repository files in a project folder results in a very large number of small files, many of which get scanned when being read or written. I'd like to try and ask our IT department to add some exceptions to help speed VS up but that will likely not be an easy task. What recommendations do you have for the minimum list of exclusions I could give that would give the most noticable improvements?
