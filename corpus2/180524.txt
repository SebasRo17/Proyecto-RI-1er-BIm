**Problem Statement -** ![Problem Statement](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F6HJC.png) Given a 2xN grid of numbers, the task is to find the most profitable tiling combination (each tile covers 2x1 cells; vertically or horizontally) covering all tiles. I thought of approaching it in the greedy way, enqueuing the max possible for any cell, but it has a fallback that a low-profit choice at i, could yield a greater profit at i+n tiles. So what should be the approach?
