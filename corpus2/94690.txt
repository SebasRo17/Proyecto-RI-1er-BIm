I'm trying to convince my co-workers about the merits of developing on local environments, but so far have had little luck in my quest. Outside of myself, the other developers with my company develop on seperate folders on the same server as our development server, using the same DB/DB Server/Web Server for all folders, with your standard text editor on the local machines. I've mentioned the benefits of any mistakes (like say the stray while loop misconfiguration) localized to one machine, network or server issues having no relevance or effect on work, and able to use xdebug (although you can use it on a shared server, the issues with sessions I've been told are problematic...and not having a fulltime sys admin to keep things happy doesn't hurt either). So far, no dice. So I ask you the SO community what could be done to convince others to do so, or if I'm the one that is on the wrong path. The current environment that we have is your typical WAMP environments, but I wanted to keep the question language and environment agnostic as possible. Thanks in advance!
