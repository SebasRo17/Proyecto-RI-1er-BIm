I try to compare two file with two different distribution of numbers. So i have random1.dat and random2.dat each one are vectors of more then 1000 rows. I saw from this question Doing a chi-square independence test in Mathematica that is it possible to make the comparison with Chi-square or Poisson but they attach the two files. How can i do that if my files are so long (or longer then 1000 rows)? Here my files: http://www.filedropper.com/random1_1: random1.dat http://www.filedropper.com/random2 : random2.dat Than I like, having in the same directory for instance 100 of this different files: random*.dat to compare all of them with a particular one (for instance random1.dat) is that possible in Mathematica? Thanks a lot !
