In order to implement JSR 292, a.k.a. invoke dynamic, something called richochet frames is introduced into the hotspot vm. I'd like to know more about it, such as invoke dynamic itself, how richochet frames implements it, where the name richochet comes from, etc. Google seems to be not very helpful here. Any pointers would be appreciated. Or better, someone please writes blogs about it :)
