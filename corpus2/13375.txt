![ornamental curve](http://i.stack.imgur.com/htDn0.jpg) How do I go about approximating this ornamental curve? Note that the curve has somewhat variable thickness as typical in calligraphy, which I would also like to replicate. The excellent reference _Handbook and Atlas of Curves_ by E.V. Shikin (1995) contains many tempting directions, including curve families with singular points, but none that resemble this particular closed curve, and it doesn't deal with thickness. A single function describing the curve is desirable but piecewise definition and splines are acceptable.
