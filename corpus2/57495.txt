I hope to find the range of `a` which leads to non-zero solution of `H` when you are given a specific value of B. And I hope to get the the corresponding B, range of a and number of solutions in a table. All the variables should be real. I tried to do it, the most difficult part is to determine the number of solutions when changing the value of a. And it is also difficult when I tried to manually change the value of a to get a range of the solution. Is there any systematic way of doing this ? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oC3Hb.png)
