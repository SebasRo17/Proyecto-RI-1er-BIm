When applying some arithmetic operation on two lists, I'd like to display the actual operations between the elements of each list. For example, `{1, 1} + {1, -1}` would display `{1 + 1, 1 - 1}`. With simple operations, I could just use `Trace` and pick out the part with the right form:               Trace[{1, 1} + {1, -1}, {_Plus, _Plus}]     (* {{1+1,1-1}} *)      However, this becomes really cumbersome in more complex operations. Even worse, some operations don't even show element-by-element operations within `Trace`.               Trace[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}.{{5, 6}, {7, 8}}]     (* {{{1,2},{3,4}}.{{5,6},{7,8}},{{19,22},{43,50}}} *)      This is what I actually want to display: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zyOrJ.png) Of course I could programmatically display the element operation of the matrix multiplication above, but I have to do the same for every other matrix operations. * * * **My question is:** Is there a straightforward way to display operations on elements of two lists? Please feel free to add your own examples and make it as general as you want to.
