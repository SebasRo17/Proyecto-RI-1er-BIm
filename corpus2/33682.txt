Consider the following line of code:               D[x == y^3 + x y, x, NonConstants -> y]      The output would be:               1 == y + x D[y, x, NonConstants -> {y}] + 3 y^2 D[y, x, NonConstants -> {y}]      This is a confusing and cumbersome notation for the more natural:               1 == y + x y' + 3y^2 y'      I am trying to use the Notation package to help me replace the messy, default, output with the more natural one.   I have not succeeded. Of-course I have read this Q. The answer, if relevant, seems inaccessible to me, unfortunately.   Any help would be appreciated.
