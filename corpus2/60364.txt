I have a distributed data collection system where I have first layer as regional Databases where all collected data is initially stored and master database where all the data is consolidated, what are you thoughts on schema design of this situation, also important thing here is I could have overlapping Ids and dictionary tables are shared by all regional db and also in future there could be need to add new regional Dbs. I am not sure how to start on designing the schema for this situation and would like to discuss with SO Community ?
