I'm using a parser generator to build a compiler. Should I commit the source files produced by the parser generator? I want to commit them to avoid a dependency on the parser generator during the build process and tests. However, if I commit them, it is tempting never to update the parser generator for fear of backwards-incompatible changes. Are there other advantages or disadvantages that I have not thought of?
