Right now my supervisor is creating requirements documentation / specs for me using bugtracking software. This seems like a terrible idea to me, all the requirements are on these little tickets and I have to click around on this dumb webform to get at the requirements. What is a sane software solution for requirements / software specs? To be clear, I am building this large software component with quite a few features and these features are being set forth in this bugtracking software.
