_Mathematica_ solves this equation fine:               Solve[ Tan[theta] == (b*Sin[t])/(a*Cos[t]), theta] // InputForm                > >     {{theta -> ConditionalExpression[ArcTan[(b*Tan[t])/a] + Pi*C[1], >       Element[C[1], Integers]]}} >   The solution is real when $a$, $b$, and $t$ are real (and $t$ isn't a multiple of $\frac{\pi}{2}$). However, adding the `Reals` condition breaks things:               Solve[ Tan[theta] == (b*Sin[t])/(a*Cos[t]), theta, Reals] // InputForm         > >     Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve. >   >     Solve[Tan[theta] == (b*Tan[t])/a, theta, Reals] >   Why?
