I have a list structured like               list1 = {{"header1","header2","header3"},             {0,1,2}};      and I'm using a custom function to find the number of the column with a specific header name, and then extract the data for this column:               header = "header1"     data = Map[Part[#,All,whatColumn[header]] &,list1];       Now let's say I would like to extract data for both column "header1" and "header2", I would need to Map the above code line on the following list:               list2 = {"header1", "header2"};      but how do I organize my placeholders # ? Something like this doesn't seem to work:               data = Map[Map[Part[#2,All,whatColumn[#1]] &,list1] &, list2];
