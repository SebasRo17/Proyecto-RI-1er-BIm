I'm trying to integrate the following function: $$ r_e=\int_0^z\frac{dz}{\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\Omega_\Lambda}} $$ where $\Omega_\Lambda=1-\Omega_M$ and both $\Omega_\Lambda$ and $\Omega_M$ are real and positive. Doing the definite integral using `Integrate` doesn't produce a result even after a few hours of running. I found that just doing the indefinite integral and then putting in the limits later produces a result. Why is this? Additionally, the result is unexpected and discontinuous for different values of $z$ depending on the value of $\Omega_M$. Any suggestions on the best strategy for integrating this?               FunH[omM_,omL_,z_]:=1/((omM(1+z)^3+omL)^(1./2.))     F[omM_,z_]:=Evaluate[Block[{omL=1-omM},Integrate[FunH[omM,omL,z],z]]]     Table[(1+z)^(-1)*(F[omM,z]-F[omM,0]),{omM,0.000001,1,0.1},{z,0.000001,3,0.001}]      I had to copy the code from another machine so I might have missed a bracket somewhere. EDIT: If anyone is interested, there is a publicly available paper dealing with a transformation of this integral to make the solution easier: http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/412/4/2685.full Essentially one can transform the above integral using a few simple substitutions into something which is proportionate to the difference between two separate integrals of the form: $$ \int\frac{du}{\sqrt{u^4+u}} $$ This can be easily integrated by Mathematica.
