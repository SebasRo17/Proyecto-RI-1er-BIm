I'm trying to parallelize a few commands that are time consuming, but independent of each other, in _Mathematica_ , but I can't seem to get it to work and I can't seem to find any beginner's tutorial on the subject either. I have four commands on the following form:               data2x = Table[{x0, y0, fx[x0, y0]}, {x0, -range, range, step}, {y0, -range, range, step}]      with different function fx, so I thought that I could cut time by using all four processors at once. I've tried `Parallelize`, `ParallelEvaluate`, and `ParallelSubmit`. For example as follows:               LaunchKernels[4];     Parallelize[       data2a = ...,       data2b = ...,        data2c = ...,       data2d = ...,       Method -> "EvaluationsPerKernel" -> 1     ];      But when I run the program, it's run sequentially (25 % CPU usage, same time to finish as sequential method) even though several processes running MathKernel.exe are launched. I run _Mathematica_ 10.0 on Windows 7, with i5-2400
