This is a rather general question, which I fail to answer myself. I guess it is mainly due to my insufficient knowledge of the precise terms. If I understand correctly, the following are equivalent:               f = Function[u, 3 + u]     f = Function[3 + #]     f = (3+#) &     f[x_]:=3+x      In all cases `f[a]` would yield `3+a`. Similarly, `f[a]` is equivalent to `f@@{a}`. I have mainly two questions:   1. What is the right term to call the shorter version, i.e. the version where one uses `@@`, `#`, `&` etc.?   2. When should I prefer the one method and not the other? It seems like many answers given around MA.SE uses the "shorter version". What are the advantages and disadvantages... **Bonus question:** Note my first question. I hope I could get more fishing rods and less fish. In other words, what is the official term for these two notions? Where are can I find documentation of these differences? The examples I presented in the this questions are merely examples, and I try to understand where can I rigorously study these notions and similar ones.
