I have a function that gives me a number of meters; how do I attach "meters" to it and send it to WolframAlpha? The function generating the result isn't a unit-aware calculation or anything:               distance := someFunction[AstronomicalData["Mercury", "Radius"]]      The result is about 6.07x10^15 Now I want to ask WolframAlpha[] to give me context for that number of meters. (Show me the number converted it to various units, show me comparisons, etc; all the stuff W|A is great for.) I figured I'd say something like               WolframAlpha[ToString[distance]<>"meters"]      But no way that I format that number into a string gives me a result that WolframAlpha[] understands, and I can't find anything in the manual explaining a better way to format it. I've tried the `Quantity[]` function, and all kinds of variations on               x := NumberForm[N[distance], 10]     WolframAlpha[ToString[x] <> "meters"]      But it just interprets it as "15x6.068x10 meters" I've tried Googling every variation on "format a number to send to the wolframalpha function" and found nothing. Is there an easy way to do this that I'm missing?
