I'm tasked with teaching an accelerated university special topics course in Java for programmers with many years of experience in C/C++. What sort of medium-length (1-2 hours max) assignments would you give, that would exercise the student's basic Java skills without seeming like an assignment one would give to someone learning Java as a first language? (The idea is to provoke thought about the difference between Java vs. C++ rather than insult the student with ridiculously simple programming in general.) To clarify, the entire course is not 1-2 hours -- it will be 4 hours on the first day and 7 hours on the second and third day, for two weeks, for a total number of contact hours of 36 hours. This is comparable to a standard college course's number of hours, just dramatically compressed.
