I am implementing a C preprocessor in C... I have the three functions:   1. trigraph replacing function   2. Line splicing function   3. comment removing function However these functions work separately on files i.e. First function will take a file and replace the trigraphs producing a temp- file1 as output Second function will take temp-file1 as input and splice the lines and produce another temp-file2. Third function will take temp-file2 as input and remove comment and produce yet another temp-file3. And now the main preprocessing tasks will be performed on temp-file3 and a .i file will be produced as final output. Now, I have 3 options :   1. Use temp files   2. use pipes   3. instead of intermediate temp-files or pipes use strings(i.e. whole temp-file1, 2 and 3 will be three big strings!!) I have three doubts...   1. Option 1 seems less efficient than option2   2. option 2 seems to be perfect but will I be limited by size of that unnamed pipe? (since I have **_single process_** i.e. function 1 2 & 3 will be called one after another) What if temp output size > pipe's total capacity?   3. option 3... Is it efficient, easy over previous two? Please tell me, Which option should I choose?
