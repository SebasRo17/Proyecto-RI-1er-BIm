Recently discovered what `InterpolatingFunction`'s are in _Mathematica_...really amazing/useful. As I understand it, it's basically a curve fitter....sorta. So how would I use _Convolve_ with a unit triangle or some other analytical- esque function, to convolve over a _InterpolatingFunction_?? ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UafNj.png) In the image, the red triangle is `UnitTriangle[x]` (well, it's height and width are off, but you get the gist of it). So ideallly, I'd like to do something like `Convolve[ UnitTriangle[x], InterpolatedFunction, ?, ?]` But that won't work of course, since I don't know what the domains are (hence the ? ?) for the interpolated function.
