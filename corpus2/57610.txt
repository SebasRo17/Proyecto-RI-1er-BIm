I want to store my data in `SQLite` database, but writing large numbers of data its too slow. For example:               db = JDBC["SQLite", "f:\\test1.db"];     conn = OpenSQLConnection[db];     SQLCreateTable[conn,        SQLTable["TEST"], {SQLColumn["COL1", "DataTypeName" -> "INTEGER"],         SQLColumn["COL2", "DataTypeName" -> "DOUBLE"]}];     SQLInsert[conn, "TEST", {"COL1", "COL2"},         RandomReal[{-10, 10}, {100, 2}]]; // AbsoluteTiming     (*{11.814676, Null}*)      Inserting 100 lines of data take more than 10s on my PC, but when I use `SQLite Database Browser` (external software) for creating table with more than `80000` lines its take less than 1 minute. Why inserting from `Mathematica` so slow? **EDIT** But `HSQL` much more faster 3.5s for `80000` lines
