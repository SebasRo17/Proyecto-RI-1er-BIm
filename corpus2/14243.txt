I'm trying to set up some notebooks so that I have one "seed" notebook that defines all my values globally when I run it. I have three other notebooks that take these values and run with them to do what they do. Problem is, these notebooks solve for functions and define them locally. I can't re-run these notebooks without running the seed book every time since Solve sees functions that are already defined. Is there a way to clear JUST the variables I have defined in a notebook? Edit: forgot to mention the seed notebook does a `ClearAll["Global``*"]` at the beginning.
