A friend of mine made a tattoo on his chest of some chemical substance formula. He challenged us to identify which substance is that. I thought that perhaps a combination of:   * Mathematica image processing capabilities   * Wolfram|Alpha chemical data   * Manual intervention could do the trick. Here is the picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SDZGa.png) I am looking for pointers on how to attack the problem (like keywords of Mathematica functions, etc). **EDIT 1** : I suppose the following need to be done:   * Extract the formula from the picture as basic (2D) structure diagram   * Define a distance metric for images or use existing one (e.g., `ImageDistance[]`)   * Calculate the distance of our element's diagram against all `ChemicalData[]` elements   * Pick the few first and do a visual verification At the moment 1st step seems like the most challenging. **EDIT 2** : As shown by Sjoerd it is much easier to search for a formula as string rather than as image!
