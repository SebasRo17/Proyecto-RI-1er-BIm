I always saw a lot of ads of programming jobs before. But I never saw an ad of operating systems development job before. I also never met personally someone who worked as operating system's programmer or something related to osdev before (I once saw a teacher at college talking about it, but I can't remember if she was talking about osdev). I would like to know:   1. What are the qualifications for an osdev position (years of experience, college/university, languages, etc)?   2. What a beginner that wants to work in this area should do?   3. How the work a of an OS developer looks like?
