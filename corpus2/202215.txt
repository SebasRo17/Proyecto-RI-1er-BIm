So after many many many years of building sites from scratch (and doing a lot of the lifting myself) I've dipped my toes into two projects that have been around for a few years that I've been avoiding: Bootstrap and Jekyll. The design was a very customised job that required me digging into the LESS so I've got a Bootstrap source files, source assets and a build directory within that directory. Then there's the Jekyll side. That has its own structure, I'm symlinking in the bootstrap build directory, and the final content (the stuff I want to actually serve) buried in `_site` directory. Here's how it looks:               /.git/*     /.gitignore     /bootstrap/     /bootstrap/... a load of source files ...     /bootstrap/bootstrap/  # the build output     /jek/     /jek/... all the jekyll files ...     /jek/bootstrap/  # symlink on ../bootstrap/bootstrap/     /jek/_site  # the stuff I actually want to upload - but don't really want in git      In _my_ history, I've either been dealing with a Django project layout (which makes a fair amount of sense) or a static layout. What I have here is two separate build systems and it's driving me nuts. Is there a better way of structuring all this junk, or failing that, is there a way I can make bootstrap output directly into the jek directory? How do you handle co-dependent static sites like this?
