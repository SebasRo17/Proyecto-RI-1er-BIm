Until today, I have always used the terms **open source** and **open source software** interchangeably. But then I read Phil Haack's blog post in which he suggests that the two terms are not necessarily referring to the same thing. He proposes the following definitions: **Open Source Software** is source code which is licensed under a license that meets the Open Source Definition. **Open Source** is a development methodology which includes certain characteristics:   * Developed in the open with community involvement   * The team accepts contributions that meet its standards   * The end product has an open source license. This encompasses open source software, open source hardware, etc. So Phil argues that the end product of open source development is open source software, but open source software is _not necessarily_ the product of open source development. Since he also mentions that there are many different understandings of what open source means, what do you think about these definitions? Do you agree with the distinction he has made?
