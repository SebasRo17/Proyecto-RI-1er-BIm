As I've been developing my position on how software should be developed at the company I work for, I've come to a certain conclusion that I'm not entirely sure of. It seems to me that if you are programming in C++, you should not use C style anything if it can be helped and you don't absolutely need the performance improvement. This way people are kept from doing things like pointer arithmetic or creating resources with new without any RAII, etc. If this idea was enforced, seeing a char* would possibly be a thing of the past. I'm wondering if this is a conclusion others have made? Or am I being too puritanical about this?
