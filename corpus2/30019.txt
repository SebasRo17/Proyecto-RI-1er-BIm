I would like to make a matrix out out of the following expression: $$ (\Omega^2 (2 d\theta^2 + d\phi^2 - d\phi^2 \cos(2 \theta) \coth(\chi)^2) + (2 d\Omega^2 + (2 d\theta^2 + d\phi^2 - 2 d\chi^2) \Omega^2) \textrm{csch}(\chi)^2)/(2 \Omega^2) $$ so that I get for the 11-components all terms that belong to $d\Omega^2$, for the 22-component all the terms belonging to $d\chi^2$, etc. (As there are no 'cross-terms', the matrix in this case should be diagonal). How do I go about this in _Mathematica_? * * * Code for copying:               (Ω^2 (2 dθ^2 + dϕ^2 - dϕ^2 Cos[2 θ] Coth[χ]^2) +      (2 dΩ^2 + (2 dθ^2 + dϕ^2 - 2 dχ^2) Ω^2) Csch[χ]^2)/(2 Ω^2)
