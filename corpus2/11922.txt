In a notebook, when writing `\[RightVector]` over a variable I always end up bolding it to make it more visible. But it'd be easier if it could be set up to bold that character by default. I haven't ventured into setting key bindings yet (just starting out), but I'm wondering if it's possible to set the combination `Esc``vec``Esc` to turn on bolding, insert the appropriate symbol, then turn off bolding. If there's an even easier way, that'd be even better.
