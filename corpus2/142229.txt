I need to refer to a number of _things_ that have both an identifier value (used in code and configuration), and a human-readable label. These things include:   * database columns   * dropdown items   * subapplications   * objects stored in a dictionary I want two unambiguous terms. One to refer to the identifier/value/key. One to refer to the label. As you can see, I'm pretty settled on the latter :) For the former, _identifier_ seems best (not everything is strictly a _key_ , and _value_ and _name_ could refer to the label; although, _identifier_ usually refers only to a variable name), but I would prefer to follow an established practice if there is one. Is there an established term for this? (Please provide a source.) If not, are there any examples of a choice from a significant source (Java APIs, MSDN, a big FLOSS project)? _(I wasn't sure if this should be posted here or toEnglish Language & Usage. I thought this was the more appropriate expert audience. Happy to migrate if not.)_
