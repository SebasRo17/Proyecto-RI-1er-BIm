I am trying to create a simple interpolation of `1-Exp[-x^2]` function, over the logarithmic grid, but I am stuck due to some unexpected behaviour:               (*grid creation:*)     grid = Table[10.0^-10*Exp[5*i], {i, 0, 10}];     (*function:*)     am[x_]:=1-Exp[-x^2]     (*grid: function vs. variable*)     Table[{grid[[i]], am[grid[[i]]]}, {i, 1, 10}]      > >     {{1.*10^-10, 0.}, {1.48413*10^-8, 2.22045*10^-16}, {2.20265*10^-6, > 4.85167*10^-12}, >        {0.000326902, 1.06865*10^-7}, {0.0485165, 0.00235108}, {7.20049, 1.}, >        {1068.65, 0.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999......}} >   and here `Table` is stuck. The problem occurs at large values of the variable `grid[[7]]`. It seems like `1-Exp[-x^2]` cannot provide a stable result at large values of the argument. Of course I can define a conditional expression like `If[x>...,1,1-Exp[-x^2]]` but I am eager to know how to treat this problem properly, since I work a lot with such _unstable_ functions and need to to know how to prevent it in the future.
