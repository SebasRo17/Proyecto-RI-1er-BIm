I am not sure if what I want to do is possible in _Mathematica_. I've provided something simple below to convey what I want to do. Basically what I want to happen is that when the `Locator` crosses over the blue line, the `Disk[]` will turn red and stay red until the `Locator` crosses the blue line again (it should stay red regardless of where the `Locator` is).               Manipulate[      Plot[x^3, {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> {{0, 1.5}, {0, 1.5}}, Frame -> True,       Epilog ->         Inset[Graphics[{Blue, Disk[]}, ImageSize -> 30], {0.2, 1}]],      {{comp, {0.5, 0.7}}, Locator}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5QeWT.png) I am trying to make a Demonstration that shows the behavior of a single component (water in this case) on a pressure vs. temperature phase diagram. Water exists in 3 distinct phases and there is only a phase change from liquid to vapor (or supercritical) if a certain boundary is crossed (looks like the one I showed here) but you can go around that boundary and not change phase. So that's what I am trying to show here with the colored disk as the indicator of "phase change" EDIT:               Manipulate[      DynamicModule[{col = False, acc = 0, p = {420, Log[6]}},       EventHandler[Show[Quiet@LogPlot[Log[T], {T, 273.16, 647.096}, PlotStyle -> Thick] /.           l_Line :> EventHandler[l, {"MouseEntered" :> If[acc === 0,      (col = col /. {True -> False, False -> True})]}],         Frame -> True, PlotRange -> {{273.16, 700}, {Log[5.6], Log[7]}},          Epilog ->           Inset[Graphics[            Text[Style[Dynamic@If[col == True, "liquid", "vapor"], 18],              Scaled[{0.400, 0.1}]]]]],        {"MouseDown" :> (acc = 1; MousePosition[Dynamic@p]),          "MouseDragged" :> (MousePosition[Dynamic@p]),          "MouseUp" :> (acc = 0; MousePosition[Dynamic@p])},         PassEventsDown -> True]],      {{p, {420, Log[6]}}, Locator,        Appearance -> Graphics[{Disk[]}, ImageSize -> 12]}]      It will only work if the mouse is _not_ depressed.
