I have posed a specific question yesterday but it may be too trivial to answer. I think the question could be asked in a more general way so it is easier to answer. Then I could solve the original problem by myself. Usually, we define a function as               F[x_] := x + 10       where the right-hand side is an expression. Now, I would like define a function where the right-hand side is the solution of a set of equations. Like               optV[V_, r_, λ_, μ_, η_, σ_] :=        V /.          FindRoot[{           A V^θ[r, λ, μ, η, σ] h[V, c, r, λ, μ, η, σ] == V - c,            D[A*V^θ*h[V, c, r, λ, μ, η, σ], V] == 1           },            {A, 0}, {V, 1}];           a[V_, r_, λ_, μ_, η_, σ_] :=        A /.          FindRoot[{           A V^θ[r, λ, μ, η, σ] h[c, r, λ, μ, η, σ] == V - c,            D[A V^θ[r, λ, μ, η, σ]  h[V, c, r, λ, μ, η, σ], V] == 1           },            {A, 0}, {V,1}]      This may not be correct code, but I think you can understand my question from it. `optV` and `a` are both parameters for another final function which would be manipulated. So you could regard `optV` and `a` as intermediate parameters. So the solution of the set of equations, correspondingly `optV` and `a`, varies along with `c`, `r`, `λ`, `μ`, `η`, `σ`, which are parameters input for manipulating plot.
