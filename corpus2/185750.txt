I'm trying to build a SOAP message generator that will generate SOAP messages of different kinds that I have specified. Each of these messages also has a reply that will be coming back. The meaning of this generator is to generate SOAP messages and measure performance on some equipment that the messages are being sent over. I therefor need to be able to generate messages at a high pace and while sending them I also need to confirm how many messages where dropped, if any. My basic plan in this project is to send and receive the SOAP messages (and replies) in different Threads to allow for maximum performance. I've tried to read up on SOAP by reading the Wikipedia and W3Schools articles here: http://www.w3schools.com/soap/default.asp http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP http://www.w3schools.com/wsdl/wsdl_intro.asp http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language I still haven't got a clear picture on how SOAP works though. **Is it possible to send and receive replies in different Threads? How could this be done?** If it's not possible I guess the SOAP message/reply would have to go through the same "socket". **Is it possible to send multiple messages without waiting for a reply over the same "socket"? How could that be done? (just keep looping and sending?)** Java and Apache CXF will be used in the implementation. I would greatly appreciate any thoughts, guidelines or general ideas on this subject. EDIT: There are a lot of recommendations on using other tools but however silly it might sound I really would like to invent the wheel again and write my own little performance testing environment. What I really wish to know is about the **message flow** in SOAP. I've clarified the questions a bit.
