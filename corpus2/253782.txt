I have attached an rgb led to a color picker on a webpage and have hit the obvious problem that though the led is 8-bit like html the color rendition is very different so with the more subtle shades the led values for the color are wildly different to the html values. The brute-force method would be for me to have a lookup-table on the webserver to map the two sets of values but would ideally like to do it more elegantly Before I start listing all my 101 ideas for doing this I wondered if anyone else had come across the issue, the end-game would be to be able to abstract the color-rendition of different leds and make it available as a webservice (html value and device id in, led value out)
