This question is inspired by the debate in the comments on this Stack Overflow question. The Google Closure Compiler documentation states the following (emphasis added): > The Closure Compiler is a tool for making JavaScript download and run > faster. **It is a true compiler for JavaScript.** Instead of compiling from > a source language to machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to better > JavaScript. However, Wikipedia gives the following definition of a "compiler": > A compiler is a computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source > code written in a programming language (the source language) **into another > computer language**... A language rewriter is usually a program that > translates the form of expressions without a change of language. Based on that, I would say that Google Closure is not a compiler. But the fact that Google explicitly state that it is in fact a "true compiler" makes me wonder if there's more to it. Is Google Closure really a JavaScript compiler?
