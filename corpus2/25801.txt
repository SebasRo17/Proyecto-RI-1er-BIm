I know that the threads ListPlot with each point a different color and a legend bar and Extracting the coordinate of a particular point of interest from a ListPlot are somehow the answers to my questions but I am having a hard time understanding them when trying to apply them to the following problem:               ListPlot[{{0,1},{0,0},{1,0},{1,1},{0.5,0.2}},        PlotStyle->Directive[PointSize[Large]]]      The x-coordinate of the first four points won't change; only the y-coordinate will. {0,1} and {1,0} must have the same color; {0,0} and {1,1} must have the same colour but different from the first case and {0.5,0.2} a different color when compared to the other two cases. The resulting plot must also have the value of the y-coordinate for each point shown all the time (no need to click a mouse or the like). I believe that the solution should be self-contained within `ListPlot` since I am planning to use it inside a `Manipulate` with other plots.
