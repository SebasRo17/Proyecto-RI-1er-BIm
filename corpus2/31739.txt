The simplest way to see what the post's title is trying to convey is to evaluate:               {"-0.5",       Text[Style["-0.5", FontFamily -> $DefaultFont[[1]],                FontSize -> $DefaultFont[[2]]]]}      On my Windows 7 laptop, at least, the first `0.5` looks larger than the second one. (The first one looks "right" to me somehow). My understanding is that `$DefaultFont` specifies the default output font, so I'm puzzled by the obvious difference (illustrated by this example) between text using the default output font, and text using a font explicitly set to match `$DefaultFont` (i.e., the first and second elements in the output of the evaluation above). Clearly my understanding is wrong somewhere, but I can't figure it out. Ultimately, I'm looking for a reliable way to specify the font size and font family of text elements in `Graphics` generated by `Plot`, etc. FWIW, I'm using version 9.0.1.0.
