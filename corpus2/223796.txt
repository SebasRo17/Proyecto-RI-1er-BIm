I will be a TA for a course that teaches Haskell this semester and the professor and I are trying to come up with a solution that lets us do entirely electronic submissions. We would like students to be able to upload files (we have a system we could use that puts uploaded files into an FTP server) and then receive grading/feedback on those files. Is anybody aware of good solutions for code review that keep the submissions and feedback confidential?
