Say i have this data:               data1 = Map[Cos, Range[0, 20]];     data2 = Map[Sin, Range[0, 20]];      And i want to plot `data1` in gray and a chosen set (with `Manipulate`) of multiplicities of `data2` in several other colors. This code does what I mean:               Manipulate[      ListLinePlot[{data1, Sequence @@ Table[data2*i, {i, k}]},        PlotStyle -> {LightGray,          Sequence @@ ConstantArray[Automatic, Length[k]]}], {{k, {1,          2}}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, ControlType -> CheckboxBar}]      I managed to make it work to only plot `data1` in gray and the multiplicities of `data2` in automatic colors, but now I'm stuck at the standard color scheme, although `PlotStyle` accepts `ColorData`. For example:               PlotStyle -> ColorData[3, "ColorList"]      However I don't know how to implement this with the condition that the first plot should be gray. **Question: Is there a way to change the color scheme in`ListPlot` AND manually choose the color of the first plot?**
