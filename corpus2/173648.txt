I've recently developed a huge interest in cryptography, and I'm exploring some of the weaknesses of ECB-mode block ciphers. A common attack scenario involves encrypted cookies, whose fields can be represented as (relatively) short hex strings. Up until now, I've relied on my eyes to pick out repeating blocks, but this is rather tedious. I'm wondering what kind of algorithms (if any) could help me automate my search for repeating patterns within a string. Can anybody point me in the right direction?
