Are there any arguments out there against using the keyword substitution (i.e. replacing `$Revision$` with `$Revision: 5$`) feature in many version control systems? Are there any overall bad practices that using the feature encourages? Are the any pervasive and hard-to-solve problems that it causes when you do use it? Here an argument against using it:   * Keyword Substition: Why You Don't Need It It's succinct, and I think the argument about the problems it causes for binary files is cogent, but I don't find it compelling.
