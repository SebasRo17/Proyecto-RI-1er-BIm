I am trying to create a very simple evolution algorithm for a creature simulator, what I would like to have is, both creatures have a trait and a dominance level, both noted by ints. their child's trait will be a random number between creature A's trait and creature B's trait then skewed to the more dominant. So if A has a trait of 5 and dominance of 2 and B has a trait of 10 and a dominance of 7, the skew will be -5 so it skews more towards B. Their child is more likely to have a trait of 8 than 6. Is there a good way to do this? I visualise it ending up like this: A5-6--7---8----9-----10B I can't figure out how much the skew should be until I am able to test the results, so for the time being it's kind of arbitrary. Thank you everyone for taking the time to help me.
