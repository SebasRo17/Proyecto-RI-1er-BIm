I have a function that returns to me lists of expressions, like:               I (a^2 + b^2) (* 1 *)     a (I b + e)   (* 2 *)     b (I a + d)   (* 3 *)     b (I a + f)   (* 4 *)     a b           (* 5 *)     a (I b + f)   (* 6 *)     I (b^2 + c^2) (* 7 *)      The expressions can become arbitrary complex. Now I want a function that returns to me that expression 2,3,4,6 as well as 1,7 are similar, because one can just rename the variables. I have absolutly no idea how to solve this problem, and would be very happy for any hint in the right direction. **Update on _similarity-criterion_** Similar means:                a -> b, c, d, e, f, ... zzzz, SomeVar1, ...      (If it is simpler, for the moment one can assume that the list of variables can be only a,b,c,d,...,z = 26 lowercase letters). It must not transform the structure of the equation, for instance:                a (I b + e)      Here, _a_ cannot become _b_ or _e_ , _b_ cannot become _a_ or _e_ , _e_ cannot become _a_ or _b_ , i.e. all of them must be different. All terms a, b, c, d are simple variables, and cannot become Sin[a], Tan[b], 1/c, ... Examples:   * `a (I b + e)`, `b (I a + d)`, `b (I a + f)`, `a (I b + f)` are all similar   * `a^2 + b` and `a + b^2` are similar   * `a (c + d) + b (c + e)` and `a (c + d) + b (e + f)` are not similar because `c` is repeated in the first one but not the second one
