I'm building a large matrix having different sized rows consisting of a few columns. The different columns are imported .txt files. Why can't I build the matrix column by column? For example, I thought I could populate the first column by evaluating               NumberConcentration [[All, 1]] =       Import["C:\\Users...NumberConcentration.txt", "Table"][[87]]      _Mathematica_ gives me an error saying this part of the array does not exist. > Set::partd: Part specification NumberConcentration[[All, 1]] is longer than > depth of object. >> Do I have to define intermediate values and then combine all of them to one matrix? Or is my syntax wrong?
