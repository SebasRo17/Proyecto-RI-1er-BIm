I am running into problems in NetLogo with large *.csv / *.txt files. The documents can consist of about 1 million data sets and I need to read them (to eventually create a diagram based on the data). With the most straightforward source code, my program needs about 2 minutes to process these files. How should I approach reading such large data files faster in NetLogo? Is NetLogo even suitable for such tasks (as it seems to be designed more for teaching and learning)?
