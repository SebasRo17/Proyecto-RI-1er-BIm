Lets say, I have the following series of functions, $f_1=a+1$   $f_2=a^2+2a+1$   $f_3=a^3+3a^2+3a+1$   Assume that $f_4, f_5,$ and $f_6$ are also known. However $f_n$ is not known as a function of $n$. From $f_1 ...f_6$, is it possible to reverse engineer the formula for $f_n$ using _Mathematica_? For the sample sequence given above, I should get, $f_n=(a+1)^n$. Is such a feature available in _Mathematica_? If so, can you provide links to the relevant documentation.
