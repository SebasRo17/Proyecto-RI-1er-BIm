Say you have an interface `IFoo`:               public interface IFoo {         void Bar(string s);         int Quux(object o);     }      In version 2 of your API, you need to add a method `Glarg` to this interface. How do you do so without breaking your existing API users and maintaining backwards compatibility? This is mainly aimed at .NET, but can apply to other frameworks & languages as well.
