I have a script, and now it's the perfect time to have an option to change `theme` templates. I was looking forward to store these files in `php` files, or html files. with `CSS` file. I looked over some codes and I found that they use brackets to refer to the variable. Here's an example of a template block:               <div class='block_div'>     <center>{title}</center>     {content}     </div>      I know that I can use `PHP` vars usering `<?=$var;?>`. However, I think the one above is better, and I looked over the web to find anything about it but I couldn't. My Question is how I can use these brackets in my php or html code. to let the user changing the template only not the code!
