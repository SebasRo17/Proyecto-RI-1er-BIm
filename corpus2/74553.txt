I have reading about variety of frameworks for web applications like OpenRasta, Django, CodeIgniter etc. It is a passion of developers to dip their hands on any new technology, but from the job-seeker's point of view, what is the significance of these new buzzes. Is it better for a job-seeker to stick with the standard frameworks like ASP.NET, Rails etc., or devote time on other open-source frameworks as well?
