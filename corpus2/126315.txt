I am currently a programmer specialized in javascript(mostly jquery) and css. In other words. My main work is always done on the client side. However, I do know basic stuff about mysql and PHP. Recently, a friend of mine who has very little knowledge of PHP (he is not a programmer but he wants to become one) told me that he would love to start a project together. I told him that I liked the project so we started splitting the "tasks". I thought it would be best if he specialized in database design & management (SQL) and also in PHP, so I would be strong 'on the client side' and he would be strong 'on the server side'. However, I have many concerns with this approach. What would you do? It is not like I want all the work for myself, because even though i have much more experience this guy has quite a lot of brains, and he will learn anything quite soon. That is why I thought he should learn SQL. How would you split the tasks? I am also afraid of the amount of work we will have since this project uses AJAX very much. Any help or advise is very welcome.
