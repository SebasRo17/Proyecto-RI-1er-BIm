I was wondering what the best way is to extend the cells in a `GraphicsGrid` so that my text fits without line breaks. My problem is illustrated by the graphic produced by the code below:               GraphicsGrid[{       {Graphics[{Blue, Rectangle[{1, -1}]}],         Style["Antidisestablishmentarianism", FontSize -> 30],         SpanFromLeft},       {Graphics[{Red, Rectangle[{1, -1}]}],         Style["Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis", FontSize -> 30],        SpanFromLeft}}]`      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nvYrv.png) I've been looking for ways to extend the cells on the right of the `GraphicsGrid` so that the text fits in on one line. In the code above, I've used `SpanFromLeft` to extend the cells a little. I would have to use many `SpanFromLeft` commands in order to fit the word next to the red square. So I was hoping that someone knew of a better way of doing this.
