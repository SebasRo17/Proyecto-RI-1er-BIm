In a non-agile development team a lead developer _generally_ :   * Sets the standard (coding and otherwise)   * Researches new technologies for the team   * Sets the technical direction for the team   * Has the final say on matters   * Designs the architecture of a system However an agile team works differently:   * An agile team will rely on emergent design, rather than up front    * An agile team designs together, rather than design being dictated by one person   * An agile team decides on their own technical direction, which is best to deliver a project Where does this leave a lead developer in an agile team? Is it possible to have a lead developer in an agile team? Does a agile team demand different responsibilities from a lead?
