I have an ASP.NET C# application that needs to go off and iterate through a directory of .xml files and do some processing on the data inside them. This is easy enough, but i need to display the result after each .xml is processed, how can this be done? What im really asking here is how do you process a lot of data in a loop that needs to be displayed back to the client even though the server processing has not fully completed. Is this even possible? I could start the big process in a seperate thread and start a js timeout to postback and essentially poll the process but this doesn't sound great and would probably require using static variables to maintain state. Would it be correct to use SessionState / ViewState / QueryString to persist the status of which file ive processed and do away with the loop altogether? Therefore seperate the large job into seperate requests?
