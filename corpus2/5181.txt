I've always used MS Excel to create my school schedules, and I've always been happy with the results. Is there a similar GUI way to generate schedules/timetables in _Mathematica_ or a third-party functionality (e.g. in a package) available?? My own search has taught me that undocumented functions exist (`TableView`) and that presumably more elaborate functions (`SpreadsheetView`) will be part of future _Mathematica_ releases. `TableView` is nice, but I haven't managed to create pretty layouts with it, as I could easily do in Excel. All it seems to do is enable me to generate big matrices quickly. Here's what my current timetable looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QH2ue.png)
