Im not a paid developer, I spend two or three hours a day working on a development project as a hobby. As time goes by, I come up with "good-ideas" for the project, that are generally features or bug reports. I would like to manage them using a ticket database. My question is about the "scope" of a ticket. I see from looking at other projects ticketing db that tickets are generally high level features to be implemented, and that these get loosely associated with a feature branch in a VCS. How do you manage the "To do list" associated with a ticket ? Is it better to "re-write" the original ticket into smaller tasks ? How small of a task rates a ticket ?
