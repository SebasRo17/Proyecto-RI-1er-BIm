I am a software developer for a large corporation, and currently work from home two days a week, and I absolutely love it. However, because of juggling of personnel, my team's office may get shutdown in the next couple of months. I have been asked my thoughts on this, and I'm not entirely sure. I love my two days at home, and wouldn't mind even four; but going to the office I feel is essential. When I'm at the office I have lunch with the other developers, share home cooked goodies, and discuss specifics of work. Because I'm also a fairly new member of the team, I'm still learning a lot, and occasionally one of the other team members have to show me how to do something that would be incredibly difficult to do over the phone or IM. For those of you who work from home full time and don't have an office to meet with your other co-workers, what are some problems that have occurred? How did you deal with them? Side note: I'm not concerned about work/home divide, I've got a spare room setup as my office (with only office stuff in it [standing desk, printer, books, etc]), and I'm in a relationship with no prospects of children, and my partner understands not to disturb me while I'm working).
