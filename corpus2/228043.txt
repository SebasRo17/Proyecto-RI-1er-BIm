I brought up in a meeting an annoyance that code changes were not commented within the code itself. We use SVN (Subversion) for source control, and it was relayed to me that you can just go into SVN and check the history and see the changes. My question is is this a best practices? It seems easier to me to place the comment in the code itself with the defect/user story reference (we use Rally/Agile) **AND** in the svn header when you check in the changes. My bosses seem to think putting it the code is unecessary, and I told them I completely disagreed with that practice. I've always been taught that comments in the code are never bad. This is not my first gig. I was even more floored when he told me his boss has been known to rip out comments in some code. After I stopped having the shakes, I wanted to... vomit. What do you think about comments in code vs/with comments in source control and what do you do as a best practice?
