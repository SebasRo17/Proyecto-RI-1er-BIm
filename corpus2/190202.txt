Today I begun my second programming course. The professor seemed a bit different from the others - we had some fun saying things like _"he's probably a misunderstood genius"_. He criticized some other (long gone) professors (with good reasons). Then it struck me to ask him _"how do I know if **you** are a good professor?"_ ... but I decided to save it for later... Now, however, such question has developed a lot in my mind. I'm very curious - **how do I know if my programming professor is good**? Some observations:   * Apparently, very few students do finish the course with him with aceptable scores - but it is possible it is the students' fault, not his.   * From our brief first class, I understood very well whatever he said (he talked a bit about everything). But I feel it might be because I was already prepared and had good experience programming before, and not necessarily the fact that he's good at expressing his ideas.   * He has a tendency to make jokes. Like most professors I've met. Unfortunately, he is the least funny.
