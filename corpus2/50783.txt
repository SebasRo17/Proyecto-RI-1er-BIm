I'm used to _MATLAB_ so this might be a stupid question but _Mathematica_ is freaking me out. I have a big matrix with the following format:               M = {{A,B,C},{1,{1,3,6,7},0},{1,{3,7,9},1}}      As you can see, each element in the second column is a separate list again. These separate lists contain integers, so it's no problem to get back to them. For example if I use `MemberQ[M[[2,2]],1]` it returns `True`, as it's supposed to do. What I want to do now: my Matrix is a little longer, contains approx. 5'000 rows. I want to check every seperate list mentioned above for the appearance of a specific integer, as I did above with the `MemberQ`. As a result it should give me something like the following (taking `M` as example): `{True,False}`. I thought that's supposed to be easy with a for-loop as it is in _MATLAB_ , but _Mathematica_ always stops when condition is not met... Looking forward to your answers. Please state if I need to clarify my question!
