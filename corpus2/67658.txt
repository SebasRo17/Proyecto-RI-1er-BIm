There are a few similar questions to this one already. But mine differs enough to warrant being asked separately. I've written an authentication ASP.Net library and I'm looking for beta testers. I've posted to the forums I frequent, but they are not forums commonly used by .Net people. I've tried inviting friends, but honestly I don't personally know a whole lot of people that use ASP.Net. I'm afraid that posting such a request to http://asp.net/forums would be marked as spam and deleted. What else can I do to find developers to test my library?
