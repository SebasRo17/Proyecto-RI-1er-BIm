This example displays a input window at a position of 675 from the left.               winMargins = {{675, Automatic}, {130, Automatic}};       InputString["testing WindowMargins!  stop: 0",          FieldSize -> Small, WindowMargins -> winMargins];      I want to display the window centered horizontally on the screen. I tried to use the following, but it does not work.               winMargins = {{Scaled[{0.5}], Automatic}, {130, Automatic}};        How can I get a horizontally centered input window?
