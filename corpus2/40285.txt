I'm just about to start a project using Sencha Touch, and just done some minor testing on my HTC desire device. All tutorial videos at Vimeo seems to be using an iPhone emulator running on a Mac. Im not sure how fast this emulator is compared to a real iPhone device or even an real Android device, but from what i have experienced, it seems that my HTC desire is not performing that nicly as this emulator. All animations (sliding, fading, etc) seems abit laggy. You can easily notice that the FPS is much less than on the Vimeo videos. HTC desire is a relativly new and modern Android 2.2 phone, running with decent hardware, so im wondering if Sencha Touch is "ready" for the Android platform. Anybody with practical experience with Android and Sencha Touch ?
