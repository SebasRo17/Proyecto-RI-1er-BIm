For my Semester project I have to go for any Adaptative Interface Design. My language is C# and I have to Use OpenTK (wrapper for OpenGL). I have an idea that I should show two points and some obstacles and my subject (user) would drag an object from one place to the final place avoiding the Obstacles. Also (s)he can place obstacles randomly. My software should be able to learn some paths by doing test runs and then after learning it should be able to predict the shortest path. I do not know how stupid this idea sounds but it is just an idea. I need help regarding any ideas for adaptative interface possible small projects or if my idea is ok then please can you tell me what should be used to implement it? I mean that along with OpenGl for the Graphics what can I use for machine learning?
