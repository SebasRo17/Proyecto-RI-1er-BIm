Are there any good samples of web applications that consume restful web services? I am developing a webapp with spring, and have come to the point of reading lists of elements and element details from a RESTful JSON api. I started developing as though I was using a database, creating services, model elements plus DAOS, but now I'm stuck on how to do a proper design here. Should model objects hold a fromJson/toJson method and encapsulate themselves the serialization info? What should DAO objects do? Where should I keep WS specific info (urls, api keys, item names, etc.)? Any good opensource apps would be nice.
