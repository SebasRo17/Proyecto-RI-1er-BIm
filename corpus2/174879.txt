I am a beginner developer and I have been wondering from the start, how do professional use tools like GIT and Subversion (I don't have a very good understanding about these tools), to fulfill their project's needs. If they do use it, how would I set up something like that? My applications are not so large and I am not working in a team yet, would they be of huge help to me? There are questions on this site about how to use the tools, but I need beginner support.
