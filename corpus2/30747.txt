I would like to set a variable equal to a copy n' pasted list, all within the Manipulate[] environment:                Manipulate[list,{list,0}]      I would like to view and edit the elements of the list within the input field. The problem is the "white space" is not long enough to view the entire pasted list. How can I make the input field larger, as if I were entering in a paragraph of text?
