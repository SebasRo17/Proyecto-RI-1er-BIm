I need to remove the reverse versions of lists from list of lists. I.e.: `{{1,2},{2,2},{2,1},{a,1,2},{2,1,a}}` I need to reduce to `{{1,2},{2,2},{a,1,2}}`. The requirement to remove only the reverse of a given list means that permutations other than the reverse will be conserved, so that               {{1,2,3},{2,1,3},{3,2,1},{1,2,2},{a,1,2},{2,1,a}}      should reduce to               {{1,2,3},{2,1,3},{1,2,2},{a,1,2}}      My try gives correct result but it use nested `For` which is not too nice. Does anyone know of a better way to do it?
