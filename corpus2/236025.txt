For the past few days, I've been trying to figure out how to take an image of a video game cover (like this one) and get the name of the game from it. Initially I attempted to use Google's Search by Image, but they're not fond of automated queries and sadly I am only able to reverse-image search from a browser and not programatically. I have a database of all of the video game covers and their names, but I'm not sure what approach I should take to matching the images (there are just around 7500 of them). I'll also need to account for lighting, orientation, and size differences, so that (I think) throws out pixel comparison. Someone else has done something similar (see this video on Youtube), so I know it's possible, I'm just not sure where to start. Any thoughts?
