Is there any way to tell Mathematica to replace $\kappa^2 + k_z^2 \rightarrow k^2$ in an expression? I want to make a result more readable, e.g. something like this: $$\frac{2 k_z^3 \sqrt{k_z^2 + \kappa^2} + 2 k_z \kappa^2 \sqrt{k_z^2 + \kappa^2} + k_z \sqrt{k_z^2 + \kappa^2} \mu^2}{2 (k_z^4 + 2 k_z^2 \kappa^2 + \kappa^4)}$$ * * *               (2 kz^3 Sqrt[kz^2 + κ^2] + 2 kz κ^2 Sqrt[kz^2 + κ^2] + kz Sqrt[kz^2 + κ^2] μ^2)/      (2 (kz^4 + 2 kz^2 κ^2 + κ^4))      * * * Which can be simplified to: $$k_z \frac{ (2k^2 + \mu^2) }{2k^3}$$ But I can't get Mathematica to perform this substitution. I have made sure to use the proper assumptions for this to work:               $Assumptions={k>0};      Yet it seems to not see the (arguably trivial) patterns. Does anyone know how to trick Mathematica into doing what I want :-)?
