I have a list in the form {{a, 1}, {b, 2}, {c, 3}}. Let's say I want to operate a transformation on all the second elements of each sublist, but this transformation is a function of them all together. As an example I want to Standardize them. At the moment I've implemented this with Transpose.               mylist = {{a, 1}, {b, 2}, {c, 3}};     newlist = Transpose[{mylist[[All, 1]], Standardize[mylist[[All, 2]]]}]      and the output is correctly               {{a, -1}, {b, 0}, {c, 1}}      I find this a little cumbersome, this approach can become complicated and hard to read sometimes. Isn't there a more natural way?
