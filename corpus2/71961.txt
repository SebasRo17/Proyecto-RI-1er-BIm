When a project has reached end of life and is being retired, either because the technology is obsolete, a newer version of the program has been rewritten, or it no longer solves a problem that is needed to be solved, what should be done with the code? Should it be deleted, or kept for future reference? This also applies to projects that someone might develop as a contractor, and the company which needed them goes out of business.
