I just started working a year ago, and I want to join an open source project for the same reasons as anyone else: help create something useful and develop my skills further. My problem is, I don't know how to find a project where I'll fit in. How can I find a beginner-friendly project? What attributes should I be searching for? What are warning signs that a project might _not_ be the right fit? Are there any tools out there to help match people with open source projects? There's a similar question here, but that question has to do with employment and is limited to PHP/Drupal.
