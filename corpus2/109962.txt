I want to develop a 3d environment to be used for meetings and other such functions. Each attendee could log in with a customized avatar and could collaborate and discuss via voice and text chat. I would like to add in multimedia content features as well into the environment. I need help regarding platform selection preferably I want to implement it as a web application with no local installation. I'd like to avoid a browser plug-in unless absolutely necessary. I don't know graphics programming so I'd prefer an approach that uses existing platforms and off the shelf software. I have considered the following options thus far:   * WebGL   * Google O3d   * web 3d's X3D    * VRML   * X3doom   * Sirikata Platform    * yogurt3d   * Unity3d   * Jibe   * OpenSim   * Papervision3d   * Flash   * 3dmlw   * Java3d   * Infinity3d   * Cube3   * CloudMach Are there other possibilities?
