I'd like to provide a very lightweight method to describe my web services. No WSDL, WADL or similar complex stuff. Just a mapping from the web service's base URL to a simple description which can be detected and parsed automatically. Basically   * The **name** of the service   * A **link** to some human readable documentation (optional)   * Possibly a **contact** address   * Usage conditions, URL patterns etc. are less needed to keep it simple. The best I could find is OpenSearch Description Documents, but first it could be simpler with plain text config files, and second there is no standard how to connect these service description documents to arbitrary web services (only autodiscovery in ATOM/RSS and HTML). I thought about creating my own format and provide it similar to `robots.txt`:               $ curl http://example.org/services.txt          service: http://example.org/foobar     name: Foobar API     about: http://example.org/foobar-doc.html          service: http://example.org/some/unapi     name: Example ORG's unAPI          # additional fields, to be discussed     standard: http://unapi.info     pattern: ?id={id}&format={format}      So if you know the base URL of a service, such as `http://example.org/some/unapi`, you can look up at least the name in the service description file. Instead of defining my own standard, however, I'd like to know whether there is already something similar to reuse.
