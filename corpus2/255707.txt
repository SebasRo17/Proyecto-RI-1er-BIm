I need to find an "efficient" data structure / set of algorithms to do the following things: I have a list of objects. I need to assign them weights and later on increase or decrease these weights. For instance: We have the hashmaps `{o1}, {o2}, {o3}`. The `{o}`'s don't have any particullar structure, just random json. I am looking for a way of saying: Increase the weight of o1 by 1. Increase the weight of o2 by 1. Increase the weight of o1 by 1. Now give me the results sorted by their weight. I am using Python. So far I have tried using a normal hashmap to store them, but the problem is that I can't just hash the `{o}`'s. I thought of hashing the pointer of the `{o}`'s in memory, but it seems I don't have access to it in Python.
