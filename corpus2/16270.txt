I have to solve an equation of the type $$a z+b \overline{z}=c$$ with $a,b,c\in\mathbb{C}$. My approach is to set $F(z)=a z+b \overline{z}-c$ transform $z$ to $x+i y$ and then get a real linear system by assuming $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ and solve $$\frac{F(x+i y)+\overline{F(x+i y)}}{2}=0$$ $$\frac{F(x+i y)-\overline{F(x+i y)}}{2i}=0.$$ My problem is that this has to happen a lot for a program that I am writing and I was wondering if there is a faster way to do that. It would be ideal if mathematica can solve these linear systems directly.
