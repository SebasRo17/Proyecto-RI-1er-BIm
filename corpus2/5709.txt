Background: I am working on a program that produces design patterns ( using wallpaper- and frieze-group theory ). This is for example a 'generating region' for a frieze or a wallpaper.                  Graphics[Polygon[{{.1, .1}, {.3, .8}, {1, .1}, {.5, .5}}]]      In reality this piece of Mathematica Graphics code is the result of many ( matrix- ) calculations. Usually I want this in a larger size, for example 1 by 2:                  Graphics[{Polygon[{{.1, .1}, {.3, .8}, {1, .1}, {.5, .5}}],          Polygon[{{1.1, .1}, {1.3, .8}, {2, .1}, {1.5, .5}}]}]      Currently I work as follows: ===pseudocode=== follows:                 Map[ CalculateBaseMotif[#1,#2] &,             Flatten[Map[# &, Table[{ii, jj}, {ii, 1, lenX}, {jj, 1, lenY}]], 1]      So `CalculateBaseMotif` is calculated over and over. While all I want is to transtlate the result of                  G=Graphics[Polygon[{{.1, .1}, {.3, .8}, {1, .1}, {.5, .5}}]].      Summarizing: I make a ( complicated ) graphic G requiring many calculations of width W and height H. Then I want to produce a ( final ) graphic like so:                 GGGG       GGGG      thus having width 4 x W and height 2 x H in the most efficient manner. **Question: How to define and work with temporary graphics data ?**
