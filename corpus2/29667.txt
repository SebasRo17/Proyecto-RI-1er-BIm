Taking my first steps in the world of Mathematica Programming. The aim of my program was to modify Wolfram's dynamic calculator   (which performs an addition subtraction and a product - in response to the user inputting two values used to perform these operations)   to now take three input and display on the three outputs: [1] the quadratic equation to be solved   [2] the roots of this quadratic equation   [3] the discriminant of this equation The three things (in red text) which you have to input are: first input box is coefficient a   second input box is coefficient b   third input box is coefficient c These coefficients represent a,b and c in the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx +c$ So the Wolfram Demonstration & My attempt (the code below) look like this: http://www.controlmanchester.com/2013/08/01/quadratic-equation-images/ The code for the original program is available here: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/example/ConstructADynamicCalculator.html This is the code that I have written (modified really):                DynamicModule[            {a = 0, b = 0, c = 0},            Deploy[             Style[              Panel[               Grid[                Transpose[             {             {             Style["input a ", Red],             Style["input b", Red],             Style["input c", Red],         "here is the equation",         "here is the value of the discriminant",         "here are the roots"},               {InputField[Dynamic[a], Number],          InputField[Dynamic[b], Number],          InputField[Dynamic[c], Number],          InputField[Dynamic[a*x^2 + b*x + c],Enabled -> False],          InputField[Dynamic[b]^2 - (4*Dynamic[a]*Dynamic[c]) , Enabled -> False],          InputField[Dynamic[a b], Enabled -> False]}                 }                     ]         , Alignment -> Right]         , ImageMargins -> 10]            ,          DefaultOptions -> {InputField -> {ContinuousAction -> True,          FieldSize -> {{5, 30}, {1, Infinity}}}}]         ]         ]      I have discovered, via trial and error, that within an input field I cannot simply try something like   `Solve[x^2 + a x + 1 == 0, x]` or `Roots[ ]`. I think this is where the heart of my problem lies. At the moment the variables I put in do propagate down and show the coefficients of the quadratic, but I cannot get any further with it. Any help, or guidance to things I should read are most welcome. Many Thanks, David p.s. I have seen from the answer by Mike Honeychurch that I have not described the problem as clearly as possible. I have edited the post :) I hope this makes my problem easier to understand
