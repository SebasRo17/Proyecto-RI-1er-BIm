Where I work, employees use a third-party desktop program for their clients. This program saves data to a flat file. My colleague wants to write a Java program that uploads that flat file to a remote server, opens the desktop program when the flat file is downloaded from a Web site, and checks if the desktop program is running or not by looking at the Windows processes. He keeps calling this helper/utility program a "wrapper." But it doesn't wrap anything! I tried to clear it up with him, but he said, "Well, I call it a wrapper." He now has everyone in the company calling it a "wrapper." What would you call it? I say that it's a helper program or utility program.
