Can someone please copy/paste the planar `Graph` given by _Mathematica_ (at least _v9_ ) for this graph:               Graph[{{1, 7}, {1, 3}, {1, 5}, {1, 6}, {2, 6}, {2, 7}, {2, 4}, {4, 5}, {4, 8},            {8, 5}, {8, 3}, {3, 6}, {3, 7}, {6, 7}}, GraphLayout -> "PlanarEmbedding"]      I would only need the output. I would do it myself but my program keeps crashing. If someone could do this easy copy / paste & a few clicks, I'd be highly appreciative. I'm redownloading _Mathematica_ right now, but it's urgent and the file is 2GB.
