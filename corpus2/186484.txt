I have a site where a regular user can delete records, where what happens is that an `IsDeleted` flag gets set. On administrative pages, a privileged user can delete records where an actual SQL `DELETE` permanently discards such records. The difference is important for obvious reasons, and I want to use a consistent term to refer to the one form of deletion vs. the other. I've been playing with the words `Remove`, `Delete`, `Discard` and possibly `Recycle`, and `Archive`. My question is: are there standard user-facing terms that distinguish these two behaviors?
