I have a Computer Science degree and I'm employed as a software engineer. I'm regularly approached by recruiters on LinkedIn with "programmer", "software developer", or general "software and/or computer industry" propositions. Every now and then though a recruiter will approach me with an "IT position" opportunity. I understand that in the absolute general sense anything and everything between the keywords _computer_ and _software_ will at some point include IT, but when it comes to more specific discussions, particularly offers for an interview for an "IT position", I often find that to be a bit odd. It often strikes me as if I am being offered to interview for the position of a DBA, sys admin, or an IT staff manager, positions that are as foreign to me as the medical field. To avoid subjectivity, I'll make my question simple. Is a _software engineer_ , _coder_ , _programmer_ or a _software developer_ , in an IT position? IT industry (app development, scientific, multimedia/game)?
