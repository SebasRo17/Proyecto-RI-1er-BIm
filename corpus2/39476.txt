Fold is an extension of Nest for 2 arguments. How does one extend this concept to multiple arguments. Here is a trivial example:               FoldList[#1 (1 + #2) &, 1000, {.01, .02, .03}]      Say I want do something like:               FoldList[#1(1+#2)-#3&,1000,{.01,.02,.03},{100,200,300}]       where 100,200,300 are the values for #3. I know Fold doesn't work this way. I'm looking for an approach that will work like this... ((1000*(1.01)-100)*1.02-200)*1.03-300). Is there a way to extend Fold to more than 2 arguments? or is there a better approach for solving problems like this?
