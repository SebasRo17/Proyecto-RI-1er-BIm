I have a project on my resume in which we had used `MVC Architecture` and `Java, JSP and MySQL`. Hence during the interviews if the position requires experience about MVC Architecture, I have to face the question like "`Explain this project.`" What exactly is the interviewer is expecting? I know that they want to know how we implemented the MVC. But what "exact" details should I tell them in the short time span of 2-3 minutes? Which key features/parts I am supposed to explain? Can someone experienced give some idea about it? The project is about Leave Management System.
