I want a column with textcells and a button to add an extra textcell:               Column[{Button["New line"],     TextCell["a", "Text", FontFamily -> "Times", FontWeight -> Plain, Editable -> True]},     Editable -> False]      How to do this? I want the first click to make it be like:               Column[{Button["New line"],     TextCell["However this has been edited", "Text", FontFamily -> "Times", FontWeight -> Plain, Editable -> True],     TextCell["a", "Text", FontFamily -> "Times", FontWeight -> Plain, Editable -> True]},     Editable -> False]
