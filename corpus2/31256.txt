Here is a function that take some time to evaluate:               n = 1000;     coeffs = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], n];     f[x_] := Sum[coeffs[[k]] Sin[k x]/k, {k, 1, n}];      If I just plot the function with 1000 sample points, it takes about 0.24 seconds on my machine:               Plot[Evaluate@f[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotPoints -> n, MaxRecursion -> 0] // Timing      On the other hand, if I try to collect 1000 samples of the function into a table, it takes _five times as long_ :               Table[Evaluate@f[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi, 2 Pi/n // N}] // Timing      (Without the `// N` Mathematica tries to evaluate things symbolically, which is even slower.) What is going on, and how can I make the `Table` as fast as the `Plot`?
