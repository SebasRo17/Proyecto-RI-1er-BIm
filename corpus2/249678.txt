I originally started out this question with "what is JQuery, and how does it work", in terms of all that fancy animation, effects, slideshow plugins, etc. I was uncertain as to how JQuery does all that fancy stuff. But after reading around on the internet, I am happy to acknowledge that JQuery is basically a "javascript library", and by that, I think it means that JQuery is pure text, of javascript code, consisting of public methods, functions, constants etc, with the idea that calling these simple methods or functions can replace loads of javascript code, and that its has a nice consistent feel to it. So am I right in saying that all that fancy animation, effects etc are not "actually" achieved by javascript/Jquery? They are achieved by using CSS3? And CSS3 is a style sheet language which the browser can understand, and has the capabililites of carrying out those stylesheet instructions? Very fuzzy and ambiguous question, I know, but just trying to get my head round how you get those amazing jquery animations etc
