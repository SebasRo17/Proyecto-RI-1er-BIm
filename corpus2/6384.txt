I would like to export a long Table of (complex) numbers to a text file using `Export["file.txt",%];` A sample line from the obtained file looks like this:               {0.11288378916846890559999999999`18.05263157894737, {{1.6974001229071336*^-12, -5.163757820258834*^-15 + 1.9829374389565386*^-13*I}, {-5.163757820258834*^-15 - 1.9829374389565386*^-13*I, 3.1517458450250055*^-13}}}      First, I do not understand where the ``18.05263157894737` comes from. It does not appear in the Mathematica file. How can I get rid of it? Then I would prefer a formatting of the number `s` like `1.6974001229071336e12` instead of `1.6974001229071336*^-12`. The ultimate purpose is import in Maple. So if there is such an export feature it would be welcome too. Note that I need at least 18 digits precision.
