I'm an academic guy, who is now venturing into the software engineering world, puzzled by the fact that many terms seem to overlap each other. I'm reading some books and cannot quite distinguish/correlate a software process model from software engineering methods. For instance, in _Software Engineering_ Ian Sommerville defines a software process model as: > A simplified representation of a software process, presented from a specific > perspective. And software methodology ( _software engineering methods_ ) as: > Structured approaches to software development which include system models, > notations, rules, design advice and process guidance. However, Wikipedia defines _software development methodology_ like this: > A software development methodology or system development methodology in > software engineering is a framework that is used to structure, plan, and > control the process of developing an information system. In my opinion, Sommerville's definition of a software process model can enter on the scope of the Wikipedia definition. Can anyone enlighten me on this issue? An example would rock, e.g, `A` is a software process model and `B` is a software engineering methods (methodology).
