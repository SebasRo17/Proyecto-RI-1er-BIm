I have like 4 or 5 computers now, and I need a better system for syncing everything. I use git and github a lot to sync my files for programming projects, but then there are databases, .bash_profile files, bash scripts, etc. Sometimes, instead of syncing files, I just ssh in from one computer to another. But this is getting fairly chaotic. Some of my computers are Ubuntu and others are OS X. Any suggestions for managing a workflow that spans multiple personal computers?
