I am trying to plot a very simple function `f[x_]:=Exp[-x]/x` on a log-log scale like this               LogLogPlot[f[x], {x, 10^(-5), 10^7}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TmZMH.png) The problem is that for large values of x the plot suddenly jumps to 1 instead of going to zero as it should. I have tried to tabulate the values and increase working precision but it doesn't go away. The problem does not appear if I use               LogLogPlot[Exp[-x]/x, {x, 10^(-5), 10^7}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9whT3.png) Anyone can explain me what is happening?
