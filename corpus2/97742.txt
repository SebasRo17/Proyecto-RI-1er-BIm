What is the appropriate method to describe a valid range of a parameter in the documentation of code? Obviously long-form documentation (white papers, API documents, etc) can be more verbose than the actual code but this is really to address issues in the actual code than in the distributed documentation (that every user should read to begin with!) Examples:   * <argument name> where { <argument name> | 0 <= <argument name> <= 255 }   * <argument name> range: [0,255]   * <argument name> is valid between zero and 255 inclusive.
