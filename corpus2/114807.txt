I heard this number and a quick google search reveals a whole lot of touting this number and absolutely zero data (honestly most articles promoting COBOL read like 95% propoganda). Perhaps it's true in an extremely limited context of banking software or something, but with millions of applications coded in dozens of languages and near-zero new COBOL projects I don't see how this is possible. Is this a myth from the 70s (when it would have seemed entirely plausible) or is there some limited definition where this is actually true? I know there is a great deal still being maintained and I'm sure a large % of _businesses_ have at least one COBOL program around, but this invisible 70% seems absurd.
