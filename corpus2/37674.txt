I know there are a few questions already about getting a Master's degree in Computer Science, but my question is a bit different. I've started programming when I was quite young. I did receive a BS in CIS at Cal Poly Pomona over 4 years ago. Since then I've made a good living as a programmer for both Boeing and Disney (where I currently work). I feel that I've made very good progress as I quickly became a Sr. level developer in both companies within a year. I had considered getting a master's for a couple of years and finally started it a few months ago at Claremont Graduate in their MSIS program (http://www.cgu.edu/pages/201.asp). I've only taken a couple of courses but already I'm feeling like I already know this stuff and work with on a daily basis. I'm even wondering if it is worth me getting another "IS" degree and if I should look at a Computer Science degree instead. I had a couple of reasons of not going to CS in my undergrad, 1) I'm not great at math 2) I wanted to have a business degree to open up my options. I feel I'm a very competent programmer though and can work in a variety of languages, understand the software development process, etc. I'm just trying to figure out if I'm wasting my time with the current program I'm in. Sorry for the lengthy post, but I wanted to give some back story for better understanding.
