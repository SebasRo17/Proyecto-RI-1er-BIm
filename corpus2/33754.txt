I am trying to generate a sound with pitch that goes up and down like a sine wave from `0` to `2Pi`. So the pitch should be `Sin[2Pi t]` as `t` steps from `0` to `1`. I thought the way to do this would be somehow in pseudocode like make               f = Integrate[E^(Sin[x] + 2), x];      And then               Play[Sin[f[t]], {t,0,2Pi}]      But it seems _Mathematica_ can't integrate `E^(Sin[x] + 2)`? So then I just fooled around and did               Integrate[(Sin[t] + 2), t]      > >     2 t - Cos[t] >                 Play[Sin[(1.2^(2 t - 1 Cos[t])*1000)], {t, 0, 2 Pi}]      and it doesn't do what I want either...
