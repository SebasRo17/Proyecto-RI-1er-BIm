I'm in the 4th year at an IT university now, and when I talk with my professor about this topic he rejects my opinion and gives me a very heavy criticism (in my university, we were being taught C (ANSI) (in Procedural Programming class - in the 1st year at university ) before C++ (in OOP class in the 2nd year) and others... But at age 13 my brother was taught, by me, Java first and nothing else. Now, he can do almost everything which a normal 2nd-year-student can do with Java. To you pros, I'd like to know why you think we should be taught procedural programming first.
