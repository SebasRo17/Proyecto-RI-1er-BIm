I plot the function f(x,y). x goes from 0 to 25 and y goes from 0 to 12. So, my plot should look elongated since the range of x is twice as long as the range of y. The problem is that, mathematica rescales the size of the axes, so that I see a square plot eventhough I see x->[0,25] and y->[0,12]. This is what I do: ListPlot3D[Abs[list], ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", AxesLabel -> {xx, yy, f(xx,yy)}, PlotRange -> All] Does anybody know how could I see an elongated plot? Thanks alot!
