Finding a global minimum for this problem (non-linear optimization by the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method) may not be possible, but by finding local minimum, I am expecting the value of the function at the minimum is around 1 or (far) less than 1 (the lower the value, the better is the answer). `"Nelder-Mead"` method is available for `NMinimize` in _Mathematica_. The problem I am facing is, even though I am changing the method options for Nelder-Mead (for example, `"ShrinkRatio"`, `"ContractRatio"`, `"ReflectRatio"`, and so on) and also initializing the calculation for different initial values (which is chosen by the `"RandomSeed"`), I am getting minima which are way greater than 1. I found people deal these kind of problems by writing codes either in C++ or Fortran and the results are good, but I know neither of them so I am trying to do it with _Mathematica_ using the built-in functions. Here is the what I am trying (a simplified version of the original problem that I have to deal with which has even more number of parameters):               A = ({{a11, 0},{0, a22}});     B = ({{b11, b13},{b13, b22}});     M1 = A + Exp[I phi] B;     M2 = a A + b Exp[I theta] B;     M3 = a A - 3 b Exp[I theta] B;     m1 = Abs[Eigenvalues[M1]];     m2 = Abs[Eigenvalues[M2]];     m3 = Abs[Eigenvalues[M3]];               t1 = T1[a11_?NumberQ, a22_?NumberQ, b11_?NumberQ, b22_?NumberQ,      b13_?NumberQ, phi_?NumberQ] = m1[[1]];     t2 = T2[a11_?NumberQ, a22_?NumberQ, b11_?NumberQ, b22_?NumberQ,      b13_?NumberQ, phi_?NumberQ] = m1[[2]];          t3 = T3[a11_?NumberQ, a22_?NumberQ, b11_?NumberQ, b22_?NumberQ,      b13_?NumberQ, theta_?NumberQ, a_?NumberQ, b_?NumberQ] = m2[[1]];     t4 = T4[a11_?NumberQ, a22_?NumberQ, b11_?NumberQ, b22_?NumberQ,      b13_?NumberQ, theta_?NumberQ, a_?NumberQ, b_?NumberQ] = m2[[2]];          t5 = T5[a11_?NumberQ, a22_?NumberQ, b11_?NumberQ, b22_?NumberQ,      b13_?NumberQ, theta_?NumberQ, a_?NumberQ, b_?NumberQ] = m3[[1]];     t6 = T6[a11_?NumberQ, a22_?NumberQ, b11_?NumberQ, b22_?NumberQ,      b13_?NumberQ, theta_?NumberQ, a_?NumberQ, b_?NumberQ] = m3[[2]];          O2 = 0.235; O1 = 72;     E2 = 0.031; E1 = 0.87;          O4 = 0.0222196; O3 = 0.958157;     E4 = 0.006198; E3 = 0.018862;          O6 = 0.0941698; O5 = 1.60087;     E6 = 3.6079*^-7; E5 = 0.00026;          function[a11, a22, b11, b22, b13, a, b, phi,theta] =      ((t1 - O1)/E1)^2 + ((t2 - O2)/E2)^2 + ((t3 - O3)/E3)^2 + ((t4 - O4)/E4)^2 +     ((t5 - O5)/E5)^2 + ((t6 - O6)/E6)^2;          Do[Print[NMinimize[     function[a11, a22, b11, b22, b13, a, b, phi, theta],      {a11, a22,b11, b22, b13, a, b, phi, theta},     Method -> {"NelderMead", "ShrinkRatio" -> 0.5,"ContractRatio" -> 0.7,     "ReflectRatio" -> 1, "ExpandRatio" -> 2,"RandomSeed" -> j}]], {j, 5}]      Five random iterations (with different initial conditions chosen randomly) find different minima but all are much greater than the expected result. Here they are:               (* {9081.63     {a11->0.0585825,a22->1.22145,b11->-0.26137,b22->0.327416,b13->-0.158818,     a->-1.2025,b->0.168387,phi->-1.01436,theta->0.698082}}          {32448.8     {a11->-0.542868,a22->0.845826,b11->1.10494,b22->0.739838,b13->-0.16513,     a->0.795721,b->0.346771,phi->-0.369352,theta->-0.077746}}          {7122.85     {a11->0.0846693,a22->-0.643122,b11->-0.0834931,b22->-1.14742,b13->-0.37268,     a->1.36398,b->-0.208855,phi->-0.367912,theta->-0.359771}}          {14919     {a11->-0.14745,a22->-0.0507363,b11->0.414601,b22->0.306933,b13->0.420321,     a->0.364225,b->0.663577,phi->-0.625049,theta->-0.33245}}          {13582.6     {a11->-0.182997,a22->0.431253,b11->0.201061,b22->0.507661,b13->0.258584,     a->-0.471931,b->0.741867,phi->-0.5953,theta->-0.0911202}} *)      I tried with different combinations of the Nelder-Mead options with no improvements. The default value of the `MaxIterations` is 100, and I also tried by increasing the number of iterations by using the package of Nelder- Mead from the excellent post Shaving the last 50 ms off NMinimize by Oleksandr R., but again did not get any improvement. Can anyone help me with what I am missing?
