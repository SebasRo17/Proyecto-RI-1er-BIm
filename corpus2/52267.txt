Why should i write a commit message? I dont want to and i think its stupid every single time. A gui frontend i use which will go unnamed forces you to do it. I hear other doing it everytime even if they are using the VCS on the command line. If i commit several times a day and havent finish a feature what am i writing about? I ONLY ever write a message after many commits and i feel its time for a mini tag or when i do an actual tag. Am i right or am i missing something? also i am using a distributed system
