My current understanding about Mathematica is that everything, at the lowest level, ends up as replacement rules.   First question: is this true?   Second question: does Mathematica "gloss over" these rules by representing them as functions? ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HViEe.png) doesn't seem to be expressed as a rule. Third question: does the by value/by reference question have any when you "pass" a value to a Mathematica function?
