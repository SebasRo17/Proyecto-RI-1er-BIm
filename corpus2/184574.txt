It seems like, when reading something like this Wikipedia article about "pure functions", they list `Today()` as an example of an impure function but it seems pretty pure to me. Is it because there is no formal input argument? Why is the actual time of day not treated as the "input to the function" in which case if you gave it the same input, i.e. executed `today()` twice at the same time, or traveled back in time to execute it again (maybe a hypothetical :) ), the output would be the same time. `Today()` never gives you a random number. it always gives you the time of day. The Wikipedia article says "different times it will yield different results" but that's like saying for different `x` `sin(x)` will give you different ratios. And `sin(x)` is their example of a pure function.
