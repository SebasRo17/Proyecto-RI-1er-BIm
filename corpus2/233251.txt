I have a team member who refuses to use any form of private source code repository on Github or Bitbucket due to "security concerns". As a result, we have a hard time sharing code with him. He appears to be concerned about source code theft by some party. To me, using cloud based source code repos is fairly standard industry practice. But does this individual have a point? Vendors do steal from customers in other industries. Should a multimillion dollar idea not be stored on a third party cloud service like AWS, Github, Bitbucket, App Engine, etc?
