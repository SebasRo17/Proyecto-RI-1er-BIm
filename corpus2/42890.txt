I am currently trying to Laplace invert an expression with the following pattern $$ \frac{s \alpha \text{Cosh}[s(L-x)]+\beta \text{Sinh}[s(L-x)]}{s(\gamma \text{Cosh}[sL]+s \delta \text{Sinh}[sL])} $$ where $s$ is the complex variable and $x\in[0,L]$ a real variable; all other parameters are real constants. One path I foresee in achieving the inversion is by expressing the denominator in the form of a power series of exponential terms, as these correspond to shifts in the time domain. For instance, this approach can successfully be applied to $$ \frac{1}{s(1+\mathrm{e}^{-s})}=\frac{1}{s}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n\mathrm{e}^{-ns} $$ which upon inversion yields a train of Heaviside functions $$ \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{s(1+\mathrm{e}^{-s})}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^n H(t-n) $$ Therefore, my question is, using Mathematica, how can I transform $(\gamma \text{Cosh}[sL]+s\delta\text{Sinh}[sL])^{-1}$ into a series of exponential functions; that is, $$ \frac{1}{\gamma \text{Cosh}[sL]+s\delta\text{Sinh}[sL]} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(s) \mathrm{e}^{-n sL} $$ Any help will be appreciated.
