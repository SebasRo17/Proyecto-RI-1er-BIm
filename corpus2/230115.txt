Nowadays, almost everybody is using a dark color scheme in their code editor - dark background with light text. Even most web based editors (e.g on Github) feature dark color schemes. I honestly don't see the benefits. The human eye is much better at reading dark text on a bright background. Also, black on white color schemes work much better when you're in a brightly lit environment. I'm currently sitting in an office with the sun shining through the window. I can read the text in my editor (gVim with dark text on white background) just fine, but on the linux console it's much harder. Editing text in console vim is almost impossible for me. The whole thing seems a bit like a strange hype to me, started by the default settings in certain IDEs/editors. But maybe I'm just weird.. ;) Anyway, so why is everybody using these?
