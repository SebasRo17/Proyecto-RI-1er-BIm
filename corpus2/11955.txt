I know that Mathematica checks the validity of its license every time the program is launched. Say, however, that I have a valid license (which I do) and that I am running some code which takes a long time to evaluate and includes multiple separate instructions being sent to the kernel (i.e. not all in a single cell evaluation). If the license server in my institute goes down will Mathematica continue to run without error as long as I keep the program open or will it immediately give an error and cease operation? In brief: Does Mathematica check its license only at launch or continually while it is open? Theres no license tag apparently....
