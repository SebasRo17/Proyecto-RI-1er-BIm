Is it better to use multiple html pages and link them together with `href` or just change content on the same page using JavaScript? I am thinking of how to layout a page and I don't have a lot of content. It would probably be about three of for pages if I just used all html. If I toggled and swapped bits of html around using JavaScript, I could probably fit it all on one page, and it would be a bit "cooler", in that it's more of an application, dynamic, etc. But I'm just wondering what the best way to go here? Is it horrible to have to much JavaScript "squashed" to one document? How do you know where to draw the line when thinking about this?
