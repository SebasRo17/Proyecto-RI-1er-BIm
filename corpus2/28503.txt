This code failed, but may exemplify my intention.               StringCases["aA1bbbbbbbbbbaA2baA3b...aA4b",Repeated[Shortest["a"~~xx__~~"b"],{2,100}]]      I want to get the substring `"aA2baA3b"`. They (`a~~__~~b` is one string pattern) are in succession. single `"aA3b"` is not expected to get and should be omitted.               StringCases["aA1bbbbbbbbbbaA2baA3b...aA4b",Repeated[Shortest["a"~~__~~"b"],{2,100}]]      gives > "aA1bbbbbbbbbbaA2baA3b"
