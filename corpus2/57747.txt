I don't get the chance to partake of it at work. But I love the idea of **code review**. Especially of online open source code review like Gerrit Code Review. I love what **Trust Metrics** have done for forums and collective intelligences sites on the internet like stackexchange, reddit, and wikipedia. Would it be possible to combine the two and come up with an open source project management system. Something that ends up being mostly community driven. Perhaps a kind of wikipedia of code for a project. Where submitters become popular/trusted by having lots of patches reviewed favoriably by others, and accepted into the trunk. And popular/trusted submitters get their patchs accepted faster/easier. I'm looking for some opinions on the idea, or perhaps pointers to where its been done before, if thats the case. This might leave the lead maintiner little more to do than:   * wrangle the direction of the project by fast-tracking or vetoing specific patches.    * settling disputes when the CI tests break, or fixing it himself.  Is design by community worse than design by committee?
