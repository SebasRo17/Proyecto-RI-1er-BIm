Extending the answer to this question, I have broken down a large system into a few classes per package. Each package is now shown in a different page for readability, but now how do I show the relationship of two classes in separate packages (separate printed pages)? **An example for clarification:** ![E has an association with A but are in separate packages](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b6Hs4.jpg) E has an association with A but are in separate packages (which means they are on different pages)
