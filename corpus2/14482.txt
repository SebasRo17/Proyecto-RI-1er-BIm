What I would like to do is remove entries from a list of instrument data when it is in maintenance. The maintenance data I have is a series of dates which look like this;               {{{2009, 6, 29, 10, 41, 0.}, {2009, 6, 30, 15, 26, 0.}}, {{2009, 6,         30, 16, 52, 0.}, {2009, 7, 1, 6, 0, 0.}}, {{2009, 7, 1, 6, 0,         0.}, {2009, 7, 1, 6, 2, 0.}}}      So between 29/6/2009 10:41 and 30/6/2008 15:26 the instrument was in maintenance. The instrument data looks like this;               {{{2010, 1, 1, 6, 15, 0.}, 0.04375}, {{2010, 1, 1, 6, 30, 0.},        0.04375}, {{2010, 1, 1, 6, 45, 0.},        0.04375}, {{2010, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0.},        0.04375}, {{2010, 1, 1, 7, 15, 0.}, 0.04375}}      With the first column being the date/time and the second the value. What I would like is a quick (the instrument data is 100,000 records) way to remove rows from the instrument data when their date falls inside a maintenance period.
