I have the opportunity to work in an 'overseas' country. I have passed the technical interviews and I am at the 'offer' stage. Everything is ok, except for the fact that I am expected to pay for my plane ticket, which is almost 2000 EUR (an aprox 8000 km distance). I've discussed this with the possible future employer and they said that the plane ticket is my expense. What I'm asking you is: Shouldn't they pay me for the plane ticket? Or give me a relocation package? Do you accept this kind of offer? What relocation package would you have asked for if you were in my shoes? PS: Destionation country is Singapore. I am a Delphi Developer with 5 years of experience in SD, and overall 8 years in IT.
