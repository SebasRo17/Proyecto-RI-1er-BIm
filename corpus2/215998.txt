I have a web application in which i need to show a big number of data or records for clients. Now i 'll use pagination but i was wondering should I:   1. Load all the data once then pagination, sorting and sarching 'll be easy..But it 'll takes big time(using local DB it takes up to 9 sec.)   2. Or each time i show new page(from the pagination) i make a new request to server and then new request to DB to get the next records..But then what if the client click on `Prev` button, i 'll make a new request to get data that I had previously..Should i cach data that are loaded before and how if that's good technique?  So load all data once or make a new request every time i need data that maybe have been loaded before. I'm using ASP.NET MVC SPA with durandaljs and knockoutjs
