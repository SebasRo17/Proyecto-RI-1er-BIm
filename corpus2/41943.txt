I try to interact with mathematica using MathLink for symbolic computations. By default it returns strings such as `2\012-1 + E\012-------\012 3\012 E` if the input is `Integrate[Exp[-x],{x,1,3}]`. For better usability I would like it to print all output in `InputForm` which I could achieve by wrapping all input by a `InputForm[]` command (would this be bullet-proof for all possible input?). However it would be more elegant if I could define this once for all at the beginning of a session. Is there a way to do this? Furthermore the output seems to include the `Out[#]` labels which I know from Notebook files. I would prefer to suppress it as well. Obviously I could do it by cutting it manually from the returned string but there might be an elegant solution as well.
