From what I know, most banking applications periodically store the account balance at a certain point in time as it would not be plausible to calculate it over the entire history of transactions every time it is needed. In order to find the account balance, the application would first load the latest balance saved and add transactions that occurred after that point. What is this process of saving account balances called? What are some common techniques used in this process?(e.g., run it on every weekend night)
