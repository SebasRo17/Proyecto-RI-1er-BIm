I'm new to Mathematica. Below is the code I have trouble with.               Do[Print[         Subscript[C, k][x_, y_]: =                Subscript[q, 2 k - 1] + x*Subscript[q, 2 k] - (Subscript[q, l] + y*Subscript[q, l + 1])        ],       {k, 3, 5}, {l, 3}]      In this loop, I want k=3 map to l=1, k=4 map to l=2, and k=5 map to l=3. However in this loop function, it loops through l=1,2,3 when k=3 and so on. So is there an automatic way or code to stop the certain looping?
