I am about to design a video conversion service, that is scalable on the conversion side. The architecture is as follows:   * Webpage for video upload   * When done, a message gets sent out to one of several resizing servers   * The server locates the video, saves it on disk, and converts it to several formats and resolutions   * The resizing server uploads the output to a content server, and messages back that the conversion is done. Messaging is something I have covered, but right now I am transferring via FTP, and wonder if there is a better way? is there something faster, or more reliable? All the servers will be sitting in the same gigabit switch or neighboring switch, so fast transfer is expected. EDIT:   The question goes on the server <-> server side of things. The servers are co- located in same LAN, so the security of the interconnection there is not expected to be the main issue.
