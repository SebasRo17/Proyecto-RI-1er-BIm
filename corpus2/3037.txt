I find it very convenient to use Mathematica notebooks to **organise** the codes + results. I was wondering if it is possible to **insert** an **animated image** (say an animated gif) in the middle of a notebook. (I tried dragging and dropping an animated gif into a notebook, the gif itself was created using Mathematica. Mathematica **Import[]** s it and I see a bunch of images in the notebook). This suggests, one solution namely using a **Manipulate[]** or **Animate[]** , with those bunch of images. But is there an **less tedious and more elegant way**? Thanks!
