What factors do I need to consider when choosing names for identifiers such as variables? I am concerned about space issues, i.e. extra memory consumption when choosing longer names. As an example, take these two variables:               bool noExp = true;     bool willNotExpireEver = true;      Each one will take up memory the size of `bool`. But what about the variable names? They are after all characters that have to be stored somewhere. Where does the space for them get allocated? Am I wasting pace by choosing longer names?
