when using product in mathematica the initial and maximum value of the product will be the variable itself that will be maupulated. what I need is to make these initial and maximum of the product as an index for several variables. for example if I have the following series product: $$\text{y}=\prod _{i=1}^M \left(1-\exp \left(-\frac{z}{\bar{\gamma }_{\text{RD}_i}}\right) \left(\frac{\bar{\gamma }_{\text{SR}_i}}{z \bar{\gamma }_{\text{IR}_i}+\bar{\gamma }_{\text{SR}_i}}\right){}^L\right);$$ So here $i$ is the index for variables $\bar{\gamma }_{\text{RD}}$, $\bar{\gamma }_{\text{IR}}$, and $\bar{\gamma }_{\text{SR}}$ How I can perform this product? Note: L is Positive Integer; L=1,2,...
