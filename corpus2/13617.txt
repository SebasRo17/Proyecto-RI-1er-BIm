I would like to enter the results of the following loop inside a matrix as its elements:               p=1;     q=4;          For[i = 0, i < p, i++,       For[j = 1, j < q + 1, j++,        For[h = 0, h < p, h++,         For[k = 1 , k < q + 1, k++,          Subscript[wtotal, m, i, j, h, k] =            Subscript[w, m, i, j, h, k  ] + Subscript[w1, m, i, j, h, k]          ; Print[Subscript[wtotal, m, i, j, h, k]]]]        ]       ];      This matrix gives 16 values, so I would like to enter those 16 values inside a 4X4 matrix. So how should I do it... Further how should i convert the 4x4x4x4 table into a 16x16 matrix so that i can take its inverse.?
