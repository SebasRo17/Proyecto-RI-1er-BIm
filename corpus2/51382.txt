I'm trying to define a function `f` which takes a list of reals. My purpose is to build a function which I can give a list of reals, integers or strings and have it build an appropriate probability distribution for. So I'd like to do something like               f[{samples_Real}]:=makeRealDist[samples];     f[{samples_Integer}]:=makeInteger[samples];     f[{samples_String}]:=makeCategoricalDist[samples];      I can easily match on `Real`/`Integer`/`Strings`. The part I can't figure out is how to match on a list of `Real`/`Integer`/`String`.
