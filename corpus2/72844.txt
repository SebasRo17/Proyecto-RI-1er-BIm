Is it appropriate to release incomplete open-source firmware, or in other words, to release only GPL software but not proprietary software source code? How are non-open-source programs, in compiled firmware for a router/embedded device, allowed with the open-source, Linux-based operating system and other GPL software? For example: If a company releases compiled firmware and source code for a router but only releases the source code for GPL software within the firmware, is it okay, according to the GPL, that the firmware source code would be uncompilable because it is incomplete and is missing the proprietary part of the software?
