I'd like to convert an open source C application to pure python (not to Cython, IronPython etc). The documentation and presentations of the original creator of the C application has given me a good understanding of the architecture of the application. Since I want the first version of the python application to be as identical to the C based one, a manual conversion seems to be the best option. I'd appreciate some tips on how to best approach this code conversion (C to Python), based on your experience. (I am just looking for insights on how others have handled a similar task before.) * * * (Python version 2.7; The C application is the popular database SQLite. Please don't let that or C vs python distract you from the actual question. My C is rusty but good enough for the task, and my Python is above average.) * * * Clarifications:   * I was planning a manual rewrite. Appreciate advice on how to analyze the C source and header files and things to keep in mind vis-a-vis python.
