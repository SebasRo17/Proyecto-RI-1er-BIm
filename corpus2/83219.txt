This question is about hardware and hosting, and how to "bootstrap" them. If you built a really great website, how could you have it hosted at low cost but so that it reassures customers that their data is safe and available. As an example, what if I have a web application I developed for small companies to use for their accounting, a replacement for Quickbooks. Aside from getting a bunch of money from VCs or Angels, how would you be able to host this so that you could guarantee your customers that their data won't be lost, and the site will always be up so that they can always get to their data?
