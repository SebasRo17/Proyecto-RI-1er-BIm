I understand that an interpreter could do one of the following things (and probably more):   1. Execute programming-language source code directly.   2. First translate the source code to some intermediate code (which is less human-readable and more efficient or easier for the interpreter to execute), and then execute this code. My questions are:   1. Is this assumption true? Am I understanding correctly the general function of an interpreter? Or is something I wrote wrong?   2. If my assumptions are true, which one of these two possible functions are more common? Please show examples.
