I'm attempting to write a cancel operation for a software download application. This application will first transfer the software to the device and then install the software on it. (These are givens I'm not allowed to change). What should the cancel operation do? When a user presses 'cancel', the application should stop transferring/installing the software immediately. Question: Since I've never written a "cancel" function, I'm wondering what are the types of things to consider when writing the code, and what are the common bugs I should expect and how to deal with them? Couldn't find anything in google so if you have some links that would be good reads I'd really appreciate it since I'm not looking for answers I'm just looking for guidelines/macro/concept help
