Given a summation like $$\sum_{1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \dotsc < i_k \leq n} f(i_1, i_2, \dotsc , i_k)$$ how can the lists of indices be enumerated? For example, if $n=4$ then the possible lists of indices are               k=1: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}     k=2: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}     k=3: {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4}     k=4: {1,2,3,4}      It doesn't matter in what order the lists appear in, and it doesn't matter if they are separated by $k$, i.e., this function could give the lists of indices for a given $k$ value, or list all lists for $k=1 \dotsc n$ (the 14 in the example) in arbitrary order. This is similar to the question Sequential Subsets of a list except that in the example given there, given a list               {1, 2, 3, 4}      the output is               {1}, {2}, {3}, {4},      {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4},     {1,2,3}, {2,3,4},     {1,2,3,4}      (in some order) and in this case, we additionally need               {1,3}, {2,4}, {1,2,4}      to appear in the output.
