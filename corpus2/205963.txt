I'm currently setting up a MongoDB database for a web-app. I'm running node.js and using Mongoose to help manage mapping, validation ect. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to really decouple MongoDB from my code, just on the off-chance we want to switch to something like CouchDB a little later. Specifically, I'd make a `databaseManger` module that is responsible for setting up Mongoose/Mongo, defining the mongoose models, managing replica sets, and doing some extra validation. This manager would export a generic API, and handle the details of the queries internally. The manager would then be passed around via dependency injection. Does this make sense? Or am I kind-of redoing some of the mongoose functionality? Any advice is appreciated.
