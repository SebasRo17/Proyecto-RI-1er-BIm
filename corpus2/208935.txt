I have an idea about programming in general so I know what a variable and a method is but I didn't program before. I liked C# because of Visual Studio and I only tried Hello word program in it. I still don't know much about OOP. Now, I have videos to learn from which I found on (LearnVisualStudio.net). However, I'm not sure about the author of the videos in that site if he is a professional or just a hobbyist because I want someone to teach me with a good practice habits, I want to learn the right way! I also have some books but I found most of them don't explain the principles in a clear way. So they start with a 'hello world' program and after that you find yourself lost with a lot of concepts which are explained randomly. Please let me know if you know anything about the site mentioned above if it is good or not to start with and let me know if learning from videos considered good for learning programming and OOP?
