I want to combine an `Image3D` and a `Graphics3D` using `Show`. Here is the code:               data = Table[        Abs[((3 - 3 z) (.5 Sign[3 - 3 z] + .5)) (x Sin[x] + y Cos[y])],        {x, 0, 15, .1}, {y, 0, 10, .1}, {z, 0, 3, .1}        ];     Show[Image3D[data/Max@data],       Graphics3D[{AbsoluteThickness[5], Blue,         Line[{{0, 0, 0}, {2, 2, 2}, {3, 3, 2}, {8, 5, 2}, {14, 9, 2}, {15,            10, 0}}]}]]      While the coordinates are aligned, the output is not. ![3d path overlap](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yQHsn.png) See the blue line on the right corner. How can I fix the problem? **Edit:** The issue is resolved. There are two answers below. Both are helpful but neither of them is complete. Once any of them is competed, I'll mark it as accepted. I write one possible answer to the question here (I added `{#[[3]], #[[2]], #[[1]]}/delta & /@ pointList` to my code):               With[{delta = .1},      data = Table[        Abs[((3 - 3 z) (.5 Sign[3 - 3 z] + .5)) (x Sin[x] + y Cos[y])],        {x, 0, 15, delta}, {y, 0, 10, delta}, {z, 0, 3, delta}        ];      Show[Graphics3D[{AbsoluteThickness[5], Blue,          Line[{#[[3]], #[[2]], #[[1]]}/            delta & /@ {{0, 0, 0}, {2, 2, 2}, {3, 3, 2}, {8, 5, 2}, {14, 9,              2}, {15, 10, 0}}]}], Image3D[data/Max@data]]      ]
