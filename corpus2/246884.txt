Let's say I wanted to close my "GPL v 2.0 (or similar)" licensed project, to which I'm the only contributor, and make it closed source.   * Do I still need to make the existing "GPL v 2.0 (or similar)" licensed code available after closing the project or can I refuse giving out the source code for old revisions that was previously "GPL v 2.0 (or similar)" licensed?   * Can I theoretically keep the the code "GPL v 2.0 (or similar)" licensed even after removing the public source code or do I have to distribute the source code if I'm using a "GPL v 2.0 (or similar)" license?
