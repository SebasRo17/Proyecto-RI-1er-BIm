1. I was wondering what "profile" means in Wikipedia: > XML is a profile of an ISO standard SGML, and most of XML comes from SGML > unchanged.   2. According to http://xml-tips.assistprogramming.com/sgml-xml-html-xhtml-all-together.html: > HTML is a subset of SGML. > > XML is a highly functional subset of SGML. > > XHTML extends and subsets HTML. Does "one being a subset of another" mean that code in the first is also syntactically correct and semantically the same as in the second? As in the sense of elementary set theory,     * are HTML, XML and XHTML all different subsets of SGML?     * do XML and HTML almost not intersect each other?     * is XHTML a superset of both XML and HTML?   3. Can I expect some more concise and clear summation of the differences in the purposes of the four and/or when to use which, than the link above? I am really confused about the clear line between their intended purposes.   4. According to http://xml-tips.assistprogramming.com/sgml-xml-html-xhtml-all-together.html: > XML is not a single Markup Language. It is a metalanguage to let users > design their own markup language. I was wondering how to understand XML and HTML are both subsets of SGML, but HTML is a markup language while XML is not a markup language but a metalanguage for designing markup languages? Are SGML and XHTML both also metalanguage for designing markup language?   5. As in both links mention that HTML is an applicaiton of SGML as well as a subset of SGML, and XHTML is an application of XML. I wonder what differences are between saying one language is an application of another, and one language is a subset of another? Thanks and regards!
