... and coded the functionality "manually"? As a rather metaphorical example, you'd hardly need a library for solving quadratic equations, although such libraries do exist and someone takes them seriously. As a more questionable case, depending on the circumstances I may ditch jQuery (for example when I don't need to support some stone age browsers): it does simplify some things but it adds another layer of complexity and unreliability to DOM. And overusing jQuery leads to absurd problems, such as one seen recently on SO: how do I assign an empty href to an `a` tag with jQuery? Turned out it was a HTML question, not even JavaScript. Another absurd case and yet non-obvious for many is using some templating engine/language built on top of another templating system: PHP. Third level of templating anyone? And another one: _sometimes_ just spitting out XML with (figurally) `printf` is far easier than doing it with some monstrous XML engine. Any other cases from your experience?
