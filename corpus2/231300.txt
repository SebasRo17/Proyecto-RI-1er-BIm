I have seen _Exception Handling_ blocks that they were `throw`ing the recently caught `Exception` in the `catch` block. Something like:               } catch ( Exception $e ) {         // Do some recovery here         callSomeFunction();              throw $e;     }      To me it doesn't make that much sense to `throw` the exact same `Exception` like this, but I'm not sure if I'm right or not. Maybe there are situations that that's the only option? My question is what are the pros and cons of this approach and shouldn't it be totally avoided as much as possible?
