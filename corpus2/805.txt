There have already been some questions about some undocumented functionality in Mathematica. Such as ( _please add to these lists!_ )   * How can one find undocumented options or option values in Mathematica?   * What do these undocumented Style options in Mathematica do?   * Undocumented command-line options Also, other questions and answers that contained undocumented functions   * `Internal`InheritedBlock` (also in Exposing Symbols to $ContextPath)   * `Internal`Bag` (in Implementing a Quadtree in Mathematica) (also here)   * `RuleCondition` (in Replace inside Held expression) Along with the "Undocumented (or scarcely documented) Features" segment of the What is in your Mathematica tool bag? question. Szabolcs also maintains a list of Mathematica tricks which contains a list of "undocumented stuff". * * * **So, what undocumented functions do you know and how do you use them?** (Added useful information is maybe how you discovered the functions and any version dependence.)
