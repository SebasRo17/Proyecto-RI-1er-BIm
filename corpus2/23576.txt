I have four series of data that I would like to plot side by side. They look something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2vp9m.jpg) As the y-coordinate goes from 80 to 50 In the first series, the x-coordinate varies from around 20 to 10 In the second series, the x-coordinate varies from around 10 to 5 In the third series, the x-coordinate moves between from around 459.9 to 460.05 In the fourth series, the x-coordinate moves between from around 460.1 to 460.05 I would like to present the four series in the same plot so that the scaling of the x-axis is as show in the picture, where the scale is normal up to 20, then just shrinks between 20 and 459 and then expands between 459 and 461. Thanks
