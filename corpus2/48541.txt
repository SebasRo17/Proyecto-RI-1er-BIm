I'm trying to make Mathematica compute this sum:               Sum[(-1)^k (n - k)^2 Binomial[2 n, k], {k, 0, n}]      As is, I get an awful formula:               Sum[(-1)^k (n - k)^2 Binomial[2 n, k], {k, 0, n}] // FullSimplify      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mdKPV.png) Using Maxima, I get the (almost correct) result `0`, with `nusum((-1)^k*(n-k)^2*binomial(2*n,k),k,0,n);`. But for `n=1`, the result is `1`, so Maxima is a bit too aggressive here: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ae1zR.png) So I try to add assumptions to Mathematica:               Sum[(-1)^k (n - k)^2 Binomial[2 n, k], {k, 0, n},        Assumptions -> Element[n, Integers] && n > 1] // FullSimplify     Refine[%, Element[n, Integers] && n > 1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xvqJ1.png) It's much better, but there is an obvious simplification, and I don't know how to make Mathematica "see" it. An hypergeometric series with a negative integer parameter is a polynomial, and here it's especially simple. `FunctionExpand` does not work either. However, we have really a `Hypergeometric2F1`, and if I write it explicitly, the simplification is possible:               -2 n Hypergeometric2F1[2, 1 - 2 n, 1, 1]     Refine[%, Element[n, Integers] && n > 1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/P6T1U.png) Is there a way to make this a bit more automatic?
