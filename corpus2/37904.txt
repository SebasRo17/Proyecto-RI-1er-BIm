I have functions defined in some section of the notebook and some cells where I use these functions maaaaany pages below in the same notebook. If I want to go and change the definition of the function I need to climb up in the notebook, find the definition and change it, then climb down to the place where I was working and using these functions. This is very inconvenient and looks like "navigation by sight". I was wondering how this can be made more efficient. For instance if it was a C++ or TeX source I would use the table of content of the file that my editor builds for me so that I can jump to the section where I define function clicking the TOC and then jump back to the original location either using "back" or again clicking the TOC. Can anything like this be done in mathematica?
