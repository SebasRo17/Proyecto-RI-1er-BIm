When developing some new code (eg. a function to analyse something) I usually make a .m and .nb file. The code goes in to .m is then called from the .nb. But sometimes I forget to run the package after saving and then spend some time wondering why my code changes don't have the desired effect. **Is there a way to run a package automatically after it's saved?** Basically I would like that when I press [Ctrl]+S the package is saved and that the effect of this button being pressed is achieved. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JfnBt.png) Currently I put `Import["MyPackage.m"]` at the top of the evaluation cell I'm currently working on in the notebook. Perhaps I could also abuse $Pre for this, but then the package would get imported on every cell evaluation (which is a bit needles). **EDIT** Well, this is what I have so far based on Chirs's answer               FrontEndExecute[      FrontEnd`AddMenuCommands[       "Save", {Delimiter,         MenuItem["Save and Run &Package",          FrontEnd`KernelExecute[NotebookSave[SelectedNotebook[]];          If[FileExtension[NotebookFileName[SelectedNotebook[]]] ==             "m",(*then*)           Get[NotebookFileName[SelectedNotebook[]]];           ];          ], MenuKey["S", Modifiers -> {"Control"}],          System`MenuEvaluator -> Automatic]}]]
