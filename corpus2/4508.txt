I have the following datasets:               dataset1={{{1997}, 98/79}, {{1998}, 26/61}, {{1999}, 22/15}, {{2000}, 100/       63}, {{2007}, 284/57}, {{2008}, 226/31}, {{2009}, 15/4}, {{2010},        221/63}};          dataset2={{{1997}, 25/79}, {{1998}, 17/61}, {{1999}, 28/25}, {{2000}, 20/       21}, {{2007}, 106/57}, {{2008}, 128/31}, {{2009}, 59/16}, {{2010},        32/9}};      I want to plot them using `DateListPlot[{dataset1,dataset2}]` (plus appropriate additions, such as `Joined`, etc.). Note, however, that there is a missing gap here: the years 2001 through 2006. I have multiple datasets (over five of them) so the dots can be hard to understand. If I use the `Filling->Bottom` addition, it cleans it up a bit, but still a bit hard. If I use `Joined->true`, it just connects 2000 and 2007 (as it should) but this implies data that I don't have. Is there a way, using _Mathematica_ , to connect the points for the years 1997 through 2000 and the years 2007 through 2010 - but not to draw a line in the middle between 2000 and 2007, as that skews the data?
