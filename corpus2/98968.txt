Some co-workers and myself are tasked with a "rewrite" of an ancient, unmaintainable application and to shape it into something workable. I am setting up a continuous integration server, and since we are developing for .NET, I think I will use CruiseControl.net The software being built will have a large amount of build targets (language, features, etc), so changes to the build server config might be more on the frequent side. Since they'll also include drivers and will run a suite of QA tests, they might get pretty complicated too. So one question I have, is should I put the configuration files and settings for the build server in the same source repository as the code base. Then it's easy to know what version of build configuration was used with a revision of the code base. But something about that seems kind of "icky" to me but I don't know why. Or, I can have a separate repository or location for the build server configuration, and maintain the lineage of the config relative to the main code base with the commit messages. Does anyone have any familiarity with either situation and did you run into problems doing one or the other? I believe CC.NET can automatically check out its config info, so both options should work.
