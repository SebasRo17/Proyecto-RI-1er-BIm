Given data:               titanic = ExampleData[{"Dataset", "Titanic"}]      This Association Query works:               titanic[All, <| "newKey" -> "age"|>]      But numeric or Symbol Keys,               titanic[All, <| 1 -> "age"|>]     titanic[All, <| newKey -> "age"|>]      fail with error: `Missing[KeyAbsent]`. Known issue? Numeric keys are especially conveninent for multiple, parametrized queries. Currently, that requires the workaround `KeyMap[ToString]` and later back `ToExpression`.
