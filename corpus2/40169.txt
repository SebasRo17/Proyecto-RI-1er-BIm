I am attempting to use `AstronomicalData` and `DeleteCases` together to remove invalid cases of two properties while listing the corresponding name which the data belongs to. I can only selectively choose one of the two properties in which to remove invalid cases from. An example of two selected properties with the first property being filtered;               DeleteCases[Transpose[{      AstronomicalData["Exoplanet", P1], AstronomicalData["Exoplanet", P2], AstronomicalData["Exoplanet"]      }],{_Missing,_,_}],      The issue is having a limitation of defining either `P1` or `P2` as the chosen property to remove invalid cases from. I have tried various ways of correcting this and can't apply it to both properties. I can switch which property it acts upon by swapping the slot _Missing is defined in like this;               {_Missing,_,_}     {_,_Missing,_}      Defining both slots doesn't apply the function to either individual property like this;               {_Missing,_Missing,_}      How can I achieve being able to filter the results where if either property has an invalid value the data is dismissed?
