I'm a long time Microsoft developer who has recently started publishing Windows Phone 7 apps to beef up my current C#/.NET skills, and get more direct exposure to WPF/Silverlight, and of course because it is new and cool. So far I've published over 10 apps successfully.   1. Is this a good thing to put on my resume?   2. Does it appear to show a grasp of the latest Microsoft technologies?   3. Any downside seen by potential employers?    4. Would you put this on your resume, if looking for a full time professional Software Engineering position?
