I am seeking a convenient and effective way to calculate such geometric quantities. I've used packages like `TensoriaCalc`, but they don't work at all time. Sometimes, I run into the following error: > Symbol `Tensor` is Protected.   >  Symbol `TensorType` is Protected.   >  Symbol `TensorName` is Protected.   > Here is the code I'm using:               Clear [i, j, φ, τ, σ]      q["case"] = Metric[ SubMinus[i], SubMinus[j],          E^(2 φ[σ]) (\[DifferentialD]τ^2 + \[DifferentialD] σ^2),          CoordinateSystem -> {τ, σ}, TensorName -> "T", StartIndex -> 1 ]      I think the above is correct, since I merely modified the example from the package manual. It gives me the correct answer sometimes (if I only use one notebook). Also, I ran the codes from the chapter "General Relativity" in the book " _Mathmatica_ for theoretical physics" by Gerd Baumann, but none of them work Is there more efficient way to calculate them? Please give me some suggestions about this.
