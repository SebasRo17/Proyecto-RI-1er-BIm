I am one of those people who learn by doing, and I often get a new idea for a project beside work, which could be fun and perhaps later on profitable. I have had quite a few ideas, but I usually burn out, which is often because I am alone on the projects. Most of my collegues have kids, or don't want to use their spare time for hobby projects. Therefore it is often hard to find other people who I can work with on my hobby projects. My question is therefore, if there is a good place to find co-developers for small non-open source projects?
