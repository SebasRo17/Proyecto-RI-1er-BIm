I am a regular user of Wordpress and whenever I feel the need to change the look of a DOM element, I prefer to use it inline. This is just because I don't want go back to the stylesheet and create new classes and styles for a single different looking element on a particular post. Can anyone please list the **PROS and CONS of this technique**. And should I change it? _**PS - All suggestions should be given keeping the CMS factor in mind._**
