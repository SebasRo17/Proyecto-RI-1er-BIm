Consider the following snippet as a reference.                DynamicModule[{},        Manipulate[        Graphics[          Translate[            GeometricTransformation[              { Blue,                 Polygon[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}]              }, {{scx, 0}, {0, scy}}            ],             Tuples[{Range[wi], Range[he]}] - 1          ],           ImageSize -> 400 {1, 1}        ],         {{scx, 1, "x scale"}, 0, 1},         {{scy, 1, "y scale"}, 0, 1},         {{wi, 1, "width"}, 1, 5, 1},         {{he, 1, "heigth"}, 1, 5, 1}       ]     ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5HDw.png) A graphical drawing program with a lot of controls (buttons, sliders) would benefit (a lot) by freeing up space and moving controls to a `Palette`, or a similar construct. I am considering the redesign of a GUI and I am currently investigating the options and technical possibilities. - Looking at the reference code snippet (which is not the GUI in question, but makes asking the question - and answering! - so much easier) I have the following question. **Is it possible to move (one of) the sliders to a`Palette`, or similar construct?**
