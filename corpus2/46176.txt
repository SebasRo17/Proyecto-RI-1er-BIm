I am trying to sum the following expression:               (Cos[(2 π m)/N]^2 Cos[(2 π n)/ N])/(2 (Cos[(2 m π)/N] - Cos[(2 n π)/N]))      from `m=1` to `(N+1)/2` excluding the term `m=n`. I split this sum into two: the first from `m=1` to `n-1`, and the second from `m=n+1` to `(N+1)/2`. I run into two problems: the first series just does not evaluate ( _Mathematica_ returns the expression). However when I plot it plugging in some values for `n`, `N` (with `N` always greater than `m`, `n`), I find the function to be well behaved in the interval. The second series from `n+1` to `(N+1)/2` does sum, but it evaluates to complicated `QPolygamma` functions, and `FullSimplify` doesn't help. Any help would be appreciated!
