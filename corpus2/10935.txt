I have the following equation given: $$ (26-x)\cdot\sqrt{5x-1} -(13x+14)\cdot\sqrt{5-2x} + 12\sqrt{(5x-1)\cdot(5-2x) }= 18x+32. $$ In order to solve it, I want to substitute $t = \sqrt{5x - 1}-\sqrt{5-2x}$. This cannot be done directly but with this step the equation could be transformed in the form $(t-2)^3 = 0$, which can be solved easily. Is it possible to make this substitution with Mathematica? The only thing I have achieved is to solve it directly with               Solve[(26 - x)*Sqrt[5*x - 1] - (13*x + 14)*Sqrt[5 - 2*x] +            12*Sqrt[(5*x - 1)*(5 - 2*x)] == 18*x + 32]
