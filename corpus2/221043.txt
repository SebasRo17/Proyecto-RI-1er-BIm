The title says it all. Some employees in our company believe that automated tests are "easy" and that it "should take a day" to write suites of COM and UI tests. What can be done to counter this? Note: I'm not asking about how to promote automation. That isn't the problem. Automated testing and processes are being promoted and requested all the time here. The issue is that some individuals don't understand that automation is not "easy" nor is it "fast".
