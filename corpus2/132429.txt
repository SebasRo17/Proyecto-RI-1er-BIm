There exists an application that reports financial data of a bank to a national bank (all located in Europe). It is a legacy system that is written mainly in COBOL. Only the user interface is written in Java. The business logic is stored as complex data base tables and entries. Without knowing all internals, the system can hardly be changed according to new financial regulations. Thus, the current system is very hard to debug and unmaintainable. My aim is now to identify state-of-the art technologies/methods for a redesign and rewrite of the whole system. What would you consider as the three most important technologies to use for a rewrite of a COBOL System in finance? Current considerations include:   1. Using a DSL approach (domain specific language)   2. Using a modern programming language like Scala   3. MS OLAP cube (suggested by a colleague, not by me)
