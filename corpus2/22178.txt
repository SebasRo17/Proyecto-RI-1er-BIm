I've been able to connect to a Vertica database, and also been able to run a SELECT query. But I'm not being able to run a query with a backslash in it. (Vertica has commands like postgresql.) The command I'm trying to run is `\d;`. I've tried variations like below with a varying number of backslashes without success: `SQLExecute[conn, "\\\d;"]` What am I doing wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Edit: I should add that the error I'm getting is this: `JDBC::error: [Vertica][VJDBC](4856) ERROR: Syntax error at or near "\" >>`
