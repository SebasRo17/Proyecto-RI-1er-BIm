I'm having trouble solving this integral numerically:               Integrand2 :=  I/λ Holo[ξ, η] E^(I (2 π)/λ r)/r     ResultsTable2 = Table[NIntegrate[Integrand2, {ξ, -20, 20}, {η, -20, 20},           Method -> "MultidimensionalRule"], {x, -15, 15, 5}, {y, -15, 15, 5}]      The function called `Holo` is modelling an aperture that looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gE7Zo.jpg) To put it simply: I'm trying to do _Fresnel_ diffraction with this as the aperture. My goal is to get a 2D inverse _Fourier transform_ by summing over the entire `Holo` term (a function of `ξ` and `η`). As you can see from the image, it oscillates rapidly, so unless I integrate over a very small area of `ξ` and `η`, I get the following error: > NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one > of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly > oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small. To get a good 2D inverse _Fourier transform_ , I need to have a larger area. Ideally, integrating over 100 by 100 would be good. Is there some kind of method or work around that can make this happen? I can provide more details if needed. I'm new to _Mathematica_ and to this site, so any answer is appreciated. I can learn from any comments or suggestions you have :) EDIT: I guess to make my question a bit clearer: _how can I numerically integrate a 2D oscillating function?_
