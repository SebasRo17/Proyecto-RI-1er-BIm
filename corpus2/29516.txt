I have a problem with the Check Spelling in Mathematica, that I quite don't understand: If I try to use the Check Spelling on any notebook, the check just stop before the first word and in the field " **Reason for stopping:** " is written: " _The spelling dictionary file Mathematica.rws could not be loaded. The file may be corrupted._ " I found nothing about this on the Internet, but after a research on my computer I found that this file is at " _/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/SpellingDictionaries/English/Mathematica.rws_ " (I'm on Linux) There is also another directory called _SpellingDictionaries_ at _~/.Mathematica/SystemFiles/SpellingDictionaries_ , but it is empty. I tried by copying the content of the first directory in the second, but it doesn't work. I also tried to use another file _Mathematica.rws_ that I found in _/WINDOWS/Program Files/Wolfram Research/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/SpellingDictionaries_ on another computer (under Windows) that had Mathematica V8 (with which the check spelling worked). I doesn't work either. Can anyone help me ? I would really like to be able to use Mathematica to write my report.
