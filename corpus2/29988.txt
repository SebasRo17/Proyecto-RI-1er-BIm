Could anybody explain to me why the following code fails ?                Reap[      NMaximize[{x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2, 0.001 <= x1 <= 0.002,         0 <= x2 <= 0.002, 1 <= x3 <= 10, x3 \[Element] Integers }, {x1, x2,         x3}, Method -> "SimulatedAnnealing",        EvaluationMonitor :> Sow[{x1, x2, x3}]]      ]      In fact it outputs :               {{-\[Infinity], {x1 -> Indeterminate, x2 -> Indeterminate,         x3 -> Indeterminate}}, {}}      If i put x1's lower bound to 0 then it works but it uses only 0 values for x1 I suppose it has something to do with the integer x3. Thanks in advance.
