I get this error when trying to integrate a seemingly simple expression:               eradius = 2.8179403267*10^-15;     n = 10^-10/(1.6*10^-19);     gamma = 1600/0.511;     lb = 0.549267;     theta2 = 0.046892183133281855;     eta3 = -(theta1*lb) - (theta1*d);     rho2 = lb/theta2;          CSR3linear =        (0.22*eradius*n)/(gamma*rho2^(2/3)*(s/lb (sigma3end - sigma3beg) + sigma3beg)^(4/3));          kick3 = NIntegrate[(eta3 + s^2/(2 rho2))*CSR3linear, {s, 0, lb}] /.              {theta1 -> {0.06},               d -> {8.60435},              sigma3beg -> {1.300512*10^-004},              sigma3end -> {1.472289*10^-005}};      > NIntegrate::inumr: The integrand has evaluated to non-numerical values for > all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{0,0.549267}}. What am I doing wrong here? Also, the choice to have the parameters theta1, d sigma3beg and sigma3end as lists in the integration is because its actually a long list of numbers for each parameter (~20) that would take forever to input separately and record each output; would much prefer the solution to outputed in one list.
