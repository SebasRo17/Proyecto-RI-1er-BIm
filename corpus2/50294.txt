I have been asked to give a presentation to a non-technical audience on what Java technologies are currently being used in the enterprise world. The goal is to give this non-technical audience the background they need to understand what engineers are talking about. It's part of a broader series of talks that I'm giving. I'm primarily a .NET and C++ dev, so I thought I'd try to get some input from some Java devs. What technologies do you use? What Java related acronyms would you like to be able to use around non-coders? What would you like non-coders to understand about them?
