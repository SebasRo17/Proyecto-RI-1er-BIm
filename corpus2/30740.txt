After I modify and re-evaluate an expression, the new result doesn't replace the old one. Rather, what happens is that the old result gets pushed down and _Mathematica_ displays the current result at the top. It looks like this:               In[20] := (* expression *)     Out[20] = (* result *)     Out[19] = (* older result, when In[20] was In[19] *)     Out[18] = ...     ...etc      I'm pretty sure I messed up my preferences, but I can't revert to defaults, because I have another issure resolved (after trying for some time) and not sure exactly how I did it. Following old > If It Works, Don't Fix It So I'm reluctant to restore the default settings, the other (fixed) issue being far more important to me. ( _Mathematica_ 9 on Ubuntu 12)
