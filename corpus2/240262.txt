I hope this isn't too off-topic and/or opinion based. I'm looking for examples and reasons why Java is an acceptable language for education purposes. Here's why: I learned programming on my own in C at the age of about 15. In school we used Pascal (which I think is quite OK, especially in educational context). In University, Java was used and I was disgusted. Examples: Verbosity:               RenderingHints rh = new RenderingHints(          RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING,          RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);     g2.setRenderingHints(rh);      * * * Listener classes instead of functions. * * * No overloading (resulting in ugly `.equals()` and `.get()` instead of `==` and `[]`). * * * When I was able to pick a programming language on my own again, I chose Python and everything "felt just right". Now the problem is that I'm going to become a teacher for computer science in german secondary schools (grade 5-13), where I will be forced to teach Java. So I'm looking for the _pretty parts_ of Java. What is especially easy/readable/... to implement in Java? Preferably in an educational context, but also from a professional programmer's point of view.
