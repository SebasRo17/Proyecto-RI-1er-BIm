In two side by side panels, using LevelScheme, I output the same data using ListPlot. In the first panel I use option Joined-> **False** , while in the second Joined-> **True**. The data in the second panel is properly limited by the size of the panel, while in the first panel it goes beyond the panel limits. So, my question is: how to make objects being displayed be cut exactly by the size of the panel, if even explicitly specifying the PlotRange in ListPlots doesn't make any difference?               << "LevelScheme"`     Figure[{       Multipanel[{{0, 1}, {0, 1}}, {1, 2}, XGapSizes -> {.5}],            FigurePanel[{1, 1}, PlotRange -> {{0, 10}, {0, 1}}],       RawGraphics[        ListPlot[Table[{.1 x, Sinc[.1 x]}, {x, Range@200}],          PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}},Joined->False]        ],            FigurePanel[{1, 2}, PlotRange -> {{0, 10}, {0, 1}}],       RawGraphics[        ListPlot[Table[{.1 x, Sinc[.1 x]}, {x, Range@200}],          PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}, Joined -> True]        ]            },                PlotRange -> {{-0.1, 1.1}, {-0.1, 1.1}}]      results in ![result of the aforementioned code execution in Mathematica 9](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Mvs4.png)
