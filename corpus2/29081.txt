I seek advice regarding the constrained behaviour of the Locator: appears confined to square {0,0}->{1,1}. When I change starting position it snaps to this constrained region. The code I am referring to follows:               Manipulate[      Module[{cn, d}, cn = {c1, c2, c3};        d = Norm[# - pt] & /@ {c1, c2, c3};        Graphics[{{Black, Point[cn]},          MapThread[{#1, Circle[#2, #3]} &, {{Red, Green, Blue}, cn, d}]}]       ],      {pt, {1, 1}, ControlType -> Locator, LocatorRegion -> Full},      Initialization -> (c1 = {0, 0}; c2 = {3, 0}; c3 = {0, 3};)      ]      The constraint remains whether I define PlotRange, use `EuclideanDistance` or otherwise define the distance function. The following graphic shows (obviously) this is well defined outside the region of constraint of the `Locator`. Intersection point at {4,4}with fixed points at{0,0}, {1,0}, {0,1}. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CXlwI.jpg) Image generated by:               Graphics[{{Black, Point[cc = {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}}]}, {Red,         Point[{{4, 4}}]}, Map[Circle[#1, Norm[# - {4, 4}]] &, cc]}]      * * * I can get around the constraint using `Slider2D` but I am still uncertain about the Locator issue.               Manipulate[      Module[{cn, d}, cn = {c1, c2, c3};        d = Norm[# - pt] & /@ {c1, c2, c3};        Graphics[{{Black, Point[cn]}, {Red, PointSize[0.02], Point[pt]},          MapThread[{#1, Circle[#2, #3]} &, {{Red, Green, Blue}, cn, d}]},         PlotRange -> {{-5, 5}, {-5, 5}}]       ],      {pt, {-4, -4}, {4, 4}, ControlType -> Slider2D},      Initialization -> (c1 = {0, 0}; c2 = {1, 0}; c3 = {0, 1};)      ]      Thank you @Nasser I look forward to trying your code.
