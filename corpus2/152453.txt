In bash at least, `if` and `case` blocks are closed like this:               if some-expr     then         echo "hello world"     fi          case $some-var in     [1-5])         do-a-thing         ;;     *)         do-another-thing     esac      as opposed to the more typical close of `end` or `endif`/`endcase`. As far as I know, this rather funny convention is unique to shell scripting and I have never seen such an odd block terminator anywhere else. Sometimes things like this have an origin in another language (like Ruby's `elsif` coming from Perl), or a strange justification. Does this feature of shell scripting have a story behind it? Is it found in other languages?
