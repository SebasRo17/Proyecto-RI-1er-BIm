many people say that html/css is something easy, it looks easy at first sight but when i worked on some projects i noticed that :   * same value works differently depending on other properties and on the targeted element.   * we need to know default values that browser affect to every property in every element.   * we can't be sure how the page will be rendered until we test, even if we are experts.   * we can't say we really know html/css until we know the algorithm used by the rendering engine and it's a huge responsibility for the engine to work with such complicated recursive layout. shortly, i have worked on desktop & web development for about 3 years and i have never seen such complicated thing to learn (html/css) **question :** Is html/css really hard to master ?
