What tools exist to facilitate pair programming with Visual Studio when the programmers are not in the same physical location? At the moment we are thinking voice (Skype?) plus remote desktop (VNC? TeamViewer?), but it would be good to know of other suggestions and experiences. Also, is there anything more integrated with Visual Studio? A bit more background: we are two experienced developers with who have collaborated well for a long time on a large mature project (ASP.NET, Windows Forms and SQL Server). However we are not usually working on the same part of the code base at the same time. We intend to spend some weeks doing substantial refactoring and it would be ideal if we were able to do this work with a pair-programming approach.
