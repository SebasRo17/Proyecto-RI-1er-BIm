I was selling a library/framework/tool to companies. Licensing the binaries. Now I got a full-time-job. Haven't started yet, but will start soon. And I just got a request for quote from a company in the same industry as my new employer. Not direct competitors, but same industry. Is it ok for me to license my software to them? Or this will put me in trouble with my soon-to-be employer? I don't think asking the company is even appropriate at this time. They are giving me a job to work for them, not to ask if I can sell my software on the side. No idea what to do. Any recommendations?
