So I think the following image already shows the problem, similar to Avoiding white lines inside filled area in RegionPlot exported as PDF or PS the pdf export of the chart creates thin lines in the plot.

Disabling the Antialiasing doesnt improves the situation! ![BarChart3D](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7yv57.png)
