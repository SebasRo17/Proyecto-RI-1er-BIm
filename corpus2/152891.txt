> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Do people in non-English-speaking countries code in English? I know that there are non-English based languages out there, where keywords are in some other tongue, but popular languages are in English. However, if you're a non-native English speaker, developing for a non-English market, do you use your native language when naming functions, classes, variables, etc.? If you do, what kind of morphology do you adopt? For example, functions are often named with verbs (e.g., `buildData`), would you use the imperative form -- if your language has one -- in the name (e.g., `construisciDati` in Italian)? A related question: For users of non-Latin writing systems and languages that support Unicode naming, do you make use of it or stick with romanisation? e.g., `建造数据`, for our `buildData` example in [Googled] Mandarin.
