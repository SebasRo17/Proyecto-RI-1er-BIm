I want to do a series expansion of an expression containing `Gamma` functions with specific arguments. An example is the following:               Series[Gamma[I p/x + z /x], {x, 0, 0}, Assumptions -> {x > 0, p > 0, z > 0}]          (* (2^-Floor[1/2 + Arg[(I p)/x + z/x]/(2 π)]) ... *)      The result then depends on expressions containing Floor functions:                Floor[1/2 + Arg[(I p)/x + z/x]/(2 π)]      However, because I am assuming all variables to be positive (and nonzero) the Arg[] will not return any values outside the open interval (-π/2, π/2). Therefore, the `Floor` expresisons should simplify to just 0. Now I would like to know how I can get _Mathematica_ to do this simplification automatically. Maybe this is something that can be done by adding rules to `FullSimplify` with the option `TransformationFunctions`?
