Making new inheritance hierarchy with the help of C++ I think about: > Why there is no inheritance from the class objects? Abstract example (on > abstract C++): >   >   >     struct Foo { int v; Foo(int a) : v(a) {} }; >     struct Buz : public Foo(2) { ... } >   > > So, the `Buz` is inherited only from instance of `Foo` \- `Foo(2)`. Can such idea be useful? Is there any possible implementations or related ideas?
