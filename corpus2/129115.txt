I'd like to hear some ideas how to sync calendar events. Say I have two calendars having fields (id, title, start, end, updated, location and description). I'm struggling with starting point. Its easy if all events are new and not overlapping with each other. But say I already have events on calendars, some are supposedly same events, some are separate events, some maybe same events, but their attributes have changed, like location, title, start and end time. How would you actually make sync between calendars with reasonable smart functionality?
