Similar to my question about easily spotted warning signs in code I think sometimes comments programmers make can tell you quite a lot (of not good things) about them in a short period of time. The scariest I've heard recently (from a senior) is: > I could use source control, but it'd slow me down Also, although not in the same category when I see something listed at the top of someone's CV and I ask them about it: > Oh, I didn't really use that but I was just in the same room as people using > it. Duh! Then why is it featured prominently on your CV??? Finally I quite often interview people with what looks like an excellent set of skills on paper. Sometimes these are excellent developers, but some of them when asked about a topic will rattle through a dictionary definition like a machine gun (and probably a better definition than I would be able to say if put on the spot like that). Then when asked to explain even really, really simple things to do with that topic are totally unable to (usually coming up with something totally wrong, followed by a repeat of the dictionary definition). I suspect that these are developers who have been in teams where they're not treated well and so have had no opportunity to act independently - which results in their learning being very superficial. What other things have you heard that tell you that a programmer is, er, let's try and think of a nice way of saying this...still taking the first steps towards being great?
