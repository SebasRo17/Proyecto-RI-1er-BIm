Is there a "modern" bison and flex equivalent which does not require the JVM or .NET or similar "heavy" runtimes? Thanks for comments, edit: By modern, I mean for example Antlr and another one in Java I saw but forgot the name of. (I know that for instance Antlr has a C target, but I am toying with the idea of embedding the compiler generator _inside my own program_ and Java would be very impractical for me.)
