In my organization when we move a task to the "Done" column we write the number of hours it took to complete the task. It can be useful when during retrospective the team tries to understand why certain stories took longer to implement than anticipated. However it is also burdensome and developers feel somewhat micromanaged or stressed when they have to do this. What do you do in your teams? What do you recommend?
