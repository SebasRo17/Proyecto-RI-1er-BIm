When I build a simple website, e.g. a contact book where I can add, delete and update contacts, I create an `index.php` file where a user, if he's not logged in, is requested to enter a password and if he enters the right password, he's assigned a session and can do certain things with the contacts. I have two files:   1. The first (`contacts.php`) is for the HTML code to be shown. Above the HTML code I include the second file and create the class.   2. The second (`contacts_class.php`) contains all methods for adding, deleting and updating. I think that's ok, but when it comes to implement a big project, how should I do it? Do I have to create folders for every page and put files in them (like above, HTML and class), and how should I do it? What is a good and neat architecture for building large projects that every other programmer would understand perfectly?
