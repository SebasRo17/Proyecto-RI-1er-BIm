I'm always trying to find new methods on development. So I looked into some websites and analyzed their ways of presentation.   1. Returning part of the page using AJAX Normally I will use an array to return values, for example:               //GET User details           $user_id = $_POST['user_id'];           $user_details = $this->get_user($user_id);           if ($user_details['status'] == true) {          exit(json_encode(array('status'=>true, 'data'=>$user_details['data'])));      } else {          exit(json_encode(array('status'=>false, 'reason'=>'SomeReasons....')));      }       But I see that some sites returning `HTML'. Is this preferable in any reason? Also what is the best method to use: `AJAX` or an `iframe`?
