I need to add an EULA to my (commercial) software but I cannot afford a lawyer. Also I had a look at various EULA examples on the internet but they are all for specific software or countries, and are probably copied from other commercial software. So I'm thinking about using a short custom EULA which would just mention the essential. Something like:   * You may redistribute the trial version of this software   * If you buy a license, you may not redistribute it or sell it   * You may not sue me for any financial or material loss arising from the use of this software   * This software is copyright XXX, all rights reserved. Would that kind of EULA protect me in most cases? Also do you know of any company that use short EULA?
