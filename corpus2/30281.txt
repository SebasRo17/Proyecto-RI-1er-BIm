I would like to know if it's possible to use/install this java library on Mathematica. This library, named SimMetrics, has a lot of string similarity functions that I would like to test. Here is the list of functions: > Levenstein, NeedlemanWunch, SmithWaterman, SmithWatermanGotoh, > SmithWatermanGotohWindowedAffine, Jaro, JaroWinkler, ChapmanLengthDeviation, > ChapmanMeanLength, QGramsDistance, BlockDistance, CosineSimilarity, > DiceSimilarity, EuclideanDistance, JaccardSimilarity, MatchingCoefficient, > MongeElkan, OverlapCoefficient. I have no knowledge on Java and use a MAC. A thought in Leonid Java Reloader, but it's a complete .jar file, not a small class. ## Update I download the simmetrics_jar_v1_6_2_d07_02_07.jar from the link above, saved it on notebook directory and tryed:               Needs["JLink`"]     ReinstallJava[ClassPath->"/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/:"<>NotebookDirectory[]<>"simmetrics_jar_v1_6_2_d07_02_07.jar"]          Now I have to use LoadJavaClass? How can a list the available classes? If I unzip the .jar file, the classes are inside this folder: uk/ac/shef/wit/simmetrics/similaritymetrics/ for example: Levenshtein.class
