What was the first program that was created as a dedicated IDE? That is, purpose built for coding, rather than simply allowing integration as part of its expansion options. This is opposed to a text editor that has generic plugin/add-in/shell features that are were not dedicated to development work. The features I am thinking about that would qualify an editor as an IDE:   * Code highlighting   * Integrated compiler invocation (with error reporting)   * Code navigation features   * (optionally) integrated debugger Sub question - what was the first Visual IDE? (by which I mean with an integrated GUI designer).
