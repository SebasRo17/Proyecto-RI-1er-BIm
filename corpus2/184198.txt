my question is rather short: How do I document typescript code properly? I found out that for projects becoming bigger and bigger, it is important to look at a function and immediately know parameters, what it returns and side-effects etc. It is tiring to have just a bunch of comments before a function, most of the time these 'blocks' even look differently in style. What I am looking for is a documentation tool like javadoc or doxygen for typescript. Is there anything out there? Or is it possible to 'abuse' a documentation tool and get it to work with typescript?
