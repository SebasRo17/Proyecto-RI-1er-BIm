I'm going to start developing an app for my job, and I would like to know what is the best approach. The app will be a basic tracker for some application that we have, and since our employers uses both Android and Apple phones I don't want to develop the app twice just so it could work on both platforms. Is it worth developing an HTML5 app that could work on all the devices or should I use some the frameworks like appcelerator? Are there strong pros and cons for either approach?
