When I create a `Graphics3D`, I often want to place an object right at the centre of the box. Initially I thought that the centre was specified by `{0, 0, 0}`, but I soon realised that this is actually the corner. I've realised that I can find the centre by dividing the dimensions of the box in half. For example if               PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 100}, {0, 100}}      then if I want to put my `Sphere` dead centre I'll put it at:               Sphere[{100/2, 100/2, 100/2, 1]      This is all very well if I explicitly know the dimensions of the box, but if I don't know the `PlotRange`, how can I ensure that my object is placed right at the centre? Is there a way to tell the size of the `PlotRange` if you haven't specified it explicitly? For example, consider this function:               balls = Table[Sphere[RandomReal[{0, 100}, 3], 1], {50}]~        Join~{Sphere[{50, 50, 50}, .05]};     Manipulate[      Graphics3D[       balls,       ViewPoint -> {1.3*10^-zoom, -2.4*10^-zoom, 2*10^-zoom},        SphericalRegion -> True,        PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 100}, {0, 100}}],      {zoom, 0, 3}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V2XzR.png) The slider controls the zoom, which in this function zooms in all the way until you hit a very small sphere. For this to work though, the sphere needs to be precisely at the centre of the plot. To ensure this precision, I manually entered the size of the plot (`PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 100}, {0, 100}}`), as well as manually control the placement of the middle sphere (`Sphere[{50, 50, 50}, .05]`). Is there a way to make sure that this sphere is placed right at the very centre of the box without needing to manually specify either the dimensions of the `PlotRange` or the coordinates of the centre sphere? I hope this clarifies what I'm trying to get at.
