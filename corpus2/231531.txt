In this slideshow on slide 26 it mentions ORM as an example of message coupling. How is that so? With an ORM, certain code will call the ORM via an API, but that sounds like "control coupling". Also the ORM's api will take parameters to specify what you want, but that sounds like data coupling. How is ORM an example of message coupling? maybe other examples of message coupling will help me understand.
