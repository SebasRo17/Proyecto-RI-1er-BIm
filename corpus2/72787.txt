Everybody knows that well-documented software development leads to success. However, it usually means that not only plain text but also binary content will be involved in the document, such as a UML diagram. And I've heard many people say that. The version control system is not the appropriate place for the binary files. I totally understand and agree with the issue. I asked several seasoned developers where the best place to store documents should be and the answer I got was "wiki". Wiki is good but I considered another potential issue. How can the source code which has been stored in a version control system connect to its related document in wiki? Let's say someone clones the repository of git or mercurial. How can he/she find the document easily? Or have I just missed something? **Updated:**   I know some wiki systems have the ability to integrate with source control systems. But my concern is not about the ability of integration. If you have cloned source code from a git repository and after a while you get on a train and want to continue to work offline on the train (which is a big feature of DVCS). Then you suddenly realize you don't have any access to document since you are working offline on the train. On the other hand, if the document was stored in git repository you would have access to the document with repository cloned.
