As the size of my data and the structures I use to hold it get larger and more complex, I start to wonder if I should learn to use sql databases. In the past, instead of unique tables, I would do something like the following:               'class Dog            String name            Toy[] toys            long  numberOfHairs            short numberOfFlees            etc.      Then I might have a sorted array based on numberOfFlees, a hash of names, a set of toys, etc. to suit my needs. This has worked fine for me with smaller projects, but at what point should I consider SQL. What will I lose and gain?
