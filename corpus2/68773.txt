It seems to me that most consulting firms do little more than match resumes to positions, typically with insightful criteria such as "X years experience in technologies Y and Z." But there are also some consulting firms that attempt to find talented developers and invest in them. And rather than simply providing staff augmentation, they either partner with a client to accomplish a project, or supply the entire team. How can you effectively (and quickly) determine which is which? Since no one advertises themselves as a "body shop," how do you find and pursue the firm that is actually looking for good developers, and not just resumes? Is there a Joel test for consulting firms? One that can be applied before you are hired? I'm asking as a potential employee here.
