Are there any open source projects out there that are written in C++ in an agile way (TDD maybe?). I am trying to contribute to a C++ open source project in order to catch up with the language and I am not sure where to look for since the language is no longer mainstream amongst the hipsters :P **Edit** : I don't think I made myself clear (sorry about this, English is not my native language) - I want to contribute to an open source project written in C++ which follows TDD rules and such, not TDD frameworks implemented in C++ (though that might be an option).
