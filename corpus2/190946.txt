I was here programming in iOS with a class that's available only for iOS 6, and I was wondering: why should I implement my app to handle multiple operating systems when my app will be distributed by Apple through the App Store, and so they could just include/install whatever iOS source needed for my app? In the old days updates to the operating systems came through CDs, and so it made sense that programmers could not expect everybody to have the latest OS, and that OS updates had to be clumped together into major releases and be few and far between. But in the age of the internet, and especially on iOS where both the user and the software developers are forced to buy and sell apps through the App Store, shouldn't we just expect the new APIs to be downloaded on the background when installing new apps? and changed to the OS to happen incrementally rather than in major releases?
