If I am subcontracting from a company. Am I able to claim the work as if I were doing for the client themselves. In other words.... if Client A ask Company A to do some web development. and Company A sub contracts out to Company B. Can Company B claim they did work for Client A. Or must they say they did work for Company A ? I am building my site and I want to release all the work I did for 1 company who subcontracted me. but I dont want to get into any legal issues.
