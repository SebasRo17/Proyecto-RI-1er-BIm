Sometimes there are different ways to ask a user the same question. For example, if the user tries to exit a program without saving their file, you can ask either of these questions:   * Are you sure you want to exit without saving? `[Y] [N]`   * Do you want to save before exiting? `[Y] [N]` These are essentially the same question, but because of the different wording, they have **opposite** answers. This raises some questions on which is better to use like which is which is clearer? which reduces mistakes? and so on. Iâ€™m wondering if there are any studies, statistics, or experimental research, clinical trials, etc. on these sorts of things that can help design UI/UX to minimize user frustration and errors. I know there are papers and books on designing user interfaces, but I have not seen anything specifically about specific wording, deciding between positive and negative responses, and such like with the above prompt example.
