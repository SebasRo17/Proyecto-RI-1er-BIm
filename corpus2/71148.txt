Why do many open source projects collaborate primarily through mailing lists rather than through, say, forums? I may be ignorant in my assessment, but I, along with my communication teacher, think mailing lists are rather inefficient:   * It's hard to reference old messages. You have to wait until an archiving site picks up the message you want to link to, then look it up.   * It's hard to reply to messages you haven't received from subscription, since you have to manually copy the sender and message contents.   * It's impossible to moderate threads of discussion. Posts cannot be deleted or modified without supernatural powers.   * It's tricky to keep threads together (namely, to ensure all participants in the conversation are copied/replied to).   * It's tricky for users to participate in multiple high-volume mailing lists, as they have to subscribe and set up filters (or just be really involved). What _real_ edge do mailing lists have that didn't occur to me?
