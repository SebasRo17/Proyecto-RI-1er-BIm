I have a matrix:               A = {{a, b}, {c, d}}      But each its element, itself, is another matrix too.               a={{0,1,1},{0,1,0}}     b={{0,0,1},{1,0,0}}          c={{0,0,0},{0,1,0}}     d={{0,0,1},{1,0,1}}      I want to comprise 'a' and 'b' with their elements; and respectively 'c' and 'd'. If just one element be similar in 'a' and 'b' and simultaneously equal to '1', (here:)               a13=b13=1      the 'b' element of 'A' must be replaced with zero. (here A12=0). Question1:   For the comparison I write bellow line, I Do not know which must be written in the A['indexes referring to location of b'] in this line:               Do[If[a[[i, j]] == b[[k, m]], A['indexes referring to location of b'] = 0], {i, 1, 2}, {j, 1,3}, {k, 1, 2}, {m, 1, 3}]      Question2: All of us know each element of a matrix has two indexes {i and j; for example Aij}. are there any possibility to devote four indexes to a one element of a Matrix(for example Aijkm? Actually, if we can devote four indexes to each A element in the above 'Do' loop, the line will be written more easily. Question3: if instead of 'a','b', 'c' and 'd' we have numerics:               A = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}      Are the any possibility to devote a matrix to numeric!!!!!!? For example               1={{0,1,1},{0,1,0}}     2={{0,0,1},{1,0,0}}      !!
