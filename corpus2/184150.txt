I am reading the C# specification. I could use clarification on a segment: > C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such > as int and double, inherit from a single root object type. Thus, all types > share a set of common operations, and values of any type can be stored, > transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. Furthermore, C# > supports both user-defined reference types and value types, allowing dynamic > allocation of objects as well as in-line storage of lightweight structures. What does “in-line storage of lightweight structures” mean in this context?
