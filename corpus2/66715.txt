It looks like _K &R "C Programming Language (2nd Edition)"_ covers ANSI C, but another book that I'm starting ( _Stephen G. Kochan "Programming in C"_) says that it uses C99. I'm coming from a C#/JavaScript/Python/PHP/Java background and looking to round out my skills. I'm currently using GCC, but I'm curious about Clang. Which version is used more in new and existing code? Does it even matter, or should I learn both?
