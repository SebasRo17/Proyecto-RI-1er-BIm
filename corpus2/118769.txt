I'm simulating a double click programmatically and I want to have a slight pause between both clicks in order to better simulate a real user. I know the interval should be less than `GetDoubleClickTime` but am not sure what would be a good time to choose. Does anyone know of any data on how fast a typical person performs a double-click? I was thinking in the direction `GetDoubleClickTime()/3` but of course the magic number seems a bit iffy.
