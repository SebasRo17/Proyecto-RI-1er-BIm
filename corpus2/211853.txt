I'm working on a simple piece of functionality (actually a ruby gem, but that is beside the point) which can be used to   * receive and persist incoming messages   * send and persist outgoing messages   * supplies a hook to the implementing code for performing some action based on a received message. Could for example send a reply, but also perform other actions. I'm struggling to find a short and concise name for this functionality. Does this bare resemblance to any named patterns, and if so which? ******* UPDATE ******* To be more specific, what I am actually doing here is receiving and sending SMS. Starting to wonder if perhaps the most appropriate name for this functionality would be an SMS dispatcher. From the Dispatcher page on wikipedia (although it has nothing to do with computing): > Dispatchers are communications personnel responsible for receiving and > transmitting pure and reliable messages Or would using the dispatcher name for this concept cause confusion with other design patterns?
