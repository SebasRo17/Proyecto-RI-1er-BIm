Generally for a javascript application, compatibility is mentioned in terms of browser types and browser versions it supports. Frameworks/Libraries like ExtJs also mention about the browser versions they are compatible with. **Does this mean that if my javascript application can run on Google Chrome 10+ version, then any operating system where Google Chrome 10+ can be installed will be able to run my javascript application without any glitches?** Or does type of operating system also have an effect on Javascript execution? The reason behind asking this is to evaluate the scope of testing of javascript applications before making any commitment to the end user. Thanks in advance for any guidance provided.
