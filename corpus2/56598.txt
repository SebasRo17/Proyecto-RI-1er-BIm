So, I think the problem that Im having is simple but, still, Im not sure on how to do it. I have an equation with no analitical solution: $a_1 \sin \left(2 \theta \right)+a_2 \sin \left(2 \phi\right)+a_3 \cos \left(2 \theta\right)+a_4 \cos \left(2 \phi\right)=a_5$ where $a_i$ are just numbers which are not relevant to the discussion. This equation has numerical solutions, what I need is a list $\{\theta,\phi\}$ that satisfy this equation. What would be the best way to do this? Any help will be greatly appreciated.
