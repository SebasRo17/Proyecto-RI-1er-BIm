This topic has been discussed in this post: Customizing configuration with Dependency Injection However - I couldn't find one for PHP syntax and since one of the answers was to use a specific ASP.net container - I couldn't correlate. I currently have a static class App\Config - that injects itself with a long array of configuration. the array is nothing more than array('max_select' => '10'); and other breakdowns for different objects to be initialize. Would Laravel's IoC be useful to chop this up? If so - how would I do so? Laravel code would be: `$app->make('MyClassA');` However I don't know how to correlate.
