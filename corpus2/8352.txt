I really like using `ClassNames` and `memberNames` as convention but I am not sure how I would name the file containing a class. I like making my classes defined in a file with the exact same name as the class. But I also like making php files all lowercase. So I am conflicted. If I have a class called `ProductGroup` should that be defined in `ProductGroup.php`, `productgroup.php`, or `product_group.php`? I know there is no right answer, so I am looking for what is most common or your opinion of which to use.. which do you use?
