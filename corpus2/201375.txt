People often give me the "divide and conquer" tip, but I think for some problems it's not nearly enough. The problem with such a complex problem as the Hanoi Tower problem is that you can't even simulate or abstract parts of the problems even if you divide it into parts if you know what I mean. So, can anyone give me a step-by-step approach in tackling such a complex and difficult problem?
