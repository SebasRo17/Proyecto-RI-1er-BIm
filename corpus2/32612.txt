**Q1** : I have a page of printed text file, but it was cut by a paper shredder (from top to bottom). You can download all the paper fragment here. There are some examples of them. How can I reconstruct it? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GscbS.png) **Q2** : This time, the situation is even worse - the page was cut by a shredder twice (from top to bottom and from left to right) ! Download Link. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h9Ldw.png) My code for **Q1** :               filenames = FileNames["*.bmp", "C:\\Users\\Liao\\Desktop\\B\\file1"];     pics = Import /@ filenames;     binarypic = Binarize[#, 0.9] & /@ pics;     binarydata = ImageData /@ binarypic;     leftandrightdata =      MapIndexed[{#2[[1]], #1[[All, 1]], #1[[All, -1]]} &, binarydata];     result = {};     firstPic = Select[leftandrightdata, ! MemberQ[#[[2]], 0] &][[1, 1]];     start = leftandrightdata[[firstPic]];     DeleteCases[leftandrightdata, start] //.            x_ /; Length[x] > 0 :> (sort =         SortBy[x, HammingDistance[#[[2]], start[[3]]] &];          AppendTo[result, start = sort[[1]]]; Rest[sort]);     Extract[pics,      Prepend[List /@ result[[All, 1]], {firstPic}]] // ImageAssemble      This code maybe dizzy for you, but it doesn't matter. The core idea is simple and straightforward, which use `HammingDistance` to determing whether two images can be combined together. But for **Q2** , I can't really find a good way to solve it.
