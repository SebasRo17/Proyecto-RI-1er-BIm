Is there any way to make the edges of a GraphPlot black without tediously writing out a long "EdgeRenderingFunction"? I guess you could ask the same kind of question about vertex labeling. For example, if I write `EdgeRenderingFunction -> ({Black, Arrow[#1, 0.1]} &)` I don't even get the standard directed edges, I get "arrows". How do I just turn the standard directed edges black (instead of the default red)?
