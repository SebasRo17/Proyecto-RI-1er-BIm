In my earlier days of programming, I was using Visual Basic for learning. It taught me many concepts, and I was able to make some cool programs (in my opinion, anyways...). I have expanded my horizon to basic C/C++, PHP, and MySQL. One of my most favourite projects, I want to turn into a multi-platfrom (for x86/x64) windowed application, and have it open source. I decided on the license already, but I want to know, before I start developing in a new language, how can I choose which language to use, that is multi-platform, and allows for windows to be created? I do not wish to use web technologies, as the application will work with lots of local files at a time. This is **not** a question about which technology is better, but about which one would be useful for this project. I know something has to be possible, because there are apps that run as Mac OSX binaries, Windows binaries, and even Linux binaries, all in windows (i.e. VLC Media Player, Firefox (Ice Wheazel), etc)
