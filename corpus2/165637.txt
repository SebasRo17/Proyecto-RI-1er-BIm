I've to read a big XML file with a lot of information. Afterwards I extract the needed information (~20 Points(columns) / ~80 relevant Data (rows, some of them with subdatasets) and write them out in a Excel File. My Question is how to handle the extraction (of unused Data) part,   * should I copy the whole file and delete the unused parts, and then write it to excel   * or is it a good approach to create Objects for each column?   * should I write the whole xml to excel and start to delete rows in excel? What would be performant and a acceptable solution?
