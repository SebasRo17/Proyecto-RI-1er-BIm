I have a catenary curve in Mathematica, and I wanted to add a variator (dimmer) with `Manipulate`, so that the user can modify the value of the x/y-coordinate of the hanging-points `A`, `B` and the point `C` on the curve. With my current code, I can just modify these values with the locator, but I can't see the current value and cannot set one directly. Is there a solution, so that I delete the rest of the curve, the part above the hanging-points `A` and `B`? Here is my code till now:               catenary[x_] := a*Cosh[(x - c)/a] + y          m = Manipulate[Module[{root},          (root = FindRoot[catenary[#[[1]]] == #[[2]] & /@ pt, {{y, 0}, {c, 0}, {a, 1}}];          Show[             Plot[catenary[x] /. root, {x, -2, 2}, PlotRange -> {-3, 3}, AspectRatio -> 3/2],              Graphics[{Red, Point[pt]}]])         ],          {{pt, {{-1, 1}, {1, 1}, {0, 0}}}, Locator}     ]
