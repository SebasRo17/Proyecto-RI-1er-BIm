I am wondering what is the correct function in Mathematica to plot the true impulse function, better known as the `DiracDelta[]` function. When using this inside of a function or just the function itself when plotting, it renders output = zero. Quick example:               Plot[DiracDelta[x], {x,-1,1}]      I am wondering, is this the correct delta function which is infinite in height at zero and zero everywhere else. I have seen other functions such as `KroneckerDelta[]`, but this seems to do the same exact thing. The code is below:               eqn1wb := (2 ((I Pi f) Exp[(-I) 2 Pi f]) ((1/2) DiracDelta[f-2] +                DiracDelta[f+2]))/(1 + I 2 Pi f);      wb1 = Plot[Re[eqn1wb], {f, -5, 5},      PlotRange :> All, PlotStyle :> {Thick, Red},     AspectRatio :> 1,     GridLines :> {{-4, -2, 2, 4}, {1.0, 0.5, -0.5, -1.0}},      PlotLabel :> "Re(w) - Frequency Response",      AxesLabel :> {"f", "W(f)"}     ]
