Earlier I asked a question about "Entity Framework and layer seperation" and found out that some people use a ViewModel to show their data in the UI. For example if we got a "Person" table and an "Address" table and I want to show a combination of the two tables. I would then create a ViewModel, lets call it PersonAddress, and show it on the UI. I have a few questions regarding this:   1. How do you best save the "PersonAddress" object to the database since it does not exist in my EF context?   2. If I only wanted to show the "Person" object, would I still create an identical "ViewModel" object to the one EF creates for me (without the EF specific properties ofcourse)   3. Do people use the "EntityState" property and dosent it become useless if you only interact with the "ViewModel"?
