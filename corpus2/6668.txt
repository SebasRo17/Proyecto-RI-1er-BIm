Some of my 2-dimensional data are displayed with a code similar to this:               Needs["PlotLegends`"]     sampleData =      Transpose[{RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 3*10^-6], 20000],      RandomVariate [NormalDistribution[0, 3*10^-6], 20000]}];      binning = {{-1*10^-5, 1*10^-5, 1*10^-7}, {-1*10^-5, 1*10^-5,1*10^-7}};     (*binning of my sampleData*)     maxBinnedData=Max[HistogramList[sampleData,binning][[2]]];     (*seachring for the maximum of the binned data*)     ShowLegend[DensityHistogram[sampleData,binning,LabelingFunction->None,     PerformanceGoal->"Speed",      ColorFunction->(If[1-#1===0,White,ColorData["Rainbow"][#1]]&),     ColorFunctionScaling->True,PlotRange->{{-1*10^-5, 1*10^-5},{-1*10^-5, 1*10^-5}},      FrameLabel->{"x", "y"},     LabelStyle->Directive[Black,FontSize->12,FontFamily->"Arial"],ImageSize->{500,500}],{(If[1-#1===0,White,ColorData["Rainbow"][1-#1]]&),11,     ToString[maxBinnedData],ToString[0],LegendTextOffset->{-2, 0},     LegendPosition->{1.1,-0.4},LegendShadow->None,     LegendLabel->Style["Counts",Black,FontSize->12,FontFamily->"Arial"]}]      The output is quite nice for my taste (see figure).![Output of my code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uk3zH.png) Yet, I want to improve two things, but all my attempts have been unsuccessfully so far. First: How can I manage that the ticks are all in scientific form (e.g. $1.0\times10^{-5}$ instead of 0.00001)? Somehow I was not able to adapt the tricks of e.g. this post to my problem. I could do it perhaps by hand, but the scale is often different (e.g. from $-2.4 \times 10^{-5}$ to $4.0 \times 10^{-6}$) so that this will be unhandy. Second: As perhaps can be seen, I try to use for all names and numbers the `FontSize->12` and the `FontFamily->“Arial”`. That works fine except for the numbers in my legend (0 and 20). How do I have to change the font setting there? I tried things like `Style[ToString[maxBinnedData], Black, FontSize -> 12, FontFamily -> "Arial"]` instead of `ToString[maxBinnedData]` but nothing worked. I would be happy if some people here could give me some hints!
