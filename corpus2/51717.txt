I noticed the following strange behaviour: Let us first define an array of functions                   g[k_] := {Sin[k], 2*Sin[k]}         gg = g[k]      When I plot this array of functions with                   DiscretePlot[{Sin[k], 2 Sin[k]}, {k, 1, 50}]      each of the two sets of points have a different colour. But, both                   DiscretePlot[gg, {k, 1, 50}]      and                   DiscretePlot[g[k], {k, 1, 50}]      show the two sets of points in blue. I am more interested in the second case, because should the array of functions be large, it is more comfortable to use the definitions like `g` and `gg` given above. But I want to preserve the different colours. How do I do that?
