I have this idea that I want to build. I want to start the idea as a web-app, then move into mobile-app and possible desktop application. The project should have databases (mostly strings). Also users would have accounts and access to these databases. So the project provides access to the user-resources through the Internet. I want the database easily accessible through different platforms. The project is also to sharpen my IT, so I don't want the easy road, but the better one.   * What are my best options of frameworks/skills?   * Good tools to manage the project?   * Is starting as a web-app a good choice, or should I build it as a mobile-app first? I have some knowledge (but not a lot of experience) in: C, C++, Java, PHP, Javascript, MySQL, HTML/CSS. Edit: I know that my question is too general, all I wanted is some ideas and guiding to have a good start. @Nathan Taylor, regarding the web-app, I don't mind any option (should I learn Python, or stick with php in this regard)? I'll probably implement the project in Android, and possibly iPhone.
