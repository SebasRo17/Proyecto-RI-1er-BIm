My top level state machine has some states and edges. I will call this the parent state machine.               A ----> B ----> C      Any state within the parent state machine can be a state machine too. I will call these children state machines.                          ___________              /            \     A ----> |  B0->B1->B2  | ----> C              \____________/      If the parent state machine transitions from A to B, B's state machine takes over. Once B is done running, how should it relinquish control to the parent state machine and transition to state C? Which design pattern do you use? If you're wondering, I have children state machines within parent state machines because my exact project is quite complex and it is natural to encapsulate the internal workings of a child state.
