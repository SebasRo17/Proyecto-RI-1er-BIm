I really like when the programs or editors I use have pleasant colors. Sometimes when there's nothing else to do or sometimes when there are very important, but incredibly boring things to do, I find myself tweaking color and font settings to make everything as comfortable as possible for me. This was one reason why I asked this question some time ago and it is the reason why I really appreciate people like Ethan Schoonover who invented the solorized color palette. Although his colors are nice, you cannot always use them because sometimes your IDE has maybe a _color basis_ you would like to keep because icons and buttons work nice with it. This is the case with the new Dracula theme of IDEA. Below is a screenshot of a method. Although the colors look good, there are details which I don't like   * The annotations (@Nullable) are too bright and the greenish yellow is ugly   * The method name is a bit too bright   * The green and red background selection is too colorful for my taste   * Finally, the normal font-color is a bit too bright to be calming.  ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nx0vQ.png) **Question:** Can we use _Mathematica_ (and mathmatics) to create a custom set of colors   * which can be integrated into an existing color environment   * which play nicely together   * where no color catches all attention
