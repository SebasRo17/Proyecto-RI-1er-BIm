I'm setting up some requirements for a software extension and try to use user stories to describe what I want to achieve. > As a creator I want to add a new entry, to let users access it through the > main page. I have the idea of adding an entry via Drag&Drop. My company has some guidelines, to have every command always available via context menu and ribbon. Should I split up my origin story into separate actions?   * As a creator I want to drag a new entry onto the main page, to let users access it.   * As a creator I want to create a new entry on the main page via ribbon, to let users access it.   * As a creator I want to create a new entry on the main page via context menu, to let users access it. That approach would result in at least three user stories per feature what won't feel comfortable to me. I could add these expectations during the discussion, but then it seems like giving a "way-to-follow" for developers. So how would I ensure that the required quality/user experience is achieved?
