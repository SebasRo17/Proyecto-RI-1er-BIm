IS MVVM getting any kind of traction outside the Microsoft community? Within Silverlight this is a non-issue, but for other technologies, like JavaScript it surely is: For instance Knockout.js is a great framework, but the 'rest of the world' seems to be on a Backbone path. My concern is that MVVM frameworks (like Knockout) are going to suffer a lack of network effect by being constrained to the Microsoft ecosystem, and thus fall behind compared to the rest.
