I saw a company is using BusyBox and also using Gpl + Lgpl + Mpl packages on it, and then they have there own application running on it. Their application is a closed source package. You buy the device but its closed source. How come GPL mixed with LGPL+MPL becomes closed source? I thought the rule is?? Or I am wrong or this following info is wrong?: > GPL: If you use it in your application then you must release your > application under the GPL. That doesn't mean you can't also sell it (like > they sell Linux CD's) but you must also release the source code for free. > That might work for you, but probably not. > > LGPL: If you use it in your application then you can still have a closed > source proprietary licensed application. But if you modify the LGPL library > then you must release your modifications under the LGPL, even though your > application can remain closed source.
