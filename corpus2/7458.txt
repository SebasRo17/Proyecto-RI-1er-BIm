When I edit a slide show it easy to copy whole slides in `Working` Screen Environment but nice to preview slides in `SlideShow` Screen Environment. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xo8ZD.png) _Mathematica_ has convenient interactive buttons to go to Full Screen mode and change slides. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5lyQy.png) **Is it possible to set up an easy button or hot key to switch between`Working` and `SlideShow` Screen Environments to avoid trips to menu? Maybe using `DockedCells` ? Any similar ideas ?**
