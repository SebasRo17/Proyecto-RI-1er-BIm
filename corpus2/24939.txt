Sorry, I'm just starting to learn mathematica. I have the following two-argument function:               h[{x_, y_}] := x ^ y      When I do the following:               Map[h, {{1, 2}, {2, 2}, {3, 2}}]      I get the expected output:               {1, 4, 9}      I was wondering what I'm doing wrong with the following rewrite of the above map expression (I want to learn how to use `#1` ... `#n` 's):                #1 ^ #2 & /@ {{1, 2}, {2, 2}, {3, 2}}      the error messages I'm getting are: > Function::slotn: "Slot number 2 in #1^#2& cannot be filled from > (#1^#2&)[{1,2}]" > > Function::slotn: "Slot number 2 in #1^#2& cannot be filled from > (#1^#2&)[{2,2}]." > > Function::slotn: "Slot number 2 in #1^#2& cannot be filled from > (#1^#2&)[{3,2}]."
