To create a website   * I create Psd Files for the design (Phase 1)   * I Convert these Psd's to html/css static webpages (Phase 2)   * I add some javascript to these webpages (Phase 3)   * I start the IDE "visual web developper" to start developping (Phase 4) I have studied computer programming for the past five years and now I noticed that the corresponding phase (phase 4) of creating a website takes the least amount time and effort in entire process. All the hard work and effort seems to be focused on the graphical design and especially on converting this design to html/css. My question is, is this a common case? Do I do something wrong in my development steps ?
