What is the best method in PHP for the Error Handling ? is there a way in PHP to Convert all PHP errors (warnings notices etc) to exceptions ? what the best way/practise to error handling ? again: if we overuse exceptions (i.e. try/catch) in many situations, i think application will be halted unnecessary. for a simple error checking we can use return false; but it may be cluttering the coding with many if else conditions. what do you guys suggest ?
