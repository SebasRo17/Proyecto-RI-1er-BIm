I have a list `F = {382.856, 638.53, 915.482, 1192.44, 1469.39, 1746.34, 2023.29, 2181.91}` And I want to use it to calculate V: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZaVI3.jpg) I think it should be something like: `V = Table[ V[i] = V[i+1] + F[i], {...loop in reverse order}]`, I'm not sure about the expression, and didn't find options to excute loop in reverse order. In Mathematica's reference, I only find that `Do[expr,{i,imax}]` , does this mean that the loop can only go in increasing order?
