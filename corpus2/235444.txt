Can someone explain me how entity changes and entity collection changes are tracked by DbContext in Entity Framework 6 where entities are POCO type (not derived from EntityObject)? I experimented with EF6 and observed that even though entities are POCO but not generating proxies (so no self tracking) but EntityState is updated in real time (so no snap shot based tracking). I am wondering how these POCO type entities are tracked in EF6?
