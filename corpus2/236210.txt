I have a website (which is actually mainly a Web API site) and I'd like to be able to simultaneously access multiple versions of it. What I'm currently doing is creating a new website for each version under IIS and referring to sync2.site.com, sync3.site.com etc. This solution is not very scale able nor maintainable. How to quickly add more "versions" of this app and access them using something like `sync.site.com?version=3`?
