Basically, let's suppose an application that manage some user's meetings.   I have a filtering zone on a page that aims to specify the category of items I need to specifically return. Supposing two kind of filters:   * Retrieving **my actual meetings** (meetings currently occurring or planned in the near future)    * Retrieving **my past meetings** (meetings that are already past)  I think of passing a kind of url parameter like this: `www.myapp.com?me=actual`   or   `www.app.com?me=past` Indeed, I can't have both `actual` and `past` in the same call since it would not be appropriate for the listing. So in my server side, I would handle through a simple conditional the passed value to filter the query. Is it right enough to pass a `string` like this (`past` or `actual`) or is there a better practice to handle this case? Note that by default, meaning without filtering, all meetings are returned.
