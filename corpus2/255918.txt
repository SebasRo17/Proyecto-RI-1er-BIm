I have built an android game - I would like to add a "high score" leaderboard to it, such that people can show off how high they managed to score. How should I design it so that people can't "hack" it by decompiling it and sending a fake score? I don't believe android has a TPM module yet for most devices, so I can't store a password there (even if I could, how could I insert it there without it being detected in transmission?). I could obfuscate the code, but that isn't going to prevent hacking, only deter it. I will be using a secured connection, so I shouldn't have any network-sniffing issues. I am not sure if it would be better to post it under android or security instead of here, but I think this is the correct place since I am asking for a design.
