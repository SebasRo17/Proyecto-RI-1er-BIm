I'm just starting out as a Java programmer and have very minimal experience. I would like to improve my knowledge and study for the Java certification. I realize everyone will have a different answer but for those who have taken the certification and passed it, I'd really appreciate if you could tell me your experiences. Just a couple of lines to let me know if you found it hard, very hard. Also how much time did you spend studying. Sorry that this is not a good question. My native language is not English so it is hard for me to say what I want to ask.
