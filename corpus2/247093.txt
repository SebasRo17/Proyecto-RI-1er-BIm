I have made a simple batman puzzle game using some batman posters from the internet. Now there are apps on google play store and windows phone store that also feature these kind of batman pictures and they have'nt been pulled off , But my app from play store has been pulled off because of this copyright thing . How do I publish my app to play store and windows phone store without any copyright issues ?
