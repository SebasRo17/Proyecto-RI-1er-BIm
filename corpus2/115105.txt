Are there any standardised security procedures or auditing techniques that can be used to assess the security of a piece of software? I'm specifically interested in auditing software written in Java, but other tips for other languages as well as general practices would be useful to know about as. A list of frequent identified security vulnerabilities would be helpful, as well. I'm looking for things that are specific to software engineering practices, rather than, for example system administrators.
