I'm a maintenance programmer, and I work with a rather large list of technologies on a monthly if not daily basis. For example I'm competent (obviously not expert) in the following languages:   * Java (including J2EE)   * C#   * VB6   * ASP Classic When I go to work on my resume, how many of the technologies should I list? It seems pointless, or even a problem, to list them all. I don't like reading vast lists of technologies when I read resumes. How many should I list, and how should I choose?
