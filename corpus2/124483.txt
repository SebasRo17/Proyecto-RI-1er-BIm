I participated and wrote a large amount of code in a project which my current company outsourcing to my former company last year. After that I left my former company and recently join in my current company. Several days ago, my current employer asks me to continue the project on top of the existing code (my current company owns the copyright and they have the code). I think it is neither ethical nor legal to do this. So should I refuse my current employer? Could my former employer take me to court if I undertake the project?
