I just wondered if anyone had any tricks or programs they used when comparing two of the same file but different versions? I appear to have foolishly made a modification at some point today (Went a few hours without running any tests) and it has stopped the whole project working - without throwing up any errors so it must be subtle whatever I have done. I just thought that there must be a program out there that might highlight differences etc. Otherwise, a step by step search might be in order!
