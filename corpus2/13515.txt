I am a developer a fairly large firm of programmers (100+). Since there are several departments and several teams within each department; communication is an issue regarding: sharing of ideas, availability of resources/tools, use of good/bad coding practices, awareness of existing utilities, etc. What social networks (Facebook/StackExchange) are out there that are used 'in- house' for work related communications? What business cases could be used to help senior management see the value of a resource like this for increased productivity?
