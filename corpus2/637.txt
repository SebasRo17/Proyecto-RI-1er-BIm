The following line of code finds the edge of a character:               pic = Binarize[GradientFilter[Rasterize[Style["\[Euro]", FontFamily -> "Times"],                                    ImageSize -> 200] // Image, 1]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PCnxH.png) The coordinates of the edges can be found as follows:               pdata = Position[ImageData[pic], 1];      Test:               Graphics[Point[pdata]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OQSw8.png) However, the points are not sorted in an order usable by `Line` or `Polygon`:               Graphics[Polygon[pdata]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wiw6L.png) This brings me to my question:   * What would be an efficient method to sort the coordinates so that it would plot properly with `Line` or `Polygon`? Additionally,   * How to thin and smooth the set of points?   * How to deal with characters with holes in them, like the ones below? ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/92FKS.png) or ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dM7jQ.png)
