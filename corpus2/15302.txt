I am writing several functions which all take similar input parameters (a complicated nested list structure). Is there some way for me to define a pattern that can be used in multiple places and allows me to extract the individual parameters? (I find `OptionsPattern[]` interesting because its definition isn't really visible but somehow `OptionValues[]` is able to extract information from it.)
