I was recently hired to redesign a management system from scratch. This is my first business-scale project. I have assisted with business applications in the past, but I am the only one dedicated to redesigning and programming the system with the assistance of a company employee. This employee built the previous version of the management system. We all agree that we want this done, and done right. I am willing to put in the time upfront to define the problem and requirements so I do not have to reap bad seeds during testing. At the moment, I am trying to capture the problem and gather the requirements for this management system. What questions should I ask this employee to be able to move forward with some documentation? I realize these requirements can change constantly, but I would like a starting point to work with. Here are a few questions I have come up with: > What is the purpose of the management system?   >  What is the problem we are trying to solve?   >  What will be the features of this system?   >  Who will be using the system? (Employees? Outside Entities?)   >  What are the means of security for this system? (Can an outside entity see > what an employee can see? etc.)
