I want to demonstrate generating a solid of revolution by revolving a planar region about, say, a horizontal axis. However, `RevolutionPlot3D` doesn't seem to have an option for revolving a curve about something other than the $z$ axis. I'm curious how you all would handle this. Here's a simple example:               theta0 = Pi;     Manipulate[       GraphicsRow[{         Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> {Thick, Black}, Filling -> Axis],         Rotate[RevolutionPlot3D[Sqrt[x], {x, 0, 1}, {t, theta0 - .001, T},         PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}, {0, 1}}, BoxRatios -> 1,          Boxed -> False, Axes -> False, ViewPoint -> {0, -2, 1}], -Pi/2]       }],     {T, theta0, theta0 + 2 Pi}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nlGje.png) My questions:   1. Is there a "better" way to showcase revolving about a horizontal axis of revolution than what I've done with `Rotate`?   2. Is it possible to generate the higher quality, finished surface of revolution while the slider bar is moving instead of only when the slider is released?   3. How do I prevent the vertical tick labels on the far left edge as well as the graphic on the far right edge from being clipped? (I tried `Spacings` and `ImagePadding`.)   4. How do I vertically align the horizontal axis of revolution of the right graphic with the horizontal axis of the left graphic? **Edit:** I had a follow up question but I will spin that off as a separate question.
