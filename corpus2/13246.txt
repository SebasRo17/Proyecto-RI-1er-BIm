Is there a way to access (or even set) the **cursor** position in a Notebook? (By **Cursor** I refer to the keyboard input postion, or "Insertion Point". For the Mouse we have `CurrentValue["MousePosition"]` or just `MousePosition[]`) Note that calling external tools is only the seconds best option for me. See Programmatically move the cursor to a desired location on the screen (which is also about the mouse)
