Is it currently possible to write desktop applications using javascript, html, css?   Possible solutions:   Use Adobe AIR runtime and program in js. But no, if I'm using AIR, the AS3 suites it the most. So not a good option.   GWT: No because it uses Java and then convert it to js or what ever.   Pyjamas: Interesting. But I'm currently focusing on JavaScript. So I don't want to use python and cross-compile to js. Run a local server and use the browser in full screen mode. Sort of okay, but still its the same browser thing. And difficult to distribute.   So what is the best option? I'm excited about node.js which is the main reason for looking into JavaScript. Otherwise I would have choose python.
