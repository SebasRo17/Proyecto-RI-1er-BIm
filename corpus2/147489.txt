I'm 16. I started programming about a year ago when I was about to start high- school. I'm going for a career in programming, and I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can. When I first started, I learned the basics of C++ from a book and I started to learn things by myself from there on. Nowadays I'm much more experienced than I was a year ago. I knew I had to study by myself because high-school won't (likely) teach me anything valuable about programming, and I want to be prepared. The question here is: how important is it to study programming by oneself?
