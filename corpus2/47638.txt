Related to some packing problems, following problem arose: **Distribute 10 points within a square of sides 1, so that minimal distance between them is maximized.** With the help of random simulation, or any other method, please provide example of such distribution, with graphical representation of square and points, and value of minimal distance between points for such distribution. The answer with distribution with largest minimal distance wins the "answer badge"! :) _(This problem so far to my knowledge couldn't be solved by pure mathematics, so I am coming here for valuable and desperately needed help regarding simulations etc.)_
