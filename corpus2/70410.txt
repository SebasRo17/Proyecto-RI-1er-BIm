I'm studying TDD and I read that it also helps you to define the design of the app, correct? So I decided to start creating a new project to help me understand it better. I want to create a simple user registration system that will ask for its name, email address, country (will pick one from a list) and phone number. So the question is... I created a new solution in VS 2010, added a new Test project and I just don't know what tests to write! Since it will help me define the design, what tests could I write here? Thanks for any help!
