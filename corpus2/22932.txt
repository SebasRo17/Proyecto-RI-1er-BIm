Newly I started working with database(MSSQL Server 2012). by google help, I created `Table` name as `EmployeesList` and also `Inserted`values into the table. know I want to connect database with `Mathematica`.for that I seen documentation and founded `OpenSQLConnection`function.but still not connected.                databaseInstalizationLink="C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server";        Needs["DatabaseLink`"];      OpenSQLConnection[databaseInstalizationLink]      I seen `JDBC`function also but I didn't get it. I tried `OpenSqlConnection[]`wizard also.like if you evaluate the below one line code we get the wizard that screenshots I posted below                  OpenSQLConnection[]      Step 1: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Nu8c.jpg) I click on `New` Button Step 2: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ongm0.jpg) I click on `Next` button.
