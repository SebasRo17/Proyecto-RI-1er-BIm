**Rewritten question:** I'm not asking a JavaScript-related question, but all "client" languages used on the web (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, and so on). If I put JavaScript code (that is GPLed) on my website, and this website is accessible from anyone over the web, am I violating the GPL in some way? What happens if I would like to sell the client-code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to someone? Do I need a different license in this case? Isn't JavaScript (when used for websites) always open source? When you open a webpage you can always read the source. Do I also need to release my server-side code if I'm selling a website which contains JavaScript GPLed code? What happens if this website is partially accessible (a part is free and the other requires you to pay) but the GPLed code (the same part) is used on both sides of the website? What if the GPLed code is only in a part of the website that requires you to pay to access it? If I'm selling a website to a customer in this way:   1. I'm selling you (one time fee) all client-related code (JavaScript, HTML and CSS)   2. I'm **not** selling you the server-side code, you're renting it (I don't want to let you reuse my server-side code) If I'm using some JavaScript GPLed code, am I violating something? (The website is accessible from anyone over the web.) **Edit 2:** Added a new specific question: What if the website can work without server-side code, I mean, JavaScript is just calling some PHP pages that contains data in JSON format. Other people can build a website with the client side, but they will need to provide data. In this case JavaScript is calling the "PHP" code (but not the opposite) I think. In this case, am I violating GPL?
