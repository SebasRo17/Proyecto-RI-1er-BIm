I'm trying to use two color functions within one `MatrixPlot` in _Mathematica_. Is it possible to do this? For example, using a very simple matrix:               test = Partition[Table[i, {i, 1, 9}], 3]      I would like to make the even numbers vary in color increasing from white to red; and the odd numbers vary in color from grey to black. How could I do this? I know how to get the whole matrix to vary in color, but no more than this.
