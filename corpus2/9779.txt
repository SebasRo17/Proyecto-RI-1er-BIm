I want to Manipulate the result of Differential Equation like :               F[x_] = y[x] /. First@DSolve[x - y'[x] + y''[x] == 0, y[x], x]     Manipulate[Plot[F[x], {x, -10, 10}], {C[1], 1, 6}, {C[2], -2, 5}]      the result of the equation is :               x + x^2/2 + E^x C[1] + C[2]      but I don't get any Curve on the display. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zRcut.jpg)
