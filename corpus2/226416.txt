I am a QA/Test manager in my organization and until today I verified the quality of the software (tests written and executed and bugs fixed). Who will verify this in Scrum? How do I know that the team wrote and executed all the right tests? On the other hand I'm afraid that if I continue to do the verification the team will not feel empowered enough. But I need some verification process that "Done" is indeed "Done". What do you suggest?
