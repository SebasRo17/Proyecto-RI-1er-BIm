I need to draw graphs that are Cartesian products of 2 graphs. I need them to look like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EYWYC.gif). So each copy of the factors can have `LinearEmbedding`, but the whole drawing should be based on grid-like skeleton. Clearly, vertices should be on nodes of the grid, and edges can be arbitrary. Are there any solutions? In particular, for Grid Graphs the `SpringEmbedding` gives similar result, but even for Torus Graphs result is very different. I need to draw Cartesian products of complete graphs, cycles, paths, complete bipartite graphs, and add labels to edges of the products.
