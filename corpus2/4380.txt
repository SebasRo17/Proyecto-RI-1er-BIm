It is well known from theory that the Coulomb potential can be obtained as a Fourier transform in the following way: $$ \int \frac{\mathrm{d}^3p}{\left( 2 \pi \right)^3} \frac{e^{\mathrm{i} \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r}}}{\mathbf{p}^2+m^2} = \frac{e^{-rm}}{4 \pi r} \hspace{20pt} r \equiv \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$$ (The mass term is here for mathematical convergence reasons, one can set the mass to zero after the transform. The Fourier transform also has a precise physical meaning, but that's out of the scope of this question.) I am trying to reproduce this result with Wolfram Mathematica; skipping some unnecessary constants I use the following code:               FourierTransform[1/(k*k + q*q + r*r + m*m), {k, q, r}, {x, y, z}]      which does not yield the expected result... I'm not an expert of Mathematica, by any means, but I cannot see why it gets this Fourier transform wrong.
