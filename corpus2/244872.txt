I'm rather new to JavaScript and programming in general so I am pretty much only used to seeing if statements that have some kind of comparison operator like, `if (x < 10)` or `if(myBool)`. I have seen an `if` statement checking against an `event`, but I don't understand what or why the `event` is being checked like that. What's the semantic meaning behind that check or comparison? Here is the code in question:               if(event){         event.preventDefault();     }
