I'm working in a fairly old yet sufficiently unproductive code base that I need to create a(some) script(s) to help me out. For example:   * we add a version # and timestamp at the header of the file (yes we use a CVS based sys but this is beyond my control).   * we have duplicated layout code for different languages (this is pre-unicode era so we just duplicate things) and when a control's attribute changes in one language that change needs to be cascade to the other ones.  So, my first thoughts were a couple of perl or python scripts to do find & replace to solve those two issues. But I wanted to reach out and see if anyone else had a different approach.
