I wrote a cross platform application and I distributed it successfully for Windows and Linux (and tested them on "clean" virtual systems, with no other additional software and/or libraries installed). I have already compiled my application on my Mac computer, but I don't know if my application will work on other Mac computers. I don't have two Macs, also, (as far as I know) it's difficult to install Mac OS X on a virtual machine with "legal" discs or without having to perform a process similar to building a Hackintosh, this means that I cannot test my app on a virtual machine (in VirtualBox). So may question would be: Is there any way of making sure that my application will actually run on other Mac systems (without the need of using another computer)? As an additional note, I wrote my application by using the Qt framework.
