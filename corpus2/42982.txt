I have few hundred data points corresponding to an irregular shape closed curve. As the result I have data points that have the same value of y but different values of x. I want to create an interpolation curve and find the intersection of the curve with a straight line. When I try to interpolate the data _Mathematica_ tells me that there are duplicates. Is there any way of finding the intersection of the curve with a straight line? Here is how I was trying to do it               aa = Interpolation[Data, InterpolationOrder -> 1];     Interpolation::inddp: "The point -6.72 in dimension 1 is duplicated"          FindRoot[aa[x] - x, {x, bestguess}]      Thank you in advance.
