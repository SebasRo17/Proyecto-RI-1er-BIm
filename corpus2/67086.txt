A 'friend' of mine asked me to write a complete CRUD system with AJAX for him for free. What should I do? Technically, its bread and butter for me. However, I am wondering if I should get paid for it. I mean it's a commercial project. On the other hand, I was thinking that I do not care if he pays me. Do what ever you want with my code. If it makes you more intelligent and helps you write better code, then I will sense a feeling of accomplishment... So can anyone help me decide?
