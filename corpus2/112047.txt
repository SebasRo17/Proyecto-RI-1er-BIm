I have few questions regarding the switching from testing to development. 1) Do you think the QA exp wont be counted? 2) Does switching from mnc to startup company for skills development will affect a resume? 3) Does a small profile project looks bad on resume,after 2 years of experience. 4) What does a manager looks in a candidate's profile? previous Company? previous project? or skills he/she has developed? 5) Does a software development in a non-it company counted? Please reply your views.
