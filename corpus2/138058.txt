I have been committing changes in git for a project over the last several months. I would like to start integrating Trac into my workflow. Generally, I have the 'git flow' style of git repository. I maintain a master and develop, and I branch features and bug-fixes from the develop branch. I see from answers in Which commit should close a Github issue when multiple commits are responsible? that I want to link the "merge commit" to the ticket. Since I already have several features in the git repository, I'd like to go "back in time" to associate them with a ticket that was entered in Trac. At this point, I have two choices:   1. Re-write history. I can use `git rebase --interactive --preserve-merges`. Then add the ticket information to the message.   2. Use `git notes add <rev>` to _add_ a note. **I am looking for opinions on which is the better option.** 1\. allows me to be more in keeping with defacto-standards, while 2. allows me to keep ticket management separate from the code repository. I have complete control over the repository, Trac server etc. Solo developer, no pushes (other than to a "backup", but I can rebuild that from the local)
