Generally speaking, RESTful API's are very good for representing resources and collections of resources.   * http://example.com/resources   * http://example.com/resources/item17 And we are good, if we work with resource. However, what should be done, when you need to expose API which does an action which doesn't create/update or delete a resource. Couple of examples:   * You have an algorithm (as example add two numbers)   * You have an action which uses external system (as example send an email). I saw two approaches: **Represent an action as a subresource** POST http://example.com/resource/item17/sendemail On one hand, it's straightforward. On other hand, it start smelling SOAPy (read RPC calls). **Represent an action as a standalone resource** POST http://example.com/emailsender This looks more RESTful. However, it doesn't feel right too (only one of CRUD actions is implemented). This resource actually doesn't have a representation. I am not sure, may be there are other methods which I have missed. The question is - "Is there a consensus on this subject? What is the preferred way to do it?"
