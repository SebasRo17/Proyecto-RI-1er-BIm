I'm doing some work on a project that uses jQuery DataTables. I've never used this particular jQuery extension before. In the past, I've used the ASP.net DataGrid control, which of course is not available in ASP.net MVC. I've also used the Telerik Kendo UI grid, which is expensive. I've been wondering how commonly used jQuery DataTables is across the internet (especially with ASP.net MVC) and what other technologies are being used to replace the formerly ubiquitous ASP.net DataGrid.
