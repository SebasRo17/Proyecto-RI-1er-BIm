I am starting my first project in OpenGL/GLSL and I was wondering, how do you work with code of shaders? Because it needs to be const char and syntax higlighting shows everything in the same color (as string) and so its difficult to navigate in code.               const char *shader = ..."void main()\n"...;      Do you edit the code and then add quotation marks or do you just write it with quotation marks from the start? Thanks edit: using VS2012
