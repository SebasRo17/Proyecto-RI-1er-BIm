Does anybody know of any tutorial material that explains how to use Mathematica to fit parameter values used in a set of ordinary differential equations to experimental values stored in a comma separated variable (CSV) file, and assumes very basic Mathematica programming experience? The ordinary differential equations are required to provide a time course simulation of the variables that is fitted to experimental data, in order to use the parameter values to predict hypothesis on the behavior of the system. Thanks for any assistance.
