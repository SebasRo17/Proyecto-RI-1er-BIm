I would like to add some new features to a text editor. The main requirements I have are:   * Should be a programmer's editor   * I would like to target C# editor features to start with (since I work in Visual Studio most of the time).   * I have considered Visual Studio addins/extensibility development, but I need to know some pros/cons of that. Mainly I am interested in the XAML editor features of VS 2010.   * Some other open-source editors I have considered are Scintilla and AvalonEdit. Again, I would like to know the learning curve for working with those. Since I have not yet started, all editors seem equivalent. I would like to know the pros/cons of developing for each of these.
