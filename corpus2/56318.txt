I need to find the parameters (`k1,k2,k3,k4,k1r,k2r,k3r,k4r`) that fit my data (list of `[Intensity, time]`) using the function `b(t)`, solution of the following system of parametric ODE:               {a'[t] == -k1*a[t] - k2*a[t] + k1r*g[t] + k2r*p[t],      g'[t] == -k1r*g[t] - k3*g[t] + k1*a[t] + k3r*b[t],      p'[t] == -k4*p[t] - k2r*p[t] + k4r*c[t] + k2*a[t],      b'[t] == -k3r*b[t] + k3*g[t],      c'[t] == k4*p[t] - k4r*c[t]}      Initial conditions:               a[0] == 1,     c[0] == 0,     b[0] == 0,     p[0] == 0,     g[0] == 0,      The system of ODE has no analytical solution, so I tried to use `NDSolve`, but it is of course not working because the ODEs are parametric. I guess `ParametricNDSolve` would help me, but unfortunately it is not implemented in the version of Mathematica I am using (Mathematica 8). Do you have any idea about how to address this problem, avoiding the `ParametricNDSolve` function?
