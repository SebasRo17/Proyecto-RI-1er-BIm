I'm studying time-series in R with this book, and there is a nice command in R that creates decompositions. Inside _Mathematica 9_ the command can be executed as:               Needs["RLink`"]     InstallR[];     REvaluate["{         url <- \"http://www.massey.ac.nz/~pscowper/ts/cbe.dat\"         CBE <- read.table(url, header = T)         Elec.ts <- ts(CBE[, 3], start = 1958, freq = 12)         plot(decompose(Elec.ts, type = \"multi\"))      }"]      and creates this plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W6FeJ.png) The first part of my attempt to reproduce this in _Mathematica_ is:               url = "http://www.massey.ac.nz/~pscowper/ts/cbe.dat";     CBE = Import[url];     elecTS = TemporalData[CBE[[2 ;; -1, 3]], {{1958}, Automatic, "Month"}];     DateListPlot[elecTS["Path"], Joined -> True, AspectRatio -> 0.2]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x472D.png) How do I continue this to perform the decomposition wholly within _Mathematica_?
