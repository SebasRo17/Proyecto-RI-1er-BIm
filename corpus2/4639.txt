I have a little problem, and hope, with your help, I'll be able to solve it. As you got from the title, I have some trouble with TeX in Mathematica. Imagine, I want to output a nice DisplayFormula, such that it would represent a function, which evaluates piecewise. In TeX it would look like this (Let's take a uniform distribution for example) $$\left\\{ \begin{aligned} &0,& t\leq x_{\min} \\\ &\frac{t-x_{\min}}{x_{\max}-x_{\min}},&x_{\min}<t\leq x_{\max} \\\ &1,& t>x_{\max} \end{aligned} \right.$$ So what's the best way to create that exact output in Mathematica? I've tried `TraditionalForm[CDF[UniformDistribution[{x_ {min}, x_ {max}}], t]]`, but that gives me almost the same output, but without the zero part. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D4N8f.png) I do know, it's not significant whether to write or not the 0 part in the piecewise function. So it works well for CDF, but with PDF there's an extraneous part is shown at the end               TraditionalForm[CDF[UniformDistribution[{x_ {min}, x_ {max}}], t]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OZUup.png) So in the CDF Mathematica's decided not to output the 0 part, but in the PDF it's shown. I've also tried to use               TraditionalForm[       Piecewise[        {{0, t <= Subscript[x, min]},         {(t - Subscript[x, min])/(Subscript[x, max] - Subscript[x, min]),           Subscript[x, min] < t <= Subscript[x, max]},         {1, t > Subscript[x, max]}},        t       ]     ]      But that variant also reveals the part that I haven't specified. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xCkPI.png) The last thing I've tried to use is `ToExpression["TeX source",TeXForm]`, but this one can't parse the simple TeX source with aligned environment (or I haven't found a way to make it work).
