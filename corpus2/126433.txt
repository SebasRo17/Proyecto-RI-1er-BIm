I was reading What makes JNI calls slow? and I was wondering if Python's C interface is any better than JNI. I heard that if you want to make certain parts of your python programs faster, or if a certain part of the program was really hurting your program's performance, you write them in C, and make Python call them. Does the C interface it incur the same costs JNI does? why or why not?
