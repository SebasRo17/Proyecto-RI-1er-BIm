I have a problem related to this: Are there guidelines on how many parameters a function should accept? In my case, I have a function that describes a rounded rectangle. The caller specifies   * An integer which determines how the rectangle should be merged into previously created shapes   * An Anchor, which is a point that is used for alignment (right, left, top, bottom etc). (0,-1) means that position (next parameter) describes the top, middle point of the rectangle.   * The position of the rectangle   * Width and height   * Corner radius Should I use Parameter Object pattern in this case? It is hard to see how these parameters are related
