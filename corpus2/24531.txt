I've tested Linux Mathematica versions 7-9 on various Linux distributions, with identical problem: after suspend/resume cycle my Manipulate controls (i.e. sliders&buttons) appear unresponsive, though I can enter the values manually. This looks much like this question, but before suspend I can use the controls normally, and if they stop working, restarting Mathematica also helps (killing and restarting math kernel doesn't help). Easy way to test this would be using this code:                 Manipulate[Plot[a x, {x, -3, 3}, PlotRange -> {-1, 1}], {a, -1, 1}]      Then making the machine suspend to RAM, waiting 5 seconds and resuming it. If the controls still work (I rarely encounter such situation), second suspend does kill them. Does anyone reproduce this problem? Are there any better workarounds than restarting Mathematica UI?
