When creating a web service API, how much should I count on the developer to act by my rules? We are really aimed on creating an API so the developers shouldn't develop client side logic too much... for example, if in one of my methods we require the client to send us a unique ID - we are relying on the client that the ID sent is really unique - so the client should also keep track of it's requests and add logic to it's code. is it ok or should we try to solve ths kind of issues in a different more transparent ways?
