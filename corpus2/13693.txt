Here's what may well be a simple problem that I have been having difficulty with: There are two connected vectors, **v1** and **v2** , such that:   * **v1** begins at the origin and and ends at point _a1_   * **v2** begins at point _a1_ and ends at point _a2_ The default constraints are such that moving point _a1_ (via the locator at the arrowhead):   * Affects the length and direction of both _v1_ and v2,    * Does _not_ affect the position of _a2_. In other words, the resultant, **v1+v2** remains unchanged. Under other circumstances, this would be fine. However I want to implement the composition of vectors such that displacing _a1_ will affect neither the length nor direction or **v2**. To do so, moving _a1_ must move _a2_ so that _a1-a2_ remains invariant. I want to maintain the effect of "my" moving of _a2_ (It has no effect on **v1** and should not have any effect on **v1** ). In other words, changing **v1** should not change **v2** , and vice-versa. That's what I mean by "independent" components. The figure on the left is a "before" scenario. Notice that a1 is located at {3,-1}; a2 is located at {4,1}. The figure on the right shows the situation after a1 is displaced to {6,-1}. Notice that **v2** has stretched and rotated slightly in a clockwise direction. I would prefer that the **v2** would have been displayed like the dashed black arrow is displayed. That would correspond to the idea that we changed **v1** without changing **v2**. Any ideas about how this can be done? ![vectors](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IlZbE.png) Here is the code:               Manipulate[      Graphics[{PointSize[Large], Point[{0, 0}],      {Red, Arrow[{{0, 0}, a1}]}, Text["a1", Offset[{0, 15}, a1]],      {Dashed, Arrow[{a1, a1 + {5, -2}}](*,Text["a3",Offset[{0,-15},a2]]*)},      Blue, Arrow[{a1, a2}], Black, Text["a2", Offset[{0, 15}, a2]]},      PlotRange -> {{-8, 8}, {-8, 8}},     BaseStyle -> 16, Axes -> {True, True}],     {{a1, {-1, 3}}, {-4, -4}, {8, 8}, Locator},     {{a2, {4, 1}}, {-3, -3}, {6, 6}, Locator}]
