I've recently read the article The Problem with logging and was wondering about my current logging strategy.   Usualy I use Log4J in my projects and just have to decide _which line/attributes_ I would like to log.   This strategy worked well for me in the past for all my projects without user- interaction. Now I want to set up logging for a WebApp with user-interaction like login, session-management, personalized user pages, etc. and was wondering what would be best practice. To clarify:   I don't ask you to help me decide **what** informations I have to log because that I know for myself (or find information in articles on this site or google).   I'm asking about the things connected with this topic:   * should I bind every log message to the corresponding user for traceability   * should I open up a new log file for every session   * are there other good libraries especially for logging webapps   * should I only log fatal errors in file and handle minor errors inside the view (e.g. show user)      * and how chatty should I be in those messages shown to the user I also know that this is a broad topic and that this question can easily be answered by "it's personal flavor" or "it depends" but I would highly appreciate anyone who's willing to give me some useful hints. Thanks in advance
