I know some people have asked about getting back into programming after a break and this is a potential duplicate. I just am in a position where I can go back to school for a graduate degree in Stat/Applied Math. But I'm very worried about the impact it will have on my career and ability to find a job afterwards. I have 3 years experience in .NET on top of a couple of years in PHP. Right now, I'm a senior software engineer. Do you think taking two years off to do math is going to dramatically hurt my marketability?
