I am trying to use Combinatorica's BipartiteMatching algorithm on a weighted graph. I need to use real numbers as weights. If I try the following               graph = CompleteGraph[1, 1]     graph = SetEdgeWeights[graph, {1}]     BipartiteMatching[graph]      it correctly gives the perfect matching {{1,2}}. But if instead I try this               graph = CompleteGraph[1, 1]     graph = SetEdgeWeights[graph, {1.}]     BipartiteMatching[graph]      (the only difference being the decimal point), it hangs, apparently forever. Am I missing something obvious? Any help would be much appreciated!
