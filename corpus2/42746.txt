I'm trying to create a manipulate controller to set four value. High and low temperature for both test and use conditions. The four values then go into a calculation. I can set these as four individual sliders - which takes quite a bit of room. I did find this code * * *                   Manipulate[     Column[{Dynamic@     Grid@Map[Pane[#, {60, 12}] &,        Transpose@points, {2}]}], {{points, ({#, 0} &) /@      Round[RandomReal[{-2, 2}, {4}], .001]},      LocatorPane[Dynamic[points, (points = {#, 0} & /@ First /@ #) &],      Graphics[{}, PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-.1, .1}}, Axes -> True,       ImageSize -> 300, Ticks -> {Automatic, None}],      Appearance ->       Graphics[{EdgeForm[Gray], LightGray, Disk[]},        ImageSize -> 10]] &}]      * * * at Manipulating several values from the same interval So, my question is on labeling each of the points so they are unique to each of the four temperature values? I'd also like to pre assign values and keep the values created for use in calculations later in the manipulate.... is this possible? I think I need to get rid of the Random assignment of the five point, change it to four specific points, and that is where I get los on how to assign the results of someone moving the points to a variable. Guess two or three questions here.
