Ð¢itle might be a little bit incorrect. :) Anyway, I'm building a software where employees input time they worked per day (work hours) and employer "pays" for this time. "Payment" is done outside this system, so employer just "confirms" (checkbox or something like this) which work hours are paid. So the question is - what is the best way (both UI and data storage wise) to implement this? At the moment I have this idea:   * Employee selects week and manually (with some Javascript helpers, like "fill the same time for all days") inputs work hours in every day of the week. Employer confirms payment the same way employee inputs data (selects week, confirms each day). Data is saved in DB as unix timestamp (one day per table row).  Problem is 14 inputs (7 days * ("hours from" + "hours to" input), yet this approach seems kinda easy to implement. Maybe I'm overlooking something and this can be done differently and better? Maybe someone has any example of already working software?
