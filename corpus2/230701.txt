I'm currently facing a issue on a project. I'm resolving URL's on multiple DNS servers using a node.js server. Until here, everything is fine. But some ISP restrict the incoming requests from IPs outside their IP range. So how could I modify my request to those specific DNS servers to make it look like I'm one of their clients? If I understand DNS request correctly, there are no such things as x-forwarded-for header as an HTTP request would have. So can it be achieve ? Or am I facing a real blocker ? (I hope I am on the correct stackexchange for this question)
