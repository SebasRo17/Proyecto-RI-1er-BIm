I'm an experienced PHP web developer that is looking to understand the options available for streaming video. _What I have_ : a video processing system (this one) that can provide output to various streaming servers / CDNs / HTTPs. _What I want_ : the ability to embed streams on multiple sites, with the ability to enable/disable the stream based on the visitor's session. What options exist for meeting these requirements? Feel free to be broad or recommend reading, as I have a relatively low understanding of this field. I'm open to both paid services as well as implementing some of this myself. Low cost is of relative importance.
