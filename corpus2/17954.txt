I have a plain text file of tab-separated values that was created on a Windows machine. I want to import it into Mathematica on a Mac.               rawdata = Import["filename.csv", "tsv"]      The output list has a blank list every other element. I think this is due to the old `\r\n`-vs-`\n` compatibility issue. How can I tell `Import` which convention the input file is using? Edit: I should mention that I want to do this in a cross-platform way, because I'll probably be moving notebooks between Mac and Windows machines. So simply skipping every other element of the output list (`[[1;2;-1]]`) won't work. Edit 2: This is what the file looks like when I open it in Emacs:               ...     4.510000000000000E+008  -1.052316667849458E+002 -1.412043034275902E+002 ^M     4.515000000000000E+008  -1.159523802353636E+002 1.631532615796773E+002 ^M     ...      The spaces between the fields are tabs. A moment's Googling tells me that `^M` is a carriage return (`\r`). This fits my hypothesis that the Windows-based device is terminating lines with `\r\n`, and Mathematica is reading that as two new-lines. My question remains: How do I tell `Import` what EOL characters are in use in my file?
