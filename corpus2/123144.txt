I'm developing a NES emulator as a hobby, in my free time. I use C++ because is the language I use mostly, know mostly and like mostly. But now that I made some advance into the project I realize I'm not using almost any specific features of C++, and could have done it in plain C and getting the same result. I don't use templates, operator overloading, polymorphism, inheritance. So what would you say? should I stay in C++ or rewrite it in C? I won't do this to gain in performance, it could come as a side effect, but the idea is _why should I use C++ if I don't need it?_ The only features of C++ I'm using is classes to encapsulate data and methods, but that can be done as well with structs and functions, I'm using new and delete, but could as well use malloc and free, and I'm using inheritance just for callbacks, which could be achieved with pointers to functions. Remember, it's a hobby project, I have no deadlines, so the overhead time and work that would require a re-write are not a problem, might be fun as well. So, the question is C or C++?
