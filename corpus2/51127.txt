Say, I have a colorlist               listColor={Black,Brown,Red,Cyan}      Now, I have some Plot function that I can use this list:               Plot[{Sin[x],Cos[x],x,x^2},{x,1,100},PlotStyle->listColor]      Everything went fine. Now, I wanted to make the plot style "thick" But when I add:               Plot[{Sin[x],Cos[x],x,x^2},{x,1,100},PlotStyle->{Thick,listColor}]      The listColor breaks down. I understand I actually need               listColor={{Thick, Black},{Thick, Brown},{Thick, Red},{Thick, Cyan}}      But adding {Thick} to each entry of listColor is too hard. Is there anyway that I can append {Thick, } to each entry of the list elegantly? I notice that using               Transpose[{Table[Thick,{i,1,4}],listColor}]      might work but it looks unnecessary...
