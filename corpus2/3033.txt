**When writing software for yourself, your company or third parties, do you always consider certain principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems in a way that contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations?** And can this code of conduct sometimes be overruled by business requirements, lack of technical skills or other friction during the development process? Some random examples in order of severity. (yes that is controversial) :   * Do you accept known bugs as a risk for the end-user?   * When writing applications, do you always give the end user the chance for a complete de-install?   * Do you always secure and encrypt private data delivered end-users in your web application?   * Do you alwask ask the end-user before submitting his entered data to the server?   * Did you ever wrote an application that sends unwanted e-mails?   * Did you ever work on harvesting or scraping projects only for the benefit of the business?   * Did you ever write software that is legal but moraly controversial, like for weapons industry.   * Did you ever wrote software that ( can intentionally) or is be used for criminal activities It would be nice if you can get a good case with explanation on your moral and ethical decisions. note: _Since ethics and law are quite local and cultural dependent, it would be interesting if you add the location of the "crime scene" with it_.
