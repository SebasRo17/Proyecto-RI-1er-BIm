There are numerous examples here, whose end result is the removal of empty brackets `{}` and empty lists. I still can't find an example of simply removing redundant brackets though. It's hard for me to believe there isn't already a common solution to this problem. Please point me there if I missed it. As I am new to _Mathematica_ I am learning primarily by example so when I ran into this problem I was at a loss of where to even start. For example I have this list as INPUT to a new function: > {   >  {{{0, 5}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 2}, {4, 1}, {5, 0}}},   >  {{{1, 5}, {2, 4}, {3, 3}, {4, 2}, {5, 1}}},   >  {{{2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {5, 2}}},   >  {{{3, 5}, {4, 4}, {5, 3}}},   >  {{{4, 5}, {5, 4}}},   >  {{{5, 5}}, {{5, 5}}}   >  } I would like the new function to generate this list as OUTPUT: > {   >  {{0, 5}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 2}, {4, 1}, {5, 0}},   >  {{1, 5}, {2, 4}, {3, 3}, {4, 2}, {5, 1}},   >  {{2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {5, 2}},   >  {{3, 5}, {4, 4}, {5, 3}},   >  {{4, 5}, {5, 4}},   >  {{5, 5}, {5, 5}}   >  } * * * The actual input TO new function:               {{{{0, 5}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 2}, {4, 1}, {5, 0}}}, {{{1, 5}, {2, 4}, {3, 3}, {4, 2}, {5, 1}}}, {{{2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {5, 2}}}, {{{3, 5}, {4, 4}, {5, 3}}}, {{{4, 5}, {5, 4}}}, {{{5, 5}}, {{5, 5}}}}      The actual output FROM new function:               {{{0, 5}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 2}, {4, 1}, {5, 0}}, {{1, 5}, {2, 4}, {3, 3}, {4, 2}, {5, 1}}, {{2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {5, 2}}, {{3, 5}, {4, 4}, {5, 3}}, {{4, 5}, {5, 4}}, {{5, 5}, {5, 5}}}
