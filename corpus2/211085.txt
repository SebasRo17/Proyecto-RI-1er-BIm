We have a closed-source commercial C++ application. Some of our logged error messages are in plain English like "ERROR: could not read file 'foo'". While others use a macro to print filename/line information like ""SplineReticulator.cpp(423): out of bounds". This is not an assert or a crash, the application recovers fine, but it's an error we want to log. What is a good rule of thumb when plain-English error message is appropriate vs. a filename/line one? Or are filename/line type errors even appropriate for closed-source commercial software? We've heard the argument they are unprofessional looking, but they are handy for debugging.
