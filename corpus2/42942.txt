I am trying to setup the following minimization to align two astronomical images.               scfac =        FindMinimum[         Log[AlignCriterion3[imTargetFM*SC, imRefFiltFM*SC, alpha]], {alpha, 1},          PrecisionGoal -> 6, AccuracyGoal -> 10];      where,               AlignCriterion3[im_, imRef_, scfac_] :=        Plus @@ Plus @@ ((im - ImRescale[imRef, scfac])^2)      and               ImRescale[Im_, ScFac_] :=        Module[{n, res},          n = Dimensions[Im][[1]];         Print[ScFac];         res = Resize[ImageData[ImageResize[Image[Im], {n*ScFac, n*ScFac}]], n]       ]      Clearly, I do not know how to setup the `FindMinimum` since I keep getting the following error: > ImageResize::imgrssz: The size {120 alpha,120 alpha} is not a valid image > size specification. How do I set it up so that the value of alpha is actually passed to the Rescaling code I've written. ![example of an image that I am trying to align. I have the x & y shifts pegged down pretty accurately - the idea is to scale the image size to try and fix what I think is some kind of scale based alignment issue.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/awjfW.png) Example of an image that I am trying to align.
