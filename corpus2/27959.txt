Say I have an integer $M$. Is there a one-line command to create a partition of $M$ into $k$ integers s.t. the difference between any two integers is as small as possible? For example, with $M = 100$ and $k = 10$, we would create the partition: {10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10}. However, for $k = 7$, we might have the partition: {14,14,14,14,14,14,16}, or better {14,14,14,14,14,15,15}. For a partial solution, you can of course write:               M = 100;     k = 7;     BalancedPartition = Array[Floor[M/k] &, k];     BalancedPartition[[k]] += M - k*Floor[M/k];     BalancedPartition      > {14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 16}
