I've been stuck on a seemingly simple Graphics issue for quite a while now... I am trying to make a temperature distribution Plot that will have a colorFunction filling to show red when at a higher temperature, then fading to blue as it gets colder, etc. My plot has temperature in the y-axis, and length (of a fin) in the x-axis. When I try to put it into effect, the filling is filled with the gradient but it goes from left to right, along the x-axis. However, I want it to be fading top to bottom, to illustrate how the temperature decreases. One of my cells of test code is included below:                   Manipulate[      Plot[T[x, length, h, P, A, k, Tinf, T0], {x, 0, length},       ColorFunction ->         Function[{x, T},          Directive[          Opacity[0.7], (ColorData["DeepSeaColors"][Rescale[T, {0, 50}]])]],       ColorFunctionScaling -> False,       ImageSize -> 200,       PlotRange -> {0, T0},        Filling -> Axis,       PlotStyle -> Thick,        AxesLabel -> {x, \[Theta]}],           {{length, 5}, 1, 30, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"}      ]      ![graph of the code](http://i.imgur.com/qknhBz8.jpg) I've tried a lot of convoluted methods like making a customized Raster image for the filling color, but I'm sure there has to be a simpler way to do this! EDIT: I want to be able to do this with the Plot function, so it is easier to Manipulate for the user. Right now I was able to get it to work by creating the data separately and then using a ListLinePlot, like so:               heatData = Transpose[{Range[100], Table[-0.5 x + 50, {x, 1, 100}]}];     bands = 50;          ListLinePlot[Table[{1, i} # & /@ heatData, {i, 0`, 1`, 1/bands}],       Background -> White, ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap",      Filling -> True]      ![graph of the code](http://i.imgur.com/htUKRDQ.jpg) Thank you so much!
