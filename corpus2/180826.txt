I am trying to figure out a better way to decide table storage configurations whether it will use **static configurations using tables** or **dynamic configurations using EAV** (entity-attribute-value) When creating database tables, forms, and reports, when do you decide that a program should use a normal database (wherein everything is statically configured, possibly final) or use entity-attribute-values (wherein all of the data are dynamic and can be customized)? Does it all depend on the client/people using it? Is static-table-customized- programs only applicable for small and medium businesses? and dynamic-eav- customizable-field-programs (like Quickbooks) only for the general public or big businesses wherein they don't want another programmer to tamper again with their software?
