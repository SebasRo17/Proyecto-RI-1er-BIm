The color of a selection is controlled by the operating system. E.g., enter the following code in separate cells.               nb=EvaluationNotebook[]          SelectionMove[nb, Next, CellContents]            2+2      and the 2+2 will be selected and highlighted. One gets the same color highlighting text or input using the Mouse. Is there a way to over-rule the OS and change the selection color using the **Option Inspector...**? I've searched for likely terms in the **Option Inspector...** , such as "Selection" and "Highlight", without success.
