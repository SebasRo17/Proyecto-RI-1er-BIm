I've been using Less.app lately to automatically minify CSS and compile it from LESS to CSS immediately when I save a LESS source file. It seems like an obvious thing, but I can't find a tool that does the same thing for JavaScript. Does such a tool exist? Desired features:   * I'm on OSX, but a cross-platform solution (e.g. using Adobe AIR) would also be acceptable.   * Leave it running minimized/hidden, automatically watches specified folder for changes (no button clicking necessary)   * Installing NodeJS/python/php/etc is a non-starter. Must be totally self-contained.   * Especially interested if it will automatically combine all of the files from the same directory.      * Either sorting based on filename so that I can name them "1.library.js", "2.framework.js", "3.app.js", etc, or...     * Allow setup of manual sorting
