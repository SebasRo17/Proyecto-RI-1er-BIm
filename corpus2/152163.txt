I'll be starting work for the first time in the IT Industry on the 18th of this month. I'll be working mostly with Microsoft technologies such as C#.NET and MS Dynamic CRM. I spent the last year working with C++. Developing small applications to automate taks and organize my notes. During this time I have developed a good basic understanding of the language. My question is how do you guys stay in touch with a programming language that you love when you need to use something else at the office?
