We are building embedded software using a Linux setup based on the Yocto project. We have a couple different configurations that we are building for different purposes (but the same target). I have been struggling with the best way to set up continuous integration for this project. Ideally, I would like to be able to reuse most of the artifacts, so that someone working on a specific layer can get rapid feedback. However, I haven't found any good suggestions on a way to break these builds apart. Is there a way to separate the various layers we are working on into multiple builds with shared artifacts so that it takes a couple hours for developers to get feedback from each build?
