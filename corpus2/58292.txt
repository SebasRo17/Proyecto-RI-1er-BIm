Say, you have a team of 5 developers and your inhouse customers demand a reasonable support availability of say 5 days a week, 9am-6pm. I can imagine the following scenarios:   * **the customers approach the same guy** , every time. Downside: single point of failure, if the guy is unavailable.   * **each developer is assigned one week of support duty**. Downside: how to you distribute the work evenly in times of planned (vacation) and unplanned (sickness) unavailability?   * **each developer is assigned one day of support duty**. Downside: similar to above, but not as bad.   * a **randomly picked developer handles the support request**. Downside: maybe not fair, see above. What is your experience?
