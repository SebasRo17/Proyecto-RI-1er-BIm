> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What should every programmer know about web development? I want to be a web designer. I've spent the past few years on ASP.Net MVC. Where should I focus to learn web design? When I think it's only about HTML, CSS, JavaScript - it's not. Can someone tell me how I can take it practically. I already have been writing HTML for the past several past years but not practically (it's not well-design or look better). I feel there is a big chapter in web-design. Can someone explain me how I can start learning then in future if someone give me a works I can do them in better way.
