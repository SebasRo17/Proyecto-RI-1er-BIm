I really don't want to do VB.NET, but I need a job and I need a job fast. The two positions I am looking at both have existing apps in VB.NET, but are looking to convert them to C# and do new development in C#, but as well all know, sometimes this doesn't happen for a while and you get stuck with the main language. My background is in C# and after looking at VB.NET, my head is hurting. Any advice as I tackle a job like this. As I said, I preferably want stick with C#, but today, one may have no choice, so I have to just take what I get. I am looking for advice on this for those who have experienced it, are experiencing it, and those who have not.
