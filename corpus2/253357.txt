I work in a very small team and we're about to begin implementing Scrum. As we're such a small team I'll have direct and frequent access to the clients. I'll be fulfilling multiple roles. I feel I understand the workings of Scrum itself but not how this affects aspects of communicating with clients. How do you convey to your clients deadlines or timeboxes with Scrum in mind? For instance, do you mention sprints or that every x weeks new deployable features will be available for demonstration? Do many of you include the clients at planning meetings?
