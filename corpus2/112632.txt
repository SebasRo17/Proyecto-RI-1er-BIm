I am planning to go to the UK or Ireland (but it could be any location, generally speaking) for 3-6 months in about a year or so and would like to be part of a software development team there. I am not necessarily looking for a full-time job, but given that several areas around there are known to be "programmer paradises", I'd rather benefit from it to broaden my horizons and also share what knowledge I have. What I would like to do is:   * to spectate and take part in the knowledge exchange and decision making strategies. To see how people think of different problems, how they tackle them, how they subdivide and distribute the work etc.    * to experience best practices in action, rather than trying to make them work for me as a lone developer or work for yet another company, that wants me to just get it done.   * to get in touch with technologies and languages that are new to me, although this is really optional, because it's something I can do myself (although I rarely seem to find the time).  I like to think, that I have a lot of things to bring to the table, but I would also like to learn, or better yet to experience, a lot. So what I am looking for an internship for a developer with work experience. Basically something like as a journeyman's stay: to work with somebody, who I can turn to, when in obvious need of wisdom. How can I go about doing this?
