I am a CS undergrad but I landed a programming job last year and I like it a lot. We are currently 3 programmer in the development section of the company and we have to work with pretty much anything were asked to do. We deal with many different languages and learn them as needed for some quick jobs etc etc. We want to hire a 4th programmer and I'm asked to suggest some students in my class, a year younger, since I failed a class. I don't really know any of these guys except my teammates which I wouldn't suggest. We don't really want to interview them all so I thought we could make a little challenge to help us choose who to interview. We're in need of someone who understand the business even though they're new to it, and likes to learn new stuff and code. Any idea on a programming challenge or a kind of letter saying why we should take them? TL;DR: We need a new undergrad programmer, we want the best to come to us without interviewing them all. Any challenge or test you could suggest?
