recently I have been given a task of finding the combinations of the given word. For example, say The given word is **like** then possible answers are liek,lkie and so on. This has to be implemented in any language, doesn't matter, but the rule is we don't use the built-functions/API to find the combinations. And I guess we know design patterns are for solving any problem with a given solution. For example, Information Expert is a Design Pattern. Now my question is whether there is any design pattern for finding combinations? Or for these kind of things Design patterns wont suit and say i have to learn a good algorithm for finding the solution. Then what's the difference between Algorithm and Patterns, both try to solve the problem in a good efficient way, right? I don't know wthether my view is correct or not, please correct if I am wrong!
