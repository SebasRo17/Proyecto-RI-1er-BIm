There are now a a variety of programming methodologies: Scrum, Extreme Programming, Kanban to just name a few. Most of them combine several more basic techniques (for example frequent iterations). However, nearly all of them state that their combination of technics is the only way to write good software. I don't think that there is one way that's best for each and every project. Instead I'm interested in independent scientific evaluations.   * What basic techniques work best for which kind of project?   * Is there any advantage in the combination of certain techniques? As I don't have time to go through primary literature I'm especially looking for a book. I know that there is Peopleware, but it is a bit old. There are already several related questions (Are there any scientifically rigorous studies of coding style principles?, Scientific evidence that supports using long variable names instead of abbreviations?...)
