I am given the charge of finding a **version control + project management setup** , and also training and maintenance, in addition to my regular jobs; I will be known as "the git guy" (or whatever) from now on. We develop PHP (in netbeans), C# (in VisStudio) and Python in windows XP and Fedora. The system is to be hosted on Windows. We are five-strong and may aggressively jump to 8-10 soon I myself shortlisted **Mercurial + Redmine** by rationalizing. My rationales are:   * Its easy to admin and maintain   * easy to get started in Mercurial and has a gentle learning curve   * It supports solo and few-people workflows equally well   * Mercurial has usable GUI tools   * Redmine has a **stable and integrated** interface to Mercurial (TRAC is skirting around stable Mercurial support, making me nervous)   * Netbeans has **stable and usable** integration with Mercurial (I know Netbeans ships with Mercurial support but...) **My questions** (in order of importance) are:   1. Are my rationales valid or will my assumptions lead to costly mistakes later?   2. Does this combination have issues that severely affect usability?   3. Are there less painful combination for our small team (SVN+Trac for example)? Some in SO have the opinion "Just get started!", but I want to play it safe.
