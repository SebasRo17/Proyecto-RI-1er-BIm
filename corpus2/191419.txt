I want to create a configuration file (text file preferred) that can be modified by user. A windows service will read from that file and behave accordingly. Can you recommend a file format for this kind of process? What I have in my is a config file like the game config files, but could not imagine how to read from it. My question is very similar to INI files or Registry or personal files?, but my question is different because I need to consider user editing.
