Whenever I encounter crashes, the exact type of the exception usually already gives enough info to easily find the culprit. **FileNotFoundException** will hardly occur while using sockets. Now recently I encounterd a **SystemNotSupportedException** and had no idea where it could come from, still don't. Also I cannot reproduce it, so I am designed to find it by detective work, rather than just running the debugger and crashing that thing. I checked through MSDN's article on this exception, hoping to maybe find something like "this type of exception is usually thrown in connection with file operations / integer-math / riding dinosaurs to Taco Bell / you-get-it", to no avail as MSDN only associates the other way around which is commonly more useful indeed. So here's my question:   Is there a lookup-table or something that allows me to determine what operations could cause a specific exception?
