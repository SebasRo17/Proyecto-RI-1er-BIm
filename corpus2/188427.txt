We have a client-server application with a thick client (GWT). There are client-side MVP presenters (MVC controllers) which hold references to some objects viewed in the GUI. Some user actions cause these objects to be updated on the server. After that we can send updated objects back to the client and reassign them to the presenter. The problem is that there are usually a few references to an object on the client (Lists, HashMaps, etc.) and it is hard to update all of them. Another approach is not to update the references but update the object itself, e.g. copy all the properties from the server object to the client one. But if an object is complex it is not easy too. Which approach is better? Or maybe I miss something?
