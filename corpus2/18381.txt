Let `x` be an algebraic number of unspecified degree, expressed using arithmetic, rational powers, and ~~algebraic integers~~ (edit: `Root[...]` constructs). I would like to test conclusively whether it is zero. I don't know whether any of the following are guaranteed to work:               x==0     Simplify[x]==0     FullSimplify[x]==0     PossibleZeroQ[x,Method->"ExactAlgebraics"]      The following should work, but seems unlikely to be efficient:               MinimalPolynomial[x][y]===y      I don't want to use numerical approximation unless the answer is guaranteed to be correct. Do any of the first four lines above guarantee a correct answer? What is the best way to perform this test in Mathematica?
