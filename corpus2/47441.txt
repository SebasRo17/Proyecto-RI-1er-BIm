For some reason I need to create a chess board. I can create a chess board by following command:               Graphics[{       EdgeForm[Thick], Black, Rectangle[{0, 0}],       EdgeForm[Thick], White, Rectangle[{1, 0}],       EdgeForm[Thick], , Black, Rectangle[{2, 0}],            EdgeForm[Thick], White, Rectangle[{0, 1}],       EdgeForm[Thick], Black, Rectangle[{1, 1}],       EdgeForm[Thick], White, Rectangle[{2, 1}],            EdgeForm[Thick], Black, Rectangle[{0, 2}],       EdgeForm[Thick], White, Rectangle[{1, 2}],       EdgeForm[Thick], , Black, Rectangle[{2, 2}],            }]      Problem is it has to be resizable (`Manipulate` command). And I should put the numbers for columns and rows. I am going to give one parameter such as board size. The code will generate the board. I believe there is a code for that, but I couldn't find on the internet. Thanks for the help. This is an example, chess board. ![Example chess board](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YxP53.gif)
