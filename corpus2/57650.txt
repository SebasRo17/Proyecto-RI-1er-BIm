Say for example I am doing the following in Mathematica               Reduce[x1 >= 0 &&     -4*x1 <= 16 &&     4*x1 >= 16 ||     x1 <= 0 &&     4*x1 <= 16 &&     -4*x1 >= 16, {x1}]      This returns $x_1 \leq -4 \;\;||\;\; x_1 \geq 4$. How would I make Mathematica return the bounded parts of the region? I.e. is there some function I can do to these inequalities so that I can return -4 or 4. E.g. I can type bound1[system] and that gives -4, and then bound2[system] and that gives 4. Is that possible? Thanks
