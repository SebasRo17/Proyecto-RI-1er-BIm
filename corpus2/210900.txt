Even though I've programmed on a professional level for some years I still do not fully understand error handling. Although my applications work fine, the error handling isn't implemented at a professional level and is a mix and match of a number of techniques. There is no structure behind my error handling. I'd like to learn and understand how it's implemented at a professional level. This is one area where I lack knowledge. When should I use an exceptions and when should I return a success status, to be checked in the logic flow? Is it OK to mix exception and returning a status? I code in C# mainly.
