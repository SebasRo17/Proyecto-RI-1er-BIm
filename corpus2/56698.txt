I'm new in Mathematica and I'm trying to simulate the vibration of a circular membrane for math project but I don't even know how to start. The wave equation describes the displacement of the membrane $(z)$ as a function of its position $(r,\theta)$ and time $(t)$. $$ \frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial t^2}=c^2 \nabla^2 z $$ For an ordinary circular drumhead the imposed boundary conditions are that $z$ is $2π$ periodic, finite within $0 ≤ r ≤ a$ and at $r = a$ (the edge of the drum) the displacement is zero: $z(a) = 0$. The wave equation is solved through a method of separation of variables and produces the solution: $$ ￼￼z=A_{nj}J_n\left(\frac{\omega r}{c}\right)sin(ωt+\phi)sin(nθ+φ) $$ How can I simulate/plot this solution in Mathematica? Thanks in advance!
