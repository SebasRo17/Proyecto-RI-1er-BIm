I am working on a real time multiprocessor scheduling algorithm. I found very few results via google research related to it. A few simulators are available but are not robust enough. OpenMp is an API I have previously used for small parallel application development. But I am not sure if it provides any support for real time parallel computing which involves time related parameters such as task period, deadline etc. Are those features available in OpenMp? If not, are the underpinnings available so I could extend OpenMp instead?
