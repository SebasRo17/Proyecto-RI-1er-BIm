How to programmatically build **random** directed acyclic graphs (DAG)? I know about the `AcyclicGraphQ` predicate and the `TopologicalSorting` function, though _Mathematica_ does not offer any algorithm to create such networks. Anyone has some experience in this topic? The following random method does not guarantee that the result will be acyclic:               graph = RandomGraph[{10, 10}, DirectedEdges -> True]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4rZ0M.png)               AcyclicGraphQ@graph          (* ==> True *)
