I solve some equations numerically with **FindRoot[]** returning a quadruple {1,2,3,4}. Because the solver sometimes do not find any roots depending on parameterization of these equations I select only those replacement rules "full filling" the equations:               Select[rules, ! MemberQ[eqns /. #1, False] &];      My question is the following: How can I easily calculate **the deviation of an application of a replacement rule** quadruples containing a False so i can check how "badly" some of my equations are not met. My problem is that as soon as I apply an rule to an equation the result is of type boolean and not numeric - which is needed for calculating the deviation. To note: I do back substitution of my previous solution into the solver as I'am variating some parameters. (see here) Thank you for your suggestions!
