My template for building packages has, at the end, the following expression that automatically `ReadProtect`s all symbols defined in my `pack`:               ToExpression[Names["pack`*"], InputForm, SetAttributes[#, {ReadProtected(*,Locked*)}] &]      It works fine, with the exception of cases where I define a constant, like for example: `iso=3;` This produces the following message (when loading the package):               SetAttributes::sym: Argument 3 at position 1 is expected to be a symbol. >>      Can the automated expression that sets `ReadProtected` be changed to correct this behavior?
