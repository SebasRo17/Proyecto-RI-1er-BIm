First off, if this is in the wrong place I apologise. I wasn't too sure on which of the Stack Exchange sites to ask it. I am studying Software Development at university, on a one year conversion course. My main programming language is Java. We have just finished studying searches and sorts. Focussing on the latter in particular, I had a hard time working through the intricacy of the code. Some, like an insertion sort, were obvious enough. Others, like the merge sort, I found extremely tricky to get my head around. I understand totally _how_ they work, I just wouldn't want to _implement_ my own. I've been told most programmers don't create their own sorts/searches as the built in methods in Java are more reliable and generally faster. However, it's considered good practice to know these sorts. When I look at a sort like the merge sort, or binary sort, I think to myself that I could never have come up with such solutions. They are too intricate and complicated. This brings me to my question. Do most programmers use sorts like people use simple Maths formulae, e.g. the area of a triangle or circle, where you apply it almost mesmerically? As a programmer would you put any real effort into trying to develop new, or more efficient sorts? Or if you knew a sort was needed would you simply know which was better through the bigOh notation and then just copy and paste the same thing in, without ever really thinking about the coding behind it? Note: if this question is not fit for Q&A (I did look at the FAQ and I think it is), please advise me where I could post. Thank you.
