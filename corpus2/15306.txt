Does anyone have experience in calling _Mathematica_ from inside SQL Server to do calculations? For example, how can I make a Procedure that uses _Mathematica_? Or a job that runs some _Mathematica_ script? I saw this post on MathGroup, but it's a little bit confusing to me. Is there an easy way? Being more specific, I would like to execute (from inside SQL Server) a _Mathematica_ script. The script works using `MathKernel -script myFile.m` but I don't know how to make SQL call it. The Mathematica is installed in another server, in the same local web.
