I've noticed this strange behavior and I'm wondering if it's a bug. I define a Cauchy distribution:               c = CauchyDistribution[0, 1];      If I evaluate `Mean[c]`, I get `Indeterminate`, as expected. If I evaluate `Expectation[x, x \[Distributed] c]`, I get `Expectation[x, x \[Distributed] CauchyDistribution[0, 1]]`. I would have expected `Indeterminate`, too, but that's ok. However, if I evaluate `Expectation[x + y, {x \[Distributed] c, y \[Distributed] c}]`, I get `0`. The sum of two independent Cauchy distributed random variables should be another Cauchy distributed random variable, right? Why is the expectation 0?
