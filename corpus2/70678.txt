I'm hoping to do some programming for the Kinect for my final year University project, starting in a few months. Although I am a fairly competent C# programmer, I've no experience with motion capture, vision depth, basically all those things measured and captured by the Kinect. Could somebody recommend some reading on this subject, preferably at the novice level for now? Online resources would also be good.
