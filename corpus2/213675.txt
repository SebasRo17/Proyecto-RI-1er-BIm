I have a php script example1.php How would the control flow be when I call another php script example2.php from example1.php. Foe E.g                example1.php looks like this      ....      ...      ....      example2.php (calling example2.php from example1.php)      .....      .....      How does the control flow work for this ? Does example1.php wait until example2.php completes execution and then continuous with rest of code logic or does it just continues allowing example2.php to run independently ?
