I recently stumbled over the following C++ Code which confused me a bit:               class One {/*definition*/};     template<class Base > class Two : public Base {/*definition*/};     template<class Base > class Three : public Base {/*definition*/};     template<class Base > class Four : public Base {/*definition*/};     class Five : public Four < Three< Two < One > > > {/*definition*/};      I know the purpose of templates and more or less when and how to use them. Is there a name or a common pattern for a cascade of several templates? When would I use this pattern (instead of anything less complex)? P.S.: definition of class Five actually is empty.
