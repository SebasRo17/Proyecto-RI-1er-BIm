I'm building a big website, and using the normal old `mysql_query` method for transactions and communications with the database, and everything i going fine, including security. I'm a little bit confused, should I switch to the new PDO interface? cause I learnt that's safer, or keep using the old `mysql_query()` and `mysql_fetch_assoc()` methods? I'm very close to completing the website, and to switch to the `PDO` interface will cost me time, to start updating my codes. I'm a little confused, **which should I use and what are the pros and cons?**
