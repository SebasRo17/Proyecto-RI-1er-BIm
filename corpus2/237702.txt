When lexing, what would be the best way to tokenize operators? Would one just create a `BinaryOperator` token, or a separate token for every single binary operator? Examples: `PlusOperator`, `MinusOperator`, `DivisionOperator` ... I am tended towards having a universal one, but going from the documentations and project sources I've read the vast majority of lexers are using one token per operator. Is there a particular reason for this? Does it even matter? Does it give you any advantages?
