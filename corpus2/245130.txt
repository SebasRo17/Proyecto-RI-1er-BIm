So from the top-voted answer to this question, it appears that using raw pointers for storage isn't frowned upon so much. However, then what is the point of a `std::weak_ptr`? I thought that storage was the exact purpose of that class. If so, is there any circumstance in which a raw pointer is considered good, valid code? If there isn't any, what is the point of having them in the language? Is it simply historical artifact?
