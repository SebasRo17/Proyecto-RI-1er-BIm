Given               M = {{"Utah", 2}, {"Iowa", 1}, {"Maine", 3}, {"Total", 6}}      I want to obtain the reverse-sorted result like this:               Reverse@SortBy[Most@M, Last]~Join~{Last@M}      giving               {{"Maine", 3}, {"Utah", 2}, {"Iowa", 1}, {"Total", 6}}      Still learning the languange, I kindly ask you to propose a shorter and - probably faster -solution for a country with 10^6 federal states.
