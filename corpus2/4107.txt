I was browsing some old code that I wrote (first year in the university) and noticed that I used to write comment titles preceeding various parts of the code. Stuff like (this is from a Monopoly game):               /*Board initialization*/     ...code...          /*Player initialization*/     ...code...          /*Game logic starts here*/     /*Displaying current situation*/     ...code...          /*Executing move*/     ...code...          /*Handle special event*/     ...code...          /*Commit changes, switch to next player*/     ...code...      This might be redundant, and arguably unnecessary if the code is really super clear, but as I scanned through the file it surprised me how strongly I felt like I know what's going on even though I hardly looked at the actual code. I can definitely see this as being fitting in certain circumstances, so I wonder- do you do this? Do you think it's a good idea? Or is it too much?
