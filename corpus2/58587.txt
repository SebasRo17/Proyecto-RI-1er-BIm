I tried to create an adjustable `BÃ©zier curve` with the following simple code. However the curve didn't show up. What is the problem? Please help.               pts = {{0, 0}, {1, 2}, {2, 0}, {3, 3}};     bez = BezierFunction[pts ];          Manipulate[      Show[Graphics[{Red, Point[lo], Green, Line[lo]}, Axes -> True],        ParametricPlot[bez[lo ], {t, 0, 1}], ImageSize -> { 200, 200 }],      {{lo, pts}, Locator}      ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YOKLG.gif)
