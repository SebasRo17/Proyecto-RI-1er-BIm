In my scenario, we have a team of experienced developers with 3+ years and they are not co-located. We are in a learning phase in terms of the domain and technology. I want some recommendations in regards to what software methodology we should adapt. I have thought of implementing waterfall, since we have to design upfront and we know all the design issues and technical challenges. Using agile on teams that are not co-located, we aren't sure how to estimate on per week bases when dont have a complete grasp on the technology.
