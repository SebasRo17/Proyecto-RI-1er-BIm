Let me give the background for this question. I'm using WebAssign to assign homework problems, and WebAssign has a built-in mechanism which can grade problems using Mathematica commands. For instance, if the solution to a problem is $e^{x+y}$ then it is possible to use the Simplify command to ensure that $e^x e^y$ is marked as correct. I'm currently assigning problems on Fourier series, and expressions like $\cos(n \pi)$ occur frequently. It is fairly standard practice to rewrite $\cos(n \pi)$ as $(-1)^n$, and I want these two expressions to be treated as equivalent (as well as similar expressions for $\cos(n \pi /2)$, etc.) The problem is that these expressions are only equal on the integers, and so Mathematica has no reason to believe they are the same. I suppose I could just write some code which plugs in the first hundred integers and checks to see if the values are the same, but I'm wondering if there's a more elegant solution.
