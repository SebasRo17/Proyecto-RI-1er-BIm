I've done a NonLinearRegression with this data               {{0.245, 0.0917011}, {0.25, 0.0894304}, {0.25, 0.108895},       {0.25, 0.111991}, {0.251, 0.0898849}, {0.251, 0.107753},      {0.254, 0.114524}, {0.254, 0.121882}, {0.255, 0.130478},      {0.255, 0.186865}, {0.256, 0.108817}, {0.256, 0.128742},      {0.256, 0.131999}, {0.257, 0.150797}}      The model is a simply parabola:               y=a x^2+b x +c      The coefficiets are:                a= 317.459      b=-154.723      c= 18.9415      Then I've done the same with Excel and the coefficients are the same, but `R^2` is not the same. In Mathematica I've got `R^2=0.97` and Excel tells me `R^2=0.45`. Why there is this incoherence?
