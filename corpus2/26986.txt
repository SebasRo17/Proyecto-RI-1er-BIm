Here are the differential equations that set's up the 11 coupled oscillators.               new = Join[     Table[x[i]''[t] == - x[i][t] +       0.1*(x[i + 1][t] - 2*x[i][t] + x[i - 1][t]), {i, 1,      9}], {x[0]''[t] == -x[0][t], x[10]''[t] == x[9][t], x[0][0] == 1,      x[0]'[0] == 1, x[1]'[0] == 0, x[1][0] == 0},      Table[x[i][0] == 0, {i, 2, 10}], Table[x[i]'[0] == 0, {i, 2, 10}]]      Here are the solutions.               Solt = NDSolve[new, Table[x[i], {i, 0, 10}], {t, 25}]      Here are the individual plots.               Table[Plot[Evaluate[x[i][t] /. Solt], {t, 0, 25},      PlotRange -> All], {i, 0, 10}]      I am trying to figure out how to make a graph so along the x-axis are my i's from 0 to 10, and I can watch the wave move along each oscillator as time moves on. I keep getting errors in which it floods my notebook and doesn't stop unless I close the kernel. This is what I have so far, and I'm not sure how to incorporate time into this.               Plot[Evaluate[x[i][t] /. Solt], {i, 0, 10}]      EDIT Coupled in a circle               Stew = Join[      Table[x[i]''[t] == - x[i][t] +        0.1*(x[i + 1][t] - 2*x[i][t] + x[i - 1][t]), {i, 1,       9}], {x[10]''[t] == - x[10][t] +        0.1*(x[0][t] - 2*x[10][t] + x[9][t]),      x[0]''[t] == - x[0][t] +        0.1*(x[1][t] - 2*x[0][t] + x[10][t])}, {x[0][0] == 0,      x[0]'[0] == 0, x[1][0] == 1, x[1]'[0] == 0.5},      Table[x[i][0] == 0, {i, 2, 10}], Table[x[i]'[0] == 0, {i, 2, 10}]];      The Dsolve               Loin = NDSolve[Stew, Table[x[i], {i, 0, 10}], {t, 6.28}]      The individual graphs               Table[Plot[Evaluate[x[i][t] /. Loin], {t, 0, 6.28},      PlotRange -> All], {i, 0, 10}]      How would I go about putting the i=0 to 10 around in a circle?
