I have designed a RESTful API and I am now working on creating a web application to use the service. One thing I am struggling with is how to manage alerts in the web application (similar to the alerts stackoverflow gives in your profile for a new answer, response etc). Basically the web application is a workflow between a user and his clients. Certain tasks have to be completed in order, and the web application alerts both the user and his clients of any actions. The user also gets alerted to any client actions that are outstanding. The way I have my architecture setup at the moment is that the API has no knowledge of alerts. It simply stores the resources that are retrieved by the web application. To work out if an alert needs to be displayed, the web application looks at all the resources, and based on a set of rules, decides what alerts need to be displayed. The problem I have is that I'm not sure this is a very efficient way to do things. There are a number of different alerts that can be displayed, and they depend on different API resources which will all need to be retrieved when a user or client logs in. My question: Is this the best way to achieve what I want, or are there other methods which are better to use and will help decrease web application load time and api calls?
