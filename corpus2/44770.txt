Is there a way to find out how large the truncation, round-off, and other errors that occur from discretizing a differential equation are while using the default settings in NDSolve? Or would I have to explicitly ask Mathematica to solve the problem using 4th order Runge-Kutta, Adams, etc and find the errors myself. I did find this link: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/howto/CheckTheResultsOfNDSolve.html helpful, but I am wondering what other methods are available.
