How can I write an efficient version of the following selection statement:               Keys[Select[hash, # < constant &]]; // AbsoluteTiming      hash can be made from:               hash = Association[Table[i -> i^2, {i, 1, 10^6}]];      On my computer, a last year MacBook Pro, it takes almost a half second. However, this is non an acceptable time for working with Hashs. Any other ways to do that? Thank you very much.
