**Background** So I have developed an order system and order tracking for a organisation. Currently it is web based with plans to develop a mobile application and a desktop application. The business model is an exclusive membership where you sign up to be able to distribute their products at a cheaper price than other competitors. EDIT: To clarify its currently being developed using Yii Framework for PHP, but I have a basic stripped down version in PHP using no framework. It's still in a development environment, no code is live yet. **Question** What (in your opinion or the industries opinion) the most effective way to distribute this application to the members? Possibly in each of the stages of development (such as how to distribute a web app, desktop app or mobile app).
