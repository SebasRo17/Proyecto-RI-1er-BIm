I am trying to solve a problem of finding a max repetitive sub-tree in an object tree. By the object tree I mean a tree where each leaf and node has a name. Each leaf has a type and a value of that type associated with that leaf. Each node has a set of leaves / nodes in certain order. Given an object tree that - we know - has a repetitive sub-tree in it. By repetitive I mean 2 or more sub-trees that are similar in everything (names/types/order of sub-elements) but the values of leaves. No nodes/leaves can be shared between sub-trees. Problem is to identify these sub-trees of the max height. I know that the exhaustive search can do the trick. I am rather looking for more efficient approach.
