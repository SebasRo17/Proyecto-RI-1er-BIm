From my understanding, the web interface was developed to use HTML because at the time it wasn't possible to simulate a desktop style application in the browser such as how Silverlight and Flash work, because of bandwidth limitations, and possibly processing power. Why hasn't there in the past, and the present been a larger acceptance and push for technologies like Flash/Silverlight? From my experience they are more pleasing to develop with (of course my opinion), and you don't have to deal with cross browser compliance, and older browsers (for the most part). Handling postbacks, AJAX, etc seems like extra unnecessary effort compared to the development paradigm of desktop applications. Do the DOM and it's complimenting technologies continue to thrive mainly on the fact that Silverlight/Flash requires a plugin install, and some mobile devices don't support the plugin?
