I would like to become a professional in php, I have learned nearly all about the language syntax and concepts and I have a good knowledge in C and C++, which made it easier to become familiar with PHP. (Of course, I learned MySql too.) But I don't feel like being able to build even a little good website of my own! It looks like PHP is all about knowing lots of functions and using them, while in fact I don't think it's like that, is it? How can I become a professional in PHP and Website Building? I would do anything and spend whatever amount of time required for that. **EDIT** I've also a very good knowledge in HTML and a normal knowledge in CSS and JavaScript. Sorry for not mentioning that, I just thought it was implicitly included.
