I am trying to find the number of countries that have a certain type of industry. Currently, I have this code:               countries = Flatten[CountryData[]];          listofCountries = Table[countries[[i]], {i, 1, 240}];          industries = Map[{CountryData[#, "MajorIndustries"]} &, CountryData[All]];          data = Table[industries[[i]] -> listofCountries[[i]], {i, 1, 240}];      I am not sure on how to find the number of countries that have an industry (i.e. `Coal`), or if I am headed in the correct direction. Could somebody show me the correct way to find the number of countries with an industry? EDIT: If I were trying to shade in the countries found on the world map with a color, how would I do so? (This is using the CountryData function.) I'm curious to see how much of the world has this industry, and so forth. (EDIT: How could I do it with the world map showing the boundaries of every country?) EDIT 2: How could I do the edit above with two industries? (i.e. Coal and Copper)
