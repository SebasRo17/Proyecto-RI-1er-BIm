I know its not possible to 'know' or 'learn' Java fully in a couple of days but I really need some help on this guys. I have just graduated from university with a degree in computer science. The languages I would say I am 'proficient' at are: HTML/CSS/PHP. I have a job interview on friday and I have to prepare a presentation and have 3 technical test. Its a junior web developer role and forgive my naivety but I didn't realise Java was a factor in web development as I have only done HTML/CSS and PHP at university. **Presentation details:**   Duration 10 minutes.   Project: Talk about a project you have been involved with that you are proud of   \- What was your role in the project?   \- What technologies did you use?   \- Did anything go wrong in the project and how did you solve it?      Does any one have any hints, tips anything they can draw on from experience to help me out? **Technical test details:**   \- 20 mins   Part 1: HTML/CSS   Part 2: SQL   Part 3: Java   Number 1 (HTML/CSS) I am fine on.   Number 2 (SQL) I can relate to my knowledge in MySQL, hopefully ill be alright.   Number 3 (Java) BIG WORRY. I have no experience with Java and have never worked with it before. Should I tell them in advanced I have never worked with it before and that my strength is PHP which hopefully can be applied in the job and I will pick it up fairly quickly, or do it simply learn as much as I can in a couple of days and do my best. Thanks for any help guys
