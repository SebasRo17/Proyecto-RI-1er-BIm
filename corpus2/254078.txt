I'm looking for some advice on how to write my WPF value converters. The way I'm currently writing them, they are very specific, like (bool?,bool) => Brush, i.e. I'm writing each converter for a specific use case, in this case, the Brush is bound to an indicator showing equality information between the bool? and the bool. This obviously makes re-use very hard and I end up with a quite large list of converters. Should I strive to write my converters in a more general way? Can I?
