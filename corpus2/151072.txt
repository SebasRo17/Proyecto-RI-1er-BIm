I was writing some tests in Gherkin (using Cucumber/Specflow). I was wondering how abstract should I get with my tests. In order to not make this open-ended, which of the following statements is better for BDD:               Given I am logged in with email admin@mycompany.com and password 12345     When I do something     Then something happens      as opposed to               Given I am logged in as the Administrator     When I do something     Then something happens      The reason I am confused is because 1 is more based on the behaviour (filing in email and password) and 2 is easier to process and write the tests.
