I'm burnt out on programming. There was recently a job opening in my department for a manager (IT mgr position). The department head encouraged me to apply and thinks I would be a good fit...but I'm not sure. Then again I don't want to be stuck working for a bad boss. What would you guys do? Those of you who have been promoted, would you say that it was a good thing for your career or do you regret it? * * * EDIT: Thanks all for sharing your experiences. Somebody told me that if I have to ask then I'm either not ready to be a manager or don't want the job. Does that sound right? I just like to research what I'm getting into before I actually make a big decision. Honestly there seems to be just as many (if not more) cons than there are pros. * * * I can't make up my mind :( After comparing a list of pros and cons...there seems to be just as many (if not more) cons than pros. The pay is certainly better but I'll be expected to be plugged in 24/7 and possibly work more hours. My goals are currently concrete but they would be more abstract in this role. I hate passing up on an opportunity especially since I was encouraged to apply and there's potential for growth, but I just don't know if it's worth it. If I take the job and it doesn't work out, there's really no turning back if I want to stay in the company. * * * @dauphic - I think you're half right. He probably wants me out of code but not due to performance...he might be planning to outsource.
