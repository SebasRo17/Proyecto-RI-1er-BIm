The Eclipse Public License is not entirely clear for me. As I understand it, anyone who redistributes a Library whose code is licensed under the EPL is considered to be a Contributor. It then states that you are not required to redistribute source-code but you must make mention of where to obtain it. Other websites have said you do not need to release the source code of your project unless you specifically modify parts of the EPL-licensed program, but from reading the license, it seems to indicate otherwise. If I would like to use Library X in my Java program where I link the library to my project via the Build Path and then redistribute Library X with my program, am I required to allow the obtaining of the source code or not, "Ask A Lawyer" advice aside.
