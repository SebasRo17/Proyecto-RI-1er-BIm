I am writing a MATLAB application that makes fairly heavy use of the MATLAB File Exchange. Most of the functions I use from here fall under the BSD license. My application is being deployed for _internal use only_ and is not meant for public consumption. While my particular case uses code that falls under the BSD license, generally speaking what implications are there for using open- source code (GPL, BSD, etc) for programs that will never go public? Do I have to include a license file to cover the code that was licensed as BSD?
