How good of an idea do you think it would be to teach people Assembly (some variant) as a first programming language? It would take a lot more effort than learning for instance Java or Python, but one would have good understanding of the machine more or less from "programming day one" (compared to many higher level languages, at least). What do you think? Is it a realistic idea, at least to those who are ready to make the extra effort? Advantages and disadvantages? _Note: I'm no teacher, just curious_
