Do you think that power failure is a scenario to implement? At what time that scenario should be taken into consideration? If power failure will cause some data loss so do you care about it ? if(IsImportant(data)) ... else .. ? What do you think If our application doesn't work anymore even power failure scenario shouldn't be fault to consider if power failure broke the application permanently ? So we have to consider these situations always ? Can you suggest pragmatic approaches for power failure scenarios ?
