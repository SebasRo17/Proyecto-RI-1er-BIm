Some of my colleges are interested in finding common zeros of the following four polynomials:               {-1 + 12*t^4 + 24*t^2*w^2 + 12*w^4 + 4*x^4 + 12*y^4 + 24*y^2*z^2 + 12*z^4,          -1 + 8*t^2 - 16*t^4 + 8*w^2 - 32*t^2*w^2 - 16*w^4 + 16*t^2*w*x + 16*w^3*x + 16*w*y + 64*w^2*x*y + 8*y^2 - 24*t^2*y^2 + 40*w^2*y^2 + 64*w*x*y^2 + 16*x*y^3 - 16*y^4 - 16*t*z + 96*t^3*z + 96*t*w^2*z + 64*t*w*x*z + 128*t*w*y*z + 64*t*x*y*z + 96*t*y^2*z + 8*z^2 + 40*t^2*z^2 - 24*w^2*z^2 + 16*x*y*z^2 - 32*y^2*z^2 + 96*t*z^3 - 16*z^4,          -2 + 3*t^2 + 3*w^2 + x^2 + 3*y^2 + 3*z^2,          -(t^3*x) - t*w^2*x + t*y - 2*t^3*y - 2*t*w^2*y - 4*t*w*x*y + 4*t*x*y^2 - 4*t*y^3 + w*z - 4*t^2*w*z - 4*w^3*z + 4*w^2*x*z - 4*w*x*y*z - 2*w*y^2*z - x*y^2*z - 4*t*y*z^2 - 2*w*z^3 - x*z^3}      which are of degree $4$, in the five variables $x$, $y$, $z$, $w$, and $t$. I have tried `GroebnerBasis`, (also in `Macaulay2`), to simplify this a bit, before feeding it to `Reduce`, but no luck, it takes all the memory of my computer and never finishes. I am looking for a simpler way to represent the ideal generated by the four polynomials above. So, if anyone have some special trick to attack very specific systems like this, I would appreciate it. EDIT: I am not so familiar with the details, but this is a simplification of a system of the form $p1=p2=p4=p4=1/4$ for four homogeneous degree-4 polynomials, so this I think could help.
