I'm a java programmer and I've decided to learn a bit about theoretical computer science. I don't have a degree in that and a little background would help me a lot since I don't know anything other than coding when it comes to software development. I've searched this website for answers and I've found a lot of people recommending the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" but since I don't have the required mathematical know-how to handle this book, I decided to go with "How to Design Programs" instead. My question here is what would I gain from this experience? Would it teach me about Computer Science like I want? Or am I better off reading about algorithms and data structures instead?
