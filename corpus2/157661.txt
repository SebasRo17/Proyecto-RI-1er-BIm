I'm trying to put together some ideas for a talk, and one of the things that occurred to me, is if there's any documentation or research into how many programmers work as the lone developer within their team. I think this is an important distinction because individual developers (and perhaps small team developers) end up having to wear many more hats than developers part of a large developer group. It could give us some better insight to career development and transition tactics, as well. I've tried some generally googling, and wasn't able to turn up anything, so I'm hoping maybe someone has seen (or studied) something related to this. Thanks in advance!
