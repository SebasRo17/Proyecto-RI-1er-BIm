I want to put somewhat complicated, or at least non-standardly formatted, text on some of my graphics. For example, I'd like to be able to use `f^[4](x)` (where the `^[4]` should obviously be a superscript rather than `f^(4)[x]` for the fourth derivative as a plot label. I'd like to control the formatting of various mathematical objects (for example, I'd like `x^2+x+1` to be written that way rather than as `1+x+x^2`), and the like. The only way I've found for doing this is actually building up the string using StyleBox'es, which is both time-consuming and ugly. Am I missing something?
