I am trying to beautify a map by using `Colorize` as demonstrated in the _Mathematica_ documentation. First, I import a shapefile from DIVA-GIS for France which contains polygons for the country, its regions and departments.               mapdata = Import["http://gadm.org/data/shp/FRA_adm.zip", "Data"];      I then extract the region data and (poorly) place a bounding region around the map:               Graphics[Rectangle[{-6, 41}, {9.7, 51.5}]];     Graphics@{EdgeForm[Thick], FaceForm[White], ("Geometry" /. mapdata[[2]])};     t1 = Show[%%, %]      I can then `Colorize`               t2 = Colorize[MorphologicalComponents[t1, CornerNeighbors -> False], ColorFunction -> "LightTerrain"]      which gives me the following `Image` (note, it is not a `Graphic`) ![France in terrestrial colors](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1CNXP.png) I'd now like to take the department information and lay it over the colored regional map               t3 = Show[Graphics@{Black, EdgeForm[Thin], FaceForm[], ("Geometry" /. mapdata[[1]])}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tbq72.png) However the `MorphologicalComponents` function rescaled the regional map, preventing me from overlapping t2 and t3 above. Is there a way to get the same or similar effect as obtained through `MorphologicalComponents` and `Colorize` without losing the x,y coordinate data?
