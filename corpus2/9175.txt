Suppose I have a function that requires a list is as input. I.e.               f[list_]:=DoSomethingWithList      Now, if I pass a variable as Dynamic like this               pts={{0.1,0.1} , {0.5,0.1}, {0.1, 0.5}};     f[Dynamic[pts]]      everything works as expected as long as I don't use parts of the list. If I use a part of a list then things no longer work as expected ( by me ). Another example               g[point_] := Slider2D[point]     p = {.1, .1}     g[Dynamic[p]]     Dynamic[p]      that works as expected, and this one               g[point_] := Slider[point[[1]]]     p = {.1, .1}     g[Dynamic[p]]     Dynamic[p]      that does not. **Question: What behaviour of Dynamic explains the above?**
