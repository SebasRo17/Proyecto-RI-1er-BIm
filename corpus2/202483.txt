(Let me edit this question to try to better get across what I am asking.) I don't understand what a license is and how I may "use" it. From the little that I do understand, there are two situations:   1. One writes a program/source code and _puts_ a license on it. The license says how other people may (are allowed) to use the program/source code.   2. I find a program/source code and would like to use it. The program comes with a license and the license tells me how I am allowed to use the program/source code. It is this second point that I am confused about. I have no experience with "using" licenses. I see some previous questions about licenses being closed, so just to make it clear: I am not asking for legal advice. I just want to make sure that I am doing it "right". I just want to know how one can use a license. To given a concrete real world example of what I am asking: I want to use the library CryptoJS 3.1 to make a web page (to put online for the whole world to see) using this library, but I am uncertain about how I may do this. From what I understand: according to the page about the library, the the library is offered under a license called the New BSD License. But I don't understand what this license is telling me about how I am allowed to use the source code. Specifically, I would appreciate if someone could explain (as if I was a 12 year old): _What do I need to do to use this library on my web page?_ For example: Do I need to give tribute with a link or something like that? One specific thing that is confusing me is that on the page of CryptoJS 3.1 it actually doesn't tell me what the license is verbatim. It says that the license is the New BSD license. There is a link to this page. And one that page is a _template_ for a license. So how do I make sense of this? In summary: I would like to use CryptoJS 3.1, but I don't know how I may do that. * * * (I have figured out the export regulations requirement, so that isn't an issue for me.)
