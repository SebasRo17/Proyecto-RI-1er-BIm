After installing version 9, the default style sheet uses Arial font in text and formula cells. So far, so bad. At least one would hope this is done consistently. But now I see this: ![traditionalform](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p6cBy.png) You can see that the default font for `TraditionalForm` in output cells is Times, which will make such output look disjoint from the equations in inline or displayed maths. The $1$ on the output line has serifs, while the **1** on the third line (in the text cell) are sans-serif. This is what I would call visually disjoint, or incongruous. What would be the best way to change the default font for the `TraditionalForm` output so that it always remains consistent with Arial (i.e., is displayed as sans-serif) when the default stylesheet is chosen? I am aware that I could also try to change the default stylesheet back to version-8 style as discussed in "How to use version 8 default.nb style sheet in place of version 9 default.nb" \- but here I'm asking what to do if I don't want to go back to Times font, only trying to get a more uniform sans-serif appearance. **Edit** Sorry to say that the inconsistencies extend far beyond the above. I only realized this morning that many important math symbols **remain** in the old form that was based on Times glyphs, even when the rest of the expression is converted to Arial. Here is a screenshot where I typed the math symbol paired with a corresponding normal Arial character - first some double- struck glyphs, then $\hbar$, then some Greek. The square root also looks unchanged from Times font, which may be OK but isn't how I recall sans-serif square roots looking. One important problem in the juxtaposition between pairs of special and normal characters is not just the presence versus absence of serifs, but also the general mismatch in the heights. ![fonts](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1rDH3.png) The last comparison between $l$ and $I$ is of course just a reminder of how bad the Arial font is on general grounds, I'm not asking how to fix that... As a result, I think the inconsistencies I'm worried about can't be removed completely until a whole new set of glyphs is added to the Arial font. I'll have to give it some more time before perhaps accepting one of the answers, although I'm not at all happy and currently waiting for a miracle. **Edit 2** Two alternative titles for this question:   * How to un-xkcd `TraditionalForm` equations in version 9?   * Will Frankenformulas take over the world?
