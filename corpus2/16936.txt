And why do most programmers quit coding and become managers so early compared to other areas? You can work as a construction worker, a lawyer, researcher, writer, architect, movie director for decades if not your whole life, without quitting the favorite thing you are doing. And yet most programmers think being a manager, or better, a non-coding manager is a cool thing and the ultimate goal of the software career. It's so rare to see an ordinary coder in his 40s or 50s (or 60s!) in a typical software company. Why? (And I am for being a coder for as long as you love doing it.)
