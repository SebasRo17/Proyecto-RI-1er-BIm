Programming languages are not just language. Each one tends to have:   * Its own IDEs,   * Its own package managers,   * Its own set of libraries,   * Its own build tools,   * Its own data formats. If you are writing Java syntax, you will be using Maven packages; if you are writing Haskell syntax, you will be using Cabal packages. What's the connection? Why does each programming language create its own world?
