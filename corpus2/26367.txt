I have a function $f: \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}^2$, and I would like to plot the region $f([0,1]^4)$. Writing $f_1(s,t,u,v)$ and $f_2(s,t,u,v)$ for each coordinate of the output I tried using _Mathematica_ 's parametric plotter:               ParametricPlot[{f1[s,t,u,v], f2[s,t,u,v]} , {s,0,1}, {t,0,1}, {u,0,1}, {v,0,1}]      This failed because _Mathematica_ seems to only support parametric plotting in (at most) two parameters. Does anyone know of a work around? For the sake of having a working example, an abbreviated example of my functions is:               f1[s_,t_,u_,v_]:=(s+1/s)(t+1/t)Cos[\[Pi] u/4]Cos[\[Pi] v/4];     f2[s_,t_,u_,v_]:=(s+1/s)(t-1/t)Cos[\[Pi] u/4]Sin[\[Pi] v/4];
