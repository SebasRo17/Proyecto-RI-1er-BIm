A little background. A developer I used to work with insisted on disabling Tempdata and using Session Flash for passing data in the return view. Question is, is there any advantage to doing it this way? using a flash message is great for returning data to the user but I've had headaches with passing data from one post to the next with tempdata disabled. Is there any problem with using flash and tempdata together or is this a major coding faux paus?
