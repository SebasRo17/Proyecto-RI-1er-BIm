I am wondering how to handle the following situation: I do have vectors of known dimension that I would like to handle symbolically. I suppose I can do something like               avec = Array[a,2];     bvec = Array[b,2];      Now in my equations there are also scalars that represent the norms of these vectors, i.e. `A == Norm[avec]` So suppose I write an expression like               expr = A avec.(avec + bvec)      What I would like Mathematica to do is:   1. Whenever `avec.avec` is encountered, replace this by A^2   2. Whenever `avec.bvec` is encountered, leave this symbolic, don't expand into the elements of the vectors. How can I achieve this?
