I am creating some plots that use `FrameStyle->AbsoluteThickness@5` and `PlotStyle->AbsoluteThickness@0.5`. In my plots' `Epilog` option, I want to use some `Inset[Framed@...,FrameStyle->AbsoluteThickness@0.5]` expressions. Upon exporting the graphics to PDF, I noticed that the `FrameStyle` option does nothing. This lead me to the following question on this site: Formatting `Framed` \- Some `FrameStyle` graphics directives don't work So I tried the following, to get a feeling for what `BoxFrame` does:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi},      PlotStyle -> AbsoluteThickness@0.5,      Frame -> True,      FrameStyle -> AbsoluteThickness@0.5,      ImageSize -> 180,      Epilog -> {Inset[         Framed["sin(x)", BoxFrame -> {{0.1, 0.5}, {5, 0}}],         {3/2 Pi, 0.5}]}]      The resulting PDF looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cZSzN.png) It seems like only integer numbers work in the `BoxFrame` option. But how can I make the frame thinner? Especially, how can I make it exactly 0.5 pt thick?
