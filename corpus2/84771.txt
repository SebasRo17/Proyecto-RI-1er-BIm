I was looking at the DevConnections conferences and lamenting the fact that the UK one was cancelled as there's absolutely no way I'll be going to any of the others, which got me thinking: **Do any companies actually send their developers to conferences abroad, or is that just a utopian ideal of which I'm irrationally envious?**
