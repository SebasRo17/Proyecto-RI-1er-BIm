I'm going to write code during a phone interview in the next few weeks. The interviewer and I will use a collaborative text editor to both view the code. I have a few questions since this is my first time writing code during a phone interview:   1. What are common **questions** asked during this type of interview?   2. What are common **gotchas** in this situation? (for both interviewer and candidate)   3. Does the **interviewer** commonly **write code** too? (perhaps a function w/ an empty body) Any other tips and advice is greatly appreciated!
