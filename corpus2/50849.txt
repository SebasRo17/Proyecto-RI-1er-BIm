Is it bad programming practice to use non-integer values to label data tables? For example, Do[data[dBx, Bz] = Table[{x,f[dBx,Bz]}, {dBx, .1, .5, .05}, {Bz, .4, 1.5, .1}] instead of introducing integer indices for the values of {dBx,Bz}. It works fine most of the time. But sometimes when I plot the data, i.e., ListDensityplot[Table[{dBx,Bz,data[dBx,Bz]},{dBx, .1, .5, .05}, {Bz, .4, 1.5, .1}]] some values are missing because for some reason mathematica adds some tiny numerical values to the indices that get called in the plot, so that 0.1 becomes 0.10000000000002
