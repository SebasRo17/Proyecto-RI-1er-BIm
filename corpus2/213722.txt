One of the interviewers asked me this question: > Tables are created with appropriate normalization rules, However the > database is performing slow. [Ie.: The select, insert statements are taking > time to do his operation.] What are areas we need to look to improve the > database performance. I understood this will be a vague question. Please provide some suggestions. And also what are the areas we need to look in Query Execution plan?
