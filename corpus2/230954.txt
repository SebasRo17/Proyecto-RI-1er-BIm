I've been a front-end developer for about two years now, and I'm attempting to break into the server side of things. Ideally I'd like to work for a startup social network on the back-end side so I want to try and be as marketable as possible. In my quest to learn a new scripting language I've dug myself into the PHP vs Ruby hole. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of the two? I would really appreciate words from experience with the two, but will settle for any experience. Cheers.
