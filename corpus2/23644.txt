I have a bunch of data to which I've assigned units using `Quantity`, including some angular measurements in degrees. I'd like to be able to use these measurements with trigonometric functions, but it seems that trig functions don't "know" about `Quantity`, so I'm forced to convert those measurements to radians and then apply the trig function to the magnitudes, like this:               x = Quantity[23.4, "AngularDegrees"]     Cos[QuantityMagnitude @ UnitConvert[x, "Radians"]]      This works, but it's slow and seems clunky, at best. Is there a more elegant (and hopefully faster) approach?
