I am a graduate CS student (Data mining and machine learning) and have a good exposure to core JAVA (>3 years). I have read up a bunch of stuff on Design patterns J2EE Web services( soap and rest) spring and hibernate Java Concurrency - advanced features like Task and Executors. I would now like to do a project combining this stuff (over my free time of corse) to get a better understanding of these things and to kind of make an end to end software (to learn the best design principles etc + svn, maven). Any good project ideas would be really appreciated. I just wanna build this stuff to learn so I dont really mind re-inventing the wheel. Also, anything related to data mining would be an added bonus (fits with my research) but absolutly not necesary (since this project is more to learn to do large scale software developement)
