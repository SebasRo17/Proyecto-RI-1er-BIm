I can't figure how to replace a failed evaluation with a null value. I am very new to Mathematica. I have an equation that are being processed using the `Solve[]` function and I then need to forward the results to other steps in my process. Some of the equations don't have solutions. This is desired and I want to eliminate those possibilities. After generating a list with all the solutions I process that list like this:               SillySyntax[Rule_] = Quiet[x /. Rule];     Quiet[Curve = Table[SillySyntax[Curves[[i]]], {i, 5}]]      This works fine, but sometimes when errors such as the following happen they break my workflow by not putting a null in there. Instead leaving a ghost of an equation. This is not desired because I know _a priori_ that these errors mean that the system is not physical. How can I remove these aberrations and ensure that `SillySyntax` will output only numbers or empties.               Greater::nord: "Invalid comparison with 0.347148 -1.5103810834566311` I"
