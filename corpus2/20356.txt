I'm currently using _Mathematica_ on a High Performance Cluster (HPC) which consists of many compute nodes each with around 16 cores. I currently run my _Mathematica_ script on 20 of the nodes that invokes 10 cores and 10 of the subkernels licenses in Parallel, meaning I use 20 Mathkernel licenses and 200 subkernel licenses. The problem is we have limited Mathkernel licenses (36, and for me to be using 20 of them is unfair on everyone else!) although ample subkernel licenses (288). Is there a way I can just use a single (or at least fewer) Mathkernel licenses to invoke the 200 subkernels I need? Currently in each of the 20 scripts I just have               LaunchKernels[10];     ParellelTable[....];      which launches the 10 local subkernels on each node, but could I specify different nodes to launch subkernels on perhaps? Thereby I would only need to launch one Mathkernel which could invoke the 200 subkernels spread across the compute nodes.
