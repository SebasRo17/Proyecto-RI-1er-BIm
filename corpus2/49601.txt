I'm not sure I have either my new repo or clone repo workflow, or both, setup correctly. When I create a new project I create a repo on github, can't clone from it as it's empty so I create a new project which goes into my workspace and then the git init runs on the workspace copy. So I end up with everything in workspace\project-name. However, when I clone from github first I need to clone the repo and this goes into my default git directory (C:\git) as git\cloned-project-name, I then need to import this Git repo as a project into my workspace and I end up with workspace\cloned-project-name effectively duplicating the project folder in the git area. I've tried to clone to workspace\cloned-project-name but then it asks to import the git project and if I try to use workspace\cloned-project-name again, it errs. What am I doing wrong? Thanks, Matt.
