I'm working on a Java Project, and I wrote a small plug-in to the existing project. I wrote it on my Mac(dev), QA is on Windows and Prod is on Unix. In the code I make specific API calls to a different program. On my mac though I'm just reading in a file. In Dev it is using windows file path to execute an external programs CLI. Prod will be the same. I'm aware of property files, should I use a property file for this to quickly switch environments. At the moment it is just a lot of commenting/uncommenting to get everything up and running.
