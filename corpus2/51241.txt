I would like to change the edge color of a graph when double clicking on it, the following code works:               DynamicModule[{col = Green, col2 = Blue, col3 = Green},         Dynamic@Graph[{1, 2, 3} , {             EventHandler[1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,             {"MouseDown" :> If[CurrentValue[                 "MouseClickCount"] == 2, (col = col /. {Red -> Green, Green -> Red})]}      ],          EventHandler[3 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,         {"MouseDown" :> If[CurrentValue[             "MouseClickCount"] == 2, (col2 = col2 /. {Red -> Blue, Blue -> Red})]}      ],          EventHandler[1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,         {"MouseDown" :> If[CurrentValue[             "MouseClickCount"] == 2, (col3 = col3 /. {Red -> Green, Green -> Red})]}      ] },      EdgeStyle -> {1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2 -> col,                    3 \[UndirectedEdge] 2 -> col2,                   1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3 -> col3}             ](* Graph *)     ]      But when I changed it like this, it doesn't work at all. Would somebody please help and point out what is wrong?               DynamicModule[{kk = {3 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,                           3 \[UndirectedEdge] 1 },                    col = Green, col2 = Blue, col3 = Green},                     Dynamic@Graph[{1, 2, 3},                     Table[EventHandler[i, {"MouseDown" :>                         If[CurrentValue["MouseClickCount"] == 2,                                (col = col /. {Red -> Green, Green -> Red})]}        ], {i, kk}] ]     ]      @Pickett Thanks so much for your detail instructions, I learned a lot from you. And I followed your method, and take a step further, intending to write some codes to delete the unwanted edges from a RandomGraph by double clicking on them. By inspecting the FullForm[dynGraph], the EventHandlers seems attached to each edge correctly, but again it doesn't work. How can I get around not setting the value of edglst in the first place?               DynamicModule[{rg, edglst, eventhlers },       rg = RandomGraph[{6, 12}];      vlst = VertexList[rg];      edglst = EdgeList[rg];      vcood = VertexCoordinates /. AbsoluteOptions[rg, VertexCoordinates];      eventhlers =        MapThread[        EventHandler[#, {"MouseDown" :>             If[CurrentValue["MouseClickCount"] == 2, (              pos = First@First@Position[edglst, #];              edglst = Drop[edglst, {pos}];              eventhlers = Drop[eventhlers, {pos}])]}] & , {  edglst } ];      dynGraph =        Dynamic@Evaluate@         Graph[vlst, eventhlers, VertexCoordinates -> vcood,           EdgeStyle -> {Thick}];      Evaluate@eventhlers;      dynGraph       ]
