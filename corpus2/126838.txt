I am working on a project that is basically a rewrite of an old batch based system that now should run online. The old system is complex and poorly documented and best source of information are people that originally built it and maintained it. However, even they are often at odds about certain functionalities. What’s worse, they don’t get along very well between them or with the team, since the roles are not very clear, they are considered Product Owners, but feel that they should lead the project. I wonder what would be the best way to extract the information they possess. At this point I think (and I never thought I’d say that) that face-to-face meetings are not very productive. Maybe a tool that would implement a flow where they would all have to answer a question that team has would be appropriate. Or maybe a wiki? What would you propose?
