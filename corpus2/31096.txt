I am primarily a programmer developing on windows based OS using C# as my primary language. I am evaluating Ubuntu Linux as an alternate platform and would like to know the best stack for doing web development on this. I had gone through this thread but it doesn't answer my questions fully. Some of the points I am interested are:   * PHP/Ruby/Python (What would you recommend?)   * Is Mono mature enough for any large scale development? Has anyone any real experience using Mono.   * IDE (including debugging support, intellisense, source control integration,Unit testing)   * Unit testing framework based on the language recommended   * Web framework if any.    * Load Testing tools   * Web server (I know there are many webservers, but would like to know which one is primarily used by most people)
