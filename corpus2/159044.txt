I'm currently learning Python and I'm at the point in the book about using the Math library. I looked on the Python website and noticed the library was a bit scarce and am writing some more useful functions. For example, I went ahead and wrote a function to take coefficients and return the roots of the equation. Essentially a quadratic formula function. I'm wondering if it's possible to add this to the python Math library. If it isn't, how do I save it such that I can use that function in other Python programs I write just by calling it?
