I'm looking for a PHP Active Record library that supports both SQL and NoSQL drivers (mongodb in particular). It doesn't matter if it actually has the NoSQL driver, I can write it myself, as long as the library itself supports it. In particular I'd need one that supports writing custom AR methods in the driver, in case they are methods that simply cannot be transferred to other drivers. The reason I want this is because I'd like to be able to talk to my databases the same no matter the driver, this will allow me to fairly easily transfer my data between different databases for performance testing. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for this, if not I apologize and would love to know what stackexchange site would be appropriate. For the record, I HAVE googled it, and all I can come up with is AR libraries for SQL databases, I haven't found a single one that combines SQL and NoSQL. Thank you.
