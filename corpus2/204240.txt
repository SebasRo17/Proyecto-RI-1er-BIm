I have an interview with a company headquartered in San Francisco. They are pretty popular, well publicized, and recently acquired by a semi-notable player in Silicon Valley. The team is probably 20-30 people. They want at least a mid-level candidate, and offer "perks" for senior/lead developers. I got an internship (for backend development) at a small startup halfway through a state school CS program, and was hired full-time a week into my internship as lead (well... only) iOS developer. I've worked here for 5 months and released an app (iOS constituent of our realtime communication suite). I've also released a location-based app for a niche community. I am familiar with TDD, GitHub, API's, AFNetworking and all the recent popular jazz, as well as dated concepts like pre-ARC memory management and xib/xibless programming. I can demonstrate a basic knowledge level of algorithms and formal programming (competent in code competitions) and I am a good communicator. But my notable experience is somewhat lacking. Would it be fair to call myself a mid-level developer?
