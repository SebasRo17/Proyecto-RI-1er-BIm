During team formation, we have a conflict where 2 developers both really want the same coveted window seat with a lush view of a creek & the woods. What sort of game / activity can we place them in that will:   1. Decide who gets the seat   2. Provide a random (not skill based) chance of winning   3. Allow both team members to participate in the selection   4. Not be a single player game masquerading as a two player game (drawing straws for example - the outcome is based off of the first player's actions when there's only 2 people)
