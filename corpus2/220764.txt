What behaviour should be preferred for widget initialization: 1) Required HTML is generated by widget itself: Layout:               <div id="my-widget"/>      Initialization:               $('#my-widget').myWidget(); // Creates HTML      2) Required HTML is placed to the page by user:               <div id="my-widget">       <div class="foo"/>       <div class="bar"/>     </div>      Initialization:               $('#my-widget').myWidget(); // Won't create nested div's      Mark Otto (one of Bootstrap creators) suggest not to generate markup by javascript: https://github.com/mdo/code-guide#javascript-generated-markup Currently, I use the following function, which appends element to the root of the widget (this.$element) only if it doesn't exist:               function($content) {       var $child = this.$element.children('.' + $content.attr('class'));       return $child.length ? $child : $content.appendTo(this.$element);     };
