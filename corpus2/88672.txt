I'm starting some CS classes at a community college and they have two tracks. Either you take three courses in C++ or three courses in Java. Both cover the same fundamental material e.g. data structures, algorithms etc. Which would you recommend considering that I know python and may be consider doing a masters in CS some time down the road....my undergrad degree is in something else. And advice would be appreciated.
