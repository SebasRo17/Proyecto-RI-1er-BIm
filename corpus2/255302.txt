I'm HMS confused I today created a branch to work on implementation of a new feature. I thought this branching was successful as these appeared. ![branches](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0K0rz.png) However I'd like to merge the new feature branch (NGUI interface test) back into the default main branch **but I don't have the option to if I right click on the most recent commit.** Plus, I've seen on other posts that the graph should be showing a branch of different colours from where the branching occurred, like in this eg. ![eg](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qgGPy.png) All advice appreciated, just discovered DVCS and think it is so elegant.
