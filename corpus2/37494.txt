I have been trying to figure out how to solve a system of inequalities relatively. I don't care about values, I just want all possible ordering. An example system might be:$${b > r,\; p > r,\; c - 1 = p,\; c < x,\; h > x,\; h < e, }$$ $${r < k,\; q > k,\; l - 1 = q,\; l < h,\; k > p}$$ I want to get all possible ways they could be arranged in order, satisfying the inequalities. If I am not explaining this well, please let me know, I'm not sure how to describe what I'm looking in a more mathematical way. Is there a straightforward way to do it? I tried using `Reduce` over the domain of `Integers`, but it choked. `FindInstance` was able to find a single instance, but not more than that. Edit: I tried:               FindInstance[{ b > r, p > r, c - 1 == p, c < x, h > x, h < e,                     r < k, q > k, l - 1 == q, l < h, k > p},                   { b, r, p, c, x, h, e, k, q, l}]      > >     {{b -> 0, r -> -1, p -> 0, c -> 1, x -> 2, h -> 3, e -> 4, k -> 1/2, q > -> 1, l -> 2}} >   This is basically what I'm looking for, but when I tried increasing `n`, I let it run for `5+` minutes and never got a solution. I also tried:               Reduce[{ b > r, p > r, c - 1 == p, c < x, h > x, h < e,               r < k, q > k, l - 1 == q, l < h, k > p},             {b, r, p, c, x, h, e, k, q, l}]      > >      b âˆˆ Reals && r < b && p > r && c == 1 + p && x > 1 + p && h > x && >      e > h && p < k < -1 + h && k < q < -1 + h && l == 1 + q >   when I tried `Reduce` over the domain `Integers`, the output was several hundred lines long. **Edit :** Sorting by the second element, the revised version is:                DeleteDuplicates[        Map[ First, Map[ SortBy[ #, Last] &,                          FindInstance[{ b > r, p > r, c - 1 == p, c < x, h > x, h < e, r < k,                                         q > k, l - 1 == q, l < h, k > p},                                         { b, r, p, c, x, h, e, k, q, l}, 10]                       ], {2}]]
