I have:               InputField[Dynamic[d]]          Dynamic[d]      If I enter e.g.               a b x^5 h m      the entry automatically gets sorted, as per screen grab: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ySQSJ.png) What is the best way to keep symbols entered into `InputField` in the same order that you entered them so that they always display in that order? What I am actually wanting to do is enter some text that contains things like subscripts and superscripts, integrals ... `InputField[expr, String]` is not the answer. On the other hand if I use               InputField[Dynamic[d], Hold[Expression]]      and then               d /. {Times -> List, Power -> Superscript} // ReleaseHold      I get a list that I can do things with: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/APMAl.png) For example I could wrap `Row` with a default spacer or `TextCell` and so on around it. But this seems quite an indirect way of doing things. **Edit** Adding `HoldForm` to the second argument to `Dynamic` doesn't appear to offer any advantage and as Andrew points out you can end up with nested `HoldForm`. So I think this is not a good solution -- maybe a backwards step actually. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f8h1O.png) For Andrew's solution, using `Boxes` in `InputField` doesn't, in itself, prevent ordering when you eventually release `Hold` (e.g. after using `MakeExpression`). i.e. I don't see how to avoid apply a hold of some type and removing `Times` to stop the ordering. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I6glu.png) So using `Boxes` may in general provide more flexibility but I'm struggling to see how it adds anything for this specific problem.
