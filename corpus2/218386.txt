I've heard a lot about requirement gathering and use cases in theory, but in practice often happens that we ask ourselves "should we include this? should this be a use case? in which language should we write this particular requirement" and so on. These questions are mainly because of lack of practice, and since we cannot go picking projects to "learn in practice" it's a little bit hard to get used to the kind of thinking we need in the process of gathering requirements for a new app. In that case, is there some place where can I find real life examples of requirements gathering and application of use cases? I've found some books, but they are mainly focused on teams and I work alone, so it becomes a little confusing.
