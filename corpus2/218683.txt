Just found out that Intel processors now have Transactional Memory support !!!! I learned about Transactional operations in my dB/OS class, it is a very simple concept: entire operation is executed or nothing gets executed. How is programming under new Transactional Mem. model is different from Multithreaded model that uses locks and mutexes ? Does it mean that we will be getting rid of locks and mutexes ?
