### Problem I have **X** , a positive integer, of some resource, **R**. There are **N** potential targets. I want to distribute all of **R** to the **N** targets in some "interesting" way. "Interesting" means:   * Some targets may not get any **R**.   * It should rarely be near even (with a majority of target getting near **X/N** of the resource).   * There should be at least a small chance of one target getting all of **R**. * * * ### Bad solutions The naive approach would be to pick a random target and give one **R** to it and repeat **X** times. This would result in too even of an approach. The next idea is to pick a random number between 1 and **X** and give it to a random target. This results in too large of a number (at least **X/2** on average) being given to one target. ### Question This algorithm will be used frequently and I want the distribution to be interesting and uneven so that the surprise doesn't wear off for users. Is there a good algorithm for something in between these two approaches, that fits the definition of _interesting_ above?
