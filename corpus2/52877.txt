I have to come up with a project propsal for my students, here are some details:   1. The design should be gove over OO concepts: encapsulation, interfaces, inheritance, abstract classes   2. Idealy a game, to keep interest high   3. No GUI, just the console   4. Effective time to finish this: ~ 6 days (1 person per proj) I have found one nice example of a game with carnivore and herbivore cells in a drop of water (array), it's a game of life twist. It is a bit too simple. Any ideeas? Aditional info: \- language is C# \- no AI and no complex rules
