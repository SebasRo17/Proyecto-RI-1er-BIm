I've been asked to give a quote to extend a piece of software i'm currently giving away for free for use by a company. They tell me they are using it in- house at the moment in conjunction with some "post processing" steps, which they would like to incorporate into the application proper. What should I keep in mind when writing quotes for custom or bespoke software requests? How can I ensure all my bases are covered? What aspects of a custom software quote are things that are often overlooked?
