One nice way to view the new and exciting `Mesh` objects introduced in **Version 10** is by utilizing the function `HighlightMesh`, so I've been using it heavily. Problem is, when trying to visualize 2D convex hull regions (3D case works fine) created using `ConvexHullMesh`, `HighlightMesh` essentially ignores the `Options` for styling the face of the 2D polygon region. Here is an example:               SeedRandom[0];     pts = RandomReal[4, {200, 2}];     chull = ConvexHullMesh[pts]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sKju8.png) Now let's `Style` it using `HighlightMesh`               HighlightMesh[chull, {Style[0, Directive[PointSize[0.02], Red]],        Style[1, Thin, Green], Style[2, Directive[Yellow]]}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4kTSH.png) Notice the `Yellow` `Color` under `Style[2, ..]`, that's for the `Polygon` face. This is obviously ignored for the `Default` color used above. Can anyone reproduce this on **Windows 8.1** and other operating systems and is there an easy workaround for this?
