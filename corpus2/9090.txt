I am trying to send a Wolfram demo, which contains a sound wav file. `sound = Import["C:/myfile.wav", "Data"]; snd := sound[[1]]; or snd = sound[[1]];` Is it possible to convert the wav file into the data set,- and in this form to insert in the demonstration? Or is there a problem with my Internet connection when uploading the demo? In what form do you have to prepare audio *.wav files for use in Wolfram demonstrations? What kind of audio compression is needed for this purpose?
