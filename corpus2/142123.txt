I want to set up an SVN repository on my computer without any network access. I am working on a code without any collaborator, so I don't want it to be publicly available. I read this post, but it suggests using online SVN repository services that give free repositories. In that case, my code will be publicly available (as is included in the terms of free plans). So I was wondering if I can set up a local server on my Windows XP machine that only I access even when I don't have any internet connection?
