Say you have two lists: `listA = {a, b, c}` `listB = {d, e, f}` How would you produce a listC that equates each of the two's elements, ie. `listC = {a == d, b == e, c == f}` ? I know, it's very easy, but somehow I've already spent an slightly embarrassing amount of time on this. I suspect it will involve `Map`, but can't seem to get the elements to behave together per each element. It seems to just `Append` the two together for some reason. `SetAttributes[listA, Listable]` `SetAttributes[listB, Listable]` seems promising given this: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Listable.html
