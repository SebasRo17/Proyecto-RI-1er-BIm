My question involves extending the functionality of `Integrate` over specific integrals in the most generic manner. Specifically, is it possible to "hack into" `Integrate` so as a to add to the "grammar" of analytic integration a new family of integrals which the user would have provided (in the spirit of `ProbabilityDistribution` which allows the user to include his own PDF into the existing tools). The idea is that Mathematica would be able to identify when such integrals pop up and replace it by the given definition. The specific example I have in mind involves the integral of `MultinormalDistribution` over square subregions of the integration domain. That is to say I would like to attach to either `MultiNormalDistribution`, or `Expectation`, (or `Integrate`) the following rule               Expectation[Boole[(x>a)&&(y>b)], {x,y} ~Distributed~         MultinormalDistribution[{0,0},{{1,c},{c,1}}]] = FF[a,b,c]      (where `FF` is a given function of `a`, `b`, and `c` which could be tabulated). @JM suggested using `TagSet` or `TagSetDelayed`, but the difficulty is to decide to which function it should be associated with, and with what efficiency, given that it would be unwise to temper with build in symbols like `Integrate`? **Attempt** As a simpler toy problem I tried               Unprotect[Integrate];      Integrate /: Integrate[f[x], {x, a_, b_}] = F[a, b]      Protect[Integrate];      for which `Integrate[f[x],{x,1,2}]` returns `F[1,2]` But for instance `Integrate[2 f[x], {x, 1, 2}]` is not evaluated, which suggests that my new (possibly admittedly dangerous) definition has not been taken as a global rule for integration. More relevantly, I tried               Unprotect[Expectation];     Expectation[ Boole[x_ > a_ && y_ > b_], {x_, y_}~Distributed~         MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0}, {{1, c_}, {c_, 1}}]] = FF[a, b, c]     Protect[Expectation];      so that               Expectation[       Boole[x > 1 && y > 2], {x, y}~Distributed~       MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0}, {{1, 1/3}, {1/3, 1}}]]       returns `FF[1,2,1/3]` (after a short while). **Questions**   1. What is the best way to write down the definition? Assign it to `MultinormalDistribution`, `Expectation`, `Integrate`?   2. How to make sure it is "integrated" by Mathematica so that when attempting, e.g. to compute the expectation of `d*Boole[x>a && y>b]` it would return `d*FF[a,b,c]` (or the expectation of `u+Boole[x>a && y>b]` the Expectation of `u + FF[a,b,c]`)? More specifically, how to make sure Mathematica tries to transform a given integral into a form which could match the new definition?
