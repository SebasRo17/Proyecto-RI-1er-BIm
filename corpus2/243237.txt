Back in the day, it was common to manage database transactions in Java by writing code that did it. Something like this:               Transaction tx = session.startTransaction();     ...     try {        tx.commit();     } catch (SomeException e){        tx.rollback();     }      at the beginning and end of every method. This had some obvious problems - it's redundant, hides the intent of what's happening, etc. So, along came annotation-driven transactions:               @Transaction     public SomeResultObj getResult(...){              ...     }      Is there any support for declarative transaction management in node.js?
