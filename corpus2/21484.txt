I want to solve the following system of equations: $$\begin{cases} 1+\sqrt{2 x+y+1}=4 (2 x+y)^2+\sqrt{6 x+3 y},\\ (x+1) \sqrt{2 x^2-x+4}+8 x^2+4 x y=4. \end{cases}$$ I tried               Reduce[{    1 + Sqrt[2 x + y + 1] == 4 (2 x + y)^2 + Sqrt[6 x + 3 y],             (x + 1) Sqrt[2 x^2 - x + 4] + 8 x^2 + 4 x  y == 4 },                 {x, y}, Reals]      I also tried with `Solve` and `NSolve`, but the evaluation exhausted my patience. I know the given system has $\left(\frac{1}{2};-\frac{1}{2}\right)$ as the only real solution. How do I tell _Mathematica_ to get that solution ?
