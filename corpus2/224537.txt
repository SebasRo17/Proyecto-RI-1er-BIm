So I just was hired at a place that had only one Developer and that was the co owner. Their employee handbook had something to the effect of the following. > All IP, inventions or software you develop while at X company is the > property of the company. Additionally you will have to provide a list of all > prior inventions, software or IP developed prior to working for company x. This is an issue for me because I have both side projects and occasionally contribute to open source stuff and would like to continue to have the ability to to both. I talked about it with the owner and he agreed to making changes and asked me for an outline that is fair for both parties. He would take that to a lawyer and they would go over it and apply it. So with that I'm looking for some wording I could submit to that effect to helping me put this together in such a way that I and any other software developers are protected as well as company x and its software. That or a resource or guideline for this sort of thing. To clarify, the company's software isn't allowed to be made open but the employees will be allowed to work on side project both of an open-source and private nature as long as they don't come to compete with the company's best interest. If it helps we are in the USA.
