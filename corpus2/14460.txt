> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to replace the style of the inline cell in a StyleSheet I'm trying to figure out the best practice for creating short, inline expressions that display as `TraditionalForm` within paragraphs of text, and to understand how to control the style used for expressions. For example, what I'd like to be able to is   * select some text and press a key or choose a style and have that selection display as `TraditionalForm`, and   * while typing, within a paragraph, be able to toggle `TraditionalForm` on and off. Ideally I'd also like to have the formatting or style of such expressions controlled by a (character, as opposed to paragraph) style. One approach that would seem to do this is just to apply the default "InlineFormula" style, but that has no apparent effect, and clearly is intended for some other purpose. Another might be to select text and choose "Cell > TraditionalForm Display", but that changes the whole cell. Selecting text and choosing an item from the "Typesetting Forms" palette works (or using the corresponding command keys), but all of the items in that palette add additional elements structure (e.g. superscripts) in addition to converting the selected text to `TraditionalForm`. Is there some straightforward way to just toggle inline `TraditionalForm` on and off? Can I control the (character) style of such selections.
