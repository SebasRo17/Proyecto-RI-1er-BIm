How can I force Mathematica to calculate symbolically the partial derivative of a function `u[x,y]` with respect to a variable `z = f(x, y)`, where f(x, y) is known? `u` is a function, defined on reals, taking real values. Same thing holds for `f`. I want to try different changes of variables in PDEs. An example of what I'm trying to achieve and why it's failing:               z = 2*x + y       > 2 x + y               D[u[x, y], z]      > General::ivar: 2 x+y is not a valid variable. >> > > D[u[x, y], 2*x + y] **EDIT** : It appears I have failed to convey the essence of the question. I am not asking _how_ to solve a PDE with Mathematica. I am asking how, given a transformation of the original variables, to calculate the partial derivatives with respect to the new variables. The PDE part is merely some context as to why I want to do this.
