Problem Link - http://opc.iarcs.org.in/index.php/problems/EQGIFTS > It is Lavanya's birthday and several families have been invited for the > birthday party. As is customary, all of them have brought gifts for Lavanya > as well as her brother Nikhil. Since their friends are all of the erudite > kind, everyone has brought a pair of books. Unfortunately, the gift givers > did not clearly indicate which book in the pair is for Lavanya and which one > is for Nikhil. Now it is up to their father to divide up these books between > them. > > He has decided that from each of these pairs, one book will go to Lavanya > and one to Nikhil. Moreover, since Nikhil is quite a keen observer of the > value of gifts, the books have to be divided in such a manner that the total > value of the books for Lavanya is as close as possible to total value of the > books for Nikhil. Since Lavanya and Nikhil are kids, no book that has been > gifted will have a value higher than 300 Rupees... For the problem, I couldn't think of anything except recursion. The code I wrote is given below. But the problem is that the code is time-inefficient and gives TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) for 9 out of 10 test cases! What would be a better approach to the problem? Code -               #include<cstdio>     #include<climits>     #include<algorithm>     using namespace std;          int n,g[150][2];          int diff(int a,int b,int f) {         ++f;         if(f==n) {                    if(a>b) {                            return a-b;                    }                    else {                         return b-a;                    }         }         return min(diff(a+g[f][0],b+g[f][1],f),diff(a+g[f][1],b+g[f][0],f));     }          int main() {         int i;         scanf("%d",&n);         for(i=0;i<n;++i) {                          scanf("%d%d",&g[i][0],&g[i][1]);         }         printf("%d",diff(g[0][0],g[0][1],0));     }      Note - It is just a practice question, & is not part of a competition.
