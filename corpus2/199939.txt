If we assume we have this little snippet of code:               string str = "checked";     bool test1;          if (str == "checked")     {         test1 = true;     }     else     {         test1 = false;     }      Is it bad practice to change a simple statement like this to the following?:               bool test2 = (str == "checked");      Because they work exactly the same, and work as required, so I can't imagine how it would be. However, as a young, inexperienced programmer I am not aware of whether such a thing is frowned upon or not. Can anyone tell me, if this is NOT ok, why not? The following test program:               using System;          public class Test     {              public static void Main()         {             string str = "checked";                  bool test1;                  if (str == "checked")             {                 test1 = true;             }             else             {                 test1 = false;             }                  bool test2 = (str == "checked");                  bool test3 = (str != "checked");                  Console.WriteLine(test1.ToString());             Console.WriteLine(test2.ToString());             Console.WriteLine(test3.ToString());         }     }      Outputs:               True     True     False      Any insight etc is appreciated.
