I have a problem using the `Fourier` command applied to the square of an exponential function. I would like to compare the theoretical result (called `Sth` in the code below) with the result computed from `Fourier` command (`SFo`). I also compare them with the result computed by direct integration (`Sxx`). As you can see running the code I get a perfect agreement between `Sxx` and `SFo` but the result of Fourier is not correct. I changed also the `FourierParameters` (to -1,1; 0,0; 1,1; and few others) but without satisfactory effects. Perhaps it is a problem of normalization? Or am I missing something important? here it is the code               Rxx[tt_]:=Exp[-2 Abs[tt]];     Sxx[ω_] := Integrate[Exp[I ω v] Rxx[v], {v,-Infinity,Infinity}];     Sth[ω_] := 4/(4 + (ω)^2) ;          LL = 1000;     Ts = 1/100;     TT = LL Ts;          tList = Table[Ts (i - 1), {i, LL}];     νs = 1/(LL Ts);     νList = νs Table[-LL/2 + (i - 1), {i, LL}];     ωList = 2 π νList;          expy = Flatten[{Rxx[tList], Table[0, {i, 0 LL}]}];     SFo = Ts*Fourier[expy, FourierParameters -> {1, 1}] // Abs // RotateRight[#, LL/2] &;     SFoList = Table[{νList[[i]], SFo[[i]]}, {i, LL}];     SthList = Table[{νList[[i]], Sth[ωList[[i]]]}, {i, LL}];          SxxList = Table[{νList[[i]], Sxx[ωList[[i]]]}, {i, LL}];          plota = ListPlot[SxxList, PlotStyle -> {Directive[RGBColor[0, 1, 0]]},PlotRange -> All]     plotb = ListPlot[SthList,PlotStyle -> {Directive[RGBColor[1, 0, 0], PointSize[Large]]},PlotRange -> All]     plotc = ListPlot[SFoList, PlotStyle -> {Directive[RGBColor[0, 0, 1]]},  PlotRange -> All]     Show[plotb, plotc, plota]      Notice that with the simple exponential as initial function               Rxx[tt_] := Exp[-Abs[tt]];     Sth[ω_] := 1/Sqrt[1 + (ω)^2];      everything works like a charm. Do you have any idea? Thank you very much.
