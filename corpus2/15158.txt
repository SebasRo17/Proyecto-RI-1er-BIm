While trying to answer questions on SO site (particularly C++ questions) I find that most of the times one person or the other includes a quote from the standard. I myself have hardly read the language spec. Even when I try to read it, I can't get my head around the language used in the specs. So, my question to become a good developer in a particular language is it essential to read its spec and know all its dusty corners which invoke undefined/implementation defined behavior?
