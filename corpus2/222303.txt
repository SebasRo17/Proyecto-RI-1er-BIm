I've already read If you use multiple computers, how do you sync everything? \- but that was off topic... I am specifically thinking about this from a programming side. I have powerful desktops at home where I do personal projects and work where I obviously do work related projects... I also have a laptop that I use for programming when I get the chance. I use dropbox and other sync tools for the majority of my work, but, I have found no decent solution for programming projects. Recently, I started to use GIT and whilst I like it for source control, I don't like pushing in tiny changes as it feels a waste when there hasn't been many significant changes. So, I am just looking for some advice, people who work with multiple computers - how do you effectively develop on multiple machines? I am thinking at present that keeping my working folder in Dropbox may just be the easiest solution, however, I can't help but feel there is a better solution out there.
