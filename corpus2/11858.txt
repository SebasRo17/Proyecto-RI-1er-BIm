Give a function which calculates for each x a random list of birthdays (which can be x=1 to x=365)               birthdays[x_] := RandomInteger[{1, 365}, x]      is my answer. Take x=25 and determine whether `birthdays[x]` contain equal numbers.               bday1 = birthdays[25]          Length[bday1]          ubday1 = Union[bday1]      `Length[ubday1]` is my answer These 2 questions were no problem but i cant find a formula for: I want to estimate for groups of x persons, the probability that at least two of them have the same birthday, and i want to repeat this process 1000 times. so im looking for the proportion of 1000 random birthday lists for x that contain the same numbers. (so i need the probability) This is my answer so far; and I don't know whether its correct or not.               birthprob[x_] := Count[Table[RandomInteger[{1, 365}, x], {1000}],       Could someone help me? Thanks in advance!
