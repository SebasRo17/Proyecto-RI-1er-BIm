I am trying to create a LaTex-style document with Section numbers of the form 1.0 and then subsection numbers 1.1, 2.1, etc. I need the numbering to be automatic such that if I insert a new subsection, the numbering of subsequent subsections will automatically adjust. Is there an easy way to do this (presumably by editing the stylesheet??). I've looked at a bunch of options but can't seem to find the appropriate one.
