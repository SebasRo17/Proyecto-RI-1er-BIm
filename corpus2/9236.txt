Sometimes, I see potential in a new technology eg. AIR (not new but I haven't tried it much), and I play around with it. After sometime, I feel inspired to try a new personal project out of it. It was during this project that I sometimes find another "tech" eg. Silverlight more suitable. Maybe its easier to get something done in that platform. But there are many alternatives to such things, and after a while, i feel that i have wasted my time just trying the "new toy", spending time learning it to get started etc. only to decide that I made the wrong decision. How long do you take to explore new technology? Or do you stick to what you already know?
