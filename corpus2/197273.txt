I have an application, where font size, font type, color, background color, image and a lot of things change based on theme. I realised in the beginning itself that using enums to denote themes and then checking the theme everywhere was a horrible mistake. So I have two approaches now and I am confused which one to go with. Keep a Base View Controller for my app with default look and feel of the application and then create a subclass per theme. Or Create a Theme class which will provide theming information and then subclass it per theme and set the theme Object on the view controller and query theme object before applying the theme. Or There could be another approach I haven't thought about :)
