**When we say 'documentation' for a software product, what does that include and what shouldn't that include?** For example, a recent question asked if comments are considered documentation? But there are many other areas that this is a valid question for as well, some more obvious than others:   * Manuals (obviously)   * Release notes?   * Tutorials   * Comments   * Any others? Where is the line drawn. For example, if 'tutorial' is documentation, is 'video tutorial' documentation, or is it something else? Generally, something in software isn't 'done' until it is implemented, tested and documented. Hence this question, what things should we consider as part of documention to consider something 'done'. * * * Question inspire from recent customer feedback at our conference indicating that our doc needed more 'samples', which we previously hadn't been as good at considering as we should have been.
