I am a C# developer. My observation of the IT industry as a C# developer is that the technology keeps changing or being updated by Microsoft like LINQ, WCF, and WPF etc. OOP has been the fundamental for all kinds of developments that we see today in any language. My question is,   1. Is it good if I am a decent programmer in OOPS but not mastering any specific technology?   2. As a WinForms developer, is it necessary to know C++ with C# for better job perspective?
