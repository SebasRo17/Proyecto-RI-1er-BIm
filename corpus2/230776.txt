We're running Microsoft Service Bus (AMQP 1.0) locally and are quite happy with it. We've recently started doing business with a provider that uses RabbitMQ (AMQP 0.9.1) as it's message broker. How should we integrate to be able to receive their events? We could expose HTTP endpoints on our bus or even write an API that could perform "translations" but it seems counter intuitive and cumbersome. I'd like to not install Rabbit on my environment at all.
