There is already a couple of questions here about motivation, but they are related to programming as a job, teamwork and so on. I have been noticing, that in the past few years my motivation to code hobby projects is decreasing. It was already decreasing about something like 8 years ago, then it got better about 4 years ago, now it is starting to get bad again. Since I do not work, lack of motivation in a job isn't a problem. The projects I am interested in developing are a couple of computer games, and a ORM library for php. I want to program those things, but I feel like I lost the energy to do them. The symptoms are stuff like: unable to concentrate, coding for about 30 minutes then leave the project to do other stuff, loss of pleasure in doing the whole thing, among others. This thing bothers me, because it is (or used to be) something that make me feel happy and I don't wanna lose the good feeling of doing something that I like.
