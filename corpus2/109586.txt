Its a general title for the question but I have a couple of questions for the Sprint in a SCRUM methodology.   1. What happens if a HOTFIX comes in the middle of a sprint. e.g - The website crashes or some part of the site that hasnt been worked on for quite some time crashes (like creditcard authorize or webservices etc). How do you incorporate that in the current Sprint(s)?   2. How to tackle bugs at the end of a Sprint. I know we can have Defect tracking sprint but should I plan for that at beginning? Or do I put that sprint back in the product backlog and start planning that from the next sprint planning.   3. How to decide how many sprints are required?  thank you for your help
