I ran across yet another new term in development methodology, and I haven't been able to find a definition for it. Specifically, it's called "train based development." Here are some examples of where I have seen this term. > Earlier this week, I asked our engineering leads and release managers to > take the Windows Metro version of Firefox off the trains. (Johnathan > Nightingale) https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2014/03/14/metro/ From the Mozilla careers web-site: > Experience working with both agile development methodology, and train-based > development/QA teams. I have heard of "train" before and not just in the context of Mozilla. But I haven't managed to find any good information about it on the net. When I googled "train based software development", I found very little information in the search results. The closest that I could dig out that separates the train from the wagons is that "train" is about making releases at regular intervals according to a schedule. But it also seems that "train" is a sort of concrete QA setup. **So, what is "train based development"?**
