I was reading a topic on SO: Why are scripting languages (e.g. ...) not suitable as shell languages?. Especially I liked the answer by JÃ¶rg W Mittag, from which I learned interesting things about `Windows PowerShell`. So after more than 20 years Windows finally has a well designed shell (Windows 1.0 - 1985, PowerShell stable release - 2009). On other hand Unix systems has a bunch of various shells since 1978 Bourne Shell. I've read some articles about MS job interviewing and I have an impression of very "geekish" company. I am wondering why didn't they had a need for command-line tools compared to Unix people who do all their work with those tools.
