A lot of my security experienced friends have told me that I need to code my web applications for working under the Suhosin PHP patch, Suhosin being _"an advanced protection system for PHP installations [...] designed to protect servers and users from known and unknown flaws in PHP applications"_. Sense stating that feat, I have had to rewrite quite a bit of of my functions and classes. Is this the new standard of making secure web applications so that it is harder to exploit and compromise? Is Suhosin now a _common_ requirement for web development in PHP?
