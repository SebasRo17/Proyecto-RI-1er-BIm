My company just (5th July 2011) received the following email from Apple: > Starting in the first week of July, apps that meet the following criteria > are required to comply with French Encryption Laws/Regulations if you intend > to distribute your app in France. > > This requirement applies to apps that use, access, implement, or > incorporate: > > (a) any encryption algorithm that is yet to be standardized by international > standard bodies such as IEEE, IETF, ISO, ITU, ETSI, 3GPP, TIA, etc. or not > otherwise published; or > > (b) standard (e.g., AES, DES, 3DES, RSA) encryption algorithm(s) instead of > or in addition to accessing or using the encryption in iOS and/or Mac OS X > > Apple will require you to upload a copy of your approved French declaration > when you submit your app to the App Store. > > Relevant French encryption regulations can be found at: > > > http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005789847&dateTexte=#LEGIARTI000006421577 > > http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/archive/fr/reglementation/regl_crypto.html > > http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/site_article195.html > > http://www.ssi.gouv.fr/site_article197.html > > Regards, > > Apple Export Compliance I've had a hunt around the web, developer forums, etc, and cannot find one single English description of exactly what this means. In my case (like many other people) I'm only using the standard encryption components provided in iOS - ie. https/SSL, AES, etc, I can't figure out if I need to do anything or not (beyond the USA encryption ERN that I've already completed). I'm worried it is going to delay submitting my next build though. Does anyone have any further information/links (or speak French)?
