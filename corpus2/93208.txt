My team started using Scrum a few sprints ago. Our project involves building software interfacing with physical devices (think robots and sensors) and our typical Product backlog usually represent adding controls device to the whole system. We split down the task close to the example here. Each device integration feature is split into code, tests, integration tests, peer review, etc. Obviously, there is a sequence inherent to each Product Backlog Items. Typically, our sprints last 2 weeks and the team has between 4 to 6 members. We run into 2 problems at the end of sprints:   * The first is to keep everyone busy at end of sprint.   * The second (related) one is contention on system. We pretty much end up integrating during the last few days of the sprint. We only have one integration system, so people are often blocked from continuing to work on their task because they can't access the system. Since it is the end of the sprint, there is not much work left to do in the sprint backlog. What should these people work on? Pick up items from the top of the product backlog is not well received from the product owner, since the current items are not done. Working on technical debt will help the project as a whole but won't help completing the sprint. Are there any best practices to either structure sprints to avoid these issues? Tips to negotiate with product owners?
