I'm trying to select elements of a list that satisfy some criteria using `Manipulate[]`. Given 2 lists:               list1 = {{a, b, c}, {d, e, f}, {g, h, i}};     list2 = {{9, 0}, {2, 1}, {9.5, 3}};      I want to build a function that, when some criteria are `True`, will look for them at a specific position in `list2`. Let me show with an example: Consider the case in which I only want to find if elements in position 1 of `list2` are `>=9` and then take the corresponding position from `list1`. I would write               Pick[list1, Map[#[[1]] >= 9 &, list2]]     (*{{a, b, c}, {g, h, i}}*)      However, if I was to look into elements in position 1 being `>=9` and elements of position 2 being `<2` I would write               Pick[list1, Map[#[[1]] >= 9 && #[[2]] < 2 &, list2]]     (*{{a, b, c}}*)      **But what I want is** to have a manipulable function that uses the `And` function in the second case, but without excluding the possibility that only one of the criterion may be desired. I.e., when only `c1 = True` I want the first case to be analyzed; when only `c2 = True` I only want the second case; when both are true, I want the both conditions to be analyzed. I was thinking about using the following function, but this doesn't work mainly because the new list is not even created.               Manipulate[      Block[{conditional, condlist, c1, c2},       condlist = {};       If[c1, Insert[condlist, #[[1]] > 9, -1]];       If[c2, Insert[condlist, #[[2]] > 3, -1]];       condlist             (*Pick[list1, Map[condlist &, list2]]*)       ], {c1, {True, False}}, {c2, {True, False}}]      Anyone has any tips on how I can solve this? Thanks in advance! **Edit:** though the example I present here only considers 2 conditionals `c1` and `c2`, this is to be applied to a much larger set of conditions. It includes 8 conditionals, and may have any combination among it (e.g. `c1 AND c2 AND c4`, or `c7`, or `c5 AND c6 AND c7`, etc).
