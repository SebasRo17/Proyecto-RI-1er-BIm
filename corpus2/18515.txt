In _Mathematica_ 8 the following expression evaluates and returns a result in terms of `InverseFunction`:               NSolve[Integrate[x^(1/2)/(Exp[x - μ] - 1), {x, 0, ∞}] == C, μ]      where `C` is a constant. But in _Mathematica_ 9 the expression does not evaluate: > NSolve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > NSolve. >> Is this a bug, a regression, or a feature? And how can this equation can be solved in V9? Particular, trying to solve this:               NSolve[PolyLog[3/2, 20 x] == 2, x]      In _Mathematica_ 8 and _Mathematica_ 9 gives different results: _Mathematica_ 8 (correct result):               NSolve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by NSolve, so some solutions may not be found; use Reduce for complete solution information. >>     {{x -> 0.05 InverseFunction[PolyLog, 2, 2][3/2,       2.0000000000000000000000000000000]}}      _Mathematica_ 9:               NSolve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to NSolve. >>     NSolve[PolyLog[3/2, 20 x] == 2, x]      * * * **UPD:** That's a confirmed bug with `NSolve`, that I already reported to developers of Wolfram Mathematica long time ago.
