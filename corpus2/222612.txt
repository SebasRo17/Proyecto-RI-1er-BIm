I don't know how to word this easily but basically the software I am writing has a ton of actions and I want to assign hotkeys to every one of them so power users can work super fast. First off they are not actions related to the application itself, i.e. Quit, Maximize Window, About, Preferences, etc. But rather actual operations you perform on the data set. It's not exactly the same but closest example I can give is the Nuke compositor, where each action is represented by a node. So things like Blur, Sharpen, Add, Color Correction, Keylight, etc. But since the number of nodes are over 500, I don't know how to create easy to remember hotkeys that do not use every modifier key combination. Is using 2 key combo, i.e. CC for Color Correction the best way? Are there resources on this subject? Basically maximizing the use of hotkeys to take working speed to the max without having to remember 1000s of key combinations. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/icbaH.png)
