> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Agile for the Solo Developer For my thesis I will be working on a user interface prototype during a 6 month period. I am required to pick a strategy and create a precise planning. While reading through different descriptions of agile methodologies I felt like I'm in buzz-word heaven. Instead of just picking one because it's famous, I was hoping someone could give some insight into which one/or which parts of it might be useful. Are there any agile methodologies specifically suitable (or scalable) for single developers?
