My minimal example               Panel[Column[{        Row[{"Board size: ", InputField[Dynamic[max], Number, FieldSize -> 3],           Button["Clear Board"]}], "A graphic object which is large enough"}]]      evaluates to ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bzkoi.jpg) Since I have a large graphic object underneath the first row, there is some space to the right of the "Clear Board" button. I would like to move the button to the right so that it is flush with the boundary of the panel -- basically the effect of the LaTeX command `\hfill` if I were typesetting. I have been messing with `Alignment` and `ControlPlacement`, but no luck so far.
