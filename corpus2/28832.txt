I would like to construct an operator in _Mathematica_ of the following form, $$D_i=\partial_i +\sum_{i \neq j}^n\frac{1}{x_i-x_j}p_{ij}, \quad i=1,...,n$$ where $p_{ij}$ is a (symmetric) permutation operator and does not commute with the $x_i$ and $\partial_i$, $$p_{ij}x_i=x_jp_{ij}, \quad p_{ij}\partial_i=\partial_j p_{ij}, \quad p_{ij}^2=1$$ I was trying using the `NCAlgebra` package, making all the operators non- commutative and defining the proper rules, but the result is far to be efficient when many operators (for instance $D_i^6$ ) are applied. The most efficient way I have found is to try to push always the permutation operator to the right and behind the derivatives. The problem appears when some properties of the powers and derivatives of the functions $\frac{1}{x_i-x_j}$ are not simplified when are defined as non-commutative objects and also that for large powers of the operator the number of terms heavily increases. But maybe the `NCAlgebra` package is not longer needed, and such operator can be defined in the normal _Mathematica_ environment Thanks in advance!
