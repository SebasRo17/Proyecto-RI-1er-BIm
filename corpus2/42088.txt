I'm working on a system that has molecular interactions, for which I have the defined constants.               r=0.5;     a=1;     c=0.01;     d=0.1;     e=0.02;     k=500;      and my system of differential equations, which was solved numerically using `NDSolve` I put the following:               sol == NDSolve[{                 x’[t] == r*x[t]*(1-(x[t]/k)) – a*c*x[t]*y[t],                  y’[t] == a*c*x[t]*y[t] – d*y[t],                 x[0] == y[0] == 30                 }, {x,y}, {t,1000}            ]      and received the following:               {{xInterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1000.}},< >], yInterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1000.}} < > ] }}      Then, I put in               Plot[Evaluate[{y[t],x[t]}/.sol],{t,0,1000},PlotRange{0,500}]      for which I received a beautiful plot of both `y[t]` and `x[t]` over the course of time `t`. However, for purposes of stability, I want to plot `y[t]` on the y axis and `x[t]` on the x axis for a range of 0 to 250 on the y axis and about 0 to 1000 on the x axis. How would I go about doing this? I thought about               Plot[Evaluate[{y[t],x[t]}/.sol],{x,0,1000},PlotRange{0,500}]      ....but I received no success. Just a blank plot.
