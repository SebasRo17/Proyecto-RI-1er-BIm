Is it possible to read a whole file (~100 MBs) into memory, and then use BinaryRead[] function on the data loaded into memory to read/cast it to the types I need with a proper StreamPosition pointer? I need this because the process is very slow if I do it directly to files, so I prefer to have all manipulations done in memory, especially that I require many memory accesses with many BinaryRead[] calls. Thank you for any efforts.
