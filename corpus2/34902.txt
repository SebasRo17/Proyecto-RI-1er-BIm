The problem is to find all $Y \in (0, 5)$ such that the roots of $4x^2 + 4xY + Y + 2 = 0$ are real. I took a straightforward approach with Mathematica with the intent of listing the only solutions which are real. It's not quite giving me the output I expected, which is a listing of only real number solutions. What am I missing? The code               ϵ = 0.01;     a = 4;     f[y_] := -(4) (y) ± √(((4 y)^2 -              4 (a) (2 + y)))/(2 a);     Table[Element[f[x], Reals] , {x, 0, 5, ϵ}]      The output               Boole[0. ± (0. + 0.707107 I) ∈         Reals] (0. ± (0. + 0.707107 I)),      Boole[-0.04 ± (0. + 0.708855 I) ∈         Reals] (-0.04 ± (0. + 0.708855 I)),      Boole[-0.08 ± (0. + 0.710563 I) ∈         Reals] (-0.08 ± (0. + 0.710563 I)),      Boole[-0.12 ± (0. + 0.712232 I) ∈         Reals] (-0.12 ± (0. + 0.712232 I)),      Boole[-0.16 ± (0. + 0.713863 I) ∈         Reals] (-0.16 ± (0. + 0.713863 I)), <<492>>,      Boole[-19.88 ± 2.1054 ∈         Reals] (-19.88 ± 2.1054),      Boole[-19.92 ± 2.11071 ∈         Reals] (-19.92 ± 2.11071), ...      Also, is there a simpler way to solve this?
