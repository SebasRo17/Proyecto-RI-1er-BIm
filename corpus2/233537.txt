I am currently developing my first serious piece of software in C#. It is a good learning experience so far. My software is basically a task scheduling tool with some advanced features and capabilities. I am not near the finishing stages yet, but I was wondering what people's opinions are on trial versions of software. Do you think it would be more beneficial, in general, to have a limited time trial (say 30 days) or a limited functionality version of the software? I think I know which I would go with, however I always like to listen to the opinions of others. Thanks,
