I am working on a fairly large open source project (Drupal) and the next major version will begin to use UUIDs for a lot of things, including configuration objects. If we put UUIDs into the configuration we ship with and then various sites change their configuration then there will be many, many objects in the wild with the same UUID but different properties. Is this... OK? Or is it better practice to ship without UUIDs and generate them on install?
