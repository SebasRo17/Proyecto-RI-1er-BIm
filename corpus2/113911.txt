This is the password policy I just got from UPS (just for package status checking): > Your password must be between 8 and 26 characters long. It must contain at > least three of the following character types: lowercase letters, capital > letters, numerals, special characters, or spaces. The password may not > contain your User ID, your name, or your e-mail address. (SSO_1007) I actually have to wrack my brain somewhat to generate this password, but not only that, most importantly, I am sure that after 3 days I will forget what this password is. Users won't be so happy. Password reset can be frequent. I think users will try to avoid using the site unless they have to. What is a reasonable and secure password policy when setting up a website? I think some companies may fear some hackers trying passwords a million times or more, so they add all those requirements for "special characters, lower case, upper case", but won't it be reasonable to turn off the account or just disable the password and require a password reset if a user has tried 30 times or 100 times? Or, add a 5 second delay each time after the user tried 30 times? If so, then those special characters won't be that much needed.
