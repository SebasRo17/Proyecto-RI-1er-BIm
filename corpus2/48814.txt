I am trying to get the sum of the squares of seven random variables, all uniformly distributed. This is what I tried.               Probability[       a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 + f^2 + g^2 < 1,       {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} \[Distributed]        UniformDistribution[{{0, 1}, {0, 1}, {0, 1}, {0, 1}, {0, 1}, {0, 1}, {0, 1}}]]      The output was > >     -Ï€^3/840 >   How can I get _Mathematica_ to get the right answer? **Warning:** the code takes about seven minutes to run on my machine.
