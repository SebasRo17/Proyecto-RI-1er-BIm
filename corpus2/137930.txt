I find very troubling amount of spelling mistakes I see everyday in our codebase, from which I will reproduce a very short but representative example:               ArgumnetCount     Timeount     Gor message from queue       Unfortunately this is in no way limited to one person. There is a lot of non- native English speakers in our team who contribute to that, however I can also pinpoint some of the worst spelling mistakes to our Software Architect who is American, born and raised. These are also to be found even in emails, presentations, documents, whatever piece of written information we have in a software development company. I'd like to know how to find out if it is a serious issue or not? I've always met these spelling mistakes with concern, but my own, personal, **official** policy is that we are not paid to spell things right, we are paid to get things done, so inside the company I never really criticized anyone about it. But I have raised this issue with some of my close friends, and never settled it for good.
