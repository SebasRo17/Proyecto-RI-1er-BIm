I have been using _Mathematica_ for about a year. It is the first language that I have attempted to learn. I'm still very much a newbie, but there are moments I feel more like I am waving than drowning. As with many addictions, at first it left an unpleasant taste, but with time, using _Mathematica_ started to open up new possibilities and I have come to depend on it. It has occurred to me that there are a number of reasons why at some stage I would like to learn some new language(s) to complement _Mathematica_ and further nurture my 'coding brain'. At times I feel slightly handicapped by not really understanding the capabilities/pitfalls of, for example, `Do` loops and other constructs that seem common in many languages. Indeed, it would be nice to be able to understand/relate to programmers that don't use _Mathematica_. Although a lot of coding paradigms can be used in _Mathematica_ , I feel it would be instructive to spend some time learning strictly procedural, object- oriented, etc. programming styles in the context of another language. Which other programming languages should a _Mathematica_ -only user be interested in, so as to appreciate the underlying programming principles and constructs that one takes for granted with _Mathematica_? Alternatively, I understand that there are a number of languages that can be implemented or interfaced from within _Mathematica_. Would it be a worthwhile trying to learn other languages/coding styles without leaving the notebook environment?
