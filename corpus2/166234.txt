I think this might be a useful language feature and was wondering if any languages already support it. The idea is if you have:               class C       virtual F          statement1          statement2      and               class D inherits C       override F          statement1          statement2          C.F()      There would be a keyword applied to C.F() such that removing the last line of code above would cause a compiler error because it's saying "This method can be overridden but the implementation here needs to run no matter what".
