Hey everyone! By self-adaptive programs, I mean the programs which are able to adapt to specific situations. For example they are able to repair them selves or are able to change their behavior according to user's needs. Obviously they need some sort of A.I modules like Intelligent Agents or so on. My question is, what applications for these programs can you think of/exist? An obvious destructive (!) application could be a malicious program/virus which can change its strategy in attacking its victim based on some factors. The reason for this question is that I want to do some research on this topic as a university project and I want to know about different stuff and uses that could come into mind! Any response is greatly appreciated! :-)
