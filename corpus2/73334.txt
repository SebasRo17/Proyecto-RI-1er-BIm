I often hear co-workers saying to each other, "That's a horrible, horrible hack." What I can take away from that is that it's not good. When I asked them if it works they say "yes, but it's not good". Does that mean it's not a good solution? How is a solution bad if it works? Is it due to good practice? Or not maintainable? Is it using a side effect of code as a part of your solution? It's interesting to me when something is classified as a hack. How can you identify it?
