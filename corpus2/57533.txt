I have been doing Objective-C programming over the past few weeks, and I have learnt a lot. However, I see that there are other Web-companies offering services to consumers directly from their website that allow consumers to create their apps through a point and click and drag features without any code. Clearly they are more cost effective and fast than having a developer write an app. I was wondering if there are any advantages then of having a developer build an app for someone, other than the obvious advantage that its got a custom look and feel. Could someone please clarify, since Im new and would like to evaluate whether it is worthwhile spending time towards learning a whole new development environment when someone could just use a webservice to make an app for multiple platforms Thanks
