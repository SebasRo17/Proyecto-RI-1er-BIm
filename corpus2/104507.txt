In my current development situation, we have a lot of DLLs, executables, and static libraries. How do you decide what should go into a DLL? What should go into an executable? Why have separate functionality in different executable files? I'm hoping the answer will be concise, but this is a largely opinionated topic it would seem. How do you decide where functionality resides in a large-scale project (more than one executable file)? I'm expecting answers to range from, "Good Design" to "Modularity" to "Whatever management puts in a requirements doc".
