I have a problem with the configuration of the J-Connector plug-in with a MySQL database. Most of the time all works well, but sometimes the connection remains blocked for 2 hours and then it gives this error:               JDBC::error: "Communications link failure\n\nThe last packet successfully      received from the server was 7,200,110 milliseconds ago.  The last packet      sent successfully to the server was 7,200,047 milliseconds ago."      Note: I'm executing the query right after the connection is set, without waiting. It seems that the query is fetching results (with Mathematica running), but instead it remains blocked for 2 hours and then it fails. Edit: I have noticed that the connection is correctly estabilished, then during the execution of the query it magically disappears (I have seen this checking the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` with another connection to database), but the JDBC driver didn't know anything about this and then after 2 hours it gives the error. It looks like it has a 2 hours timeout (7,200,000 milliseconds) which I didn't set, my question is: how can I set it to a more reasonable time (like 1 minute)? So I can catch the error and re-execute the query without waiting for a long time. Or, anyway, do you have any other solution to handle MySQL connection problems?
