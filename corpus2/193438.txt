I've read that ios apps can communicate via unique urls. An online tutorial on tutsplus says > Communication between apps provides your application with an opportunity to > take advantage of other application’s functionality, send and receive data > between apps, and provide a rich user experience that “just works”. I have to admit that since I have no experience with objective c and cocoa I only scanned the article. But as far as I've understood the url based communication, your app can register a unique url that serves as a socket for communication. Is this not the perfect basis for a crude file system ? I know that all ios apps run in a sandbox and can only access their own data. I do recognose the merits of this design decision but still it seems cure and curse at the same time. This is not meant to be a discussion about apple's ecosystem and the concept of ios apps. **My question is simply:** Can url communication be used to create a file storage that works like a simple "desk" ? I would love an app that could store and host my files to allow a simpler workflow between different apps. Is this technically possible or did I misunderstand the url system ? Would apple allow an app like this in the app store ?
