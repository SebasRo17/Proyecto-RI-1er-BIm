In my job all developers that resolve a bug have to add a new unit test that warns about this type of bugs (in the case it occours again). If a unit test is not possible (for example, a webpage design issue), then QA department has to create a test case to manually check it. The idea behind this is that if a defect has not been detected before the product release is because there isn't an appropriate unit test to detect it. So the developer has to add it. The question is: is this common in any software development methodology? This technique has a name? I would like to learn more about it, but I need some information to start with it.
