If I am selling software commercially and I offer users free upgrade for 12 months after purchase, can I make them agree to a new licence when they download an upgrade? What should the original license say in order to stipulate this? And if I can do this, then wouldn't it be possible to put in the new license that they are no longer entitled to free upgrades _(being the devil's advocate here)_?
