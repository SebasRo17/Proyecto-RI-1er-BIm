I have a stack of timelapse microscopy images that I am trying to segment frame-by-frame using some of Mathematica's image processing functions. I have created a little interactive DynamicModule with a LocatorPane where the user can try out different image processing operations/parameters on a particular frame until an acceptable segmentation is arrived at for that frame. Once the segmentation for that frame is acceptable I would like the user to be able to store the generated segmentation image (aka save the "mask") and then move on to the next frame of the timelapse. The problem I am encountering is that when I use Append or AppendTo to store each segmentation image the time to Append gets very slow as the user goes through more and more frames (I have timelapse stacks of ~100 to 200 images to go through). Is there some way to generate a list of segmented masks frame-by- frame without using Append? I have used Reap and Sow in the past when a list is generated in one fell swoop but here I am going frame-by-frame in a sort of "store-as-you-go" manner. Any suggestions as to how I might do this?
