Is it possible to have an expression `x` such that its elements are only evaluated when they are individually accessed, for example when evaluating statements like `x[[1]]` or `f/@x`? The basic idea is that `x` is a list of `Get` commands, each of which loads a large expression (gigabytes), so that `x` can be terabytes in size yet it remains fairly manipulable within Mathematica. What I thought would work was something like:               x={Unevaluated[Get[...]],Unevaluated[Get[...]],...}      The problem with that however is that `Unevaluated` doesn't get stripped when I need it to, i.e. when calling something like `f[x[[1]]]`, because of Mathematica's evaluator semantics. The only workable alternative is to use `Hold` instead of `Unevaluated`, but that requires that I manually call `ReleaseHold` every time, which is ugly. I was hoping for something entirely transparent.
