Most security threats that I've heard of have arisen due to a bug in the software (e.g. all input is not properly sanity checked, stack overflows, etc.). So if we exclude all social hacking, are all security threats due to bugs? In other words, if there were no bugs, would there be no security threats (again, excluding the faults of humans such as disclosing passwords and such)? Or can systems be exploited in ways not caused by bugs?
