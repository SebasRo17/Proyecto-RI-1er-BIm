I have created a dashboard that looks fine on my screen and fits onto my screen at 100% magnification on Mathematica. When I try printing it, no matter what printing environment I use, I can not get it to print what is on the screen on a single or two consecutive A4 pages. Depending on the printing environment selected, it prints out either some of the page but not all of it, or prints out the page magnified a few times so that it ends up taking up about 8 A4 pages. When I click on Page Setup, nothing happens. I have also tried exporting to PDF first but the export ends up looking exactly as the printed version did. Here is the code: \--Some functions               GraphHeading[GraphLabel_] :=        TextCell[GraphLabel, FontWeight -> Bold, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"];     DropDownBoxHeading[BoxHeading_] :=        TextCell[BoxHeading, FontWeight -> Bold, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"];      \--Some Definitions               Tab3DropDownOpUSelection = "Haul Trucks";     Tab3DropDownMetricSelection = "Fuel";     Tab3DropDownOperationalUnit =        PopupMenu[        Dynamic[Tab3DropDownOpUSelection], {"Haul Trucks", "Loaders",          "Haul Trucks and Loaders", ""}];     Tab3DropDownMetric =        PopupMenu[        Dynamic[Tab3DropDownMetricSelection], {"Fuel", "Costs",          "Consumption Index", "Cost per Tonne"}];     Tab3MetricList = {"Fuel", "Costs", "Consumption Index",         "Cost per Tonne"};      \--Some things to display               Tab3Graph :=       Dynamic[ListLinePlot[{{{1, 0.96`}, {2, 0.6900000000000001`}, {3,            1.11`}, {4, 1.`}, {5, 1.3900000000000001`}, {6,            1.1500000000000001`}, {7, 1.3800000000000001`}, {8, 1.51`}, {9,            1.1500000000000001`}, {10, 0.51`}}, {{1, 1.06`}, {2, 0.75`}, {3,            1.22`}, {4, 1.1`}, {5, 1.53`}, {6, 1.27`}, {7, 1.52`}, {8,            1.6600000000000001`}, {9, 1.27`}, {10, 0.56`}}},         PlotMarkers -> Automatic,         PlotRange -> {{1, 10}, {0, 1.8260000000000003`}},         AxesOrigin -> {1, Automatic},         Frame -> {{True, False}, {True, False}},         PlotLabel -> "Haul Truck Fuel",         FrameLabel -> {"Week", "Litres", "", ""}, AspectRatio -> 1/3.5,         ImageSize -> {800, 300}, PlotStyle -> {Black, Black}]]     Tab3Stats1Table :=       Grid[{{"Metric", "Unit", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,          10}, {"Predicted Fuel", "Mlitres", 1.01`, 0.72`, 1.16`, 1.05`,          1.46`, 1.21`, 1.45`, 1.58`, 1.21`,          0.53`}, {"Upper Predicted Fuel", "Mlitres", 1.06`, 0.75`, 1.22`,          1.1`, 1.53`, 1.27`, 1.52`, 1.660000, 1.27`,          0.56`}, {"Lower Predicted Fuel", "Mlitres", 0.96, 0.6900000,          1.11`, 1.`, 1.3900, 1.1500, 1.38000, 1.51`, 1.15000,          0.51`}, {"Material Handled", "Mtonnes", 3.29`, 2.39`, 3.83`,          3.14`, 4.`, 3.2600000000000002`, 3.81`, 4.21`, 3.12`, 1.42`}},        Alignment -> Left,        Dividers -> {{Black, Black, Black, Gray, Gray, Gray, Gray, Gray,           Gray, Gray, Gray, Gray, Gray, Gray, Black}, {Black, Black, Gray,           Gray, Gray, Gray, Gray, Black}}]      \--Putting it all together               Tab3 := Column[{Row[{GraphHeading["Most Recent Update Week is Week "],            GraphHeading[10], " - ", GraphHeading[2013]}],          Column[{Grid[{{"Operational Unit",               "Metric"}, {Tab3DropDownOperationalUnit,               Tab3DropDownMetric,}}, Alignment -> Left], Tab3Graph,            Tab3Graph, Tab3Graph,            Grid[{{"         "}, {"Totals for Selected Week"}, {Dynamic[               Tab3Stats1Table]}, {"           "}},             Alignment -> {Left, Top}],            Column[{"Weekly Measures", Dynamic[Tab3Stats1Table]}]}]},         Alignment -> Center];      \--Use this to generate what is to be display and then hide the code and simply try to print the display.
