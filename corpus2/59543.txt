I want to convert the (x,y) coordinates you get from using a locator on a map to Lat/Lon coordinates - exactly like the GetCoordinates tool does when you right click on a map.               Manipulate[GeoGraphics[GeoPosition[{51.5164090, -0.0943590}],     GeoRange -> Quantity[0.20, "Miles"]], {u, Locator}, {u}]      ie if I create a simple map and use use right click -> GetCoordinates it will give me 3 pairs of values   1. Lat Lon   2. Lat Lon in degrees   3. (x,y) <\-- this is the one Locator returns. Simple demo map               GeoGraphics[GeoPosition[{51.5164090, -0.0943590}],      GeoRange -> Quantity[10, "Miles"]]      Im presuming its related to GeoPositionENU somehow but the starting point seems to change for each instance of the map.
