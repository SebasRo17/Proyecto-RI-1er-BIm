First I have               ContourPlot3D[{       (1 - p1) (1 - p2)^3 == p1 p2^3,        p1 p2^6 (c p1 + (1 - c) p2)^3 ((1 - c) p1 + c p2)^2          == (1 - p1) (1 -p2)^6 (1 - c p1 - (1 - c) p2)^3 (1 - (1 - c) p1 - c p2)^2      }, {p1, 0.2, 0}, {p2, 1, 0.5}, {c, 0, 1},      Lighting -> ({"Directional", White, #} & /@ Tuples[{-1, 1}, 3]),      Mesh -> None,      BoxRatios -> {2, 2, 1},     ContourStyle -> {Yellow, Directive[Red, Opacity[0.5]]},      BaseStyle -> {FontWeight -> "Bold", FontSize -> 20}]      which will show me (please don't mind the labels) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AmlnD.png) I want _Mathematica_ to plot the region between the yellow plane and the transparent red plane, so I use `RegionPlot3D` with the same set of equations.               RegionPlot3D[(1 - p1) (1 - p2)^3 > p1 p2^3 &&        p1 p2^6 (c p1 + (1 - c) p2)^3 (c p2 + (1 - c) p1)^2         > (1 - p1) (1 - p2)^6 (1 - (c p1 + (1 - c) p2))^3 (1 - (c p2 + (1 - c) p1))^2,      {p1, 0, 0.2}, {p2, 0.5, 1}, {c, 0, 1},      Mesh -> None, FaceGrids -> All, ViewPoint -> Front,PlotPoints->100]      which will give me the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ug62c.png) One will expect `RegionPlot3D` will give a single connected bulk but instead there are several rod-like artifacts. How to get a nice region plot with that set of equations? (Increasing plotpoints to 200 might work, but it takes so long...)
