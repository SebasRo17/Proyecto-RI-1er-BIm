I've been running a company for nearly 10 years, and all this time it's been just myself, another programmer (who's a great friend and cofounder), and a salesman (who's also a friend). Together, we've managed to do decent business and we've all managed to make a living, but we've been trying to expand for a long time now. Unfortunately, there are a few problems:   * The technology we use is not obsolete, but it's also not as popular compared to other web development options like PHP   * We work in a competitive market, competing against multi-million dollar companies   * We can't afford to pay new programmers or salesmen very well. We make enough money for ourselves, but unless we got a significant number of new customers we wouldn't be able to pay much.   * Because of the fact we can't pay much, we use a slightly more rare technology, and we compete against large companies, we find it difficult to find new programmers or salesman. We desperately need to expand, but when we try to get more customers, we can't support them with so few people (or their demands grow outside of our range of expertise) and when we try to hire new programmers and salesman, we usually don't get a high quality and they usually don't provide a major benefit for our company. Does anyone have some suggestions or tips on how we could expand?
