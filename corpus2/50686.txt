There are a lot of questions here about formatting of barcharts, but I couldn't find one matching mine. I seek to display data in stacked format, labeling each component of the stack and the total for each bar. I can't make it work for the life of me. As a starting place, consider               BarChart[{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}}, ChartLayout -> "Stacked",       ChartLabels -> {Range[2004, 2006], None}]      I want each component labeled as below -- ![goal](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wr6C9.png) My efforts to date result in some pieces appearing but never all, and often in the wrong places.
