I have my undergraduate final year project coming up and am very interested in lexers, parsers, compilers and so on. I would like to use the DLR (.NET 4.0 dynamic language runtime) for my undergraduate final year project, but am struggling to find a reason to use it! A domain specific language would be an idea, but most of the domains I can think of have already been done. A possibility was a primarily semantic web focused triple store query language similar to SPARQL, but the domain is rather complicated and the query engine would take quite a while to write and optimise. I am also thinking about different programming paradigms, particularly higher level ones such as array/collection programming languages rather than scalar. A language which is less _specific_ in terms of the domain, but with which it is 'easier to process X, which is commonly used or dealt with in situation Y' would be interesting. Another approach would be to attempt to port an existing language (or at least part of it, time permitting) to the DLR. Preferably not APL or Perl - I'm not a masochist. **Edit:** To clarify, by 'Port' I mean host an existing language on the DLR, such as IronJS, IronPython, IronRuby, etc. Does anyone have any ideas for a domain specific language, preferably but not necessarily suitable for the DLR?
