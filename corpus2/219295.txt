Recently I am very confused about my position in the company. Months ago, this company offered me the position of Software Architect and I accepted. But about one year passed and I came to realize that this "Software Architect" title in this company is almost totally different from the one I used to know and the one I see people discussing here. Below are several items what a software architect is responsible for. They are from This Post:                  A Systems Architect should:        1. Specify the high-level architecture        2. Participate in code reviews        3. Approve technologies used        4. Assist the developers in their coding effort        5. Maintain and monitor the development schedule        6. Produce SA artifacts, such as UML diagrams, Gantt charts and the like.      But as a "Software Architect" in this company, I can only touch the 6th Item together with a lot of coding. So this title in my company is more like a Senior Developer rather than a Software Architect. My questions are:   1\. Is it common for a company in IT industry to have their own definition of Job Titles?   2\. If the answer to question 1 is No, then is it legal for a company to do that? **Update**   The reason why this issue became a problem recently is that, our General Manager seems to want me to be responsible for a project which is being developing by many members, but he **never** authorizes me to lead other team members or coordinate between teams (coordination among teams is a must especially when are developing software suites). Instead, he just came to me and blame me when the project didn't get progressed as expected. Though I designed all the interfaces and classes of some modules for other members to work and did lots of coding, pushing and guaranteeing the progress is beyond my responsibility especially when this Software Architect is not the usual one we see, I feel it is so unfair to meÔºÅ
