I was calculating the set of lattice vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^4$ which have taxicab norm $r$. For example, executing               Solve[Abs[c1] + Abs[c2] + Abs[c3] + Abs[c4] <= 2, {c1, c2, c3, c4}, Integers]      yields the 41 lattice vectors of taxicab norm 2 or less. This works fine up through $r=19$, at which point there are 97,281 solutions. However, at $r=20$,               Solve[Abs[c1] + Abs[c2] + Abs[c3] + Abs[c4] <= 20, {c1, c2, c3, c4}, Integers]      simply returns {{}}. According to the documentation, Solve[] yields {{}} "if the set of solutions is full-dimensional", which is clearly not the case for the above, which has a finite, though large, number of solutions. Also, as far as I could tell, nowhere in the documentation does it specify that there is a cap on the number of possible solutions. Question: _Is there are a reason for this? And is there a way to coax Solve[] into returning the correct answer?_ I know of the obvious though tedious mathematical tricks for reducing the problem into several lower-dimensional problems, but I'd like to solve it directly if possible.
