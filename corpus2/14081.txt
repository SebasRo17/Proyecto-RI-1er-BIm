Let's see an example of a first order ODE system : $$\begin{align*} y_1'&=a_{11}\cdot y_1+a_{12}\cdot y_2 \qquad(1)\\\ y_2'&=a_{21}\cdot y_1+a_{22}\cdot y_2 \qquad(2) \end{align*}$$ where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are functions we are to solve, and $a_{11},\; a_{12},\; a_{21},\; a_{22}$ are constants. I know 2 methods to solve this, one is to eliminate $y_1$ or $y_2$ by replacing, and then we will get 2 decoupled second order ODEs $$ y_1''-(a_{11}+a_{22})y_1'+(a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21})y_1=0 $$ the other ODE is similar. The other method: Try to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix $\\{\\{a_{11},a_{12}\\},\\{a_{21},a_{22}\\}\\} $, and then get the general solutions for system of $y_1$ and $y_2$ simultaneously. Though the second method is more popular in the textbooks, I like the first one more. **So my question is: Which function in _Mathematica_ can decouple the ODE system by the _first_ method automatically?**
