I need to call a program from PHP and pass some vars and/or sets of key-value pairs to it. How do I pass these vars, through arguments to the called function? `exec("/path/to/program flag1 flag2 [key1=A,key2=B]");` Or is there a better method to achieve this? Somebody suggested to me to write them into a txt file and pass the path to it to as an argument instead, `exec("/path/to/program path_to_txt_file);` but Iâ€™m not to excited about this method.
