I want to set constraints to my parameters, e.g., "m", but Mma gives nonsensical output. How could I avoid this phenomenon by using another but "equivalent expression"? Or, is this just in my computer (i.e. a non- reproducible problem)? case 1. output is as expected:               ToExpression[      ToString[2.] <> ToString[">"] <> ToString["m"] <> ">=" <>        ToString[1.]]      > >     2. > m >= 1. >   case 2. output is unexpected:               ToExpression[      ToString[0.10465923419974825] <> ToString[">"] <> ToString["m"] <>        ">=" <> ToString[-6.0857416503171394*^-6]]      > >     -60.8574 >
