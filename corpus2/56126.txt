I have this second-order polynom: $$ 6xy+8y^2-12x-26y+11=0 $$ And I need to reduce it to a canonical form of a second-order curve. I solved this, but is it possible to draw a plot of the original equation to check whether my solution is correct? Something like               Plot[6 x*y + 8 y^2 - 12 x - 26 y + 11, {x, -20, 20}, PlotRange -> {-20, 20}]      Now this draws an empty plot. Thank you.
