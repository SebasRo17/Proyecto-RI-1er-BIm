Recently I have used Mathematica to simulate the concrete structure. The most important point is generate random concrete aggregate. As you know, concrete aggregate can be looked as a polyhedron. We can use ConvexHull to generate polyhedron.               Needs["TetGenLink`"];          data3D = {{0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}};     Graphics3D[Point[data3D]];          {pts, surface} = TetGenConvexHull[data3D];     Graphics3D[GraphicsComplex[pts, Polygon[surface]]];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SLdxs.png) Question 1: How to define two polyhedron intersect or not? I have written a Module, But its speed is very slow. Question 2: When the concrete aggregate become more and more in a cubic region, it is very difficult to add new aggregate in the region, How can deal with this problem ? The key is define the space relationship between line(segment) and plane(triangle):               HelenFormulaofTriangle[triangle_] := Module[        {a, b, c, p},             a = Norm[(triangle[[1]] - triangle[[2]])];        b = Norm[(triangle[[1]] - triangle[[3]])];        c = Norm[(triangle[[2]] - triangle[[3]])];             p = 0.5*(a + b + c);             Sqrt[p*(p - a)*(p - b)*(p - c)]             (*        triangle={{0,0,0},{1,0,0},{0,1,0}};        HelenFormulaofTriangle[triangle];        *)             ];                    PointInandOnorOut3DTriangle[point_, triangle_] := Module[        {},             If[         HelenFormulaofTriangle[{point, triangle[[1]], triangle[[2]]}] +            HelenFormulaofTriangle[{point, triangle[[1]], triangle[[3]]}] +            HelenFormulaofTriangle[{point, triangle[[2]], triangle[[3]]}] >           HelenFormulaofTriangle[triangle],         0,         1]                       ];                  triangle={{0,0,0},{1,0,0},{0,1,0}};        HelenFormulaofTriangle[triangle];        point={0,0,1};        PointInandOnorOut3DTriangle[point,triangle];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ka17C.png)
