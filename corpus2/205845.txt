I'm trying to decide on what format I should save data in, and hopefully this question will help me come to a decision. The program I'm writing uses 'databases' in which `word=meaning` (not a dictionary, that was just an example). I don't really want people to be able to manually edit these 'databases' without my program easily, but at the same time I'm looking for interoperability between programming langauges (namely C#, PHP, Java and Objective C) At the minute, the main contenders are SQLite, XML and SQL Server CE (although PHP doesn't have support for Server CE, but that doesn't have to be too much of an issue). Really, my question is, should I use encryption because I have read that it is often just as easy to decrypt? And if you support encryption, how do you deal with the encryption key - do I just generate a long, complicated string? Or is binary enough? Nothing in the database is too critical, however I would like to have an `isEditable` 'key' so my program knows whether to allow edits or not. And I'd also like to use my own file extension.
