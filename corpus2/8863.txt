Is there a quick way to search all built-in Mathematica functions by name? Say I want to find all functions whose name contains "Graph", such as GraphPlot, NeighborhoodGraph, Subgraph, and so forth. When I enter "Graph" into Mathematica's documentation system, I get some, but not all of the functions whose names contain "Graph". I also get a lot of names which are not functions, as well as other material of varying relevance. I just want to search for functions by name or partial name. Also, I don't want to see functions from optional packages -- only the basic ones that load when Mathematica starts up.
