I have been tasked with developing a short product backlog for the following: > A media player application is needed for playing mp3 files. It should have > the ability to search the users file structure for playable files which can > be played or imported into a media library for playing later. There should > be the usual options for starting, pausing and stopping playback of a > selected fileâ€¦ My solution / user stories are as follows:   * As a user I can use the media player application so that I can play MP3 files.   * As a user I want the ability to search for playable files to play them later   * As a user I want the ability to search for files so that I am able to import them to my media library.   * As a user I can use certain options on an app so that I can start, pause and playback a file. Am I on the right track?
