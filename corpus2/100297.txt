We are outsourcing a development to a small team of offshore developers. Our in house process for code review is manual, paper based, based on a waterfall model requiring "big bang" delivery. It cannot be changed. Past experience is these devs are proficient and reliable, however come time to deliver, the overhead of reviews becomes a difficult burden for everyone involved and issues are being found too late. We use CVS for our source repository. They take a copy of the CVS repo, receiving regular updates to the most recent code base, and use GIT locally to manage their changes. When ready to deliver, send us a tarball of an upto date CVS clone with their work merged into it. We then code review and check it in. We are looking for a tool chain to support a code review process where we can do regular, light weight reviews outside our inhouse process, so that when the inhouse process kicks in, we can do it "go fast" mode as we have already reviewed most of the code. Limitations are that there systems and ours are disconnected. We use sneaker net to transfer files between us. The best we can do is have one machine in house that VPN's into their system. The source is commercial code and cannot be placed anywhere where it is exposed to the internet. One option they have suggested is Gerrit - which they plan to use on their site. Is there a way to share and synchronise the gerrit database between sites, given the limitation of the sneaker net? Does anyone else have a solution to tis kind of problem?
