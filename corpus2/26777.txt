I have developed a web application for a client which is live to their customers. Recently, the application has been sold in such as way that it is replicated to other domain names so there are 4+ instances of the application which I am to develop and maintain. At the moment, each copy of the app has it own SVN repository and when it comes to making changes to the application that effects all instances, I update one and then use Beyond Compare to merge changes over to the other copies. Would it be a better solution to use svn branches to maintain a core system and to merge out to sub branches and visa versa for bugs? Each application may have changes made to it that are client specific, such as logos, colours etc. Are Branches the best way to go or continue to have each in their own repository and use BC to merge where necessary?
