Lets consider that I've this function:               fn = a*x^2 + b*x + c;      The idea here is to assign automatically the variables `a`, `b`, `c` and `x` to a function so it becomes something like that:               fn[x_,a_,b_,c_] := a*x^2 + b*x + c      In order to do this I've tried to extract the varibles from `fn` using `Variables`:               Sort@Variables@fn      > {a, b, c, x} Then in order to apply it to the function `fn` I do the following:               fn1@Variables@fn /. List -> Sequence      > fn1[a, b, c, x] **Questions:**   * Is it possible to add the `Blank`s to the former expression in order to have `fn1[a_,b_,c_,x_]`?  > One of my fail attempt to do this was to use `Blank@#&/@Sort@Variables@fn` > but it's obviously not working.   * One other point is that if you consider that you've found a way to automaticly have `fn1[a_,b_,c_,x_]`, how to assign the value of `fn` to `fn1[a_,b_,c_,x_]` without having the `fn1[a_,b_,c_,x_] is protected` message?
