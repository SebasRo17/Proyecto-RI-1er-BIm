I have a website where I'm going to be partnering with another website. They want to view one specific page of mine, in their [WordPress] website. They aren't developers, so I looked into how to do this. At first glance, it appears as though the WordPress iFrame plugin is the easiest route. My next thought is, they'll probably still want to show their own header and footer in their page, while showing the content of my page in the iFrame. No big deal. I'm thinking of developing a View on my [MVC 4] website that will be used ONLY for their iFrame purposes. Since they'll probably want their own headers, I'll probably design a page that uses no layout, and just a custom header and/or footer that shows that the information is coming from MY website. Here are my questions: 1) The page that will be displayed contains MANY anchor tags, if that's embedded in an iFrame, what happens if the user on THEIR website clicks the link in the iFrame? Does the iFrame page change, or does their ENTIRE page change? 2) Depending on the answer to #1, should I just disable all hyperlinks/anchor tags in the iFrame page on my site so it doesn't cause any funkyness on their site? 3) What if I WANT some hyperlinks on the iFrame page so they come visit my website? Is that a matter of telling them to put a real link on their site to my own? 4) What security concerns do I have with allowing a page of my own to be accessible via iFrame from another site? Should I only allow traffic to my iFrame page when it's from their site? If it's not from their site, then re- direct to my "real" page? Thanks all!
