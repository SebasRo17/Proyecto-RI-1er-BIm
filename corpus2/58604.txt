This text file logs the time that a process (identified by a number) changes state ("Brown", "Blue" etc.")               2014-08-29 03:59:52 , 27273 , Brown     2014-08-29 03:59:53 , 27276 , Green     2014-08-29 03:59:55 , 27276 , Brown     2014-08-29 03:59:57 , 27303 , Red     2014-08-29 03:59:58 , 27303 , Green     2014-08-29 03:59:59 , 27303 , Brown     2014-08-29 04:00:04 , 27317 , Brown     2014-08-29 04:00:07 , 27331 , Blue     2014-08-29 04:00:07 , 27334 , Blue     2014-08-29 04:00:08 , 27331 , Red     2014-08-29 04:00:08 , 27334 , Cyan      What I try to do is to plot horizontal bars as time intervals, colored according to the third column, where x-axis is time, y-axis is process id number. One of the colors (probably Cyan) should not be displayed, as it marks the interval end. It is actually a timeline of many parallel events. DatePlot does not seem to help. Any suggestions?
