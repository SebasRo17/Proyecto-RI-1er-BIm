Background: I'm a microsoft DBA/IT type person by day, an iOS and Mac developer by night. I have one app in the App Store and another one in the works. I try to spend as much time as possible working on my two apps, but with a new daughter and other (non computer) hobbies, I find it hard to spend more than a few hours every week programming. I'm wondering how this compares to other developers. I see a lot of apps out there written by single developers who don't do iOS development as their main job. Are they spending 4 hours a night working on their projects, or do they just plug away for a year or two before releasing anything?
