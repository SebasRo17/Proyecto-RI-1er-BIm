First of all, I don't know how `ContinuedFraction[]` or `Convergents[]` are implemeneted, and I think it is immaterial to my question. for some number $x$ there's an associated continued fraction representation $[a_1,...,a_i,...]$ (finite or not), and, for this matter, two other sequences $[x_1,...,x_i,...]$ and $[d_1,...,d_i,...]$ defined like this: As we follow the implementation of some $a_i$ into the fraction, further action is due on some number $x_{i+1}=n_{i+1}+d_{i+1}$. It consists of setting $a_{i+2}=n_{i+1}$, and repeating the action on $x_{i+2}=1/d_{i+1}=n_{i+2}+d_{i+2}$. I am interested in an (possibly) efficient way of extracting the $[d_1,...,d_i,...]$ for some number $x$, preferably using functional programming in Mathematica. Any clue\lead would be very much appreciated! **I know I didn't give any base code to work with which is annoying, and I don't really expect anyone to come forth and solve someone else's problem from start to end. Having said that, hopefully, comments regarding this annoyance will be spared..**
