This is what I call a "combined" getter/setter method (from jQuery):               var foo = $("<div>This is my HTML</div>"),         myText;          myText = foo.text(); // myHTML now equals "This is my HTML" (Getter)     foo.text("This is a new value"); // The text now equals "This is a new value")      This is the same logic with separate (theoretical) methods:               var foo = $("<div>This is my HTML</div>"),         myText;          myText = foo.getText(); // myHTML now equals "This is my HTML" (Getter)     foo.setText("This is a new value"); // The text now equals "This is a new value")      **My Question:** When designing a library like jQuery, why would you decide to go the first route and not the second? Isn't the second approach clearer and easier to understand at a glance?
