I have an associative binary operation '`.`', which I often use in this sort of way:               result = expr1 . expr2 . expr3 . expr4      The '`.`' operation is very fast, but the individual subexpressions are often _hard_ to compute. So I would like my '`.`' operation to automatically parallelize itself, evaluating each of the separate subexpressions in separate kernels before finally taking the results and actually performing the operation. How can I achieve this in Mathematica? It seems there are several challenges. One is to prevent the subexpressions evaluating before the '`.`' operation is evaluated.
