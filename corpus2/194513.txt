I'm working on a realtime multiplayer game using Django and gevent-socketio, I'm facing some issues: I need to send an update of the game state to connected players every X seconds (~4 seconds), so basically I need to execute a function every x seconds which does some calculations and sends the connected players the new game state. What is the easiest way to achieve this? is using cron a good choice here or should I look for other tools like celery or ...? Also, the function needs to operate on some data. querying the database every time the function is executed does not seems to be a good idea, where can I store the game data (which is updated frequently during the game)?
