I am just starting out learning Visual Basic 2010. I have books and videos. The books all seem to be written for people who have some programming experience, even the books that say they are for beginners. The videos were great until they started talking about variables. I got the basics of them but they started into complicated variables and I donâ€™t see the need for them right away. Where can I go to see code for fairly intricate applications written out, with an over lay of definitions of which part of the code is a method as opposed to a class and so on? Also, I am working at a company that does not use SQL. So I need to use Access 2007 for all of my tables. Is there much of a difference to the coding?
