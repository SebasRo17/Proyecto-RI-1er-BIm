I usually works remotely using kernels on our hpc and front-end on my local laptop. This enable me do relatively large computation within my laptop(IP address of my laptop may change frequently). But there is a problem when come across packages. Since I manage all the packages on my local computer, I can't just use `Get["mypack.m"]` when I use remote kernel, instead, I have to copy all the packages to my remote machine before `Get`. However, I'm constantly developing the packages and copying them back and forth between local and remote computer is quiet tedious. Are there simpler ways to deal with it?
