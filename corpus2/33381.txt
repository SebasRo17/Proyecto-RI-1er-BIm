I have written a `Manipulate` code carrying out some very complicated tasks. There is no problem for the first run, but if I click the reset button to reset all variables to their initial states (which is also ok) and click the run button a second time, then it is very likely that the Mathematica kernel will crash during the re-run progress, the frequency for such crash happening is about 9 out of 10 times. I have spent almost a month trying to track down the source of this problem, but failed. I also asked the Wolfram support team, they suggested to implement the `Quit` function in the reset button as a workaround, such that the reset button will make the kernel quit, since the first run is always ok. Now the problem is, I cannot directly put `Quit[]` inside the button, for by doing this the kernel loses all definiton about the enclosing `Manipulate`. So I need the reset button doing two tasks:   1. Quit the kernel.   2. Make Mathematica automatically re-run the enclosing `Manipulate` code. I wonder if this is possible?
