I am a non-programmer that has used the services of : freelancer, odesk, etc I've tried asking for what i need but, I can't find anyone who can show me any type of example similar to what I request in the specs for the web- programming. They have front ends and back ends, but they don't fulfill true "live" website requirements. "live" as to be ready to support traffic, keys in hand, can be updated constantly by me, ... How do I figure how to evaluate a programmer ? How do I bid the appropriate price for the services ?
