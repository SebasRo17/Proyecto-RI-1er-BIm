I recently got into home-based hours-based programming work and one of the problems I am having is that deadlines I say to my clients are not often met. Some factors come into play:   1. I run into a coding problem that requires research time, which adds a couple of time to my specified deadline.   2. There are times when my internet is down for half a day or even a whole day.   3. There are some inquiries left unanswered (via email) and many other factors. I was wondering how I can specify deadlines which will take into consideration any unexpected factors that might delay it or something like that, which of course, will not put a frown into my clients' face, hehe. By the way, a client asked me to develop a site from scratch using Django in which I have not much experience of. He knew that and he consented to me doing some research while in development. I said I would finish the project in about 3 weeks yet I did not expect Django to be such a massive nerve-wracking framework, my internet was down during some days, and I only worked less than 10 hours on the holy week. Thanks in advance!
