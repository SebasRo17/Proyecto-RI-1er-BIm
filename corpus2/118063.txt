Currently, I'm very comfortable with building tools/web apps in an ASP.NET environment. I'm not really looking to leave tbh, as I really like C#, ASP.NET, MVC 3, Visual Studio, etc. However, right now I know almost nothing about PHP and that seems like a deficiency that I'd like to rectify. Are there any books (or other learning methods) that would be a good resource to learn PHP? Obviously there are plenty of beginning PHP books, but I am already comfortable with much of what is involved with building a web page, and interested in focusing on PHP itself which might not be compatible with the scope of some beginning PHP books. I went through the PHP Manual quite a bit, and it doesn't seem to flow as smoothly as might be ideal. Is there a beginning PHP book that would be appropriate? I miss the cohesiveness that most books contain when looking through those samples. There is lots of info more, but it feels more like a reference while coding than a primary learning vehicle.
