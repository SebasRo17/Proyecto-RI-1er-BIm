In Dijkstra's paper "Humble Programmer", he mentions that he gave some volunteers a problem to solve: > “I have run a little programming experiment with really experienced > volunteers, but something quite unintended and quite unexpected turned up. > None of my volunteers found the obvious and most elegant solution. Upon > closer analysis this turned out to have a common source: their notion of > repetition was so tightly connected to the idea of an associated controlled > variable to be stepped up, that they were mentally blocked from seeing the > obvious. Their solutions were less efficient, needlessly hard to understand, > and it took them a very long time to find them.” What was the problem Dijkstra gave to the volunteers? What were the solutions?
