This seems like it should be a simple question, but I am running into some difficulty in doing this with _Mathematica_. Right now, I have a list like this:               data1={0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 10, 3, 11, 1, 0, 0, 32, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 2, 0, 25, 0, 1, 0, 1,             0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 13, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 95, 4, 16, 11, 2, 0, 0,             81, 35, 0, 0, 0, 33, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 42, 0, 0, 0};      I want to insert "1997" into the list after each element and transpose it, so that it will look like so: `{{1997,0},{1997,0},{1997,0}...}`. So far so good. Unfortunately, the only way I know how to do this is to manually create a list of equal length to `data1` (70 "1997"s in a row). I also do not know how to create a list that is just 70 "1997"s in a row. I've plumbed the documentation and tried every command I can think of, but the closest I can get are either functions or a list that resembles `{{1997,0,1997,0,1997,0...}` etc.
