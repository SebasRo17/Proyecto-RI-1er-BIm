Suppose I have a few lists of numbers and want to exponentiate element-wise, then sum up everything into a polynomial. For example, if I have               a = {1,2,3}     b = {2,4,6}     c = {3,2,1}      I would like to get               poly = xy^2z^3 + x^2y^4z^6 + x^3y^2z      Unfortunately, I am not too familiar with the functional programming style Mathematica is intended to be used for, and I can only write something like               For[i = 1, i < Length[a] + 1, i++,      term = x^Part[a, i]*y^Part[b, i]*z^Part[c, i];     poly = poly + term;]      As you may expect, this is taking quite a long time to evaluate. Would anybody have any thoughts as to how I would rewrite this to make it more efficient?
