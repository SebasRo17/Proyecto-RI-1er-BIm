Assume that we are given a symbol `p={x,y}` which should represent a 2D point. If `x` and `y` have numerical values then we can plot the point uisng               Graphics[Point[p]]      Next, I wanted to plot some setting for various `x` and `y`, so I thought I could use the `With` command and have something like:               With[{x = 1, y = 1},      Graphics[Point[p]]      ]      This doesn't work. I guess it has something to do with the order of evaluations, holding stuff etc. but I cannot figure out how to solve this. So the question is how to use `With` together with `Graphics`?
