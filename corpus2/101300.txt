What is the difference between unit testing and integration testing when it come to web development (where 90-95% of the code relies on a database)? One thing I here all the time is that unit testing should not deal with databases and integration testing should. The issue I have with this is that to me that means the only difference between unit testing and integration testing is the data source and if that is the case, you are testing the same functionality. If the functionality that is tested is the same, why even bother with unit testing and always test against a database?
