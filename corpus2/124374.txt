I am now entering the world of java ee 6. And I am supposed to used different technologies like jsf, jpa, different kinds of beans and all that stuff. I am learning using the netbeans IDE, which is, I should say, very efficient when it comes to getting the work done. It is just that, I came from the old school servlet programming environment using scriptlets on them jsp pages where you get to write every line and every request parameter/attribute you have to set manually. which is somehow good because you get to understand you program THAT WELL. but with this java ee 6, with the code generators from NETBEANS, I get to create controllers, jsf pages and entities without writing any code (taken aside the DB part though). I do understand the flow of the application but not to the degree that I can understand what the line does, how does it reached, what are the use of the variables and what does it do after. all the nitty gritty stuff. to make it short, I am using generators without REALLY understanding the code that well (mostly on the new tags by jsf). I just want to ask if this is a bad path/practice or is it ok because we want PRODUCTIVITY?
