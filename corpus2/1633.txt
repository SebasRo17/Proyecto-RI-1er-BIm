I want to write a function that generates a square matrix from sublists. My sublists are `a = Range[0, x, 0.5]; b = Range[0.25, x + 0.25, 0.5];` Suppose x=2, then I can manually evaluate {a,b,a,b,a} to generate an 5x5 matrix. I want to make the matrix automatically, of course, but without using a loop. I've tried different ways to do it, with Nest, Range and Table, but I can't make it work. Do I absolutely have to use a loop?
