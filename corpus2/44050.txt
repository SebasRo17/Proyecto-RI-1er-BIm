I have cut down a DynamicModule that was updating unexpectedly and found the following behaviour I don' t understand. If I do this I get one random value as expected               Dynamic[      th = RandomReal[{-1, 1}];      th     ]      In this case I also get one value as expected               DynamicModule[{th},      Dynamic[ RandomReal[{-1, 1}]]     ]      However, in this case the value is updating continuously. I did not expect this.               DynamicModule[{th},      Dynamic[       th = RandomReal[{-1, 1}];       th      ]     ]      Why does it do this and how do I make it give me just one value? Edit Here is a fuller example to show what I am aiming for. The DynamicModule has two parts that are wrapped in Dynamic and information from the first (set up and calculation) must be shared with the second (graphics).               DynamicModule[{th, ft, rr = 1, f = 0.2345, m, c, x, res},      Column[{        Row[{Slider[Dynamic[rr], {0, 10}], " ran amp = ", Dynamic[rr]}],        Dynamic[         th = Table[            Cos[2 \[Pi] f (n - 1)] + RandomReal[{-rr, rr}], {n, 400}];         ft = Fourier[th, FourierParameters -> {-1, -1}];         res = FindFit[Abs[ft[[1 ;; 200]]], m x + c, {c, m}, x];         {m, c} /. res         ],        Dynamic[         ListPlot[Abs[ft[[1 ;; 200]]], PlotRange -> All,          ImageSize -> 5 72,           Epilog -> {Line[{{1, c}, {200, m 200 + c}} /. res]}]         ]        }]      ]
