I know that this is an extremely basic question, but I am having a lot of trouble finding the answer in the documentation. When I import an image (for example, `Import[test.png]`), Mathematica often displays it smaller than the _actual_ size of the image. How do I force Mathematica to display the imported image at actual size? I may want to display such images using `Grid`. For example, suppose that `fname` is a list of ***.png** file names. Then I may want to import and display all of those images using a command like:               fname = FileNames["*.png"];     table = Transpose[{fname, Table[Import[fname[[i]]], {i, 1, Length[fname]}]}];     Grid[table]      and I'd like the images displayed at actual size. I know that this is a very basic question, but I really appreciate your time.
