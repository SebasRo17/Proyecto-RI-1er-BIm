While browsing around on SO, I came across an answer that suggested using a `try-catch-finally` clause to fix the problem he was having. (A rare bug that sometimes happened to his users). Someone commented that it was a valid solution, but he said it was not recommended for production code. > Is this true? Why is it not recommended for production code? It seems perfectly valid to me if it is used for catching exceptions. In this context it was for an app and users are very discouraged from continuing if the app just crashes seemingly randomly. > He also mentioned that it could fail at anytime. Is this true as well?
