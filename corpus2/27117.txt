When using the InlineMathCell one types `Ctrl`+`9` within the text cell, and gets a slot for starting typing the InlineMathCell part. When typing the content of the InlineMathCell is slightly highlighted by a light pink color. As soon as the typing goes outside of the InlineMathCell, the highlighting disappears, and the InlineMathCell background looks white. My question is: How can I change the highlighting color of an InlineMathCell to make it more visible? Reaction to the statement that this question already has an asnwer: NO IT HAD NOT BEFORE THE PRESENT ANSWER OF SILVIA. See the discussion below.
