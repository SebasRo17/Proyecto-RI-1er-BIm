I have an ordinary differential equation that contains coefficient functions that depend implicitly on the independent variable via an algebraic equation. I am trying to go ahead and use NSolve to solve for that coefficient function, but it doesn't work, even approximately. The problem seems to be in the evaluation of NSolve, but I can't fix it. Anybody knows help?               PP=a^5+a^2 +3w+4          (* 4+a^2+a^5+3 w *)          sol=NDSolve[{f'[w]==(a/.NSolve[PP,a][[1]]),f[0]==0},f,{w,0,3}][[1]]          (*Out[2]= {f->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,3.}},<>]}*)          f'[0]/. sol          (*Out[3]= -1.13496*)          NSolve[PP/. w->0,a][[1]]          (* Out[4]= {a->-1.43359} *)
