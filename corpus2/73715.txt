I recently stumbled accross this article from a few years ago. It argues that significant differences in the culture surrounding VB and C#, not the actual differences in the language, contribute to C# coders being generally more talented than VB coders. Obviously, that caused a lot of flame wars and the question of whether C#ers or VBers are the dumber will never be answered. That being said, the writers claim that the culture surrounding a particular platform contributes to the quality of the team could still be plausible. For example, even though Java is more efficient to develop apps with at the moment, a team of Google Go developers would seem likely to be of a higher caliber on average than a team of Java developers, since to learn Go, a developer probably has to be a super-early adopter and a frontier-hacking whiz. So, in a nutshell, **how does the culture surronding one platform or another affect the quality of the average developer on that platform, if at all?**
