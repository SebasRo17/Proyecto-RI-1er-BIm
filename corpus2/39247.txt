Basically I want to build a chart like something I would do in Excel. It should look like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BRKoP.png) Here is the formula I'm using and what I've done so far               a[r_, n_, d_] := (((1 + r)^n) - 1)/(1 - (1 + r)^-d)          TableForm[        Table[AccountingForm[a[r, 30, d], 3],              {r, .000000000001, .15, .01}, {d, 15, 40, 5}],        TableHeadings -> {               {"0%","1%","2%","3%","4%","5%","6%","7%","8%","9%","10%","11%","12%","13%","14%"},               {"15", "20", "25", "30", "35", "40"}          }]      This is the output I'm getting: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ELrNe.png) Basically all I want is the integer plus 2 decimal places. What am I missing? Is there a way to automatically generate the headings based on the changing value of r and d?
