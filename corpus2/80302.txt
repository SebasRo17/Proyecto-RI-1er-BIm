What do you think would be the primary reasons to make APIs with REST or OData instead of just making everything custom (for example only using GET requests, even for setting variables). Reasons for the opposite also welcome. As a bit of background, it's going to be used for a request that is sent once every few minutes as a master-server updater for a game (as well as by clients for querying).
