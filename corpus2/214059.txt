I often hear that a real programmer can easily learn any language within a week. Languages are just tools for getting things done, I'm told. Programming is the ultimate skill that must be learned and mastered. How can I make sure that I'm actually learning **how to program** rather than simply learning the details of a language? And how can I develop programming skills that can be applied towards all languages instead of just one?
