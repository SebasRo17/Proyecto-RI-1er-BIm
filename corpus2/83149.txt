I have recently started my journey to learn programming, and got my self a book on Objective-C. The thing is though: I get stuck quite often, trying to figure out how to solve the different exercises. I am quite new, currently on chapter 5 and trying to figure out how to do the different exercises. I get stuck and can't solve the exercise, so I look up the solution on the official forum and try to understand how they solved it. Then I keep thinking that the authors intention must to be able to do the following exercises, so I get a little worried about not being able to do all exercises. So I was wondering: is it bad learning behaviour to look up the solution online, and try to understand the method behind the solution, or should I keep sticking with that method, and learning it somehow sooner or later? What did you do when you were in the same learning process as me?
