**Q1** : I need to simplify some algebraic expression, according to particular pattern, namely: \begin{equation*} x^m = \left\\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 & \text{if } m \text{ is even} \\\ x & \text{if } m \text{ is odd} \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} for example: $$ a x^3 + b x y-c x^7 y^2 $$ should be simplified to $$ ax + bxy - cxy^2 $$ I need something like:               a x^3 + b x y - c x^7 y^2 /.{x^_ -> ... }      but, that will recognize the parity of the each power in the expression. **Q2** : How one can get only one term in the sum? For example, in the example there are three terms $$ a x^3, \ b x y, \ -c x^7 y^2 $$ is there any possibility to decompose the full expression to               A = {a x^3, b x y, - c x^7 y^2}
