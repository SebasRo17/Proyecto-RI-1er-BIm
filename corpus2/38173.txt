I want to change the color of a button while it is pressed, pause for a short time and then change the color back to the original color. I can't seem to figure out how to do this (tried various forms of `DynamicModule` and `Dynamic`, but no luck). This is what I tried so far:               Manipulate[       DynamicModule[{simulationFlag, bgnd = Automatic},         simulationFlag = newSimulation;         Pause[0.5];         Dynamic[bgnd = Automatic; {simulationFlag}]],       {{newSimulation, 0.02}, ControlType -> None},       Row[{         Button["New Simulation", Dynamic[newSimulation = newSimulation+1; {bgnd=Yellow}],           Background -> Dynamic[bgnd]]}]     ]
