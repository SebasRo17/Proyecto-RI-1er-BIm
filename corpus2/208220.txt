I am working on an application which is completely written using server side method in asp.net web forms with c# . Now my team lead wants to convert whole application to ajax , in that approach we need to do the following tasks one by one . 1- Change all page methods into web methods so all will be static methods 2- Use jquery ajax to call all web methods . 3- bind html using json response. Now i am looking for some framework which can make my json html binding work bit easy but most of the frameworks like (knockout) are much compatible with MVC framework . I have two main concern points:   1. Is it good idea to convert all methods into web methods and use ajax ?    2. If i have to work with this approach what is the best framework i can use ?
