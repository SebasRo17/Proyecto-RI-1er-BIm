I have a function, `r[t]`, which is a piecewise function that generates a 3D vector. It looks like this:               r[t_] = Piecewise[{{{5 t, 0, 3 (1 + Cos[t])}, 0 <= t <= π},      {{5 Cos[t - 3  π/2] + 5*π, 5 Sin[t - 3 π/2] + 5, 0},  π < t <= 2 π},      {{5*π + 3*Cos[t - 3 π/2], 2*5 - 3 + 3*Sin[t - 3 π/2],  1/(2 π) (t - 2 π)^2},       2 π < t <= 4 π},      {{-3 (t - 17 π/3), 10, -1/π t^2 + 10 t - 22 π},   4 π < t <= 5 π},      {{-3 t + 17 π, 10, -972 π + 540 t - (99 t^2)/π + (6 t^3)/π^2},        5 π < t <= 6 π},      {{-π - 3 Sin[t], 9/40 (1/3 (20 + 18 π) - t)^2, 3 Cos[t] - 3}, 6 π < t <= 8 π},      {{-25 π + 25 t - (19 t^2)/(4 π) + t^3/(4 π^2),  -(25/2) (140 - 132 π + 27 π^2) +      (15 (80 - 74 π + 15 π^2) t)/(2 π) -  (3 (180 - 164 π + 33 π^2) t^2)/(8 π^2) -      ((-50 + 45 π - 9 π^2) t^3)/(20 π^3), 1056 - (360 t)/π + (81 t^2)/(2 π^2) - (3 t^3)/(2 π^3)},        8 π < t <= 10 π}}];      I am very new to Mathematica (this is my first day using it), and I am unsure of how to plot this function in a 3D space. I have tried `Plot3D` and `VectorPlot3D`, but neither seems to offer a good way to do this (that I can think of). How might I go about plotting the function?
