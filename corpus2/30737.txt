Python use of indentation for code scope was initially very polemic and now is considered one of the best language features, because it helps ( almost by forcing us ) to have a consistent style. Well, I saw this a post where someone posted Java code with `; y {}` aligned to the right margin to look more pythonic.               int foo()                                     {         int sum                                   ;         bar()                                     ;         for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++)              {             sum += i                              ;}         return sum                                ;}      It was very shocking at first ( as a matter of fact, if I ever see Java code like that in one of my projects I would be scared! ) However, there is something interesting here. Do we need all those braces and semicolons? How would the code would look like without them?               class Person       int age            void greet( String a )           if( a == "" )             out.println("Hello stranger")         else             out.printf("Hello %s%n", a )            int age()           return this.age          class Main          void main()              new Person().greet("")      Looks good to me, but in such small piece of code is hard to appreciate it, and since I don't Python too much, I can't tell by looking at existing libraries if it would be cleaner or not. So I took the first file of a library named: jAlarms I found and this is the result: ( **WARNING** : the following image may be disturbing for some people ) http://pxe.pastebin.com/eU1R4xsh Obviously it doesn't compile. This would be a compiling version using right aligned {} and ; http://pxe.pastebin.com/2uijtbYM **Question** What would happen if we could code like this? Would it make things clearer? Would it make it harder? I see braces, and semicolons as help to the parser and we, as humans have get used to them, but do we really need them? I guess is hard to tell specially since many mainstream languages do use braces, C, C++, Java, C# JavaScript Assuming the compiler wouldn't have problems without them, would you use them? Please comment. **UPDATE** By the way I have just remember about this language that does something similar for JavaScript.
