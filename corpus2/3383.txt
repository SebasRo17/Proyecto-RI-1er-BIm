Years ago, in my first real programming job, my boss encouraged me to keep a journal of my daily activities. I still do so, although no longer a paper and hand-written one. Do you keep a journal, if so, what do you write in it, and how does it help you in your job? Or, does it just take time that is not ever recovered?
