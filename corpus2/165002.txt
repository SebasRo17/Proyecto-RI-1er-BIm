It has been a year or so since I last took an assembly class. In that class, we were using MASM with the Irvine libraries to make it easier to program in. After we'd gone through most of the instructions, he said that the NOP instruction essentially did nothing and not to worry about using it. Anyway, it was about midterm and he has some example code that wouldn't run properly, so he told us to add a NOP instruction and it worked fine. I asked I'm after class why and what it actually did, and he said he didn't know. Anybody know?
