This graphic is produced by running `DominantColors` (new in _Mathematica_ 9) with different values, using the Lena image as the source: ![lenna strips](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7qAoA.png) Each row is a list of the dominant colours in an image, when asking for between 2 and 60. However I'm surprised that the order of the colors keeps changing: why would the order depend on how many you asked for? Have I done something daft in my code? Or I have failed to grasp something obvious in the online documentation? (Either is likely.)               With[{l = ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Lena"}]},         Graphics[          Table[{colorList = DominantColors[l, d];            {Table[{                 colorList[[x]],                  Rectangle[{x - 1, 10 - d},{x, 10 - (d + 0.7)}]                   },                 {x, 1, Length@colorList}]}},           {d, 2, 60}]]     ]
