My team is going to add new team members and my manager doesn't want to take any risks. I don't think it's a large problem but my manager is concerned that a new programmer would sabotage and accidentally destroy parts of the code or the data e.g. cause data disaster. I say that probability is not very high but still I've been told that it's important to limit the rights of what new collaborators can do. But this is not practical and we can't eat the cake and have it - adding a collaborator to source control gives the new collaborator access to all the source code and even if there was a way to only let a new member in to parts of the source code (we're using bitbucket for source control) it still wouldn't work since technically the whole project is usually needed to build it so one can't just take a part of the code and expect it to work and able to build on independently. We're using Google App Engine and nor is it a working idea to create a clone of the app that my collaborator can build on. I said that we are not the first ones with this problem and that a solution that works for someone else should work for us but my manager seemed not satisfied with that answer. Can you comment on my situation or give concrete advice what could be done about the "problem" / scenario since it's just a scenario that a newly added developer accidentally deletes the whole datastore, but we don't want it to be possible.
