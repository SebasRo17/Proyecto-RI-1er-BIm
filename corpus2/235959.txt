I notice that a ton of platforms are developed nowadays. I have always wondered where it all begins - What choices has to be made, reasons why certain platforms are chosen, why certain places choose to use Open Source, or Microsoft products. I am at the stage of my .NET Development career where I would like to write something big, and make a platform out of it utilizing many different technologies to comprise a single solution. This question is probably double sided too. **Where does platform development start?** **What needs to be researched and known by the developer before he embraces the challenge of writing a mass-scale application** **Is it a good idea to involve communities in the project, even if you plan not to fully use open-source technologies?** These are just a couple of questions which boggles my mind. I am a young developer seeking to improve my skill in developing, creating and building applications. Not always fun when millionaires depend on me for my hard work where I can use my own work to make ends meet more comfortably. Thanks
