I want to include multiple **sub functions** : $b(x) = 10x$ $w(x) = s + b(x)$ $c(x) = x^2$ into two **main functions** : $ua(x) = w(x)-c(x)$ $ub(x) = w(x)-c(x)^2$ As a reaction to this answer, I wrote the following in mathematica:               b[x_] := 10 x     w[b_, x_] := s + b[x]     c[x_] := x^2          ua[w_,b_,c_,x_] := w[b,x] - c[x]     ub[w_,b_,c_,x_] := w[b,x] - (c[x])^2      My intention is to have those main functions that can be called with just x values (e.g. Plot functions with x as the dependent variable) I want subfunctions building my main function **because** :   * Easier control of the sub functions   * Main function looks "cleaner"   * No code duplication **Q:** What is the right way to achieve the desired behavior?
