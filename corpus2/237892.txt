Is it acceptable to use code made by other people that was deliberately made to be shared amongst Web developers? Things such as long libraries of code that contain hundreds of lines of code that you may want to copy rather than write yourself because it is too long and complicated. Is this unacceptable and frowned upon in the programming community simply because everyone is required to write all their code themselves and no copying to speed things up is allowed? Also, do you think large organizations would copy pre-made code that has been made to be used to speed the process of programming web development up? Must they write every single line of code themselves?
