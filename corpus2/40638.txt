I need to solve the following problem. I have the following function: `Erf[Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2]]/Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2]`, where x and y are variables and a and b parameters. I need to slightly modify the function (maybe adding an additional parameter, multiplying with the given parameters or modifying denominator, such as, that its major term in the series expansion about infinity for x and y would be 1/x and 1/y, respectively. This is what I get:               FullSimplify[Series[Erf[Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2]]/Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2], {x, Infinity, 2}]]      and the major term in the output would be `1/(Sqrt[a] x)` Also with the y:               FullSimplify[Series[Erf[Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2]]/Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2], {y, Infinity,     2}]]1/(Sqrt[a] x)      and the major term in the output would be `1/(Sqrt[a] y)` So I need a function similar to one here `(Erf[Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2]]/Sqrt[a x^2 + b y^2])`, who will give both 1/x and 1/y respectively, for the given mathematica inputs. Has anybody got an idea how to modify the function? An intuitive way was to multiply it by `Square[a b]`, but I tried and it did not work. I tried the other things, but the problem to me didn't seem trivial. Has anyone got an idea? Also does anybody know what Mathematica does to make a series of a function of 2 variables around infinity? I know it is called the asymptotic series, but what would be practical way to get it. Having an insight about that some constraint can be found about the function, and therefore the above-mentioned problem can be solved.
