I'm drawing a flow diagram which should visualize the communication between 4 services I created. Now I've got a question I'm not quite sure about. There are two ways the services could be started. Is it allowed to have multiple starting-points in a flow chart? And: do I have to visualize error handling, like a service not being available? I think this doesn't belong in a flow chart, perhaps?
