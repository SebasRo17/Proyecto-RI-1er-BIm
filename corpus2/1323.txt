I recently saw that Microsoft released a coding standards document (All-In-One Code Framework Coding Standards) and it got me thinking... The company that I work for has no formal coding standards at all. There are only a few developers and we have been together long enough to have evolved into similar styles and its never been an issue. Does the company you work for have a documented coding standards? If no, why not? Does having a standard make a difference? Is it worth writing a standard from scratch or should you adopt another standard as your own (ie. make Microsoft's standards yours)?
