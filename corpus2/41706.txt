In this simple code               ListPlot[Table[Sin[x], {x, 0, Pi, .1}], PlotRange -> {0, 0.5},      Joined -> True, PlotMarkers -> Automatic, ClippingStyle -> None, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r2nbW.png) We can see that there are two PlotMarkers appear at the clipped boundary. But actually there are not points, so they should not exist. How can we remove them? I have already used `ClippingStyle -> None`. * * * **Update** As Alexey Popkov pointed out, this is really a bug. If we play with this code               data = {Table[{x, Sin[x]}, {x, 0, 1.05 Pi, .1}], Table[{x, Sin[2 x]}, {x, 0, 1.05 Pi, .1}]};     ListPlot[data, PlotRange -> {0, 0.5}, Joined -> True, PlotMarkers -> {Automatic, Medium}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G7beA.png) Now, even the same plot marker will be used for all data sets at the clipped boundaries, both top and bottom.
