Sometimes I observe _Mathematica_ produce expressions exactly like the following after a simplification step: $$\frac{a+\sqrt{-(1-b)}\sqrt{\frac{1}{b-1}}}{\sqrt{c}\sqrt{\frac{1}{c}}}$$ Now, any further generic `Simplify` or `FullSimplify` would not do any good any more. One is tempted to use `PowerExpand`, but this would just introduce an annoying `i` term in the numerator, instead of simplifying correctly. Therefore, what I have been doing is typing in simplifications like:               /.Sqrt[x_]Sqrt[y_]/(Sqrt[z_]Sqrt[m_])->Sqrt[x y]/Sqrt[z m]//Simplify      by hand. This is very annoying. Maybe there is a _Mathematica_ function which joins all the square roots in all possible places of an expression together? **EDIT** Example code to be simplified:               Sqrt[-(1 - b)] Sqrt[1/(b - 1)]      Generally, any simplification involving explicitly specifying properties of terms involved does not help really, since the amount of actions is the same as manually correcting the expression. What I am looking for is a function which merges all possible square roots together, regardless of content. **EDIT2** Please note the following triviality: a search for a function performing the merging of all square roots in an expression only makes sense if an appropriate branch for the square root functions is chosen so that $\sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}=\sqrt{x y}$ is actually true for the expressions in question. Thank you.
