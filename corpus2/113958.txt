There doesn't seem to be that many good descriptions that go into the specifics about how dlmalloc works. The sources I have come across so far _mention_ dlmalloc, but then only goes on to explain what malloc() and free() are, rather than describing dlmalloc. The Wikipedia description, on the other hand, was a bit hard for me to understand. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc#dlmalloc_and_its_derivatives Can anyone explain the workings of dlmalloc, how to implement it, and any additional sources that could help?
