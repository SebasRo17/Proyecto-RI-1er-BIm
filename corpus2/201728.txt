I was studying _Mediator Pattern_ and I noticed that to use this pattern you should register the _Colleagues_ into _Mediator_ from the _Colleague_ concrete classes. for that we have to make an instance of _Mediator_ inside _Colleague_ concrete classes which violates IoC and you can not inject the _Colleagues_ into _Mediator_ (as far as I know! whether it is right or wrong) Questions: 1- Am I right about the thing I said? 2- Shall we always use IoC at all or there are some times you can forget about it? 3- If we always have to use IoC, can we say _Mediator_ is an anti-Pattern?
