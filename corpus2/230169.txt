Variables and the keys in key-value pairs are both identifiers for values, so, on a conceptual level, these seem very similar ideas. How would you explain the difference between these two concepts?   * Is it that key-value pairs are used in collections?   * Is it that variables point to a memory location?   * Or something else? (If I look at code, I'm instinctively aware of the difference, the question's more about how to explain it which doesn't seem too obvious given that they do similar things.)
