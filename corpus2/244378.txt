I am beginner in software development. I noticed when I try to learn one technology let's say .NET I lose my grip over other for example Java. I thought it would be better to concentrate on one technology either Java or .NET to make significant advancement and be an expert, because they can be many details which one can ignore when keeps on changing between technologies. Is my decision right? Do experts choose this approach? **Update:** Should I pursue my career knowing one technology or not?
