I am working on an algorithm to find possible fills for gaps in text. My function will receive as input: (example)               [false,"o",false,"b",false,"r"]      representing the string "foobar" with some values cut out. My function should find opportunies for the possible ways to fill the gaps given a set maximum characters (and a minimum of one blank filled). so, given a maximum of 2 it should return:               [     [true,"o",false,"b",false,"r"],     [false,"o",true,"b",false,"r"],     [false,"o",false,"b",true,"r"],     [true,"o",true,"b",false,"r"],     [true,"o",false,"b",true,"r"],     [false,"o",true,"b",true,"r"]     ]      Can anyone give me a shove in the right direction? Oh, and I planned to run the results through another function to sort these out, but if I can NOT get results where there is a false between the blanks (ie, from the above, `[true,"o",false,"b",true,"r"]`) it would be a huge bonus. This is in a javascript/jQuery environment
