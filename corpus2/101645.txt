Is creating a scripting language for my own personal learning experience worth it? The reason I ask is that there are so many programming languages available already, I know mine will never have any actual use other than providing a good learning experience. I do, however, see drawbacks with just trying to make a scripting language as a learning experience: it will take a lot of time and effort in which I could be doing something more "productive." Would creating a programming language (including writing drafts of its intended purpose, syntax, philosophy, interpreter, etc) be worth the time, effort and learning experience? Or are there other projects I could benefit more from?
