When I copy a cells by selecting them from the collapse bars on the right, then using the context menu option "Copy", the pasted image of plots is not anti-aliased and in general the text seems to have bad styling compared to a screen. For example, here is a plot which is copied using the built-in copy command:               Manipulate[Plot[Cos[a x], {x, 0, 3 \[Pi]}], {a, 1, 10, 0.3}]      ![copied plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/13VxF.png) and here is a screen shot of the same command and plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ArIPX.png) As you can see the screen shot looks a lot better. For example, compare the graphical quality of the buttons in the animation panel.
