I have an AdWords script that regularly transfers sensitive data to my server using a POST HTTP request. For security I have a predefined 32 character randomized string that is verified by my server before it accepts the data. **Is this secure?** I don't know too much about the HTTP protocol, but I know that the data is being sent unencrypted. Is it probable/possible for somebody to access the data during the request? From what I've understood, the HTTPS protocol is most useful when on an untrusted network where it's easy for anybody to spy on your packets. In my case, data is being sent from Google's servers to my host's servers (DreamHost in this case). Would it be prudent of me to upgrade to HTTPS, or would this be pointless? Are there any other security pitfalls I should be aware of? I will accept the first answer that clears up my situation.
