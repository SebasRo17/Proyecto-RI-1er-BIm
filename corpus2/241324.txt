I'm trying to build binding system similar to the one that is used in WPF and I ran into some memory leaking problems, so here comes my question - how is memory managed in WPF property system? From what I know in WPF values of `DependencyProperties` are stored in external containers - what I wanna know is how are they collected when `DependencyObject` dies? Simplest solution would be to store them is some weak reference dictionary - but here comes the main problem I ran into - when there is a listener on property that needs reference to its (this property) parent it holds it (the parent) alive (when value of weak reference dictionary points somewhere, even indirectly, to key - it can't be collected). How is it avoided in WPF without the need of using weak references everywhere?
