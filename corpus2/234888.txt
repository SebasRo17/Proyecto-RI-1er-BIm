That scenario has been played out many times in movies and books, but is it really possible to build such a computer system in the real-world without at least one company knowing the nature of the system. As an example, in the movie Batman: The Dark Knight. Batman uses contractors to build a spy network that allows him to use mobile phones as sonar devices. He claims in the movie that no one knows the nature of the system, because it was out sourced to many different parties. Sounds good in science fiction, but in the real world can systems been engineered this way. While I know parts of a system can easily be outsourced. Could an agency build a large complex computer system using contractors without anyone knowing the nature of the system?
