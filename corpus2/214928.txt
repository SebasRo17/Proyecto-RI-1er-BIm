I was going thru a video (from `coursera - by sedgewick`) in which he argues that `you cannot sustain Moore's law using a quadratic algorithm`.He elaborates like this In year 197* you build a computer of power X ,and need to count N objects.This takes M days According to `Moore's law`,you have a computer of power 2X after 1.5 years.But now you have 2N objects to count. If you use a quadratic algorithm, In year 197*+1.5 ,it takes (4M)/2 = 2M days 4M because the algorithm is quadratic,and division by 2 because of doubling computer power. I find this hard to understand.I tried to work thru this as below               To count N objects using comp=X , it takes M days.     -> N/X = M          After 1.5 yrs ,you need to count 2N objects using comp=2X     -> 2N/(2X) -> N/X -> M days      where do I go wrong? can someone please help me understand?
