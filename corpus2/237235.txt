I am trying to develop a web application on a windows machine using apache wicket, java, jquery etc. Apache wicket comes with an embedded jetty server. I am using eclipse as the IDE. The application needs to access some resources like configuration files etc that are present on remote machine (linux server) to which we could ssh, once development is complete we would like to deploy this application on a tomcat server hosted on this linux server. How to move seamlessly from the windows development environment to the linux server deployment? Right now we do the development by copying over the latest config files from the server, however this is error prone as it becomes difficult to keep track of the latest config files, this leads to unexpected behavior when the application is deployed. Our team is located in India and our servers are located in US, mapping the config files and accessing them do not have good response times.
