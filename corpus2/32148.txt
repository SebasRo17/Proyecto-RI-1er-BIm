Is there a way to get a word's linguistic pronunciation given the word as a string? I would like a function `LingusticPronunciation` such that, for example, `LingusticPronunciation["Dog"]` would return `"Dawg"` or maybe even `"dȯg"` or `"däg"`, depending on what type of pronunciation dictionary is used. Ultimately I am trying to search for all homophones in a document and would prefer not having to use the internet to check for different homophone/pronunciation information.
