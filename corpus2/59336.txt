I want to compare different flight routes to Australia and their lengths. So far I have written:               departure =      Entity["City", {"BuenosAires", "BuenosAires", "Argentina"}];          destination =      Entity["City", {"Perth", "WesternAustralia", "Australia"}];          km =      ToString@QuantityMagnitude@Round@(GeoDistance[departure, destination]) <> " km";          GeoGraphics[      {       {Thick, Red, GeoPath[{departure, destination}]},       Style[Text[km, GeoPosition[destination]], Blue, 14, Bold]       },      GeoCenter -> destination,      GeoProjection -> "Mercator",      GeoRange -> "World",      ImageSize -> 400,      Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g1ONM.jpg) My problem: To specify a city with Mathematica I have to include its federal state / administrative division, which, in many cases, I don' t know. So I have to google and manually input it. Since I want to automate the program for other cities the question is: How can I persuade Mathematica to tell me that Perth, Australia, is part of Western Australia and use this answer as automated input?
