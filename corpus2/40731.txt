I am very new to mathematica but it looks like an interesting language and I would like to explore it for a future project to create a web search engine. It seems like it would be fairly well suited for this as it seems to already be powering wolfram alpha. I was wondering if the only databases you can hook into are SQL like databases. I can't see anywhere that talks about hooking into Mongo or a graph database like Neo4j. Why is this? Does this not make sense for some reason? Any thoughts would be great. Thanks. Edit: So ya. If you have examples of ways to connect Mathematica to MongoDB that would be awesome. If possible I would also like to see an example of connecting it to Neo4j. (Or reasons why that would not make sense). I guess I am wondering why everything for Mathematica is being used to connect to SQL databases thus far? Is there a reason for that?
