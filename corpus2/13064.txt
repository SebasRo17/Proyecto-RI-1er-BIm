Here's a perfect example of my problem:               Manipulate[Pause[n], {n, {1, 10}, ContinuousAction -> False}, SynchronousUpdating -> False]      It is illustrated by clicking 10 and then immediately clicking 1, that is, you shouldn't have to wait, it should stop pausing for ten seconds and begin pausing for only one second. In general, Mathematica does not release a previous computation until the current one is finished. I need to override this in my application, which involves a computationally expensive function for only some values in the slider, and I want the computation to stop and restart when the mouse is dragged. A Manipulate itself is not necessary for me, perhaps some trickery with Dynamics can achieve this? Also, would your solution work if the function that the slider drives is written with javalink?
