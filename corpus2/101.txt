For a Computer Science (CS) degree at many colleges and universities, certain math courses are **required** : Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Discrete Mathematics are few examples. However, since I've started working in the real world as a software developer, I have yet to truly use _some_ the knowledge I had at once acquired from taking those classes. _Discrete Math might be the only exception_. My questions: **Should these math classes be required to obtain a computer science degree? Or would they be better served as electives?** I'm challenging even that the certain math classes even help with required CS classes. For example, I never used linear algebra outside of the math class itself. I hear it's used in Computer Graphics, but I never took those classes-- yet linear algebra was _required_ for a CS degree. I personally think it could be better served as an elective rather than requirement because it's more specific to a branch of CS rather than general CS. From a Slashdot post CS Profs Debate Role of Math In CS Education: > _'For too long, we have taught computer science as an academic discipline > (as though all of our students will go on to get PhDs and then become CS > faculty members) even though for most of us, our students are overwhelmingly > seeking careers in which they apply computer science.'_
