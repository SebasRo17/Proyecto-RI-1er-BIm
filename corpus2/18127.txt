I'm considering writing a low level driver or OS components/kernels. The osdev.org folks seem to think that the important bits are not meaningfully testable this way, but I have read some discussions where people thought differently. I've looked around, but have failed to find any real life examples of TDD on low-level components. Is this something people actually do, or just something that people talk about in theory because there is not a good way to do it in practice?
