Are dedicated hosting yet cheaper and would remain so ? Do they really going to survive as cloud based offering are also getting cheaper day by day ? I am asking to gain perspective of long term scenario in hosting space as well as to know what is the current situation. Everywhere I go there is this buzzword "cloud" and audience don't even bother to compare it with dedicated hosting options. Is cloud really the way to go ahead ? what are it's cons ?
