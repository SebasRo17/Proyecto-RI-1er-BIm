I know how to program for Unix, Mac, and iOS, but I have no clue when it comes to Windows. Now I have a specific project that requires building a Windows version of a Mac OS X desktop app. But I have no idea where to start learning. What languages can I build the app in and how do I package it for download and distribution? What tools can I use? Can I use Vim and something resembling the Unix command line? I can program well in Ruby and Objective C, but I'm guessing I won't be able to use either of these to make a Windows desktop app. Any tips?
