I'm trying to define a function which modifies and sums over the elements of an array. Here is a very simplified version.               myF[kmax_] = Sum[v[[k]]/k, {k, 1, kmax}]      As you can see, each element between 1 and the function argument (`kmax`) is divided by its index and then summed with the others. The problem is that mathematica isn't accepting that `v[[k]]` and complains that `k` isn't an integer.               Part::pspec: Part specification k is neither an integer nor a list of integers.      I tried replacing `k` with `Round[k]`, but the problem remains. I even tried redefining the vector, where the elements are already divided by `k`, and then just summing over the first `kmax` elements:               myF[kmax_] = Total[Take[v, kmax]]      And I'm still getting error messages about the argument not being of the right type               Take::seqs: Sequence specification (+n, -n, {+n}, {-n}, {m, n}, or {m, n, s}) expected at position 2 in Take      So, am I doing something wrong? **Is there any way to access array elements within a function definition?**
