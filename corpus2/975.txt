The usual `Partition[]` function is a very handy little thing:               Partition[Range[12], 4]     {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12}}          Partition[Range[13], 4, 3]     {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, {7, 8, 9, 10}, {10, 11, 12, 13}}      One application I'm working on required me to write a particular generalization of `Partition[]`'s functionality, which allowed the generation of sublists of unequal lengths, for as long as the lengths were appropriately commensurate. (Let's assume for the purposes of this question that the list lengths being commensurate is guaranteed, but you're welcome to generalize further to the incommensurate case.) Here's my generalization in action:               multisegment[lst_List, scts_List] := Block[{acc},       acc = Prepend[Accumulate[PadRight[scts, Length[lst]/Mean[scts], scts]], 0];       Inner[Take[lst, {#1, #2}] &, Most[acc] + 1, Rest[acc], List]]          multisegment[CharacterRange["a", "x"], {3, 1, 2}]     {{"a", "b", "c"}, {"d"}, {"e", "f"}, {"g", "h", "i"}, {"j"}, {"k", "l"},      {"m", "n", "o"}, {"p"}, {"q", "r"}, {"s", "t", "u"}, {"v"}, {"w", "x"}}      (Thanks to halirutan for optimization help with `multisegment[]`.) The problem I've hit into is that I wanted `multisegment[]` to also support offsets, just like in `Partition[]`. I want to be able to do something like the following:               multisegment[Range[14], {4, 3}, {3, 1}]     {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {4, 5, 6}, {5, 6, 7, 8},       {8, 9, 10}, {9, 10, 11, 12}, {12, 13, 14}}      How might a version of `multisegment[]` with offsets be accomplished?
