I am a very solid Relational Database guy and understand all the way to 3rd normal form, appreciate the algebraic set theory roots of SQL, and can probably relationalize a broken heart (or not). I haven't figured out a relational database structure FOR date nights with my wife, but I HAVE thought about relational database projects ON date nights with my wife.. Now I'm hearing about NoSQL, and researching it. Cutting to the chase, is there anything about NoSQL that is ground breaking, mathematically novel, or a "hey you don't even really need to organize your data relationally, this is so much easier" type of approach? Is NoSQL like a super shell to the data structure? In my mind, data must ultimately have structure to be retrieved and the retrieval must be defined in a language of some sort.
