I'm trying to plot the Fourier transform of $\sin (2 t)$. I tried using the FourierTransform Function (I'm expecting a peak at `w = 2`) but it gives me undefined at `w = 2` because the DiracDelta function is not defined at `DiracDelta[0]`. Is there any way around this? I used               Plot[FourierTransform[Sin[2*t], t, w], {w, -3, 3}, PlotRange -> Full]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/45s3t.png) which has gaps at 2 and -2, but no height. How do I get a peak with some height there?
