I'm looking for the Z-Score for a distribution, where the integrated area sums up to 0.90. Unfortunately I always get an error from Mathematica, `"nonnumerical value"`. Does someone know why?               Solve[NIntegrate[PDF[StudentTDistribution[49], x], {x, -Infinity, y}] == 0.95, y]      I tried as well               Solve[StudentTPValue[x, 49] == 0.10, x]      How can one get only the value as an output? I ultimately want to test a hypothesis value to check if they are in the `0.95±∞` part of a Student-t distribution.
