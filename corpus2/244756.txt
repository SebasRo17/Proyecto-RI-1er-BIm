I was looking for a way to share my application created files through Whatsapp. I found we can chat using custom URL scheme provided by whatsapp. But, to share files of my app, I read that I have to use `DocumentInteractionController`. Is there any sample available? Also, when I read about this on Apple docs, it says: > Create an instance of the UIDocumentInteractionController class for each > file you want to interact with. Is it necessary to create an instance for each file? I just want to share the files as and when I receive them through my service to my app.
