Given this pseudo code:               class B { }          class A : B     {         int val;     };          alpha = new A();      What arrow do I draw between `alpha` and `A` in a UML class diagram? Is this even something UML is meant to do?               +-------+        +-------+        +-------+     | alpha | --??-- |   A   |------|>|   B   |     |       |        |       |        |       |     +-------+        +-------+        +-------+      In my case, I truly do want to express explicitly that `alpha` instantiates `A`. So if there is no way in UML, I'll just make up a way -- which is fine, but I want to know if UML can express it already. My situation is that I'm trying to explain OOP to a friend who is very visual. Therefore, I want to try to visually distinguish the two relationships (inheritance and instantiation) so that he can distinguish it mentally.
