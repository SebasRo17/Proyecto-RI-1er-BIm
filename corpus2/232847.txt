I have a website that allows user uploads of content. Part of the design, to date, involves storing the user content on a NAS that has been configured with a separate app pool in IIS that has scripting disabled, shorter lifespans, no cookies, etc for CDN-type behavior as a subdomain (static.domain.com vs. www.domain.com). I have complete control over this process and all the instances. The design decision behind this was to allow for cheaper storage of uploaded documents (instead of wwwroot or a DB) and help mitigate some security concerns by disallowing scripting. The concern I have now is that CDNs, and this setup, are by nature very permissive and do next to no checking or validation. Are there any _reasonably effective_ measures to discourage idle sharing of this user content? I know nothing will stop determined or malicious people, but I want to at least prevent this user content from being available at large to the general populous. All of the links to the content will be behind a paywall at the 'www' subdomain, but the content itself will be behind the 'static' subdomain. Ideas I had so far:   1. HTTP Referer checking    2. Obfuscated filenames (I know, I know...)    3. Cookie testing with URL rewrite? (IIS8)    4. ...    5. Ask stackexchange
