I want to evaluate an indefinite integral using the Integrate command, and I know that the answer can be written in terms of elementary functions (square roots, logs etc.) but _Mathematica_ seems to give the answer in terms of a Hypergeometric2F1 function. How do I get it to give me the answer in terms of the elementary functions? The integral is the following: $$ \int \sqrt{\left(\frac{w}{2}\right)\left(\frac{w}{2}+u+v\right)} \ \mathrm{d}w $$ Thanks!
