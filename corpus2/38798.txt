I want to solve numerically the second-order differential equation proposed by Coleman in this paper (equation 8, page 1804): $$ \gamma(\lambda) \lambda_{zz} + \beta(\lambda) \lambda_z^2 + \tau(\lambda) = T_0. $$ In my case, functions $\gamma(\lambda)$, $\beta(\lambda)$, and $\tau(\lambda)$ look analytically different from Coleman's ones, but their result is quite similar. In my case $$ \varphi(\lambda) = a_0 + a_1 \lambda^2 + a_2 \lambda^2 + a_3 \lambda^3 + a_4 \lambda^4, \\\ \tau(\lambda) = \varphi'(\lambda), \\\ \gamma(\lambda) = - \frac{h_0^2}{12} \frac{\tau(\lambda)}{\lambda^5}, \\\ \beta(\lambda)=\frac{1}{2} \gamma'(\lambda). $$ Coleman shows that this ODE have three kind of solution:   1. **Fully developed draw**. In this case, $\lambda_z$ does not vanish at a finite point, but $\lambda(z)$ is bounded, i.e., it is strictly monotone. The solution satisfies these conditions: $$ \lim_{z\to-\infty} \lambda(z) = \lambda_*, \qquad \lim_{z\to+\infty} \lambda(z) = \lambda^*, $$ and $$\int_{\lambda_*}^{\lambda^*} [\tau(\lambda) - T^*]d\lambda = 0, \quad \tau(\lambda_*) = \tau(\lambda^*) = T^*. $$ Moreover, $$ \lim_{z\to \pm\infty} \lambda_z = \lim_{z\to \pm\infty} \lambda_{zz} = 0. $$   1. **Neck or Bulge**. In this case, $\lambda_z$ vanish at a precisely finite point, $z_0$. If $\lambda(z_0)$ is a global maximum we have a neck, if it is a global minimum we have a bulge. In both cases, the solution is symmetric about $z_0$. Conditions: $$ \lim_{z\to \pm\infty} \lambda(z) = \lambda_{(\infty)}, \qquad \lambda_z(z_0) = 0, $$ $$ \int_{\lambda_{(\infty)}}^{\lambda_0} [\tau(\lambda) - T^0]d\lambda = 0, \quad \tau(\lambda_{(\infty)}) = T^0. $$ for each $ \tau(\lambda_{\min}) < T^0 < T^*$ (bulge) or $ T^* < T^0 < \tau(\lambda_{\max})$ (neck).   1. **Equally spaced striae**. In this case, the solution has more than one finite value at which $\lambda_z = 0$, and it is periodic. We call $\lambda_a$ a minimum and $\lambda_b$ its consecutive maximum (and $z_a$ and $z_b$ are the locations of minimum and maximum, respectively). Conditions: $$ \lambda_z(z_a) = \lambda_z(z_b) = 0, \quad \int_{\lambda_a}^{\lambda_b} [\tau(\lambda) - T^0]d\lambda = 0, \quad \tau(\lambda_a) > T_0 > \tau(\lambda_b). $$ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R0caM.png) Some parameters:               H0 = 1;     par = {            a0 -> 2.0377638272727268,            a1 ->  -7.105521894545453,            a2 -> 9.234000147272726,            a3 -> -5.302489919999999,            a4 -> 1.136247839999999           };          φ[λ_] := a0 + a1 λ + a2 λ^2 + a3 λ^3 + a4 λ^4 /. par;     τ[λ_] := φ'[λ];     γ[λ_] := -(H0^2/12) τ[λ]/λ^5;     β[λ_] := 1/2 γ'[λ];          SubStar[λ] = 1.0253896074560216`;     SuperStar[λ] = 1.3079437258773567`;     λmax = 1.0851003185010777`;     λmin = 1.2482330148322596`;     λa = 1.0610276111671018`;     λb = 1.194705994040993`;     TM = 0.0059225557575715015`; (* T^* *)     TN = 0.008388970560993414`; (* neck *)      My first approach was considering this ODE as BVP, but I don't know range along $z$: I can assume $z = 0$ where $\lambda_z = 0$ for neck or striae, or a place at which $\lambda_z = \varepsilon$ and $\lambda(0) = (1+\varepsilon_*) \lambda_*$ for fully developed draw (I can't handle an infinity domain), but I know the values of $\lambda$ only at the second place, but I have no idea about where this place is. A second approach was considering the ODE as IVP (see this post), imposing $\lambda(z)$ and $\lambda_z(z)$ at a precisely point (where I assume knowing the function and it's derivative) and seeing its evolution. Unfortunately, this approach leads to a periodic solution only (and when I set some value of the first derivative it approaches infinity at certain point). How can I solve this equation? What is better, IVP or BVP? /Petrus
