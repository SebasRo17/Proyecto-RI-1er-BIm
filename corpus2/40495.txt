I have an application that has a back-end database (tables, procedures, database specific dlls) and front-end (application logic and UI) that separate people are working on. I was wondering what's the best way to organize it in my repository (I'm using GIT). The options I see are:   * all-in-one repository   * submodules of main repository   * two separate repositories   * other? Any suggestions are welcome.
