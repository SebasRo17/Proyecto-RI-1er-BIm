I'm sorry if the title is a little hard to get. I've never built an entire big software my self, just some small apps in my free time, i was more familiar with the do-what-my-boss-told-me things. And our approach is a little amateur, obsolete also (Foxpro 8.0 and MS SQL 2000). Now i've started to work at another company and been assigned to build a software in C#.Net, but the problem is i'm not sure with the program's architecture My problem is, we're building a software. But we have variety of clients, and for example, we have a CalculateCostOfProduct funtion, and it might be different for each client. Says for party A, the function is :               function CalculateCostOfProduct()     return 5;       for party B :               function CalculateCostOfProduct()     return 10;       ... And there should be extra modules for specific needs also ! So there will be customized versions from the original standard. How should i manage this ? But we can't build different exe for different client! So please give me some ideas, or solutions that might solve this problem.
