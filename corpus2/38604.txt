I've just been reading through the SOLID principles, and this is one I have real difficulty with when designing software. I am relatively new (4 months professionally) at coding. The idea is simply to encapsulate classes into ones that perform a single task. For example, what if you have a class that creates and populates a Treeview and configures it to your specification. You then want data retrieved from a database when the user clicks on the nodes. Would you say this is two separate concerns?   1. Populate and configure the treeview    2. Obtain data from the database? Also, in the same app. You have a datagridview that is also populated with dynamic data. Would you therefore put that data retrieval in the same class as the treeview data retrieval or would that be yet another completely seperate class? Thanks.
