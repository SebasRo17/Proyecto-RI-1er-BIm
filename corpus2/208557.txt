Currently programming a new software, I'm searching for information about protecting my concept and my source-code. I precise I'm quite new in licensing. As I'm feeling very concerned by Open-source and sharing with the community, I'm puzzled on the other hand because I want to make some profit of my work (around 1 year of free-time, you can imagine the amount of missed beers in pub!). So I'm looking for a double license, that is compatible, and allows software source-code distributing, but force companies to get a commercial license, or to negotiate directly with me. But I think it is totally contradictory with GPL like licenses. What are you thinking about that?
