Let $X$ be a random variable with pdf:               dist = ProbabilityDistribution[1/(Abs[x]*Log[Abs[x]]^2), {x, -E^-2, E^-2}]      Here are some pseudo-random drawings from it:               data = RandomVariate[dist, 500000];      The domain of support for this random variable is:               {x, -E^-2, E^-2} // N     {x, -0.135335, 0.135335}      and all the generated data should lie within this domain of support. But, if I try something like:               Max[data]     0.15312      _Mathematica_ 9 returns a number which lies outside the domain of support. So, the _Mathematica_ random number generator is failing â€” it is generating values that lie outside the domain of support: i.e. not from this pdf. I reported this under version 8 to WRI, and again under version 9 pre-testing and since it is still here, I am beginning to wonder whether it is just me? Do others get this problem as well? I am running a Mac Pro with OS X 10.6.8
