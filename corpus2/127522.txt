I am the development team lead of a new project at my company. This is the first project where the company will use Scrum. We have a waterfall/iterative SDLC. The BAs write requirements docs, hands over to dev and test, dev start developing and will release to testing in iterations. Testers take long time to test a release by which devs continue development but also bug fixes for the current release. I have a few questions   1. In a sprint with say 5 stories when do you release for testing ? Is it as soon as a story is completed by dev or after all stories are completed but before end of sprint giving test the required time to test.    2. If the BA writes user stories what should be the detail. Traditionally it takes long time to write a spec with all UI layout, behaviour, text etc to be finalised. I guess my question is how to write stories that are implementable and testable.   3. Our test team is non-technical. How important it is to have automated UI testing for Scrum. The UI is based on WPF. I have solid development experience using agile methods (TDD, code reviews, refactoring etc.) but new to scrum. edit: By iterations I mean that if there are 100 requirements we may release to testing when we have finished 30, 35, 35 requirements rather than wait till all 100 requirements have been completed.
