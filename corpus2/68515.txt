A client I did a project for accidentally ended up with the source code of said project. Stupid i know. The arrangement was that they would get the product, never the source code. However, obviously, they are now trying to pull a fast one and use the source code to create their own products for other clients. Now i don't want to make a huge deal out of it, but i am contemplating releasing the code as an open source project for anyone to use so that their 'unique' selling point (my code) is moot. What do you guys suggest i do / release the code under if they decide to be *ssholes about this?
