I want to do a partial least squares (PLS) regression using `LeastSquares` on my data. The input parameters are temperature, humidity and pressure for a given date. The problem is that some parameters are missing, for example on 6. 9. 2013 the temperature and pressure were recorded, but humidity was not.               m = {     ...     {{2013,9,5},30.0,65.,101.45},     {{2013,9,6},28.6,,101.41},     {{2013,9,7},29.3,58.,101.29},     ...     }      Is it possible to use the available data for days like that, or do I have to leave those days out?
