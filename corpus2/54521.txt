Each time I open a new notebook, using File->New->Notebook, I get this message ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J0LeN.png) Then I check on the "Do this for all notebooks". But when I repeat this and want to create a new notebook, it asks again. Restarted M and still no change. Any idea what can cause this and how to resolve it? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hYfjF.gif) I am on window 7, 64 bit. Version 10.
