This might be a simple question for the most of you, but I am very new to mathematica so please bear with me. I'll refer to the code below:               H = 10     T0 = 3600     Cd = 0.0573*Sqrt[1 + 0.148*U0]     Iv = 0.06*(1 + 0.043*U0)*(z/10)^-0.22     Solve[Utz == U0*(1 + Cd*Log[z/H])*(1 - 0.41*Iv*Log[T/T0]) && U0 > 0, U0]      I would like to Solve the above formula for U0, so I get U0=... with Utz, z and T as the variables. I only need solutions >0. However, the notebook keeps 'running' when I use this. I have also used input values for Utz, z and T, this works fine and the correct value for U0 is provided. Am I doing this correctly and does the Solve simply take a lot of time, or is there another explanation? Thanks in advance, Hans *Edit1: Thanks Sjoerd for your comment. The problem lies in the fact that Cd and Iv are both defined by variables U0 and z. That is why I want to incorporate those in the Solve for U0, something like?:               Solve[Utz == U0*(1 + (0.0573*Sqrt[1 + 0.148*U0])*Log[z/H])*(1 - 0.41*(0.06*(1 + 0.043*U0)*(z/10)^-0.22)*Log[T/T0]) && U0 > 0 && T > 0 && z/H > 0, U0]      However, again this results in 'running' process.
