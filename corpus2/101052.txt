Here's some background:   * I have someone who is motivated to help me out on a project that already has a good chunk of code written   * The person does not have a CS background, but knows the basics (functions, variables, objects, classes, etc)   * The goal isn't to make this person a rockstar developer overnight - they just need to be able to pull their weight on this specific project.   * The project is a Rails project, but if there are general responses, I'd like to favor them. The current approach that is being taken is to give this person a simple feature (that has a similar feature already written). Then nudging them when they get confused, while trying not to give them full chunks of code. Regardless, they're very confused and frustrated, and moving slowly. Not unexpected, but I'm wondering if there are any tips or tricks to help them learn more effectively, and get to the wonderful "ah-ha!" moments.
