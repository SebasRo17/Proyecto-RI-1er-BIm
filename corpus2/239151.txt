So far as I know, there are two forms of the Adapter Pattern: the class adapter and the object adapter. Could someone please explain to me the following limitation of the class adapter and why it is not a limitation of the object adapter:   * a class adapter is not suitable when we want to adapt a class and all of its subclasses. I guess the following is considered a limitation of the object adapter:   * with an object adapter it is harder to override Adaptee behaviour than with a class adapter. Why is that?
