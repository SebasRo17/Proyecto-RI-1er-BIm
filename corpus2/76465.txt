I've been writing .Net code since 2003 and so I am very comfortable with it now and have a fairly deep knowledge surrounding the .Net framework that I have built over the years, plus feel very comfortable with advanced programming concepts and programming in general. I want to get into some game programming, but the last C++ I wrote was at a beginner-to-intermediate level around 2001-2002. I know that there is a lot of support for game development in .Net languages these days, but I also know that there are a lot of game libraries, resources and commercial products built on or around C and C++. Would learning C++ at this stage be a practical endeavour for me, or would the amount of time required to become competent with C++ outweigh the productivity advantage I'd get from sticking with .Net? One of my considerations is that I'm concerned about the massive and growing impact Apple is having on the tech world and the general complacency Microsoft seems to have with winning consumer and developer mindshare these days, which leaves me wondering, if I were to focus my efforts on .Net technologies (particularly in view of the fact that the Mono team was recently laid off after Novell's acquisition), am I probably severely limiting my potential future audience for any games I create?
