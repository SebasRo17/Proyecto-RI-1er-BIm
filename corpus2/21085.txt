Is it possible to easily modify a `Manipulate` such that the slider automagically skips certain values? For example, say I am plotting an equation that's perfectly well behaved for all values of `x` between `x=0` and `x=1` except for `x=0.25` where it blows up and causes _Mathematica_ to emit many error messages. I could, of course, check for `x=0.25` in the body of the `Manipulate` and then do something sensible but it would be nice if I could just say to `Manipulate` 'Avoid x=0.25.'
