I have a question concerning the life cycle management of a/multiple project(s), more specific to the advantages/disadvantages of using technologies such as Maven. Currently we work in a continuous-integration environment but lots of things still need to be manually performed (dependency management, deploying, setting up documentation, generating stats, ...). My impression is that this approach often leads to errors, miscommunications or things just are forgotten. I know and have used Maven in the past but in smaller environments and I was always really enthusiastic about it. But I was wondering if someone could share some insights, experiences, pros, contras, ... about the use of Maven (or similar technology) in larger environments and for multiple projects. I would like to use the suggestions made here to start the debate about moving to the next level in project management!
