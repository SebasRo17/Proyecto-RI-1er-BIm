I am using PHP and designing some abstract classes. I can declare properties with constant values within my abstract class and access/overwrite them from any class which extends this without re declaring them within any of the extending classes. A benefit to this is less repetitive typing but the downside that overtime the original structure/layout of these abstract properties is forgotten and could be left at there default static values or even forgotten(not used) completely. How is this handled in professional environments? I assume this has been thought out before and is either favored or isn't? I am trying to adhere to good OOP principles/rules such as SOLID, DRY and KISS but I haven't seen this specific issue talked about in these. (perhaps I missed it when researching?)
