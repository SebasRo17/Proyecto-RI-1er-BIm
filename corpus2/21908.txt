Currently, I am using a Windows machine with _Mathematica 8_. I noticed a difference in a series expansion of the function `EllipticE[]` in comparison with a result given by _Mathematica 9_ on Linux (which I was using previously). In _Mathematica 8_ on Windows the following input:               Series[EllipticE[I c, m], {c, Infinity, 0}] // PowerExpand // FullSimplify       produces a warning: > General::ivar: I c is not a valid variable. >> and the following output (slightly rearranged by me to better fit the browser): $$-\frac{i\left(6m+\frac{(1+m)}{\sinh^2(c)}\right)}{6\sinh(c)m^{3/2}}-\text{EllipticE}[m]+\frac{m \text{EllipticE}[\frac{1}{m}] + (1-m)\text{EllipticK}[\frac{1}{m}] }{\sqrt{m}}-$$ $$\frac{(1+m \cosh(2 c))\sqrt{\text{Limit}\big[-m\sinh^2(c)~,~i c \to 0\big]}}{\sinh^2(c)2m}$$ Same output as a code:               -((I (6 m Csch[c] + (1 + m) Csch[c]^3))/(6 m^(3/2))) -       EllipticE[m] +       (m EllipticE[1/m] - (-1 + m) EllipticK[1/m])/Sqrt[m] -       (((1 + m Cosh[2 c]) Csch[c]^2 Sqrt[Limit[-m Sinh[c]^2, I c -> 0]])/(2 m))      Now, in _Mathematica 9_ on Linux there was no such warning, and no `Limit` term appeared. I am confused about how to treat this `Limit` term, since it might just be a sign of something going terribly wrong in the guts of _Mathematica 8_. Does anyone have an advice on how to proceed? Maybe some of you can evaluate the same series expansion in a different version of _Mathematica_ so that we could compare results? ### EDIT Evaluating instead:               Series[EllipticE[c, m], {c, I Infinity, 0}] // PowerExpand // FullSimplify       worked as a charm without errors.
