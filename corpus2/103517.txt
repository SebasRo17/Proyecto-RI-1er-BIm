I understand how to code. I know how to get around the basics of the languages I use regularly. I know how to write slightly-above-basic regular expressions, I can talk to databases, I can accept input, print output, handle files, etc. I'm more or less assured of my basic ability to spit out the source code for moderately complex program. My problem is that I never feel like it's enough. I feel like I only know a small portion of the standard library of my language, and that until I understand it all, at least in passing, I have no right to even try to get a job using it. I'm just out of (community/junior/whathaveyou) college, and my friends are getting jobs in the industry, but I still feel like a fake or a poser and that I'm just not good enough. Is there a decent marker for "I know enough" that I could use to assure myself that I can code? Should I take the fact that I'm at least capable of coding up a FizzBuzz as an indicator that it's alright to apply for things? How can I learn more of these standard libraries, frameworks, and/or APIs relatively easily? I code on a regular basis, I read books, but my knowledge still feels so shallow. HELP!
