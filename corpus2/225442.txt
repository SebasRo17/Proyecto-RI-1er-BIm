I am trying to make an UPDATE STATEMENT generator using C# Winforms. I would like to build a statement generator which will print statements like this:               UPDATE Customers     SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Hamburg'     WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';      But my problem is, how can I let the user paste in multiple values for each `SET`? My end user is likely to build a list using a spreadsheet and will want to paste in the values into a multi-line text box. I could create 2 multi-line text boxes, but what if i have more `SET` columns i need to add?
