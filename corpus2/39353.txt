After some googling I was unable to find out hierarchy of different titles in career development. Especially the connection between Senior Engineer and Software Specialist is unclear to me. Which one is higher? Most of all I would like to see links pointing to some career development paths from the trainee to the highest boss, and what kind of different routes there are including technical and managerial paths.
