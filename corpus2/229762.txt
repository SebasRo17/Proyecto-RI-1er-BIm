Sorry if the title is hard to understand, it is easier if I describe the scenario to get the question across. I have a service that collects data, performs business logic and does all the normal stuff. I now have to perform an integration that will provide a set of data (for sage accounts) via an endpoint (`http://example.net/import-feed`). This endpoint can be polled by the external service at any time to pull the latest changes. When a piece of data is updated, say a payment or a date this needs to be added to the feed. This payment or date could be changed multiple times before the service gets polled. The question is what is the best methods to keep track of **all** or the **last change (probably best)** made to the record/row/data and pull all of these changes into the feed. The external service will then send notifications back to my service letting me know if adding that update was successful or not. Currently the only method I can think of is track the last modified time and the last time it was imported, and a status saying if it needs to be imported/updated. These imports/updates would then be pulled from the feed. I hope you understand the problem, I have had a hard time trying to find information on this type of integration. It may just be me not using the correct terms. So, what are the methods for this?
