I'm currently a beginning developer (3 years). I have been mainly doing Web Development for as long as I have been developing. This is my comfort zone when it comes to programming. I like both JavaScript and PHP because they are easy to use; however, I would really like to further my knowledge when it comes to programming. I've been doing some research on many different languages just getting to know the look and feel of other languages. I like C as it has a similar syntax to JavaScript. I also like Ruby and Java. However, I think I need to learn one at a time. I have decided on Python because of its clean syntax and the fact that a lot of people consider it a good beginner language. ### My Problem I'm coming from languages that are both easy to learn and use (JavaScript and PHP). For example, for JavaScript all you need is:               <script type="text/javascript">         //script here     </script>      And you can execute a script and you can do things such as DOM manipulation. For PHP all you need is a server that has PHP installed and you can use:               <?php         //script here     ?>      You can then just execute it either through AJAX or a request in a form. I don't understand how to use Python. I don't believe you can just do AJAX requests with `python` files like you can with `PHP` files. What can I do with Python? Or do I use it? What have you made using it?
