In Java, the variance of parameterized types is indicated depending on how it's used:               <A extends B,B> void store(ArrayList<B> list, A elem) {         list.add(elem);     }      Whereas in Scala it is indicated in the class declaration with a `+` or `-`. What I want to know is, now that Scala has been around awhile, what has been people's experience with making variance a property of the type? Is it generally flexible enough for what you want to do? Are there aspects you would have done differently, knowing what you know now?
