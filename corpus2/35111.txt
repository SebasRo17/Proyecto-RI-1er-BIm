I am experiencing a curious behaviour of `Simplify` when handling expressions involving powers of $\mathbf{i}$, such as $\mathbf{i}^x$ where $x$ is unknown. For example, when I take the equation `2^x a == 0`, and I ask Mathematica to simplify it for me by calling `Simplify[2^x a == 0]`, it rightly answers that the original equation is equivalent to `a==0`; hence clearly Mathematica's `Simplify` "knows" that taking a power of something non-zero cannot produce a zero. However, if I ask about `I^x a == 0`, then the result of `Simplify` is merely `I^x a == 0`, i.e. what I started with. This remains true after adding the assumption that $x$ is an integer or changing `Simplify` to `FullSimplify` (i.e. `FullSimplify[I^( x) a == 0, Assumptions -> {Element[x, Integers]}]`. It would be much more convenient if This is obviously not a serious problem, but it can be a nuisance when I need to simplify a number of equations and would like to quickly see the result in a relatively uncluttered form. Also, I am curious about why things work the way they do, i.e. why complex powers are treated so much differently than real powers. Thank you for any solution to the problem, and/or explanation of this phenomenon. (A solution would be a way to "teach" Mathematica to eliminate factors like `I^( x)` in equations like `I^( x)*(something)==0`).
