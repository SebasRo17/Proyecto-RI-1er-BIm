I'm trying to add custom downvalues for `GeneratingFunction`, and to do so I thought I just had to `Unprotect` it. However, that doesn't work:               Unprotect[GeneratingFunction]      > >     {"GeneratingFunction"} >                 GeneratingFunction[2] = 3      > >     During evaluation of In[3]:= Set::write: Tag GeneratingFunction in >     GeneratingFunction[2] is Protected. >> >   >      3 >                 GeneratingFunction[2]      > >     During evaluation of In[4]:= GeneratingFunction::argmu: > GeneratingFunction >     called with 1 argument; 3 or more arguments are expected. >> >   >     GeneratingFunction[2] >   I'm running _Mathematica_ 9 64 bit on Linux. What do I need to do to really remove protection from this symbol?
