I'm sure that most shops use a standard whiteboard or a more fancier "glass- board" to discuss ideas during a meeting. After the meeting, people will usually take photos of the artifacts using a point-and-shoot camera and then e-mail the digital photo to all the participants. I'm thinking of buying a really huge LCD screen support to facilitate discussion. This LCD Screen will be outfitted with a Multi-touch "filter" that will be connected to a PC via the USB port. The PC will be connected to the screen via the HDMI port. The PC will run on a standard Windows 7 installation. Instead of writing/drawing on a whiteboard using a marker, the participants will use their fingers to draw/write stuff on the screen surface. Whatever input the "filter" receives, it will be sent back to the PC. So the application that has the focus is the one responsible for making sense of the input. I'm thinking of using "PAINT" for now. After the discussion, the "canvas" will be saved as an image and forwarded to participants e-mail. ^That's the easy/boring part. Here's the cool part: We can write an application that will fully utilize the Multi-touch technology to facilitate discussion more effectively. I'm thinking of writing apps like those in the Microsoft Surface computing videos. We can also outfit the PC with a camera and use facial recognition technology to automatically figure out who the participants are so we can provide a single "Distribute a copy of this canvas to the participants" button. Question:   1. Has anyone used a gigantic multi-touch screen over a whiteboard to facilitate discussion?   2. If yes, how successful was it?   3. Are there already software available today that makes these things possible?   4. Do you know a vendor/provider that provides a complete solution for this kind of things? Thanks!
