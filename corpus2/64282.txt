I'm currently evaluating Hibernate Envers 3.6.2.Final; an auditing module part of Hibernate. As far as I am in my evaluation, I feel a _little_ disappointed by Envers. I would expect much more from it :   1. More _clear_ documentation     * The documentation is sparse or unclear; lack of small drawings in the document   2. More activity from the community     * I have waited two days for having an answer from... the creator on the forum. Is he a busy man or there is nearly no people out there?   3. Much powerful and flexible API     * Querying the historical data is painful. I have to rely on direct SQL to achieve a simple "select field, count(id) from table_aud group by field" Do you know any equivalent or do you want to share your thougths with me ?
