I suffer from adult ADHD. Sometimes I get bored with projects or work items assigned to me at work because they aren't particularly interesting. I end up inventing more interesting work and working on that instead, not getting my assignments done on time. I do end up making useful software, but not what I committed to making. I know that I need to "suck it up" and "just do it", however the ADHD makes it difficult for me to choose what to think about. As a result, I get distracted often and don't deliver on time. Are there any techniques I should try to help stay on task, especially when there is more fun work I could be doing?
