In JavaScript, every number you will ever use will always be represented with what C programmer would call a `double`. The official type is I believe `number`. If I recall correctly, that fact was mentioned by Google as a "fundamental" problem with JavaScript and one of the reason why they wanted to have clean break with Dart. Now, I can't help but wonder :   * Can the ECMAScript standard just add that type? Would it be possible to do without breaking existing code?   * Anyway, can't a JIT engine watch the integer usage and generate code that is almost as efficient as using a native integer type, by using integer registers and opcodes? In effect : Could it be done? _Why should it be done?_
