I'm trying to do the following:               l = FileNames[];     s[x_] := ToString[l[[x]]]     t = Table[s[x], {x, 1, Length[l]}];     i[x_] := Import[t[[x]]]     m[x_] := ImageMultiply[i[x], i[x + 1]]      This is supposed to take two images of one folder and multiply them. But I want to take two images and multiply them, then I want to take the next two, multiply them and multiply to the last multiplied images and proceed like this for all the images in the folder. I already have a table with all the file locations, the problem is that `ImageMultiply[]` doesn't take lists as inputs. I wasn't able to do something like:               ImageMultiply[t]      Which would solve the problem, but the input of this function is:               ImageMultiply[image1,image2,...]      And not:               ImageMultiply[{image1,image2, ...}]      Perhaps there is some way of _drop_ all the elements out of the list into that function, I don't know about it. I've also looked some functions that look extremelly similar to what I'm trying to do, I guess that there's some way to use `NestList[]` or `Nest[]` to do it, but I've tried a few experiments and it resulted in hazard...$^1$ $1$ - I don't remember precisely which arguments (then I chose arbitrary ones) I used in that function, but it really froze my computer.
