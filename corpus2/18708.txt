I have a question regarding the error message: > >     NDSolve::ivone: Boundary values may only be specified for one > independent variable. >     Initial values may only be specified at one value of the other > independent variable. >> >   I'm curious as to when this error shows up. If I run the heat equation example from the `NDSolve` documentation, I get a valid solution. However, consider an edit to the p.d.e to               NDSolve[{D[u[t, x], {t, 2}] == D[u[t, x], {x, 2}], u[0, x] == 0,        u[t, 0] == 0, u[t, 5] == 0}, u, {t, 0, 10}, {x, 0, 5}]      That is, I changed $u_t = u_{xx}$ to $u_{tt} = u_{xx}$ and also changed an initial condition. (A solution of course is $u(x, t) = 0$.) Now, if I run this, I will get the error quoted above. I believe `NDSolve` doesn't even try to run. How do I need to edit the boundary conditions in order to get a run attempt? Does `NDSolve` only accept certain types of boundary conditions dependent on the order of the p.d.e? How do I find out what boundary conditions are acceptable? I'm asking about this because I'm trying to solve a very complicated third- order, nonlinear, p.d.e resulting from an optic equation and every set of initial conditions that I have given `NDSolve` for this 3rd-order equation has resulted in the above error.
