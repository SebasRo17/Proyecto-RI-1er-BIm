I am interested in a function which would stop _Mathematica_ reducing fraction. If my input is `50/100`, _Mathematica_ outputs `1/2`, I want it to output `50/100`. Any nice function which does this? I need this because I want to define a recursive function with this behavior:               f[0]=50/100     f[n_]:=(Numerator[f[n-1]]+1)/(Denominator[f[n-1]]+1)      I want to obtain `f[1]=51/101`, not `f[1]=2/3`, which I get. A more complicated example:               f[0]=50/100     f[n_]:=If[Mod[n,2]==0,(Numerator[f[n-1]+1])/n,Numerator[f[n-1]/(Denominator[f[n-1]‌​]+1)      This gets really annoying if I store 50/100 as {50,100}.
