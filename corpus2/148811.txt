We have a repository of tables. Around 200 tables, each table can be thousands of rows, all tables are originally in Excel sheets. Each table has a different scheme. All data is text or numbers. We would like to create an application that allows free text search on all tables (we define which columns will be searched in each table) efficiently - speed is important. **The main dilemma is which DB technology we should choose.** We created a mock up by importing all tables to MS SQL Server, and creating a full text index over them. The search is done using the CONTAINS keyword. This solution works well for a small number of tables, but it doesn't scale. We thought about a NoSQL solution, but we don't yet have any experience in it. Our limitations (which unfortunately I can not effect): Windows servers only. But we can install on them whatever we want.
