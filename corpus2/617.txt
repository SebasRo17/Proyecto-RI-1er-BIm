I have some data with 19000 sublists such as :               {"   7.9080000e+01   1.9283193e+04"}      Where the first number is the value for variable `A` and the second for variable `B`. All my attempts to transform this format have failed so far. I think my best guess was using `ToExpression` unsuccessfully. How can I transform such lists to a "plottable" format by   * Changing the `String` format ?   * Computing the `e` ?   * Import the data differently ?
