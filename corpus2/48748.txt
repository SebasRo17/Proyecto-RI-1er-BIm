I want Mathematica to excute the first action inside the `Button` fully before executing the second action. In particular, look at the following plot which I want to `Export` to a pdf.               Manipulate[myFigure=Show[Plot[x^2+a,{x,-1,1},PlotRange->{-1,4}]],{{a,2,"a"},-1,3},Button["Export a=0",{a=0,Export["Figure1.pdf",myFigure];}],Button["Export a=1",{a=1,Export["Figure2.pdf",myFigure];}]]      If I click `Export`, Mathematica seems to `Export` the plot before `Updating` the `Manipulate` to the new value for 'a'. However, I obviously want it to change to the new 'a' first, showing the new plot, and then `Export` this plot to a pdf. Any thoughts on how to make `Manipulate` `Dynamically Update` itself before the `Export`? Or other solutions?
