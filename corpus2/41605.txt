By definition, the interior point is a point inside an arbitrary region like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/seIFN.png) In picture above, $y$ is an interior point of region. **My question** is how to find the distance of an interior point from it's boundary? I have this Idea: By using the polygons, we can approximate the perimeter of region by a n-gon (n is large enough). Then by saving the coordinates of perimeter in two vectors, say $x$ and $y$, and use `Nearest` command we can find nearest point of perimeter from interior point ($y$). I created data matrices (find from here) in MATLAB and import to Mathematica.               imp = Import["PI.mat", "LabeledData"];     X = "KP" /. imp;     Y = "KI" /. imp;      But I can't know how to use `Nearest` command when we have large vectors like `X` and `Y` :               Nearest[{Flatten@X, Flatten@Y}, {3, 1.5}]      An error appears, because `Flatten@X`, `Flatten@Y` and `{3, 1.5}` are not the same length.
