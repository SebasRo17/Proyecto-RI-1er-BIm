As I understand it, writing your objects in an immutable style can help the performance of your program for compiled languages, as the compiler tends to rewrite your code in single static assignment form under the hood anyway. Is there a performance benefit to using immutable objects in an interpreted language like Python or PHP? I understand there may be readability or code quality benefits from immutability, but I am asking specifically about performance.
