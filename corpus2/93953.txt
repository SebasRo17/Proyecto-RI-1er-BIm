I am currently working as a software engineer for a large company (around 1000 employees). I recently got a job offer for a smaller company but with more pay (enough that I am really considering the move). The smaller company has about 17 employees and only about 4 developers. It also has a different title, I would be an application developer. Say in five years or so when I am looking to move to another job, will going from a larger company to a smaller company be viewed as negative on my resume? Will the change in title have any effect? The big question here is: How does the size of a company and title of the position affect your career?
