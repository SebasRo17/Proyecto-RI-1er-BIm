Take the following examples:               public static String returnOnce() {         String resultString = null;         if (someCondition) {             resultString = "condition is true";         } else {             resultString = "condition is false";         }         return resultString;     }          public static String returnMulti() {         if (someCondition) {             return "condition is true";         }          return "condition is false";     }      Is one approach objectively better than the other, or is it just a matter of preference? The first requires a temporary variable, but has just a single place where the method returns. Does the decision change if the method is more complex with multiple factors that could change the result?
