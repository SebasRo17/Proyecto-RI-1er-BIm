I have an application built in WPF and VB.net. It works on several Windows XP computers that I've tested it on, however, my animator's computer doesn't seem to like it. At first, the program would work up to a certain point, where the program would play a video. However, as she was missing the codec to play the video, it threw an exception. We installed the codec, and now the program silently fails all together, without so much as an error message or crash notification. These are the prerequisites that are required. All of these are installed on her computer. Assume prereqs for these items are also installed.   * .NET 4 Framework    * SQL Server Compact Edition 2006   * Windows Media Player v. 11   * Theora DirectShow codec Her computer is running Windows XP Home Edition SP3. What is going on? How can we get this program working on her system?
