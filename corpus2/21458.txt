Fairly often I have a need to get the `Ordering` of an expression but with recognition of duplicates. For example:               Ordering[{0, 4, 1, 1, 2}]      > >     {1, 3, 4, 5, 2} >   but with duplicates such as `3, 4` marked, i.e.: > >     {{1}, {3, 4}, {5}, {2}} >   I have been using a decorate-and-sort followed by `GatherBy` and `Part`:               {0, 4, 1, 1, 2} //       GatherBy[Sort[{#, Range@Length@#}\[Transpose]], First][[All, All, 2]] &      > >     {{1}, {3, 4}, {5}, {2}} >   Is there a better way?
