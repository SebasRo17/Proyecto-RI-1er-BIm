I have numbers;               A == 0x20000000     B == 18     C == (B/10)     D == 0x20000004 == (A + C)      A and D are in hex, but I'm not sure what the assumed numeric bases of the others are (although I'd assume base 10 since they don't explicitly state a base. It may or may not be relevant but I'm dealing with memory addresses, A and D are pointers. The part I'm failing to understand is how 18/10 gives me 0x4. **Edit: Code for clarity:**               *address1 (pointer is to address: 0x20000000)          printf("Test1: %p\n", address1);     printf("Test2: %p\n", address1+(18/10));     printf("Test3: %p\n", address1+(21/10));      Output:               Test1: 0x20000000     Test2: 0x20000004     Test3: 0x20000008
