Mathematica has _a lot_ of list manipulation functions, and, also because I don't work with lists often, at times I'm a bit lost. I'll find a way, but I'm sure it's not the most efficient. Case in point, this list:               list = {{x -> -1, y -> 5}, {x -> -1, y -> 6}, {x -> -1, y -> 7}, {x -> 0, y -> 2},       {x -> 0, y -> 3}, {x -> 0, y -> 4}, {x -> 0, y -> 5}, {x -> 0, y -> 6},        {x -> 0, y -> 7}, {x -> 1, y -> 2}, {x -> 1, y -> 3}, {x -> 1, y -> 4},        {x -> 1, y -> 5}, {x -> 1, y -> 6}, {x -> 1, y -> 7}, {x -> 2, y -> 3},       {x -> 2, y -> 4}, {x -> 2, y -> 5}, {x -> 2, y -> 6}, {x -> 2, y -> 7},       {x -> 3, y -> 4}, {x -> 3, y -> 5}, {x -> 3, y -> 6}, {x -> 3, y -> 7},       {x -> 4, y -> 5}, {x -> 4, y -> 6}, {x -> 4, y -> 7}, {x -> 5, y -> 6},       {x -> 5, y -> 7}, {x -> 5, y -> 8}, {x -> 6, y -> 7}, {x -> 6, y -> 8}, {x -> 7, y -> 8}}        I just need the numerical data, then this function:               Transpose[{list[[All, 1]][[All, 2]], list[[All, 2]][[All, 2]]}]      gives me the desired result, but it doesn't look good, and I'm afraid of wearing out my `[` and `]` keys.               {{-1, 5}, {-1, 6}, {-1, 7}, {0, 2}, {0, 3}, {0, 4}, {0, 5}, {0, 6}, {0, 7},       {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {1, 6}, {1, 7}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5},       {2, 6}, {2, 7}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {3, 6}, {3, 7}, {4, 5}, {4, 6}, {4, 7},       {5, 6}, {5, 7}, {5, 8}, {6, 7}, {6, 8}, {7, 8}}        What's the best way to extract the data from the list?
