I recently found the need to do recurrent billing. I am extremely averse to storing people's credit card information and I refuse to take risks in that area. I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, however. Using a gateway in my local area and currency is prohibitively expensive. Basically, as things stand, we can't do business through a gateway. Yet we need recurrent billing and the need to store credit card information has arisen. I thought of storing the credit card numbers (encrypted), partially or wholly, then saving the CCV number locally on an unwired machine. To bill customers, I would generate temp billing tables, and fire off a form manually for each customer that needs to be billed. I would manually populate the CCV and pipe a form to my payment processor (they will not store the data, unfortunately-- only process the payment). It's a manual PITA, and defeats the point of automation, but it's my best bet outside of storing the data outright. Can you give me any advice on my scheme?
