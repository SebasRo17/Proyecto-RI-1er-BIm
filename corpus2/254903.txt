My program's aim is to determine the correct time zone offset (GMT+k) as a series of numbers are fed to it. eg: -4 +11 1 -4 -4 So, here -4 (the mode of the series) is the correct value. But this requires storing the series then analyzing it and I do not have enough storage (RAM and FLASH) for this. The running average can be calculated easily by storing the list size and the sum. Is there a similar case for finding the mode?
