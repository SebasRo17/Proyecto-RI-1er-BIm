So I've worked on my own all this time, selling software, creating a few web applications on my own. I had an Arts background I was self taught. It was a bit difficult to find a development position after endless trying, I finally landed a LAMP position. What I realized was it was all confidence issue. Before when I didn't know a few things I panicked but after spending such a long time working on my own projects and solving various problems, I felt confident enough that I could fulfill requirements on my own. I hope this helps other people applying for jobs This is the first time I will be developing with other team members in an office, are there anything I should prepare for my first day at work next week? Any tips and pointers while working as a developer at a company? I'm kinda nervous but excited.
