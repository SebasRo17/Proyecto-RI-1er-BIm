I am developing a course registration website in Django. New users must confirm their email address by clicking on a link emailed to them. Unfortunately, this message is consistently ending up in people's spam folders. What steps can I take to prevent this from happening? Should I include an unsubscribe paragraph? Should I send less mass mail from my site (I occasionally send out a message to 500 emails.)?
