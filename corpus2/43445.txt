I want to find 2D-Fourier transformation of the function given below               f = HeavisideTheta[y1]*HeavisideTheta[y2 - y1]      For the purpose, I use built-in function in two ways as below,               FourierTransform[f, {y2, y1}, {q2, q1}]      FourierTransform[f, {y1, y2}, {q1, q2}]       The outputs are different depending on the order of variables. Please, See below. > >     -(1/(2 π q1 q2 + 2 π q2^2)) + (I DiracDelta[q2])/(2 q1) + >     (I DiracDelta[q1 + q2])/(2 q2) + 1/2 π DiracDelta[q2] DiracDelta[q1 + > q2] >   >     -(1/(2 π q1 q2 + 2 π q2^2)) + (I DiracDelta[q2])/(2 q1) - (I > DiracDelta[q1 + q2])/(2 q1) >   I thought they should be same. I don't know why they are different. Please help me to figure out which one is correct.
