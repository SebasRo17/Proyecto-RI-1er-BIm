I came across the concept of web development bootcamps, these 9-10 week intensive crash courses claim to teach beginners web development and help them get 80k starting salary jobs. Many of you might have heard of these. Is what the bootcamps promise feasible? Is it possible for web technologies like Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript to be taught from scratch in such a short period? And to people without a technical background?
