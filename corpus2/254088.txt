I am creating some helper functions (mvc.net) for creating common controls that I need in almost every project such as alert boxes, dialogs etc. If these do not contain any business logic and it's just client side code (html, js) then it's ok. My problem arises when I need some business logic behind this helper. I want to create a 'rate my (web) application' control that will be visible every 3 days and the user may hide it for now, navigate to rate link or hide it for ever. To do this I need some sort of database access and a code that acts as business logic. Normally I would use a controller for this, with my DI and everything, but I don't know where to put this code now. This should be placed **in the helper function** or **in a controller** that responds objects instead of ActionResults?
