I'm working towards implementing Gitlab at my company with a workflow strategy. My idea is that developers will be given access to repositories but, anytime they try to commit, their code must be reviewed. I know I can have them create a branch before committing, and then create a Merge Request after it's been pushed to the repo. I'm still unclear about certain things... The idea that we rely on people to create a branch and then a merge request seems faulty, is there a solution that forces some sort of policy that the master branch can stay clean unless an "admin" approves the code that's about to merge into it. I've read "github team workflow" but it doesn't seem to offer a viable solution. Any advice about process or your own best practice is appreciated. Thanks!
