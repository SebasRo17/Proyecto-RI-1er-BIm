I am attempting, for the first time, to use Mathematica to do some serious linear algebra. I would like to solve systems of equations of the form $$U_{n n'} f_{n'} = b_n.$$ I have an expression for $U_{n n'}$ that is of the general form $U_{n n'} = f_1(n) \delta_{n n'} + f_2(n,n')$. Is using 2 nested Table commands the easiest/most efficient way to build this matrix in Mathematica? I am not entirely sure how large I will need to make the matrix (it results from discretizing an integral equation, so the number of rows/columns will be as many as I need to get an accurate solution). I guess that it could be as large as 10,000 x 10,000, maybe. Is LinearSolve efficient enough to handle these sized systems on a standard desktop PC? Is parallelization for this automatic or do I need to do something manually? After I have found the solution, I am going to need to feed the solution to another equation to find the quantity that I am actually interested in. Is there anything I should do at the outset to make my life easier later? I apologize for the general nature of my question, but this is all new ground for me, so I am not sure what general guidelines and practices are best.
