I am a newbie. I have decent command over C++ but i lack domain knowledge when it comes to servers and stuff. My current assignment is to write ISAPI filters for IIS Web Server. I have been googling for a couple of days and have found out that its quite a challenging task. I found some examples here. I need to understand and implement some filters which would log requests to the server and take a count of requests on each resource. I do not seem to understand the code examples. Can you guys please suggest a plan or list of to do's for me. I ask this because i know there are a lot of prerequisites to this project. Where should I start ? How should I proceed ? I am expecting you guys to look at the code examples here and tell me what stuff I should read up to grasp the examples. Then i could imagine writing my own filters.
