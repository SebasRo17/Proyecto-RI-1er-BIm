I'm developing a site to monitor web services. The most basic type of check is sending a ping, storing the response time in a `CheckLog` object. By default, `PingCheck` objects are triggered every minute, so in one hour you get 60 `CheckLogs` and in one day you get 1440 `CheckLogs`. That's a lot of them, I don't need to store such level of detail, so I've set a up _collapsing mechanism_ that periodically takes the uncollapsed `CheckLogs` older than 24h and _collapses_ (averages) them in intervals of 30 minutes. So, if you have 360 `CheckLogs` that have been saved from 0:00 to 6:00, after collapsing you retain just 12 of them. The problem.. well, is this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vnX8p.png) After averaging the response times, the graph changes drastically. What can I do to improve this? Guess one option could be narrowing the interval duration to 15 min. I've seen the graphs at the GitHub status page and they do not seem to suffer from this problem. I'd appreciate any kind of information you could give me about this area.
