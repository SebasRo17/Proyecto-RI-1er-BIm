I start every `.java` file in my project with a license (BSD, in my case). And its first line says:               /**      * Copyright (c) 2011-2014, Firstname Lastname      *      * Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without      * modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions      etc.      The question is, why do I need to show years there? I see many other projects are doing the same. What will I lose by just saying `Copyright (c) Firstname Lastname`, without that time interval.
