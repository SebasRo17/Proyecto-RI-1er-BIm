I've a simple question, surely aleredy asked, but I can't find a simple answer to it. I've got 3 lists               listA = {{x1, y1, fA1}, {x2, y2, fA2}, ...}          listB = {{x1, y1, fB1}, {x2, y2, fB2}, ...}          listC = {{x1, y1, fC1}, {x2, y2, fC2}, ...}      `x` and `y` are the same for all, but the values of the funcions at each `(x, y)` are different. How can I plot the the lists using `ListDensityPlot` and scale colors in such a way that equal `f` have equal color?
