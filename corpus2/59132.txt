I tried to ask Mathematica to imitate Andy Warhol, let it convert a Marilyn Monroe's portrait looks like Warhol's world famous pop-art painting. However, the result shown below is far from satisfactory. How to obtain a better result? Warhol's world famous pop-art painting: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kIpXd.jpg) Result from the code below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OXwqw.jpg)               im = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/RSKpk.jpg"];     images = {{im, im, im, im}, {im, im, im, im}};      Do[images[[n, m]] = ImagePad[ (Colorize[Binarize[im ] ,            ColorRules -> {0 -> RandomColor[], 1 -> RandomColor[]}           ]  ), 6, White] , {n, 1, 2}, {m, 1, 4}] ;          ImageAssemble[images ]
