I have a `ListlinePlot` function, that I would like to combine with both a `Graphics3D` plot and a `ListPointPlot3D` plot, in such a way that the `ListLinePlot` is the bottom of the 3D boundary cube for the 3D plots. Can this be done in Mathematica 8.0.4? Obviously the code below fails to combine the plots in `Show`, but is there another way to accomplish this? Thanks!                   Needs["TetGenLink`"]     twodPts = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {10, 2}];     threedPts = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {50, 3}];     {pts, surface} = TetGenConvexHull[threedPts];          twoDptsPlot = ListLinePlot[twodPts, ImageSize -> {200, 200}];     threeDPtsPlot = ListPointPlot3D[threedPts, ImageSize -> {200, 200}];     surfacePlot =        Graphics3D[{EdgeForm[], Opacity[0.3],          GraphicsComplex[pts, Polygon[surface]], ImageSize -> {200, 200}}];          {twoDptsPlot,       Show[threeDPtsPlot, surfacePlot, ImageSize -> {200, 200},        BoxRatios -> 1, Axes -> False]}      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vzAIF.png)
