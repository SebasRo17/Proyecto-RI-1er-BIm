I was reading the book "Functional Programming for the Real World". It started with comparison between imperative and functional programming languages. And it stated how 'values' and 'expressions' in functional programming is different from 'variables' and 'functions' of imperative programming. From the discussion I sort of developed an idea that - > Functional programming languages have more opportunity to do compile time > optimization than their imperative counterparts. Is it true?
