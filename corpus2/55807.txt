I'm using the HierarchicalClustering package to cluster some data. So let's say I have this:               Needs["HierarchicalClustering`"]          In[21]:= Agglomerate[{1, 1, 2, 10, 4, 8}, Linkage -> "Single"]          Out[21]= Cluster[Cluster[Cluster[Cluster[1, 1, 0, 1, 1], 2, 1, 2, 1], 4, 4, 3, 1],  Cluster[8, 10, 4, 1, 1], 16, 4, 2]      Is there a direct way to go from that output to an undirected graph structure? The HierarchicalClustering package can create graphs as Dendrograms:               DendrogramPlot[{1, 1, 2, 10, 4, 8}, LeafLabels -> (# &),  Linkage -> "Single"]      But I would like to use the graph functions to work with the data. Maybe I'm doing this wrong and I don't even need the HierarchicalClustering to cluster my data. I would appreciate any ideas. Thanx!
