Yeah, I was wondering if it was possible ? I have a function which have different variables depending on time, like: $$\frac{d}{dt}mr^{2}\dot{\phi}$$ In this case both $r$, being a length, depends on time, and so does the time derived angle $\dot{\phi}$. I know this is an easy equation to solve in hand, but maybe sometime you get something a bit more difficult. So, can this be done in mathematica, and how ? :) Hope you understand what I mean. Thanks in advance.
