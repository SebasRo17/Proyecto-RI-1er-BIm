I'm a recent college graduate, and I'm mainly involved in high-level programming (e.g., Java, C#, and Python). I've received an offer form a good company for an embedded software engineer position, where I'd be programming devices with C, handling interrupts, and so forth. If I take this job and decide to go back into high-level software development later on, will I be at a disadvantage? Are there development practices specific to embedded development that will sour me to high-level development gigs? In a nutshell, if I'm mainly interested in high-level development, would this just be a very long diversion with very little benefit?
