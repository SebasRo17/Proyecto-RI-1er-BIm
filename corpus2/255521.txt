Just a quick question here. I already have a Bachelor's degree in Statistics, and I am thinking of getting the Graduate Certificate in Software Engineering offered by Harvard Extension. Assuming that I hold both BS in Statistics and Graduate Certificate in Software Engineering, Would it be possible me to pass the HR screening process if I apply for a programming job later on? (I am asking this because many programming analyst jobs seem to require a degree or diploma in Computer Science or Computer Engineering) Thanks,
