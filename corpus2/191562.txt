I have written a server/client program in which I am using 2 threads :   * One to recieve data continously and   * Other to send data as the user writes it on screen Problem: I have created the threads but durung execution ,the control gets stuck in the recieving thread having the infinite loop to recieve data and never goes to the sending thread. Please tell me if there is any solution to the problem.
