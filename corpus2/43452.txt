I am struggling with slots, In this case I have a function int which gives either true or false. When it gives true, I want               Select[interest, (DateList[#[[1, All]]] === #)&]      to be applied however as you can see this does not work because of the slots. Problem is that I want the slot in function `int[#]` to be the same as the slot behind ===. How can I overcome this problem?                If[int[#], Select[interest, DateList[#[[1, All]]]& === #],          2 {False}] & /@ fasteDatoer]      Simple example Lets say that when first applied it states int[james], which is true. I then want it to `Select[interest, DateList[#[[1, All]]]& === james.`
