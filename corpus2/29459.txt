Consider this code:               DynamicModule[{x, y},     x[t_] := t^2 + 5;     y[t_] := t^3 + 5;          Manipulate[Plot[fcn[t], {t, -5, 5}],     {fcn, {x -> "Square", y -> "Cubic"}}]]      ![SetterBar not working properly](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zQemy.png) Why does the SetterBar created by Manipulate not highlight properly when either option is selected? The same problem exists for other user interface elements, like a RadioButtonBar:               DynamicModule[{x, y},     x[t_] := t^2 + 5;     y[t_] := t^3 + 5;          Manipulate[Plot[fcn[t], {t, -5, 5}],     {{fcn, x, "Graph Type"}, {x -> "Square", y -> "Cubic"}, RadioButtonBar}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IZSfz.png) However, if you remove the DynamicModule, everything works as expected:               x[t_] := t^2 + 5;     y[t_] := t^3 + 5;          Manipulate[Plot[fcn[t], {t, -5, 5}],     {{fcn, x, "Graph Type"}, {x -> "Square", y -> "Cubic"}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pZUlD.png) Also if you were to replace DynamicModule with Block or Module, everything works as expected:               Module[{x, y},     x[t_] := t^2 + 5;     y[t_] := t^3 + 5;          Manipulate[Plot[fcn[t], {t, -5, 5}],     {{fcn, x, "Graph Type"}, {x -> "Square", y -> "Cubic"}}]]      Can anyone explain why this is, and how to fix it?
