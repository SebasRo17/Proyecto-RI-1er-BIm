I have a set of fractional coordinates. I also have a rotation matrix that operates on cartesian coordinates. Does anyone know how I could convert my rotation matrix so I can operate on the fractional coordinates? The fractional coordinates are functions of the basis vectors a,b,c and the corresponding alpha, beta, gamma. The following link explains how to do coordinate transformations. I'm just not sure about how to use the listed matrices to operate on the rotation matrix. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_coordinates Any ideas? Thanks
