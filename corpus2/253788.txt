I have a class that has three methods `A()`, `B()` and `C()`. Those methods modify the own instance. While the methods have to return an instance when the instance is a separate copy (just as `Clone()`), I got a free choice to return `void` or the same instance (`return this;`) when modifying the same instance in the method and not returning any other value. When deciding for returning the same modified instance, I can do neat method chains like `obj.A().B().C();`. Would this be the only reason for doing so? Is it even okay to modify the own instance and return it, too? Or should it only return a copy and leave the original object as before? Because when returning the same modified instance the user would maybe admit the returned value is a copy, otherwise it would not be returned? If it's okay, what's the best way to clarify such things on the method?
