Circle packing theorem states: _For every connected simple planar graph G there is a circle packing in the plane whose intersection graph is (isomorphic to) G._ **How to use Mathematica to draw examples of such pairs (graph, circle packing)?** More specifically: Generate a random connected simple planar graph with given number of nodes N (this can be done lets say using adjacency matrix; in a way another parameter affecting resulting graph could be "density" of links). Draw its usual graphical representation containing nodes and links. Then draw its circle packing representation. In other words, lets say there is N slider, and "density" slider (variable parameters). Based on that, get regular graph drawing and its circle packing. * * * NOTE ON GENERATING PLANAR GRAPHS: To my knowledge, this is not a trivial problem, and there is no built-in Mathematica solution. Though, there are several questions and answers here. One of best is Create triangular mesh from random list of points :               SeedRandom[1];     pts = RandomReal[{0, 12}, {100, 2}];     Needs["ComputationalGeometry`"];     dt = DelaunayTriangulation[pts];     dt // Column     toPairs[{m_, ns_List}] := Map[{m, #} &, ns];     edges = Flatten[Map[toPairs, dt], 1];     Graphics[GraphicsComplex[pts, {Line[edges],        Red, PointSize[Large], Point[pts]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yAiPy.png) * * * NOTE ON GENERATING CIRCLE PACK CORRESPONDENT TO THE PLANAR GRAPH: See: Collins, Stephenson: A circle packing algorithm. * * * This question is not an assignment. It is an intellectual experiment, related to aestetics and structure. I am not requesting code. I am seeking ideas, approaches, and solutions. * * * Visual examples: * * * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/omIfc.png) * * * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gSPBW.png) * * * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Z7pz.jpg)
