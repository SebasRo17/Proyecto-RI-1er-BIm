I would like for the autocomplete feature to search through contexts, for example if I have a symbol named A`B`C`MyFunction, when I type A` and press "cmd + shift + k" it will complete it. _Edit_ To be clear, I don't want to have to type the path because it's usually very long, and I don't want to have to type the function name again, even if the path itself gets auto completed. I want the following: If I have these functions:               Very`Long`Context`For`My`Function1     Very`Long`Context`For`My`Function2     ...      I want to be able to type Very` and then press CMD+Shift+k, to get a dropdown menu saying exactly               Very`Long`Context`For`My`Function1     Very`Long`Context`For`My`Function2     ...
