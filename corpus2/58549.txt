I have the following list               w={{0.01,99 +0.00001414 I},{0.15,6.6370108 +0.003144129 I},{0.25,3.9515722 +0.00854493297 I},{6,0.10041 +0.28132187 I}}      and I want to `ListPlot` the imaginary part but with the command `Im[w]` I get the list               {{0,0.00001414},{0,0.00314413},{0,0.00854493},{0,0.281322}}      This way I basically lose the x axis values 0.01, 0.15, 0.25 and 6. How can I get in a list the imaginary part and the x axis values? (With `Re[w]` I can get the real part right, the 0.01, 0.15 etc don't change)
