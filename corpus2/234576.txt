I solved my problem by using simple nested loops and comparisons but I'm wondering if there is a well known Selection Algorithm to solve my problem. Let's say I have an array such as [1, 10, 250, 9, 8,8, 249, 249, 248, 247, 2, 4, 9, 10, 9, 7, 6] I need to find subarrays [6,7,8,9,10] [8,9,10] [247, 248, 249, 250] Subarrays should be min. 3 length size. I dont want a solution but a similar algorithm would help me refactor my code. I'm currently doing this with nested loops and using buffer collections.
