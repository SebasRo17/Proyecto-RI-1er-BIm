> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Are certifications worth it? I am looking to get into more Java Development after being thrown on a project that required Java development for a month and successfully knocking it out. I still feel as though I could use a little bit more refinement with Java and I thought certifications might be the way to go. I would like to be certified in JPA, Java Web services, and Java Front end development (probably JSF or Spring MVC or something like that). I would like to be an architect at some point as well. I have a couple of questions about what is the best way to go about getting certified. My first question is regarding the Java Certification process itself: 1) Is there a baseline certification that I would need to get before I go out and get certified in JPA , Web Services, Front End development, and Architect certification? 2) Do you think that certification is even a good idea? Do you know of employers that would give someone a leg up if say, he has only worked on one or two Java EE projects but has a certification or two? 3) Is this a good step in terms of career development? Is focusing just on development limiting my self to the basement of some development firms? How can I make myself more valuable as a business asset? Any other thoughts you guys have on certifications and their business worth?
