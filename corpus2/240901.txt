Sometimes while I'm editing something I see some useless code added by other developers, probably due to habit. Editing this code will not make any difference, so is it appropriate? In my specific case I'm talking about Java private fields like this:               private int aSimpleInt = 0;     private boolean myBool = false;     private MyObject obj = null;      declaring the default values is redundant and useless.   Should I remove them or just skip?
