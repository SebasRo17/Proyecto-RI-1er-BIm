In a typical computer science algorithms course, much attention is given to the discussion of queues vs. stacks as a data structure programmers need to consciously choose from to achieve algorithmic performance. What's a good Mathematica program example that also involves (explicitly) choosing data structures? Most of these "implementation details" or algorithmic design tactics is automated in a black box fashion by Mathematica's Automatic idiosyncrasy.
