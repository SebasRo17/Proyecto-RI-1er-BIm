I am working with a web application, using TFS. Every time I build the site it takes an unproductivly long time to start up again. I would like to have a second mapping of the site on my c drive, where I would only get latest and build once a day, so this version would always be fast. This would be like a "readonly" directory as I wouldn't personally make any edits to it. Please let me know if this possible, or if you have any alternative.
