I am building an application in C# that works with a Progress database. The passwords that are stored in this database are stored using a hash algorithm that Progress has not made public. However, I would like to authenticate using these hashes. Is it feasible to reverse engineer such a hash algorithm and how would I go about doing this? To be clear: I am not looking for a way to get the unhashed passwords from the hashes. I'm looking for the algorithm to get a hash from a password.
