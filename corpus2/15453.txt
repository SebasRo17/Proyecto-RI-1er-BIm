I have a question on using logarithmic ticks in a colorbar in _Mathematica_ 8.0 . I use the package `ColorbarPlot` (`type->"Density"`) in order to show a legend. As well as the default ticks, I can set the ticks by myself. The problem is that my data range is from $-10^{16}$ to $10^{16}$, and I cannot see the intermediate values because the values with large exponents at the two ends to the range absorb all the colour. One solution would be to have logarithmic ticks, but I have also negative values. Do you have any ideas? If you have another solution without using `Colorbarplot`, it would also be welcome.
