In real-time games, there is always a game loop that runs every few milliseconds, updates the game with new data and repaints the entire screen. Is this something that is seen in other types of applications, other than games? A 'constant-update-loop'? For example, imagine an application like MSPaint. The user can draw lines on the screen with the mouse. The line that is being drawn is displayed on the screen as it is being drawn. Please imagine this line is actually made of a lot of smaller lines, each 2 pixels long. It would make sense to store each of these small lines in a List. But as I said, the line that is being drawn (the large line, made out of lots of small lines) is displayed as it is being drawn. This means that a repaint of the screen would be necessary to display the new small line that was added the previous moment. But - please correct me if I'm mistaken - it would be difficult to repaint only the specific part of the screen where the new small line was drawn. If so, a repaint of the entire screen would be necessary. Thus it would make sense to use an 'update loop' to constantly repaint the entire screen, and constantly iterate over the list of lines and draw these lines over and over again - like in games. Is this approach existent in non-game applications, and specifically in 'drawing' applications? Thanks
