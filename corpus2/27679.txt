I have a graph here and I want to be able to manipulate the 4 parameters that are in the Block command. I want to watch the graph change as I change the parameters. I've done this before, but the Block command that Mathematica suggested throws me off a little bit. Here is the code:                test = Block[{ε = 3, ω0 = 1, ωf = 1.788,       A = 5}, Reap[      NDSolve[{x''[t] == ε (1 - x[t]^2) x'[t] - ω0^2*x[t] +           A*Sin[ωf*t], x[0] == 1, x'[0] == 0,         WhenEvent[Mod[t, 2 π/ωf] == 0,          Sow[{x[t], x'[t]}]]}, {}, {t, 0, 10000},        MaxSteps -> ∞]]][[-1, 1]];          ListPlot[test, ImageSize -> Medium, PlotRange -> All,       PlotStyle -> PointSize[0.0035]]
