I am new to web programming and just started learning XML and AJAX. I am creating a social gaming website for my college project. I am confused at the point of using XML for AJAX in HTML5. As XHTML is replaced by HTML5 so is it ok to use XML or i should choose JSON (i know nothing about JSON but it is what I found in answers on web to the question related to choice between JSON and XML). My preference is XML because it is in my syllabus but I want to make sure that XML and HTML5 will not conflict.
