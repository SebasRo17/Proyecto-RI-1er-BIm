I would like to investigate whether ClojureScript, with the associated Google Closure library is a reasonable tool to build modern, in-browser, Javascript applications. My current Javascript stack consists of jQuery, Backbone and RequireJS with the possible additions of some widgets libraries like jQueryUI or KendoUI. So it will be quite a big leap (I already know how to work in Clojure, although I have little experience). What is a good roadmap to do so? Should I learn the Google Closure library first, or can I grasp it together with ClojureScript? One thing I am concerned about is the overall application structure. Backbone is rather opinionated on how to organize your application. I am not sure whether Google Closure also includes some components to help with the design of the application. And, if this is the case, I do not know how to tell whether this structure will port to ClojureScript or a ClojureScript application will require a different organization anyway, and only use - say - the widgets and DOM manipulation features of Closure.
