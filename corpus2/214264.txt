Why does:               something = false      always return false? Since it is an assignment and not a comparison, it seems it would make more sense to return the result (success/failure) of the assignment ( **like pretty much every other assignment you do** ). **EDIT - this is wrong, as the answers below point out. My bad. Slight brain fart. See the original impetus for this question in the comments below.** What happens if `some_boolean_var = false` failed for whatever reason (unlikely, but theoretically possible, especially if you defined a custom method for this action)? That would also return false, so you have no indication as to whether the assignment actually worked. It basically just means you can't combine assignment and comparison in one line like you can do with nearly everything else in Rails. For example, you can't do:               if something = false (note the single =)       do stuff     end      I mean you can do it but not if you wanted to check and make sure the assignment succeeded first. Just really weird to me. I'm sure there is a reason for this so please enlighten me :) Thanks in advance!
