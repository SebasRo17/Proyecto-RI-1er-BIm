I am trying to write a command to collapse the sum of terms into an expression with summation. Something like               F_[1, j___] + F_[2, j___] + F_[3, j___] := Sum[F[i, j], {i, 1, 3}]      which is designed to to collapse the LHS, which is a function of 2 or more parameters (for example - F[i,j] or F[i,j,k] - this is the reason for the i___ in the definition) into a summation on the first variable. but I get the following error:               SetDelayed::write: "Tag Plus in F_[1,i___]+F_[2,i___]+F_[3,i___] is Protected"      It seems that I am overriding the _Plus_ definition. I don't know then how to define this properly. Thanks.
