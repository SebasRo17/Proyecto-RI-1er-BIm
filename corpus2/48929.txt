I was looking at this question (writing a program such that 2 + 2 = 5) and tried to write something in Mathematica, but I couldn't get something to work without completely replacing `Plus`. Neither of these worked:               Unprotect[Plus]     Plus[2, 2] := 5     Unprotect[Integer]     2 + 2 ^= 5      This book suggests that `Plus` and `Times` have special rules. Is this really impossible to do?
