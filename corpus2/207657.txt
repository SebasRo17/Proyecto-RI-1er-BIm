I have designed a simple website on paper. Now I want to produce a professional-looking document for my customer to approve. How can I do this? I've tried Visio, but it seems horribly overcomplicated and unsuitable for my purpose. I could describe what I've written in words in a Word document but that'd be much harder to read and understand. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1rTG3.jpg)
