Suppose $(X_1,Y_1)$ is a bivariate random vector with a given distribution and let $X_2$ be a univariate random variable with the same distribution as $X_1$ but independent of $(X_1,Y_1)$. I want to find the distribution of $(X_1+X_2,Y_1)$. As an specific example suppose $(X_1,Y_1)$ is bivariate normal so my first attempt was the following code:               \[ScriptCapitalD] =      TransformedDistribution[{u + w ,      v}, {{u, v} \[Distributed]       BinormalDistribution[{0, 0}, {1, 1}, 0.5],      w \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[0, 1]}];          PDF[\[ScriptCapitalD], {x, y}]          PDF[     TransformedDistribution[{u + w,      v}, {{u, v} \[Distributed]      BinormalDistribution[{0, 0}, {1, 1}, 0.5],      w \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[0, 1]}], {x, y}]          Mean[\[ScriptCapitalD]]          {0, 0}          Covariance[\[ScriptCapitalD]]          {{2., 0.5}, {0.5, 1.}}      I have tried some other distributions such as uniform distribution as well but I can not get the `PDF` of the joint distribution. Although I can find the answer myself by using the transformation theory for random variables I wonder if it is possible to get the results in Mathematica.
