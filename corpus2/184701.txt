Are there any studies that aggregate data over a wide population of contributed code, that establish a correlation between amount of code written in a commit and the # of bugs discovered in that code ? It'd be hard to do in github without knowing whether a change was due to new functionality or a bug, but you could determine a relation between lines of code per commit and how much thrashing eventually goes on in that code.
