I'm attempting to remove all points in an array which are within a Euclidean distance "ThresDist" of one-another. Using the command:               DeleteDuplicates[List, EuclideanDistance[#1, #2] <= ThresDist &];      I can remove one point in a pair of points that fall within a distance "ThresDist" of one-another. However:               DeleteCases[List, EuclideanDistance[#1, #2] <= ThresDist  &];      Fails to work similarly. Is there something wrong with my approach? Note : I made a typo earlier in writing DeleteCases, and also used a poor variable name. This was sloppy of me. As for the actual question - how might I best accomplish my goal? I've searched through Mathematica's function directory, and I can't seem to find an appropriate way to prune not just a duplicate point, but all points that fall within a threshold distance of one-another?
