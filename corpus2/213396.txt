As in the question above: What the best way to wire up Entity Framework database model (context) to viewModel in MVVM (WPF)? I am learning MVVM pattern in WPF, alot of examples shows how to implement model to viewModel, but models in that examples are just simple classes, I want to use MVVM together with entity framework model (base first approach). Whats the best way to wire model to viewModel. Thanks for answers.               //ctor of ViewModel      public ViewModel()     {      db = new PackageShipmentDBEntities(); // Entity Framework generated class          ListaZBazy = new ObservableCollection<Pack>(db.Packs.Where(w => w.IsSent == false));      }      This is my usual ctor of ViewModel, think there is a better way, I was reading about repository pattern, not sure if I can adapt this to WPF MVVM
