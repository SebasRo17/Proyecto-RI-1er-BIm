I'm considering using Grails for a new website, but am open to other/new programming languages and frameworks. I have done development using J2EE/JSF2, ASP.NET, and PHP. Is Grails or Ruby on Rails pretty much the best way to get functionality up and running quickly? Some initial thoughts:   * DJango looks similar to RoR/Grails and I'd consider it   * GWT is an interesting concept but it doesn't seem like turnaround time is quite as fast Thanks, -Jon
