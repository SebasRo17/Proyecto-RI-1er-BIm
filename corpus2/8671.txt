I have a function, say               minimizeme[ω_][β_][ϵ_] = ϵ^2 ω-Log[2 (Cosh[2 β]+Cosh[2 β ϵ])]/(2 β);      I want to make a high-precision dynamic `ContourPlot` of it using:               plottricrit[ω_] := ContourPlot[      D[minimizeme[ω][β][ϵ], ϵ] == 0,      {β, 0.5, 1.0},      {ϵ, -3, 3},      Evaluated -> True,       ContourStyle -> Thick,       RegionFunction -> Function[         {β, ϵ},          minimizeme[ω][β][ϵ] < minimizeme[ω][β][0]],      ImageSize -> Large,       PerformanceGoal -> Accuracy,      WorkingPrecision -> 60]          Manipulate[plottricrit[ω],{ω,0.217`60,0.22545`60}]      However, I keep running into a `ContourPlot::precw` message which tells me that > The precision of the argument function (...) is less than > `WorkingPrecision`. I have tried several ways to set the right precision (i.e., using `With` to inject a higher `$MachinePrecision`, using `SetPrecision`, using `Rationalize`, etc.), but I can't seem to get rid of this error. What is the right way to deal with it?
