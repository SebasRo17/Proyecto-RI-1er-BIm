Was wondering if you could help me on a SQL problem I’m having. I have a set of records of events where each event has a start time and end time. No event has the same start time, and the end time for each event is greater than or equal to the preceding event. What I want to be able to do is pull out the set of records that are not overlapping – where the start time for an event is not between the start/end for any other event. In the example below, the start time for B/C/D are in- between A’s start and end, so I want to keep A, and get rid of B,C,D. Then start over again, keeping E, and get rid of F, then start over and keep G, getting rid of H/I, etc. Seems like this requires a self join but I can’t figure out the criteria for that would identify the records this way. Any ideas?               Event |  Start  | End     A             1            10 (keep)     B             2            11 (discard because start time of 2 < 10)     C             5            15 (discard because start time of 5 < 10)     D             9            12 (discard because start time of 9 < 10)     E             10           13 (keep -  this starts a new set because it’s the first record after A with start >= A end)     F             11           20 (discard because 11 < 13)     G             14           22 (keep -  this starts a new set because it’s the first record after E with start >= E)     H             15           22 (discard because 15 < 22)     I             17           27 (discard because 17 < 22)     J             22           27 (keep -  this starts a new set because it’s the first record after G with start >= G)
