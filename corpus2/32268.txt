I've a (perhaps too) basic questions that has been bugging me for a while. Manipulate seems to ignore global assignments. For instance the following does not result in the obvious output one would expect:               a = x*b;     Manipulate[Plot[a, {x, 0, 1}], {b, 1, 2}].      Instead, to had a 45 degree line, one had to redefine the a object within manipulation:               Manipulate[x*b;Plot[a, {x, 0, 1}], {b, 1, 2}].      Is there a way to have `Manipulate` to use the global assignment `a=x*b`? Thanks!!
