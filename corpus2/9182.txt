Suppose I wanted to draw the zero contour for the function $$d^2-g.$$ I could use the following code:               ContourPlot[d^2-g,{g,0,1},{d,0,1},Contours->{0},                     ContourStyle->Black,ContourShading->None,FrameLabel->{"g","d"}]      Which produces this: ![contour plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZvUY1.png) Taking this one step further, I might want to plot the zero contour for $$td^2-g.$$ at various values of $t$, which I could achieve functionally with               Show[Table[ContourPlot[t*d^2-g,{g,0,1},{d,0,1},Contours->{0},                ContourStyle->Black,ContourShading->None,FrameLabel->{"g","d"}],{t,0.1,1,0.1}]]      producing this: ![multi-contour plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zu9W4.png) Now, to make this easier to understand, I want to label each contour with its corresponding value of $t$, but this is where I run into trouble. I had thought that this could be achieved with the option               ContourLabels->t      but that yields this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGFlA.png) (it seems to have moved the labels rather than changing them). Does anyone know how to get Mathematica to draw a label equal to the relevant value of t on each of these contours? Secondly, assuming I can get that working, how can I reposition the labels towards the top of the contours so that they appear where the contours are furthest apart.
