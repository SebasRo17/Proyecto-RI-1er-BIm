So I am interested in working towards are few specific certs. Namely Oracle 11g, MySQL, and Java. I know there are tons of books out there, and I do plan to hit up my local library on these subjects in the near future. However, I find myself wanting to get some digital info, and was wondering if anyone knows of a repository that would have pdf books on these subjects, or knows of a better way to pursue the knowledge. Seeing as how I don't have $3k a pop for the classes, I'm looking for ways to get my knowledge a little cheaper? Thanks for the help in advance.
