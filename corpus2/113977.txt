This is probably a stupid question, but do I need to Clean/Rebuild before Debugging or Publishing a Visual Studio project? I see other developers doing it all the time, and at some point I started doing it without even thinking. It seems habit to always go Clean, wait, Rebuild, wait, Publish. I know I didn't always do it.... I think I started to do it after spending a bunch of time debugging an error, only to discover it went away when I Cleaned and Rebuilt the solution. I've had this issue more than once too, so I know it wasn't a one-time thing, but it seems like a huge waste of time to always be cleaning/rebuilding your projects.
