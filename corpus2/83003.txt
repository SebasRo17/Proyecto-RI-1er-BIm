I have a problem with a senior director who doesn't understand iterative development (much less Agile). He is insistent that our software design specification (SDS) be complete before any line of code is written. Complete, to him, means all functional detail is there. Also, being a former Cobol programmer, he wants to see "modules" and flowcharts. This is a Java web app for crying out loud! Anyway, I'm trying to find a simple place to gently point him to show that the SDS need not be 100% complete before we begin coding (nor can it be complete). Any suggestions? Thanks!
