I don't know if this is too broad or not, but I am a youngish programmer still in college, its my Junior year. I feel like I have a pretty good grasps for different languages and have a pretty good base. But I am stumbling to think how if for example, I am trying to create a program and say I wrote one part in python just because its easy, and does the job, but this program would need to get output from another program that I wrote in C and I am using C because of its speed. I am not sure how to have the two different programs and languages interact with each other to create an overall one total program. I am thinking of like sure you can write to a file, but then what if python and C programs both accessing a file I would need to think of locks. Most times I have done this was with importing files into a program, but in that case they are the same language so that is easy I just use the import function, but with two languages/programs interacting to create one cohesive output I am having trouble. I was thinking about this question because I was thinking of diving into creating some basic web applications just to learn but I have no idea how to have say javascript file interactive with something that I wrote in python or vice-versa. I feel like I am missing something really easy here and just not understanding. Sorry if this question is too broad but I couldn't really find a clear answer online, I was trying to look through an opensource webapp, but couldn't really grasp an answer from it, again pardon me if the question seems dumb I thought this be a good place to ask I love reading on stackexchange. Thank you for any reply.
