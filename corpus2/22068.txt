Suppose you have some notebooks, they work for a family of related tasks, each one doing a certain task. Lets say Notebook 1 gets two inputs from its variables `in11` and `in12`, and produces one output to `out1`. The other Notebook 2 gets two inputs from its variables `in21` and `in22`, and produces one output to `out2`. How can we set up a kind of master notebook where just the decision to select a specific   task should be made, the assignments to the variables are made, and the result of the calculation is shown. The two working notebooks themselves should be in the same folder on your disk, and a call from the open master notebook pipes them their respective inputs and outputs.
