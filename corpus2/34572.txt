I am trying to create a financial dashboard using _Mathematica_. I am having trouble formatting the axes ticks to show whole numbers. Further, when I hover over one of the chart elements, it is displayed in scientific notation. I have attached the code and an image.               Manipulate[       sql = StringJoin[         "select Right(Period,2) as [Period], SUM(Revenue) as [Revenue] ",          " from PRSummaryCMF where Month >=  ", ToString[a],          " and Year =  ", ToString[b], " group by Period order by Period"];       n = SQLExecute[conn, sql];       BarChart[n[[All, 2]],          ChartLabels -> {n[[All, 1]]},          ChartStyle -> "Pastel" ,          BarSpacing -> Automatic],        {{b, 2010, "Year"}, {2010, 2011, 2012, 2013}, ControlType -> Setter},        {{a, "01", "Period"},          {"01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", "08", "09", "10", "11", "12"},          ControlType -> Setter,  Appearance -> "Labeled"},       ContentSize -> 500]      ![Output Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CmCv6.jpg)
