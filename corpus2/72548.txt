Our team of developers are going to start holding monthly meetings for the purposes of cross training and knowledge improvement. We're looking for ideas for topics to discuss. We've already made a list of some obvious ones, such as discussions/training on specific applications, proper usage of TFS for source control, bug tracking and code reviews, coding standards, and corporate architecture. The problem we're having is that we are a cross-platform development team so we don't want to look at topics that only apply to certain members of the team (Sql, .NET, reporting, third party apps, etc). We'll use sub-team meetings for those. So what other topics that would apply across a broad development team would be good for these training sessions?
