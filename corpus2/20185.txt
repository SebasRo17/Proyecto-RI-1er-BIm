I have an ESRI ShapeFile (SHP) that I've loaded. It has a number of layers which I can see the names of by using:               Import["file.shp", "LayerNames"]      I get something like > {"Africover_Kenya_Spatial_Aggregation", "ke-landcover", "ke-forests", \ "ke- > rangeland", "ke-agriculture", "ke-waterbodies", "ke-bareareas", \ "ke- > urban", "ke-politicalboundary", "theme1"} I would like to import just one layer ("ke-landcover" for example) from the data but I can't figure this out. If I ask for the "Graphics" element, I think I get the layers individually, but I don't know how to verify whether this is true or not. I'm new to mathematica, and documentation for GIS applications is limited at best. Can anyone help me? Thanks!
