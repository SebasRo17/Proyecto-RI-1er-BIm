Just wondering if someone could suggest a good algorithm in the collaborative filtering vein that I could use to suggest music choices based on top ten lists. This is a personal project, I am a member of a private music blog where most of the users recently submitted "best of 2011" lists. The lists range in size (say 10-50 albums) and are not ranked. Have around 100 lists. Basically hoping to give each user some recommendations based on the correlation of their list with everyone else's.
