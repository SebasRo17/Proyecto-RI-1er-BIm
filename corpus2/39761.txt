I have a recursive integral sequence as follows: $$y_0(x)=1+r,$$ $$y_1(x)=-\frac{1}{\Gamma(a)}\int_0^x (x-t)^{a-1} y_0(t) dt,$$ $$\vdots$$ $$y_n(x)=-\frac{1}{\Gamma(a)}\int_0^x (x-t)^{a-1} y_{n-1}(t) dt,\quad 0<a<1.$$ I wrote the following code but the output answer isn't correct. I know this problem is caused by the change of variables($t‎\leftrightarrow‎ x$ ) in $y_n(x)$. How to modify this problem?               Y[0, x_] = 1 + r;     Y[k_, x_] :=       Y[k, x] =FullSimplify[-(1/Gamma[a])*Integrate[(x - t)^(a - 1)*(Y[k - 1, t]), {t, 0, x}]]     For[i = 0, i <= 10, i++, Print["Y", i, "[x]=", Simplify[Y[i, x]]]]
