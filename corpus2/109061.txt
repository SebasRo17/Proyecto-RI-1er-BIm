I was at Google Developer Day yesterday and I was approached by several companies looking for hire and for freelance work. As I am interested in doing some freelance work I chatted a little with the representatives of these companies and they all gave me their business cards. I was a little taken aback by this since I didn't have a business card for myself and the fact that I find business card to be quite simply outdated. So, lacking a business card, I gave them my website address where I have a portfolio, links to my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts and a blog. Should I order some business cards and carry them around in these events? I can't shake the feeling that business card are outdated, am I just plain wrong?
