I'd like to make a simple-ish website that is essentially a small game. Key strokes are to be processed and sent to a server (already acquired and should support SQL and JSP, I believe) which then translate to a location and written to the DB. SQL queries are to be used to retrieve these locations and written to other clients connected to the website. Their page is to be updated with these locations. I have working knowledge of Java, jQuery/Ajax, SQL and JavaScript but I'm unfamiliar with JSP and how everything hooks up. I'm aware of the MVC paradigm as well. For my little game idea, would these technologies work? Am I over thinking this and can make it much easier to implement? What might be a good tutorial or example to study? EDIT: I was just informed I will not be able to use WAR files on the server. I'm not big on php and really don't like developing with it, can I still use Java?
