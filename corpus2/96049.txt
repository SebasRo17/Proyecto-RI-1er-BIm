I'm an ASP.NET developer since 3 years ago and I'm now pretty powerful in WebForms. But now it seems that everybody is moving or shifting towards ASP.NET MVC, and my company is also taking this shift. The question is, when and how can you feel that it's the time to shift to a newer technology. For example, when and how can you feel that you have to go from HTML4 to HTML5, or CSS2 to CSS3, or ASP.NET WebForms to ASP.NET MVC, etc.?
