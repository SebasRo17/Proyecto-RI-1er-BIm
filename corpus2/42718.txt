There's an option for `FullSimplify`, which is `Trig`, and with it I could prevent a trigonometric identities from being used. I'm looking for a similar option that would prevent `FullSimplify` from using the Euler formula               Sin[x] -> 1/2/I (Exp[x] - Exp[-x])     Cos[x] -> 1/2   (Exp[x] + Exp[-x])      So I want `FullSimplify` to retain `Sin` and `Cos` functions and to use trig identities, but no conversions to `Exp`. ### Edit Example as requested from a comment:               Cos[2 B g t] Sin[u]^2 - I Sin[2 B g t] Sin[u]^2      In this formula, I want `FullSimplify` not to convert `Cos[2 B g t] - I Sin[2 B g t]` to `Exp[-2IBgT]`.
