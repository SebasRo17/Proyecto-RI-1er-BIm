So I am creating a web api for an app I am making. The data is sanitized before it is sent to my web api and then encrypted before it is stored in my MySql server. The phone app sanitizes then behind the scenes calls -> web php api which encrypts aes style with a hard coded salt then calls -> server My question is if I hard code a salt value into the php page is it at risk on a go daddy server? I mean I know NOTHING is truly secure however what are the odds that someone would be able to hack a go daddy server and see my php source code. Assuming they disassemble my app and see the URL call to the api. Since php code executes on the server I am assuming that there is no way to extract it?
