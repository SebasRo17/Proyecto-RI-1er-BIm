At our company we have started outsourcing some of our development. This has worked somewhat well. However, we are having a hard time getting them to properly use version control. They are familiar with SVN and know how to use it. However, for some reason they don't commit regularly, instead they work with 16 things simultaneously and make a huge commits every 2 weeks, if we are lucky maybe with a few comments. Which makes it very difficult to both following and review their work, collaborate and also fix bugs. I have tried to explain to them to do their work as one small task at a time and regularly commit each of these with appropriate comments. Without much success, either they don't understand the concept or they are lazy. My question is, what would be good guidelines describing how one should work with version control, not from a technical perspective (they know SVN), which seems to be the only thing I'm finding online, but from a development/collaboration/project perspective?
