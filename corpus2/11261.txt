I'd like to have first a function plot and then the same plot repeated inside a `Manipulate`, with additional things (like tangent planes etc.). I can do               plot=Plot3D[<whatever>]      and then               Manipulate[Show[plot,<whatever>],...]      but there is one problem. I'd like to have the _second_ plot semi-opaque, so that things are more visible. My question is either (1) how to achieve this using my approach with `plot=Plot3D[...]`, or (2) is there any better approach? I've seen this question, but the first answer seemed too complicated (am I wrong?) and the second one didn't work for me...
