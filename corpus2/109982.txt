I'm curious what is considered the standard today for use as the Collation of MySQL Tables? I was told that Latin-1 was the best choice when I was beginning with MySQL, but came across this post from 2009. It states that US-ASCII and LATIN-1 Character Sets are on the way out, and that UTF-8 is on the way in and should be made the default by MSQ version 6. Does this gel with what you know, or with what you think, or with what you do? For this question, let's assume there is no specific need for non-english characters.
