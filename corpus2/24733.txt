I'd like to plot two sets of coordinates in two different arrays using ListLogPlot, and be able to individually specify the sizes and colors of the datapoints for each array. Things seem to work fine if I allow Mathematica to specify point sizes and colors automatically:               ListLogPlot[{ListA, ListB}, ImageSize -> {800, 800}]      I can also specify that datapoints for ListA should be Red and that datapoints for ListB should be Blue:               ListLogPlot[{ListA, ListB}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}, ImageSize -> {800, 800}]      However, attempting to specify a PointSize for one or either array seems to break things:               ListLogPlot[{ListA, ListB}, PlotStyle -> {PointSize[0.02], Red, Blue}, ImageSize -> {800, 800}]      Here, the colors are correct, but only ListB datapoints are rescaled to the correct size. I've also tried using Show[], and specifying the plots individually therein, but this seems to generate a plot with an axis scaled only for one of the datasets. Why is this happening, and how might I work around it?
