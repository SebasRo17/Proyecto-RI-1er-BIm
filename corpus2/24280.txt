I am trying to evaluate this integral numerically: $$ \int_0^{\infty } m \exp (-m) J_1(m){}^2 \, dm $$ Everything is OK when only the integration method is specified:               NIntegrate[-m Exp[-m] BesselJ[1, m]^2, {m, 0, Infinity}, Method -> "ClenshawCurtisRule"]      but when I specify the `WorkingPrecision`, the integral remains unevaluated:               NIntegrate[-m Exp[-m] BesselJ[1, m]^2, {m, 0, Infinity}, Method -> "ClenshawCurtisRule",       WorkingPrecision -> 10]      What is wrong with this code? I am using _Mathematica_ v9.0.1 **UPDATE** This bug is still present in version 10.0.0.0.
