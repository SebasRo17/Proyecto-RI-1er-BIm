Technically I'm building an intranet web application, with web server running 24/7 and a central database, users can access it with any browser. However, for the user, the app should have the look and feel of a desktop application, and Chrome's application shortcut suits it best. But I don't want end user do the tasks of (1) install Chrome (2) access the web with url (3) create shortcut. Is it possible to make an installer package with Chrome inside, and automatically create the application shortcut (on the desktop and start menu)?
