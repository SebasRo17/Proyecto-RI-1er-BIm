i am a beginner to ruby . i just did some minor research about why RUBY ? why choose RUBY ? whats new in it. Whenever i do type in a word RUBY in google search there comes a suggestion like RUBY on RAILS . so my mind changed to learn stuffs about ruby on rails. I went through some forums but got the same answer from everyone. RUBY ON RAILS is a web development FRAMEWORK . once again i learnt stuffs about what a framework is. There are lot of questions which is u know like itching my mind.Varieties of answer from everyone. i dont know which is the right one. first if anyone wish to give me a reply .. tell me solution for this. just like java we run ruby programs in command prompt by moving to the directory in cmd where ruby is installed.it is similar to java. so can we create a desktop application by using it.i mean like a file searching program which is default in windows . We can create the same file searching program using java swing and playing with some string functions isn't it? can we do the same with ruby .? thats my first one. i will raise doubts on ruby on rails after i get cleared about the above question.
