It has a single root and each node has 0..N ordered sub-nodes . The keys represent a distinct set of paths. Two trees can only be merged if they share a common root. It needs to support, at minimum: insert, merge, enumerate paths. For this tree:               The      +--------+----------------+      |        |                |     cat      cow              dog      +        +--------+       +      |        |        |       |     drinks   jumps    moos    barks      +      |     milk      the paths would be:   * The cat drinks milk   * The cow jumps   * The cow moos   * The dog barks It's a bit like a trie.
