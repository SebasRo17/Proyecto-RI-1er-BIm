I work on a Windows/Mac cross platform application that is sometimes downloaded from web sites. It is sometimes re-branded by and sold by third parties. I'm the 'windows guy', my Mac counterpart is on vacation. I'm getting some questions from a customers about what the Mac user experience will be if we sign the Mac installer with an Apple Developer certificate in our build system with our company name. For some reason this customer doesn't want to sign the app themselves, but doesn't want our company name to pop up in front of the user. Assuming the user's OS 10.8 Gatekeeper is set to allow downloads from both the Apple App Store and from 'identified developers', does the user see any warning dialog that provides certificate information similar to he Windows User Access Control prompts? In my tests it looks like internet downloaded Apple signed apps are just trusted by OS10.8, and will run without anything resembling a Windows UAC prompt. The user experience seems to be: 1) Download application from internet signed by an 'Apple identified developer'. 2) Click the application on web browser download list or using finder. 3) Application installer runs with no warning or caution dialogs. Is this correct? Also, is there some way on OS10.8 for the user to view in human readable form the 'identified developer' certificate information of a signed file?
