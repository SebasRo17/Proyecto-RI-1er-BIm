I wanted to find the normalization of distribution F2 .               p = 2.2849;     p1 = 0.938/3;     p2 = 0.938/3;     p3 = 1.6;               F2 = Integrate[(s - s0)*(s + 2^2)^-2/(p^2 - s)^2, {s, s0, Infinity}]/. s0 -> (p1^2/(1 - x2 - x3) + p2^2/x2 + p3^2/x3)          nfactor = NIntegrate[F2, {x2, 0, 1}, {x3, 0, 1}];      why is Mathematica producing complex result? while the result have to be real
