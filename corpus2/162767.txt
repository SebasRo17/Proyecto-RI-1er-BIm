I came across a job posting for a senior web developer position. The posting said that the development will be done using **Ruby on Rails** , but no prior knowledge is required. I confirmed with a contact in that company that a PHP web developer can apply for it or even an ASP.Net developer. I also confirmed that the interview won't contain any questions specific to PHP or Ruby on Rails. Can anyone please provide a good list of questions for a senior web developer that isn't specific to a certain language? **Note** This question isn't a duplicate for similar posts asking for questions relating to PHP, .Net or Ruby. Also, I'm not looking for topics to learn as a web developer, but rather interesting questions for a technical interview given the former conditions.
