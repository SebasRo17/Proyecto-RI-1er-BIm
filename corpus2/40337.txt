I want to create in an automatic way some matrices to do symbolic calculations with them. They look like these: $$ \left( \begin{array}{cccc} a & 0 & b & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\ b & 0 & a & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) $$ So they have entry $a$ in at position $(1,1)$ and $(3,3)$ and entry $b$ at position $(1,3)$ and $(3,1)$ and the rest of the entries are 1 on the diagonal and zero elsewhere. So in general i want a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix with $b$ at position $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ and $a$ at position $(i,i)$ and $(j,j)$ How can i create these kind of matrices automatically? Probably it is possible to write some function T[n,i,j] that gives as value the corresponding matrix. (I have no insight into possible implementations of the solution, so additional Tags are welcome!)
