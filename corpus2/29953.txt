Juju3[expr_] :=     (Solve[expr[[1]] == 0, expr[[2]] == 0, expr[[3]] == 0, {r, x, y}];     a = %[[1]];     b = %%[[2]];     c = %%%[[3]];     Which[a[[2, 2]] == 0 || a[[3, 2]] == 0, Speak["MOO"],a[[2, 2]] != 0 && a[[3, 2]] != 0, Speak["PEACE AND LOVE"]]     j = D[expr, {{r, x, y}}];     j     FullSimplify[j /.Solve[expr[[1]] == 0, expr[[2]] == 0,expr[[3]] == 0, {r, x, y}]] ;     FullSimplify[Eigenvalues[%[[1]]]]     FullSimplify[Eigenvalues[%%[[2]]]]     FullSimplify[Eigenvalues[%%%[[3]]]])      Then I tried:               Juju3[{i - l*r - ux*r*x - uy*r*y, -mx*x + ex*ux*r*x, -my*y + ey*uy*r*y}]      ,and it did not work whereas when I just use my code without creating a function it works very well. I am reading about building functions with Mathematica right now but I still want to post this because I do not know what I am doing wrong. Everything? Maybe! Because I am a noob ^^ But I am reading tutorials so please do not get angry :) Specifically I have been told by a user that one should put semicolon for things that one do not want the output of, and also that one should put parentheses when having a function with multiple lines, so I did do that here. PS: I shortened the function because I use **b** and **c** also in the same way as **a** but no need for it here I guess.
