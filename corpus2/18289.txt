> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Creating a table/Matrix during a For loop Yet another simple question.               For[i = 1, i < 3, i++,      For[j = 1, j < 3, j++,        Print[{i, j}]      ]     ]      I want to assign the output to a list, for example like:               tts = {{1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}}      All my efforts did not gave me the desired result, but I am sure it is possible. Any suggestions are welcome.
