I want to run an Ito stochastic process. I have the following parameters               b1b = 0.9;     b3b = .8;     a1b = 0.1;     a3b = 0.2;     eps = 0.1;     G = (1/eps^2)*b1b ; a1 = (1/eps^2)*a1b; a3 = (1/eps^2)*a3b;     xc = Sqrt[a1/a3];     Uc = a1*xc^2/2 - a3*xc^4/4      I want to stop the process when `U[x[t]]=U[xc]` and `y[t]=0` (or at least very close for each of these parameters: say in the vicinity of `10^-4*U[xc]` for `U[x[t]]` and `10^-8` for `y[t]`). Please note `U[x]` is the integral of `U'[x]`. I am trying to write code that simulates `dz[t]` for many realisations (say 100) and calculates the average of times at which the aforementioned constraint is satisfied (i.e., average of 100 times). However, I have no idea how to incorporate the constraints and extract the time at which the constraints are satisfied. I tried to use the `ItoProcess[]` function, but had no fruitful outcome. Any help would be much appreciated.
