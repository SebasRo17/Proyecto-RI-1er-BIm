I am looking for a standardize way to visualize the following hierarchical logic: The state of the thread is represented by the answers to the hierarchical set of question You can read this listing like a flowchart, you iterate over the questions decide, go one step deeper and so on. Therefore I thought the best way to visualize it, using a flowchart. The problem is, in this hierarchical set it is possible to end in more than one state and its totally valid. I have never seen a flowchart where you can enter more than one state. Is it still possible and I am missing the right symbol to present this logic or are flowchart not fitting anyway? What other graphical representation could I use, is there something fitting in UML? A non-deterministic state machine seems not to be intuitive enough, transfering it into a deterministic state machine would result in to many states, and so on.
