One of the most intriguing items in the recently released Visual Studio 2010 Feature Pack 2 is the ability to create and edit UI tests in Silverlight. Here is an example of a coded UI test. I haven't had much time to use it yet, but for people who have, I am curious as to what your thoughts are. Is this something you have found to be particularly useful? I would like to be able to automate a significant amount of regression testing that we are currently performing manually. In your experience, has it made a major impact on the resources that you would normally have to dedicate to testing? Thanks
