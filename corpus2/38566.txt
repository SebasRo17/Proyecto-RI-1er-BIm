I eveluated some values using `Reduce` commend and I store them in a `Table`               t = Table[       N[Reduce[ 1/(1 + f) <= p[[i]] <= 1 + f , f], 100], {i, 1, n}]      Elements of a table looks like: `{f>= 99.000000000000000000000000000000000, f>=49.00000000000000000000000000000000...}` Now I want to plot this values for an integer domain. So I wanted to use ListPlot, but to use it I have to have a table which looks like: `{99.00000000000000000000000000000, 49.000000000000000000 ...}` How can I transform the first table to the second, which includes only values?
