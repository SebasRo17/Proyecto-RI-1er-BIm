I have a plot like this:               Table[Plot[a*x^2/4, {x, 0, 5}, PlotLabel -> "a="  a], {a, 1, 5, 1}]      I want to label the plots as `a=1`, `a=2`, ..., but _Mathematica_ labels them as `a=`, `2a=`, .... How can I solve this problem? I also have another problem:               DiscretePlot3D[2 x + y, {x, {1, 4, .2}}, {y, {2, 6, .2}},         Filling -> None, PlotMarkers -> {"Sphere", .01}]      Why I can not use plot markers such as `*`, `\[FilledSquare]`, ... in this plot?
