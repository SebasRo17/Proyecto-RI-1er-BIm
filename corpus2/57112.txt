I can't figure out why the following code only works with integers.               r1 = TransformedRegion[Cuboid[{-1, -1, -1}, {1, 1, 1}], TranslationTransform[{0, 1, 0}]]     RegionPlot3D[r1]     DiscretizeRegion[r1]     RegionQ[r1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nZsVV.png)![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5TiZz.png) now, If I replace every "1" with a "1.", I get an error message.               r1 = TransformedRegion[Cuboid[{-1., -1., -1.}, {1., 1., 1.}], TranslationTransform[{0, 1,0}]]     RegionPlot3D[r1]     DiscretizeRegion[r1]     RegionQ[r1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DRpA6.png) The problem seems to extend to most of mathematica's new region functions, as demonstrated below with RegionMeasure. A possible work around is to symbolically evaluate the expression first.               r1 = TransformedRegion[Cuboid[{-1., -1., -1.}, {1, 1, 1}],TranslationTransform[{0, 1, 0}]];     RegionMeasure[r1]          r1 = TransformedRegion[Cuboid[{-a, -a, -a}, {a, a, a}], TranslationTransform[{0, 1, 0}]];     RegionMeasure[r1] /. a -> 1.0      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KTPx4.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HxPv8.png) Has anybody else experimented with this issue?
