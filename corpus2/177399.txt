In the context of C#, .NET 4/4.5 used for an application running on a web- server, what is the relationship between "Task Parallel Library" and "Task- based Asynchronous Pattern"? I understand one is a library and the other is a pattern. But to dig deeper, is it like "The library is used by the pattern to enforce good practices". I'm also not clear if both are supported in .NET 4.0 (with `await` and `async` keywords) Edit: Seems that `await` and `async` are only in .NET 4.5 ...
