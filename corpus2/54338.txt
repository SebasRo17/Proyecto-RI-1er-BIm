I've read online on multiple occassions that MySQL is a bad database. The places I've read this include some threads on Reddit, but they never seem to delve in on _why_ it's a poor product. Is there any truth to this claim? I've never used it beyond a very simple CRUD scenario, and that was for a university project during my second year. What pitfalls, **if any** , are there when choosing MySQL as your database?
