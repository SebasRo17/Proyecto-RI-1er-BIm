I tried this question in superuser but no luck, maybe somebody here knows what is going on... Mathematica offers export to a format they call Computed Document Format (CDF) - it is basically a player for the notebooks you work in that environment. One way to use them is to embed it on a web page. While the pop-up window that generates the embed code offers a way to copy the code to the clip board (this is under Ubuntu), it doesn't appear to register and there is nothing to paste once I get to the text editor to incorporated it in my web page. Any suggestions of what might be amiss would be appreciated. Is there a secondary clipboard where the text goes? Copy/paste works fine otherwise in this software... I run Mathematica 9.0 on Ubuntu 12.04
