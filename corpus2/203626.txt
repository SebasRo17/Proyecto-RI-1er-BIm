**Question** Given two cloud services, Sender A & Receiver B, communicating over HTTPS, what options do I have to ensure that Receiver B only response to Sender A? For the purposes of **Background** The receiver is generating activation keys for some hardware from a serial number. Our support team is using Salesforce and we're making callouts from Salesforce to an Azure service to generate the key. Since neither are behind a firewall we want to make sure that only request from our Salesforce instance can generate an activation key. My thought was just to create a nice long key stored on both sides that could be used to validate the request, but I'm not a security expert and don't know if there is anything else I should be considering.
