I have a messy expression of variables that I would like to simplify under the assumption that certain ratios of the variables are small. For example, consider $\sqrt{x+y}\;$ expanded for small $\frac{y}{x}$. That is, $x >> y$. This is simple enough to do by hand (pull out a $\sqrt{x}$ and then define a new variable to be $\frac{y}{x}$, then expand this variable about $0$). But, I cannot figure out how to do it in _Mathematica_. **EDIT 1** I've since realized that what I actually want to do is more complicated than the example above. Consider the following expression $\sqrt{a+d} + \sqrt{b+d}\;$ expanded for small $\frac{d}{a}$ and small $\frac{d}{b}$ (that is $a>>d$ and $b>>d$). Following Artes' answer below, the solution is               Series[ (a + d)^(1/2) + (b + d)^(1/2) /. {d -> z1 a, d -> z2}, {z1, 0, 2},{z2, 0, 2}] /.      {z1 -> d/a, z2 -> d/b}      But this solution doesn't work as intended due to the order operations _Mathematica_ performs upon this command. What needs to be done is to replace `d` with `z1 a`, then expand `z1` about `0`, replace `z1` with `d/a`, then replace `d` with `z2 b`, expand `z2` about `0`, and finally replace `z2` with `d/b`. How can one do this in _Mathematica_?   (Obviously the example I gave can be separated into two expressions when can be expanded separately, but this cannot be done for the more complicated expression I am actually trying to expand).
