I need to extract very particular data from log files(of different types and formats). Since I am a recent college passout; my mind ran to using Lex and Yacc for the purpose. Now I have the **following Questions** **1.** Will it be legal to do so ? (This product I am working for belongs to one of the biggest tech companies in the world.) **2.** Also ; I would like to know if I am being too afraid to write my own parser? **3.** How can I use Lex and Yacc if my product is Windows based? Please tell me if you need any clarification or extra information.
