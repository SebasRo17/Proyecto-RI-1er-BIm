I was thinking about this earlier today and figured I would get some input on the matter. When I develop applications I would usually have the Data Access Layer on another project, incase it could be re-used elsewhere in a similar manner in the future but also to allow updating the DAL without updating the UI layer. When doing so I handle all of the data querying etc in the DAL. The application does not need to know if its ADO.NET, EF or a List. However, it occurred to me that in almost all cases the return types are specified in the DAL. So the UI Layer does need to know about types defined there. Is that normal or is there a way for more seperation? (other than using Anon types)
