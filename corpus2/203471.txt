Is there a reason why functions in most(?) programming languages are designed to support any number of input parameters but only one return value? In most languages, it is possible to "work around" that limitation, e.g. by using out-parameters, returning pointers or by defining/returning structs/classes. But it seems strange that programming languages were not designed to support multiple return values in a more "natural" way. Is there an explanation for this?
