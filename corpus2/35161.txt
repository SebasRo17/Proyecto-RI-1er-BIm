I have a lookup table with about 30 rows. Column 1 has the value I want to search for and column 2 has the value I want returned. It seemed like I should be able to use rules to do this, but clearly I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, the values are all strings I tried:               rule2 :> (#[[1]] -> #[[2]]) & /@ elrALobMap;      This didn't work. First, should I be doing this a different way? (I see that I can do it with Position and Pick, but that seemed awkward. Second, I'd appreciate any help in understanding how (if it's possible) what I did code should be coded.
