I'm trying to create a process for better understand what's happening in my code. I want to create metrics to automatically give my answers about simple or complex questions like:   1. How many times a url was clicked? (how many requests arrived to a certain servlet method)   2. How many times a certain user requested the same page?   3. How many requests are pending in a queue on average? and so on... Is there an easy way to do this automatically and elegantly (for example - attribute like @CountHits would be great)? I found this open source: http://metrics.codahale.com/getting- started/#reporting-via-jmx But it's too coupled to the code. Not so elegant :/
