I am trying to use _Mathematica_ to illustrate mixed strategies in Game Theory. I want my students to be able to use common joysticks as controllers. What I find, however, is that in addition to doing what I want, moving one of the controls on my gamepad rotates the 3D graphics in such a way as to ruin the presentation. Basically, all I want the controls to do is change the strategy each player uses. The Graphics3D object should not rotate. Here's a very simplified of the code that illustrates the undesired behavior.               Manipulate[     Column[{x, y,      Show[Graphics3D[{Line[{{x, y, 0}, {x + 1, y + 1, 1}}]},       Axes -> True, ImageSize -> 400],           Graphics3D[{Tube[{{x, y, 0}, {x - 1, x - y, 1}}]}]]}],      "X1" -> {{x, 0.71}, 0, 1}, "Z1" -> {{y, 0.5}, 0, 1},      ControllerPath -> "Joystick"]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5oETP.png) I also thought it might be useful to show you the following, which is the results from               ControllerState["PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller", "Mapping"]          (* {"X2" -> "Z Axis", "Y2" -> -"Z Rotation", "JB" -> "Button 11",       "JB1" -> "Button 11", "JB2" -> "Button 12", "JB3" -> None,       "TLB" -> "Button 5", "TRB" -> "Button 6", "BLB" -> "Button 7",       "BRB" -> "Button 8", "X" -> "X Axis", "Y" -> -"Y Axis",       "Z" -> "Z Axis", "X1" -> "X Axis", "Y1" -> -"Y Axis",       "Z1" -> "Z Axis", "X2" -> "Z Rotation", "Y2" -> -"Slider",       "Z2" -> None, "X3" -> "Hatswitch X Axis",       "Y3" -> -"Hatswitch Y Axis", "Z3" -> None,       "X4" -> Switch[{"Button 1", "Button 3"},        {False, False}, 0,        {True, False}, -1,        {False, True}, 1,        {True, True}, 0.00001], "Y4" -> Switch[{"Button 2", "Button 4"},        {False, False}, 0,        {True, False}, -1,        {False, True}, 1,        {True, True}, 0.00001], "X5" -> Switch[{"Button 7", "Button 5"},        {False, False}, 0,        {True, False}, -1,        {False, True}, 1,        {True, True}, 0.00001], "Y5" -> Switch[{"Button 8", "Button 6"},        {False, False}, 0,        {True, False}, -1,        {False, True}, 1,        {True, True}, 0.00001], "X6" -> Switch[{"Button 9", "Button 10"},        {False, False}, 0,        {True, False}, -1,        {False, True}, 1,        {True, True}, 0.00001], "B1" -> "Button 1", "B2" -> "Button 2",       "B3" -> "Button 3", "B4" -> "Button 4", "B5" -> "Button 5",       "B6" -> "Button 6", "B7" -> "Button 7", "B8" -> "Button 8",       "B9" -> "Button 9", "B10" -> "Button 10", "B11" -> "Button 11",       "B12" -> "Button 12", "DefaultAbsolute" -> False} *)      Also, for what it's worth, the Sony Playstation gamepad I am using has two main analog controls that appear to move in at least a left right and up down configuration. Moving the left control left and right appears to correspond to "X1" and moving the right control left and right appears to correspond to "Z1". I'm hoping my problem is not Sony PS3 controller specific but is due to some lack of understanding on my part about how to map the physical controls to _Mathematica_ behavior.
