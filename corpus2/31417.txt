I'm new to _Mathematica_ , and was looking for more efficient ways to implement the `Do` loop below. `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` are all constants, but I'm also using a list in the loop. Is this possible to implement with `NestList`? I haven't been able to find any examples with a list being used inside of `NestList`.               Do[     X = Tanh[a.input[[i]] + b.X + c];     Y = d.X;     YOut = Append[YOut, Y];      ,{i, Length[input]}];      Thanks! * Sorry for the confusion, I tried to simplify my code for the sake of brevity.               Do[     X = Tanh[Win.input[[i]] + Wres.X + Wbias]];     Y = WOUT.X;     YOut = Append[YOut, Y];     , {i, Length[input]}     ];      `Win`, `Wres`, `Wbias`, and `WOUT` are all appropriately sized matrices. This do loop is part of a testing routine for Reservoir Computing, a type of machine learning. With help from your answer, I'm rewriting the above as:               f = WOUT.(Tanh[Wbias + Win.#2 + WRes.#1]) &;     YOut = FoldList[f, X, input];      Will try it out now. Thanks for the help!
