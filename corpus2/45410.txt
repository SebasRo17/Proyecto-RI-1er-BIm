I'd like to create transparent graphs like the following from P1095, _Calculus_ 6th Ed, by James Stewart. Can _Mathematica_ accomplish this? By "transparent," I mean the ability to see the interior, intersection, boundaries etc. preferrably with dashed hidden lines. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GL2Pl.jpg) Would someone please explain how to do this for a function like \begin{cases} (4 - z^2) = x^2 + y^2, 2 \le z \le 4 \\\ x^2 + y^2 = 4, -2 \le z \le 2 \end{cases} http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/howto/AddTransparencyToPlots.html doesn't appear to be very helpful in that respect.
