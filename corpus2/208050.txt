The symbols for access modifiers that I know are relevant for many different languages: > **public** :        +   >  **private** :       -   >  **protected** :  #   >  **package** :    ~ ( _or none_ )   >    _However_ , in VB.NET there are other such access modifiers -- `friend`, and `protected friend` ( _these are called`internal` and `protected internal` in c#_). What are the UML symbols for these access modifiers?      Is `friend` close enough to "package access" that it could be denoted with a tilde "`~`"? Would that then mean that `protected friend` could be denoted as "`#~`"?
