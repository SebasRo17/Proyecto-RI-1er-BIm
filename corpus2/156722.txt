I have been programming in higher level languages (Python, C#, VBA, VB.NET) for around 10 years and I have completely zero understanding on what's going on, "under the hood." I am wondering what are the benefits of learning assembly, and how will it aid me as a programmer? Can you please provide me with a resource that will show me exactly the connection between what I write in higher level code to what happens in assembly?
