I'm about to start my AQA EPQ - which is a 5000 word essay and presentation on a topic of your choice; I was looking for topics in which to research and report on. I believe this question is often asked by many university and sixth form students because often, chosen questions can lead to to many 'dead-ends'. I want to be able to go into depth with the topic and write-up a detailed report with a strong over-all conclusion. What topics within computer science are considered good topics to research and report on.
