I have no clue where to put the following class and I've noticed I just keep putting them in a helpers folder which isn't much helpfull towards reusability in future projects. **Example:** I want to have the ability to use the `DisplayNameAttribute` together with resource files. In order for this to work I made a `LocalizedDisplayNameAttribute` which inherits the ´DisplayNameAttribute´ and adds the following properties `DisplayNameResourceName` and `DisplayNameResourceType`. In which namespace/location would you place such a class which is likely to be reused in future projects?
