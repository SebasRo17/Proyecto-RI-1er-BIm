I have two instances of Laravel: `Rest Server` API and `Rest Client`. Let's say I want to display list of positions on the front page. I'm making request to my Server API from my client controller:               public function add_employee() {         $data['employee_positions'] = Client_API::generic_request('/employees/position_list');         $this->layout->content = View::make('employees.add_employee')->with($data);     }      If my API request returns 400-500 errors, I want my application be redirected to login page. Where should I validate my API responses? I can't do redirects in my Client's `Client_API` wrapper class. So far, the only way I can accomplish it is by validating responses before returning them inside `Client_API` class and in case of `400-500` error - I'm throwing Exception, and then handling my business logic (redirects) inside catching exceptions function. I've been told that Exceptions shouldn't be used as a part of business processes inside my application.
