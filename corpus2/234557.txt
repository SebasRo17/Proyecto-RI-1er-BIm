I am a programmer with some experience in C++ and I am learning Java. In most of the Java books (like Head First Java) authors ask readers to stay away from IDEs and recommend using a good text editor, but I could not find a convincing reason apart from the fact that a beginner might be overwhelmed by many options being thrown at once. However I started using Eclipse after writing a couple of small programs and I think that tools like auto-completion, inbuilt help debugging etc makes learning a better experience. I would like to know which approach is better and if I am missing out anything by using an IDE rather than a text editor.
