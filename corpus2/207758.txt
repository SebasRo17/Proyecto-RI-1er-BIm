At work, we develop a lot of our applications in SAS, from start to finish. One of the problems with this approach is that SAS is a very verbose language with very few language constructs; there is limited support for variables, very limited support for basic functions, and no such thing as classes. They have a concept called "macros" which essentially text substitution; you define a macro, and on invocation, it simply drops in the content of the macro. My question is, is anyone familiar with "best coding practices" for use in developing SAS applications? Are there software design patterns for SAS? I've gone through Code Complete, and some of what he writes is applicable to SAS, but much of it is not, as the concepts don't exist in SAS. Can anyone give recommendations for writing maintainable, well-designed SAS code?
