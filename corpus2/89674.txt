I'm considering using a project from http://www.codeproject.com that uses the CPOL license. Section 5e says: "You may distribute the Executable Files and Source Code only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy of the Executable Files or Source Code You distribute and ensure that anyone receiving such Executable Files and Source Code agrees that the terms of this License apply to such Executable Files and/or Source Code. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute the Executable Files or Source Code with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License." Is not clear to me if I should include their source code with my executable or not. Or even worse, if I should make my own source code available such as with GPL license. The reason why is not clear to me is because I'm not sure if by compiling their source code together with mine I'm "distributing" either their "Source Code" or "Executable Files"?
