In many User Interface libraries, we have concept of views and subviews. so according to MVC pattern every view should update the model as soon as it changes. For that view should have a reference of its model. If we have a subview and it does some calculation, then should that model also be passed to the subview or part of that model pertaining to that subview should be passed to that subview. and Say when we take certain actions, should there be a separate controller for the subview or the actions on the subview should be handled by its parent view's controller ?
