I am looking for a software license which has stronger protection than AGPLv3. The GPL license said that when we distribute the software, we must provide a way for user to download the source code. However there is a loophole in this license, the GPL FAQ said (see below) it is not considered "distribution" if the company uses it as an internal project. Is there any license which require to distribute the source code, even it is only used in a company's internal project? PS, GPL FAQ "Internal Distribution" section: > **Is making and using multiple copies within one organization or company > “distribution”?**   >  No, in that case the organization is just making the copies for itself. As > a consequence, a company or other organization can develop a modified > version and install that version through its own facilities, without giving > the staff permission to release that modified version to outsiders. > > However, when the organization transfers copies to other organizations or > individuals, that is distribution. In particular, providing copies to > contractors for use off-site is distribution.
