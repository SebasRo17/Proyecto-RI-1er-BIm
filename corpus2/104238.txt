I moved to this company recently, and my first reaction of the development process leaves me with doubts. Here is where I really doubt the efficiency: _Every single_ function _must_ have Javadoc style comment, and the code is tested by White-box Test automatically. Even when I write simple & short function, the function must have a Javadoc style comment. For example:               void request_ait(void)     {           hoa_request_ait();     }      If I write code without a Javadoc style comment, even for this simple function, the QA tool register it as a defect. So I write a simple comment template. For example:               /**       * @author peter       * @version 1.0       * @since   2011-08-28       */         void request_ait(void)         {               hoa_request_ait();         }      I know that comments on API functions or important functions are really useful. But forcing every function to have a Javadoc style comment is inefficient... I want to listen your opinion. Am I wrong?
