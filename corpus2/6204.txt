Assume the following very complex palette:               CreatePalette[       PasteButton[FontColor -> RGBColor[1, 0, 0]]     ];      Its purpose is to insert a `FontColor` rule. It works like expected in a notebook but I plan to use it inside raw cell expressions. Please try the following two examples. Paste the following code into a notebook               NotebookWrite[      SelectedNotebook[],      Cell[Cell["abc", "Text"]]      ]      You get a text cell saying "abc". Now go with the cursor anywhere between the "abc" and press `Ctrl+Shift+E` (this is _Cell->Show Expression_ ) to see the underlying cell data. Go directly in front of the last closing bracket, make a comma and press the palette-button. You should get               Cell[BoxData[      FormBox["abc", Text]],FontColor->RGBColor[1,0,0]]      Pressing `Ctrl+Shift+E` again and the text is red. Works like a charm. Now try the following cell with the same approach:               NotebookWrite[      SelectedNotebook[],      Cell[StyleData["StandardForm"]]      ]      Here I get (Linux 64, Mma 8.0.4)               Cell[StyleData["StandardForm"],       RowBox[{"FontColor", "->", RowBox[{"RGBColor", "[",        RowBox[{"1", ",", "0", ",", "0"}], "]"}]}]     ]      which is not what I expected and which does not work. **Question:** Can anyone explain me what's going on here? Is the `PasteButton` aware of the context? **Background:** The background is, that I have created a palette which I want to use to adjust style-sheet definitions. That was, when I stumbled over this behaviour. **Fix:** One possible way to fix this is to use `NotebookWrite` directly instead of the `PasteButton`. Disadvantage of this approach is, that the expression can no longer be inserted into a normal notebook, because there you have to insert cell-expression.
