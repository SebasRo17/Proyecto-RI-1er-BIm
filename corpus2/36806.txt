Mathics, a free Mathematica-compatible project has been recently launched. It provides a subset of the functions and capabilities of Mathematica at a slower pace. This opens us the tantalizing possibility to share our code even with people who do not have Mathematica on their computers. Since Mathics is currently supporting only a fraction of all Mathematica functions, it becomes important for our code to be able to discriminate whether it is run within Mathematica or Mathics. Is this possible?
