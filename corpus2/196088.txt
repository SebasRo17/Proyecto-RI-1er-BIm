We have a site that launched and is "feature-complete", we've done all that the client has asked for and fixed a few bugs post-launch. However, I noticed that our site's home page is using 100 SQL queries, and there's _no_ caching. I took half a day to add caching and did it in a branch. Now I'm wondering how I can convince the project manager and other team members and gain support for a post-launch deployment of this optimization. What reasons can I give that it won't harm the project to do this? Or do I just wait until the next project launches to make these sorts of improvements? More details:   * I can't very well tell future employers that I implemented caching and saw an increase in performance without actually deploying it and capturing the improvement (through google analytics or Page Speed or some other method), or can I?   * This is an agency environment, none of our projects use any caching or any other performance optimization   * The site has 50k visitors   * The site is only live with full functionality for 1 month, around the end of May it will be replaced with a static page (marketing campaign site)   * local testing reducing page load from ~3 seconds to ~700ms
