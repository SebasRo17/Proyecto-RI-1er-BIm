I am trying to write a program that will take a screenshot of each workspace and then display them together to create an expo type effect. I am currently using gtk and I can only take a screenshot of the active workspace (using gdk_get_default_root_window and gdk_pixbuf_get_from_drawable). The only method I have currently found of taking a screenshot of an inactive workspace is to switch to it, take the screenshot and then switch back, but this will make the screen flash. So my question is, is there way of capturing the workspaces without flashing the screen?
