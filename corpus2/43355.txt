I am learning _Mathematica_ and `FeynCalc` by doing some basic cross section calculations. I have an issue with trace calculations: When I plug in for instance the interference term for `ee->tautau`, the result comes out with the `g00` component of the metric tensor explicitly written, i.e. not set to `1` as it should be. This means I have to manually remove it before the next step in the calculation. I have tried doing something like `MetricTensor[0,0]:=1`, but it did not help. I am probably missing some syntax, but can you point me to the correct way of doing it? Here is my code:               DiracSimplify[       Contract[e^2*gz^2/4/(s*(s - Mz^2 + Mz*Gammaz))/4*         Tr[GA[mu].(GS[q2] - M).GA[0].(cV - cA GA[5]).GA[0].GA[            nu].(GS[q1] + M)]*         Tr[GA[mu].(GS[p1] + m).GA[0].(cV - cA GA[5]).GA[0].GA[            nu].(GS[p2] - m)]]];
