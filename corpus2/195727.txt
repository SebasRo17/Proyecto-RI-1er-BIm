I have created an `ObjectParser` class which parses data into strongly typed objects using an `IObjectParserDataSource` as the data source (the data could be an Excel file, text file, array, query string, etc). Examples of my implementations of `IObjectParserDataSource` are:   * `TextFileObjectParserDataSource`   * `ExcelFileObjectParserDataSource` These class names feel really long and convoluted to me. I could name them:   * `TextFileDataSource`   * `ExcelFileDataSource` But this introduces a level of ambiguity and they don't became as clearly related to `IObjectParserDataSource` at first glance. This becomes important because defining these data sources will happen in client code and I wish to minimize potential confusion and uncertainty. **How would you name these classes in such a scenario?**
