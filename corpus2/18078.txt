I wish to create an efficient circular buffer. That is, I wish to keep a fixed length list while appending a new value and dropping the oldest, repeatedly. As we know lists in _Mathematica_ are implemented as arrays and `Append` etc. are slow on long lists. For example:               big = Range@1*^7;          Do[big = Append[Rest@big, RandomInteger@99], {100}] // AbsoluteTiming      > {2.2100031, Null} `Internal`Bag` and related functions are appropriate for a continually accumulating list but do not appear to be applicable to this situation. Is there an efficient means to have a large circular buffer in _Mathematica_?
