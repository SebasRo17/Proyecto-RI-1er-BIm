This type of conditional statement is generally frowned upon               if(condition)       statement;      because if you add another statement, like this               if(condition)       statement;       statement;      it gives the impression that the second `statement` is part of the `if` block when it isn't. That said, my IDE does automatic indentation, which I think makes this problem moot. Furthermore, when I want to add another statement, it automatically does the bracket completion--which makes the issue about having to manually add brackets when you want to add another statement moot. Is there any reason why this would still be bad style?
