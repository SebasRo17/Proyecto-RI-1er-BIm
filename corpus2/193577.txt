I recently started working for a company that has me making mockups for an app they'd like to see converted to an iPhone app. I have not been informed as to how all the boards fit together, but I do have a general idea on what they should look like. I would like to write notes or comments on each individual board about how things should be done once I have more information. Is it possible to comment on a board or is there some place close to the boards where I can leave notes on what to do next?
