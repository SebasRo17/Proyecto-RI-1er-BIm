I have some data, which if expressed by some elementary functions, would contain a non-differentiable point. I would like to be able to use something like interpolate to convert the data into a function and then differentiate it but somehow still preserve the non-differentiability property at that point. MWE               list = Table[{j, Max[5, j]}, {j, 0, 15, 1}]          {{0, 5}, {1, 5}, {2, 5}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}, {5, 5}, {6, 6}, {7, 7}, {8,        8}, {9, 9}, {10, 10}, {11, 11}, {12, 12}, {13, 13}, {14, 14}, {15,        15}}      My data comes from a continuous function which is not differentiable at $x=5$.               fint = Interpolation[list]          dfint[x_] = D[fint[x], x]          Plot[dfint[x], {x, 0, 15}, AxesOrigin -> {0, -1}]      The Derivative looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/69CjV.jpg) Instead of like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kM0KW.jpg) **Update 12:38 AM May 22:**               lista = DeleteCases[list, a_ /; a[[1]] >= 6]     listb = DeleteCases[list, a_ /; a[[1]] <= 4]          {{0, 5}, {1, 5}, {2, 5}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}, {5, 5}}          {{5, 5}, {6, 6}, {7, 7}, {8, 8}, {9, 9}, {10, 10}, {11, 11}, {12,        12}, {13, 13}, {14, 14}, {15, 15}}          ga = Interpolation[lista]     gb = Interpolation[listb]          dga[x_] = D[ga[x], x]     dgb[x_] = D[gb[x], x]          g[x_] = Piecewise[{{ga[x], x <= 5}, {gb[x], x > 5}}]          dg[x_] = Piecewise[{{dga[x], x < 5}, {dgb[x], x > 5}}]      Doing this               Plot[dg[x], {x, 0, 15}, AxesOrigin -> {0, -1}]      gives ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DqFpa.jpg) However               dg[5]          0      I guess I need to get this to be indeterminate.
