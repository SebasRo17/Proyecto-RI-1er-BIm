I am working on a project that requires that I understand different techniques used by search engines for the web. I have a strong scientific and development background, so I am not afraid of highly technical information. I am looking for all forms of technical information including information on web crawlers, other techniques for acquiring data, methods of data storage and how to query it, etc., etc. I am completely new to the subject and I'm looking for useful resource and books on the subject. Any suggestions are appreciated.
