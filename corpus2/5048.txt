I would like to make _Mathematica_ documents with hidden calculations, such that they can be visualized on demand. In general it can be done in several forms and I actually use some. I would like to ask about one specific way of doing that. Namely, I would like to make a button incorporated into either inline or input cell. Upon pressing on this button a separate notebook should open containing the calculations. It is easy to make this, if the document only contains output cells. For instance, this               button1[expr_, sz_] := Button["Evaluate expression",        CreateDocument[expr, WindowSize -> {sz, sz}]];          button1[Expand[(x + y)^2], 300]      makes a button which opens the window with the result `x^2+2xy+y^2`. It is easy to make a notebook with a cell that can be later evaluated:               button2[expr_, sz_] := Button["Evaluate expression",        CreateDocument[         ExpressionCell[expr, "Input"],         WindowSize -> {sz, sz}]];     button2[Expand[(x + y)^2], 300]      but it also returns the already evaluated result. For whatever reason this:               SetAttributes[button2, HoldFirst];      does not help. One can also show the both unevaluated input and the output like this:               button3[expr_, sz_: 300] :=       Button["Show expression",        nb = CreateDocument[            {ExpressionCell[Unevaluated[expr], "Input"],            ExpressionCell[Button["Evaluate", Print@Evaluate[expr]],             "Input" ]},          WindowSize -> {sz, sz}          ]];     button3[Expand[(x + y)^2]]      However, I would like to get rid of the operator `Unevaluated` in the first cell. My aim is to get a separate notebook that is generated from the initial document. This notebook should have an input and the corresponding output cell (or cells), which a) shows how some result has been achieved in the past and what was this result and b) in which I could try to change something in the input cell(s) and see what would happen, while the source code lays somewhere unchanged. Thank you, Alexei
