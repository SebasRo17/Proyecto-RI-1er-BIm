I want to build up a social network, targeted to a specific interest. I want to generate revenues in form of ads. I first thought of building it from scratch, which will take a lot of time (even if it's something simple), then i remembered there are open source options like Diaspora or Friendica. I don't know if there are others... My question is, with these previously mentioned projects or any other, ¿is it possible to legally generate revenues? Diaspora license is: AGPLv3,[3][4] some parts dual-licensed under MIT License[5] as well Friendica: AGPL ¡Thank you!
