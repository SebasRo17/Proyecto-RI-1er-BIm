I'm currently working on throwing together some basic prototypes, partly to gather requirements and partly to design the final UI. At the moment I'm trying building up the screen using Post-it notes, with yellow notes for information and pink for actions (buttons or menus). The idea being that you can easily move, remove and add information. But I'm sure there are more efficient methods out there. What is the recommended way for developers to efficiently create non- interactive UI prototypes? And why? * * * I tried some pen, paper and Post-it note versions and they went down like a lead balloon (likely my drawing skills). In the end I used Balsamiq, which thus far is liked by most users and they get it is prototype. Alas, some people are still having problems with the idea that first one should get an idea of what the application should do via some lo-fi prototypes and really want to "see something on the screen" before committing to anything.
