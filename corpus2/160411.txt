I've worked in several contracts where the client used Cucumber and I've often felt that the testing suite didn't really have a place in our stack. From what I understand, business analysts/non-technical coworkers write up the tests and the developers make the step definitions work. My problem with this approach is the tests are never valid or terse enough to be used without rewriting the whole file.
