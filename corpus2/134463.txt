There are a few new HTML5 features that have made it into recent browsers that allow sharing state among tabs, browser windows, same domain windows, etc. So it's probably gotten a little easier to write a web application that keeps a lot of state on the client and also manages state intelligently between tabs and/or windows. There are currently libraries like Backbone.js that can help manage state in a single tab or a single window. Is there anything out there yet that helps with multiple tabs (or windows) managing global state, tab specific state, and cross-tab eventing without relying on the server to sync them all up?
