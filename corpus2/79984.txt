SO I have made this program dealing with cities and the roads linking them, and I am wondering if anyone could point me towards a way to represent this "network" graphically (in 3 or 2Ds). Could be either a specific programming friendly file format (which I could easily generate an instance of programatically), or a specific language's api or library for such representation. My current work is in Java, but if there's a solution in an other language it's not a problem.
