I'm trying to find a way to have Mathematica always represent a numerical value as a self defined variable that I define using `lhs=rhs`. For example, if I execute               In[1]:=Solve[x^3 - 1 == 0, x]     Out[1]:={{x -> 1}, {x -> -(-1)^(1/3)}, {x -> (-1)^(2/3)}}      What I'd like is to define a variable `rho=(-1)^(1/3)` so that when I execute the above I get out something like               In[1]:=Solve[x^3 - 1 == 0, x]     Out[1]:={{x -> 1}, {x -> -rho}, {x -> rho^2}}      Is this possible? I'm basically trying to get mathematica to always represent an $n$th root of unity as a given symbol to clean up inputs and outputs.
