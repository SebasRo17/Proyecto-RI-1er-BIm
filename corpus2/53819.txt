As a freelancer working on both paid and personal projects, I'm always splitting my time between a huge number of small and large projects/tasks/fine details. I've developed a small custom-coded solution to organizing my time and tasks. What is the best solution to organizing and managing your projects, tasks and to-do list as a freelancer? This could include both paid and unpaid services, programs, or other web-based solutions. I know it can be subjective to say 'the best', so I'll rephrase the question to 'what do you find to be the most effective solution for yourself, and why?'
