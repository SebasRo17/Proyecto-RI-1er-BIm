The start of my question is about one specific situation - I have some erroneous lat/long values in a dataset which I need to clean up. But I'd like it to cover the overall topic of cleaning up messy data for analysis work. The task at hand. I'm importing the NGA anti-shipping activity message database to do some analysis work with it. The problem comes when I try to extract lat/long value - there are a few invalid values in my dataset. Sometimes Mathematica can make it difficult to tell what sort of data something is. Is it a Null, or "Null" (string)? What are some ways to identify bad data, and correct it (or delete it)?               (* First import all the piracy events between 1990 and aug 1st, 2014 *)     (* This will take a minute or so *)     asamjson =       Import["http://msi.nga.mil/MSI_JWS/ASAM_JSON/getJSON?typename=\     DateRange_AllRefNumbers&fromDate=19900101&toDate=20140801", "JSON"];     Needs["GeneralUtilities`"]     asamdataset = Dataset[ToAssociations@asamjson];          (* Then we define some helper functions *)     getLong[ds_] := fixstr[ds["Longitude"]];     getLat[ds_] := fixstr[ds["Latitude"] ];     getPos[ds_] := {getLat[ds], getLong[ds]};     fixLong[ds_] := StringReplace[ds["Longitude"], "&deg;" -> "\[Degree]"];     fixstr[str_] := StringReplace[str, "&deg;" -> "\[Degree]"];          (* However, if we try to use our dataset we have some erroneous lat/long*)      (* values.   How can we correct these values (Zero the particular values,      (* make something up, ?), without resorting to deleting the entire record. *)     piracyLocations =       Map[GeoPosition[ {fixstr[#["Latitude"]],        fixstr[#["Longitude"]] }]   &, asamdataset]      EDIT: PatoCriollo's solution below is elegant. But sooner or later we'll come across data that doesn't have a nicely cleaned duplicate of itself waiting to be used. In fact even the ASAM dataset has bogus values in the lat/lng data.               dat = Map[ ToExpression@{#["lat"], #["lng"] }   &,      Take[asamdataset, 1000]];     Show[SmoothDensityHistogram[dat, .3, ColorFunction -> "SunsetColors",        PlotPoints -> 150, Mesh -> 20, MeshStyle -> Opacity[.1],        PlotRange -> All],        Graphics[{FaceForm[], EdgeForm[Directive[White, Opacity[.7]]],        CountryData["World", "Polygon"]}], AspectRatio -> Automatic]      ![ASAM data heatmap](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1nya6.png)
