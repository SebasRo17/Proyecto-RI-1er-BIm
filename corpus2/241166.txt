By recently I mean some weeks ago. I am trying to continue a project I left 2 weeks ago and I need time to understand some functions I wrote (not copied from somewhere) and it takes me time. Normally I don't need to because my functions, methods etc. are black boxes but when I need to change something it's really hard. Does this mean I write bad code? I am still in school and I am the only who writes/uses the code so I don't have feedback, but I am afraid that if it is difficult for me to understand it, it would be 10 times more difficult for someone else. What should I do? I write a lot of comments but most of the time are useless when reviewing. Do you have any suggestions?
