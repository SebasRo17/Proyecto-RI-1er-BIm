Ok so i have some HR-TEM images. In this technique fringes appear whereever a crystalline structure is present. This fringes are separated by a certain distance depending on the material, this is our wavelength. I would like to enter a wavelength range defined by two values, say .50 to .55 nm or in pixels. The output should be that all but these freqeuncies as defined by the WL should be filtered out of the image, a band-pass. So here's an example using some commercial software: ![Example of what i want](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gi0kV.jpg) I guess the approach is to Fourrier transform, filter out, and fourrier back. My attempt wasn't even close to getting a result... Thanks!
