How do we solve third order nonlinear differential equation f’’’+ff’-f’2-Re2 f’=0 f(0)=0,f'(0)=1,f(Infinity)=0 From the OP's comment: > >     ic1 = 0; ic2 = 0; ic3 = 1 a = 0.0; >     sol = NDSolve[{y'''[x] + y[x] y'[x] - y'[x]^2 - a^2 y'[x] == 0, >       y[0] == ic1, y'[Infinity] == ic3, y'[0] == ic2}, y[x], PlotRange]; >     Plot[y[x] /. sol, {x, 0, finish}]. >   > > I have used this code to solve using mathematica but i didnt get it
