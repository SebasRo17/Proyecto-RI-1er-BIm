Is there a convenient way to format tick labels? In this example I would like to use the default Mathematica tick intervals, but simply convert the X axis labels to strings with "s" added. As you can see below, by default Mathematica shows six X axis labels, with three subticks, although for different plot ranges both can vary:               plotA = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 6, 16}, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0osxu.png) A basic function can be defined to add the "s" formatting, but it doesn't vary as the Mathematica range would. Adding subticks would be further work, and the upper X frame would have to be defined too, to match the intervals.               frametickfunction[xmin_, xmax_] :=      {#, ToString[#] <> "s"} & /@ FindDivisions[{xmin, xmax}, 6]          plotB = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 6, 16}, Frame -> True,      FrameTicks -> {{True, True}, {frametickfunction, True}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0oXs5.png) It would be convenient if I could obtain the X axis specification produced in plotA, modify it, and use it in plotB. Is this possible, or are there other methods?
