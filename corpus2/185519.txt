So, we have just migrated from SVN to Perforce. I'm having a little trouble trying to figure out the best workflow. For Subversion, I did the following (via TortoiseSVN):   1. Check out repo   2. Do work   3. Update repo   4. Resolve conflicts, if any.   5. Commit my code.   6. Do work.. What is the best approach for P4? I know that you must open files for edit before actually editing them. With this in mind I am currently doing the following (via P4V):   1. Sync to head   2. Open entire project for editing   3. Do work   4. Revert unchanged files   5. Submit i.e. commit pending changes.   6. Open entire project for edit, again.   7. Do work.. Is this a practical approach? or is there one that is more in tune with Perforce best practices?
