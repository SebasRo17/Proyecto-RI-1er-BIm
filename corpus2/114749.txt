As a software developer, I find a frequent need to create icons for my applications. Nothing has ever worked as well as IcoFX for this purpose. Unfortunately, the program is no longer free - but I still have the installer for an older version. My question is whether or not I can distribute copies of the installer. The license agreement contains the following pertinent clauses:               6. All redistributions of the Software's files must retain all         copyright notices and web site addresses that are         currently in place, and must include this list of         conditions without modification.          7. None of the Software's files may be redistributed for         profit or as part of another Software package without         express written permission of the Author.          10. The Author reserves his rights to modify this agreement          in the future.      The first two clauses would seem to suggest that I can legally distribute verbatim copies of the installer but the last clause has me confused. If the author modifies the agreement and removes the ability to distribute copies, does it apply to my copy that I downloaded a while back?
