This is a continuation of: Why do certain fractional values in TriangleWave not evaluate?   The analysis by R.M and rasher revealed that problem to reduce to the behavior of:               ArcSin[Sin[π / 10]]      > >     ArcSin[1/4 (-1 + Sqrt[5])] >   Every other denominator besides ten, at least up to 500,000, automatically evaluates to a simpler form:                Position[ArcSin[Sin[π / Range[500000]]], _ArcSin]  (* slow *)      > >     {{10}} >   All other coefficient of π with a denominator of ten appear to exhibit the same problem:               ArcSin[Sin[{1, 3, 7, 9, 11} π/10]]      > >     {ArcSin[1/4 (-1 + Sqrt[5])], ArcSin[1/4 (1 + Sqrt[5])], ArcSin[1/4 (1 + > Sqrt[5])], >      ArcSin[1/4 (-1 + Sqrt[5])], ArcSin[1/4 (1 - Sqrt[5])]} >   `FullSimplify` reduces the expression:                ArcSin[Sin[{1, 3, 7, 9, 11} π/10]] // FullSimplify      > >     {π/10, (3 π)/10, (3 π)/10, π/10, -(π/10)} >   Is this a bug? Is there some explanation for it? * * * **Before someone points out the obvious** : I see that `Sin[π/10]` evaluates to `1/4 (-1 + Sqrt[5])`. But why isn't `ArcSin` "smart" enough to recognize this value, when it recognizes others? For example `Sin[π/12]` evaluates to `(-1 + Sqrt[3])/(2 Sqrt[2])` but `ArcSin` correctly recognizes this and outputs `π/12`.
