When one says "a class' interface": Does he/she refer to all of the get and set methods - or do they refer only to the methods' signatures and return types, without the inner implementation of these methods? (Aka, the implementation of a 'get' method isn't considered part of the interface, but rather part of the inner implementation of the class. The interface is the return type for that method and the signature of that method).
