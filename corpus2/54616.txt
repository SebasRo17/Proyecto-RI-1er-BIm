I often get a data table with column names and row names. For example:               Gene_Name   ID         CHR   Sample_1    Sample_2    Sample_3   ...     Itm2a       NM_00134   chrX  0.00        1.23        2.45       ...     Fam109a     NM_02342   chr7  1.44        4.44        2.14       ...     ...         ...        ...   ...         ...         ...        ...      I'd like to divide it into 4 blocks, namely the data block (with all the numeric data reads), column names, row names and corner names. Currently I usually do something like this:               rw = Import["table.csv"];     colnames = rw[[1 ;; 1, 4 ;;]];     rownames = rw[[2 ;;, 1 ;; 3]];     cornernames = rw[[1 ;; 1, 1 ;; 3]];     data = rw[[2 ;;, 4 ;;]];      which is quite clumsy and feels not "mathmatica". Can anyone do better?
