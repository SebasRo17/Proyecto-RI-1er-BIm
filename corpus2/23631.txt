I'm trying to plot a 3D graphic and I want to highlight the intersection between two graphics: a plane and a surface. I thought that `Meshfunction->{#3&}` was a good idea, but I realized that I can't change the position of the mesh! This is my code:               a = 0.5;     J = -3.00;          U[x_,y_,a_] := -(1-a)/Sqrt[(x-a)^2+y^2] - a/Sqrt[(x+1-a)^2+y^2] - 0.5*(x^2+y^2);     t=Table[       Show[         Plot3D[2*U[x,y,a], {x,-1.5,1.5}, {y,-1.5,1.5},                PlotRange -> {-2.7,-4.0}, Mesh -> 1, MeshFunctions -> {#3&},                 MeshStyle -> {Orange, Thick}, ClippingStyle->None,                PlotStyle -> Directive[Gray],                 AxesLabel -> {Style["x",Italic,20],Style["y",Italic,20],Style["J=2U(x,y,a)",Italic,20]}],         Plot3D[J-t, {x,-1.5,1.5}, {y,-1.5,1.5},                 Mesh -> False, PlotStyle -> Directive[Green,Opacity[0.5]]],         ImageSize->700],        {t, 0., .7, .2}]      Someone can help me please?
