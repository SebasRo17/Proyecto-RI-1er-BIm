I mean everything, not just schema changes. Even a simple SELECT on a primary key can't go into production, even though it has been code-reviewed by other developers (in context), without a DBA review of every statement, extracted from the code and submitted with EXPLAIN output, details of how often it will be called, etc, etc. If you've been in such an environment, did you find it to be a net gain, or a drag on development? As someone who has been working with relational databases for years, I find the "developers can't be trusted to use databases" attitude unwarranted, and I'm curious as to how common this situation is. For what it's worth, this is just for web development, not something critical.
