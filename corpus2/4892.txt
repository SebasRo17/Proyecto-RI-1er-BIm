I have several TeX-files and they contain information of the form * * *               \commandnameA{Bob}     blabla     \commandnameB{It wasn't Bob}     \commandnameC{2012}     bla     \commandnameD{$\frac{1}{3}$}     \commandnameE{\commandnameF{It was Bob!}}     \commandnamefilename{29}      * * * Is it possible to read in that information via Mathematica? Like for example in a list `{Bob,It wasn't Bob,2012,$\frac{1}{3}$,\commandnameF{It was Bob!},It was Bob!,29}` The purpose would be to use the enumaration of the files (here 29) together with the other content of the files to further calculate statistics and generate graphics about these bunch of TeX-files as a whole.
