I am looking for resources to turn to when I don't have the answer for something. I lead a team of software developers. We have been rolling out new software releases on a monthly basis. When there is a bug that my team cannot fix, it lands on me. Most of the time I can resolve the issue, but there are times when I get stuck. Unfortunately, I'm the top of the line at our company. There is nobody I can ask for help or assistance in figuring something out. Do you happen to have any recommendations or guidance for situations like this?
