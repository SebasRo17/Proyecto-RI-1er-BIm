I would like to render a cylinder symmetric radial cross-section with Image3D. As an example one could use the propagation of a Bessel Beam through a Lens: ![Bessel Beam Focusing](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C6VOD.png) Here the cylinder axis is the bottom of the image and the radial coordinate is along the vertical direction of the image. A 3D volumetric rendering would show the resulting focus ring at a radius of 1mm very nicely. My solution is very slow and uses a tomographical approach by generating array plots of rotated image rows and stacking them together in Image3D.               inpdata =        ImageData[        Import[NotebookDirectory[] <> "<Filename of image to rotate>.png"]][[;; , ;; , 1]];     outdata =        Monitor[Table[tint = Interpolation[Reverse[1 - inpdata[[;; , i]]]];          Image[ArrayPlot[           Table[Piecewise[{{tint[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]],                Sqrt[x^2 + y^2] < Length[inpdata]}},              0], {x, -Length[inpdata],              Length[inpdata]}, {y, -Length[inpdata], Length[inpdata]}],            Frame -> False, ImageMargins -> None,            ColorFunctionScaling -> False]], {i, 1, Dimensions[inpdata][[2]], 1}], i];     Image3D[outdata]      I hope that there is a more efficient way to do this in _Mathematica_...
