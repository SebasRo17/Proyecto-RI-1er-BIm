I develop a web application and we test it on browsers like Firefox and Internet Explorer. During our development we test the application on Firefox 3.5. **2** and our testing team tests the same on 3.5. **6** and found the UI looks good. But all of the sudden the client complains that it doesn't look good in 3.5. **8**. How do we handle these minor version issues? How can we check the browser compatibility during development and during testing? Is there any tool to test the application on 3.5. **X** , X being all the minor versions?
