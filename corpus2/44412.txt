I am trying to get a simple but relatively ugly result out of the following summation, however, mathematica gives me an expression which includes HypergeometricPFQ. Obviously, I am doing something wrong, which is pretty classical for me. Can somebody please point me out what went wrong? The result should be an expression involving factorials and product (maybe). thank you!               a[j_, q_, k_] := (q! (j + q - 1)!)/((j! (q - j)!) (j - k + q - 1)!);     aa[i_, q_, k_] := a[i - q + k + 1, q, k];     b[j_, q_, k_] = (-1)^j Sum[aa[i, q, k]*aa[j - i, q, k], {i, 0, j, 1}]          ((-1)^j k! (j + k)! (q!)^2 HypergeometricPFQ[{-j, 1 + k,       1 + k - 2 q, -1 - j - k + q}, {-j - k, 2 + k - q, -j - k + 2 q},      1])/(j! (1 + k - q)! (1 + j + k - q)! (-1 - k + 2 q)! (-1 - j -        k + 2 q)!)
