I'm ultimately trying to create a directed graph with some of the nodes in fixed positions and the other nodes placed around them in "acceptable" positions. It's better if I ask the question by showing an example of the code. E.g. I have this graph:               node = {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16};     edges = {11 -> 14, 11 -> 16, 12 -> 16, 12 -> 15, 13 -> 15, 13 -> 16,       14 -> 16, 14 -> 15, 15 -> 16, 15 -> 13, 16 -> 15, 16 -> 14};     vertexposition = {{6.51493919050084`, 44.04756585632944`},                        {75.59445680043342`, 50.47455242214042`},                        {87.32825501506514`, 13.395648943951699`},                       {28.795707353492418`, 3.420138063734413`},                        {60.729164933330765`, 16.915777496473908`},                        {51.85158892659126`, 25.803692768150313`}};          Show[          Graph[node, edges, VertexCoordinates -> vertexposition, Frame -> True,                              VertexSize -> {"Scaled", .02}, VertexLabels -> "Name"]          , FrameTicks -> True, ImageSize -> 600]      I have these fixed critical nodes with positions that are important to me, however I have many other nodes that I want to add to the graph and connect to these nodes without having to specifically add their coordinates. For example, I want to remove the connection between node $11$ and node $14$ but add three arbitrary nodes that link in series to connect nodes $11$ and $14$ without having to define their position, and have mathematica put an "appropriate" default position for them. That is, I don't want to add the nodes and have them all bunch up at the origin; the graph should look more organic. Here's the kicker, I want to add edgeweights to all the nodes and don't necessarily want them to space out according to the edgeweights.
