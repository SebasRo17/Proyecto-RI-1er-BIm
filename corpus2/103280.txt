As a team lead, how can you help your programmers to grow? The reason I ask this is because there are a few programmers working with me, and I really want to "turn them on the loose", to realize their maximum potential, and to keep them happy. But I don't quite know how to do this, do I have to   1. Interact with them frequently, or give them quiet time, leave them undisturbed?   2. Ask them to follow coding guidelines, such as enforcing unit tests, coding styles, or let them do whatever they see fit?   3. Be lenient with them. Such as don't really care whether they really come into office for 8 hours or 4 hours, or need to enforce some "disciplines" in the work place? Guess what, each positions have their own points, and different people would argue for different things. Such confusions make managing people indefinitely harder. What do you think?
