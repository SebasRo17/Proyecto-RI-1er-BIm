I've been working on a nightmare of a project for some months now. The product is a small Ruby on Rails app/website for internal use by a small group of people. I'm coming up to the finish line and I'd like the actual beta release to go smoothly. I still have a number of small bugs that affect functionality in a minor way and do not break the build. This is my first job and first time taking a product to launch. I'm curious what people's methodologies are for a smooth transition to bring your application from a development environment to a live production environment.
