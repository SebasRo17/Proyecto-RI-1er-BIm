I have a couple of questions about UML.   * Firstly, how would you show "Use Case Ends" on a sequence diagram.   * Secondly, if you have an alt in a sequence diagram for "Variable == false", would you need to show what would happen if the variable is true, even if nothing would happen other than moving onto the next method call?    * Third, isn't the last arrow on the diagram always going to be asynchronous, because it can continue and does not have to wait?
