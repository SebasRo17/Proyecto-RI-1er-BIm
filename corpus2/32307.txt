Here is my code, which works, but seems a little too long, I think might be a more refined version.               Range[Ceiling[#/2]] ~ Join ~        If[OddQ[#], Rest, Identity] @ Reverse @ Range[Ceiling[#/2]] & /@ Range[9]          Range[Ceiling[#/2]] ~ Join ~ Range[Floor[#/2], 1, -1] & /@ Range[9]      > >     {{1}, {1, 1}, {1, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 3, 3,  2, > 1}, >      {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, > 2, 1}} >
