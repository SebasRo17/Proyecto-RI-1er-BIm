I am working on a side project at work where I find it beneficial to use some of my code that I have developed personally (outside of work) to speed my development. My side project is developing a C++ GUI application to let our power users run queries (built by me) against databases on several different platforms (DB2, Oracle, SQL Server and MySQL). In the past, I would usually just run these myself on request or build an Excel VBA application for them. Now that I have built several VBA applications for several different people, I find the need to build one central application that just reads in custom .sql files and executes against various databases. The application that I am building is in C++ and uses an LGPL cross-platform GUI toolkit. However, I have a lot of code that in my own libraries that I have built over the years on leisure, non-work related projects. Is it okay to use this code at work, thus saving me (and the company) time? If so, can I port any bug fixes and enhancements back to my personal library? There seems to be a line that I do not know when I am going to cross it. I just want to add that none of the personal code has anything to do with any business logic. They are just basic utility classes/wrappers.
