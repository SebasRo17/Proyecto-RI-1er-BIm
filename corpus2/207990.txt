I'm new to a small development company (half a dozen programmers and should grow to possibly a dozen eventually). We also have a few external contractors working with us (just to add a bit of complication). I would like to slowly start adopting Agile, or more importantly short sprints. I was curios to know, from past experience, what would you recommend that our initial sprint length (in weeks) be? Maybe I can even go as far as asking what is the sprint length of a very mature and experienced Agile team (shorter [2 weeks] or longer sprints [4 weeks])? My initial thought was to use a shorter sprint, say 2 weeks and then in time, once we get the hang of things and all has smoothed out, we could simply double it to 4 weeks.
