In this code, one cannot close the dialog window:               {TogglerBar[Dynamic[x], Range[5]], Dynamic[x],  Dynamic[CreateDialog[x]]}      If I use `DynamicModule` this way, the dialog window will not pop up when it was closed and re-chosen some values.               {TogglerBar[Dynamic[y],Range[5]],Dynamic[y],DynamicModule[{y=y},CreateDialog[y]]}      So how to make the created dialog window could be closed and reopen when click to set different values by `TogglerBar`
