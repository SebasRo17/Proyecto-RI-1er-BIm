I'm writing out a notebook that goes through the van der Waals Equation of State for gases, and I run into a situation where I want to assign (simplified) Tc[b_]:=5b, use that to solve for b in terms of Tc with               b[Tc_]/.Solve[Tc==Tc[b],b][[1]]      Is it ok to assign Tc[b_] and still use Tc as a variable?   * If it is ok, is it possible to assign Tc[b_] and leave Tc blue instead of black, like other variables? What about assigning Tc[b_] and Tc to different things? How do the mechanics behind assigning things work in Mathematica such that I can assign Tc and not bother Tc[b_]? Here's my full code, it works fine, I'm just wondering down the road if evaluating like this will work in a more complicated situation.               RGas = Quantity["MolarGasConstant"];          Pvan[V_, T_] := (R*T)/(V - b) - a/V^2     Pvan[V_, T_]' := D[Pvan[V, T], V]     Pvan[V_, T_]'' := D[Pvan[V, T]', V]          CriticalValues =        Solve[{Pvan[V, T] == P, Pvan[V, T]' == 0 == Pvan[V, T]''}, {V, T, P}]          Pc[a_, b_] = P /. CriticalValues[[1]]     Vc[a_, b_] = V /. CriticalValues[[1]]     Tc[a_, b_] = T /. CriticalValues[[1]]          Zc[Pc_, Vc_, Tc_] := (Pc[a, b]*Vc[a, b])/(R*Tc[a, b])     Zc[Pc, Vc, Tc]          abCritical = Solve[{Tc == Tc[a, b], Pc == Pc[a, b]}, {a, b}]     a[Tc_, Pc_] = a /. abCritical[[1]] /. R -> RGas;     b[Tc_, Pc_] = b /. abCritical[[1]] /. R -> RGas;     \[Nu]c[Tc_, Pc_] := b[Tc, Pc]/4 /. R -> RGas;     \[Sigma][Tc_, Pc_] := ((3*\[Nu]c[Tc, Pc])/(4*\[Pi]*Nâ‚€))^(1/3) /.R -> RGas;          Solve[Eliminate[{P == Pvan[V, T], TR == T/Tc[a, b], VR == V/Vc[a, b],        PR == P/Pc[a, b]}, {P, T, V}], PR] // FullSimplify      It follows the first 3 pages of this.
