I'm reading the blog on mosaics by Theodore Gray. I tried the first example:               dir = "d:\\mosaic\\pool\\*.jpg";       master = "d:\\mosaic\\master.jpg";       imagePool = Map[With[{i = Import[#]}, {i, Mean[Flatten[N[i[[1, 1]]], 1]]}] &,        FileNames[dir]];     closeMatch[c_] := RandomChoice[Take[SortBy[imagePool, Norm[c - #[[2]]] &], 20]][[1]];     Grid[Reverse[Map[closeMatch, Import[master][[1, 1]], {2}]], Spacings -> {0, 0}]      but it gives me errors: > Part::partd: Part specification (<an image>)[1,1] is longer than depth of > object. I'm using Mathematica version 9. A comment on the blog says the code has to be modified for version 8, so I guess the changes are also required for version 9. How can I make this code work?
