I want to integrate the function funcin (spherical coordinates).               ϵ=78.36     λ=0.548881         funcin =        1/(ϵ*π)*Exp[-(2*r + λ*Sqrt[r^2 + ρ^2 -          2*r*ρ*Cos[θ]])]*r^2*Sin[θ]*1/Sqrt[ρ^2 + r^2 - 2*r*ρ*Cos[θ]]     intfuncing = Integrate[funcin, {r, 0, Infinity}, {θ, 0, π}, {ϕ, 0,2 π}]      If I use analytic calculation (`Integrate`), an integral over r is left, which must be numerically evaluated, e.g., by using `N[intfuncing]` for specific ρ. For example I can write:                Do[ρ = 0.1 + (i - 1)*0.05; int[[i]] = N[intfuncing], {i, 60}]      to calculate the integral at 60 points. But I get an error by that: > NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one > of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly > oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small. If I try to evaluate the integral numerically with `NIntegrate`, I get: > the integral ... evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points > in the region with boundaries {{∞, 0.}, {0, 3.14159}, {0, 6.28319}}. Does anyone have an idea how to solve this problem?
