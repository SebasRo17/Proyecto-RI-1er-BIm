Mathematica includes three functions that I know of which can be used to effectively (if not actually) define a variable and give it a value within a local scope: `Module`, `Block`, and `With`. What are the differences between these functions (and any other scoping constructs that may exist which I don't know about), and how do I decide which one is appropriate to use in any given instance? The documentation does describe what the different constructs do to some extent, but I feel like it's insufficiently clear on how exactly they differ from each other. Having some short examples that demonstrate the differences would be great.
