I have a large system in OpenEdge ABL that could use some documentation-love. Currently a team member is working on a utility that can find methods and functions and make some "Javadoc-esque" html pages out of it. It's pretty rough around the edges. Okay, it's like sawblades around the edges. I'm trying to find something like Javadoc or Doxygen that is capable of parsing OpenEdge ABL to generate some kind of API documentation. I know the market for OpenEdge isn't the best, but there is a lot of stuff that's passed along by word of mouth. It's difficult to search for because it used to be called "Progress" which throws off your search queries with non-relevant information. I'm also open to a system that lets you define the regex's to look for to define your own syntax. Then it parses and gives you an output based on that.
