Mathematica is not able to tell whether a summation of two positive expressions is positive or not. Which is very strange. My three symbolic arguments, $x$, $y$, and $z$, are all real numbers bounded by zero and one. Hence the following expression should definitely be positive as well. $x + (1 - x) (1 + y)^z$ My code is:               $Assumptions = {(x | y | z) \[Element] Reals} && 0 < x < 1 && 0 < y < 1 && 0 < z < 1          Refine[x + (1 - x) (1 + y)^z > 0]      The expected result is `True`. But what I get is just a repetition of the inequality within `Refine`. To test, I tried the two terms on LHS separately as:               Refine[x > 0]          Refine[(1 - x) (1 + y)^z > 0]      And both give me `True`. But once I combine them it doesn't work. This is very very strange. Can anyone help me out? Thank you so much!
