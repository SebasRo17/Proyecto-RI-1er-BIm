Assume there is a request which is going to look up a list of items from a service which requires authorisation (e.g. it's behind a Basic Authentication domain). If the service didn't require authentication, I would always make this request as a GET (it's idempotent). But because the credentials would end up in the query string, I'm basically required to do this as a POST. Is there any alternative to this method?
