I am looking for pointers on how to redefine UI elements (in the FE as well as in a CDF document). For example: the looks of a button, or of tab elements, and so on. (I don't mean something like "changing the color of a (pressed or unpressed) button", I really mean the UI element appearance). I have been looking around (web and here) and I didn't come up with an answer, nor with any kind of information... Anyone has any pointers? Is it even possible? Thanks!
