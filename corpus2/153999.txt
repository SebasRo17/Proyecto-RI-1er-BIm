I have an Android app which I added adMob ads to. They only work though when the user is online. Now the problem is, the app is specially made for offline use, so pretty much nobody will ever get to see one. The app is free to download, but I would still like to make a few cents out of it. It currently has around 300, which I guess will look at it about twice per workday. Any help on how to make some money with this free, offline app?
