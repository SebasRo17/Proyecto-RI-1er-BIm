I'm considering sitting with the end-users and observing them while the work for a day to better understand the software requirements. Before I try this, I'm hoping someone can provide a list of best practices, suggestions on when this approach is more/less suitable than simply interviewing the users, and notes from your own experiences using job observation/shadowing. References to other sites or recollections of your own personal experience are both welcome.
