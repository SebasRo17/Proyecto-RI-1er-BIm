I have a winforms application that connects to a single sql server 2012 database and is executed in many PCs of a company. I'm having several problems with some transactions inside the application, deadlocks and timeouts so the refactor idea comes to my head. Actually the app is using DbConnection object (the app starts with Framework 2.0 and recently was updated to Framework 3.5 but the data access layer was not changed) to perform the sql calls to the database and in the Program.cs the connection is opened and until the user doesn't close the app the connection maintains opened. What are my options to refactor this app?   * Entity Framework? => With this I must to say that the SQL database has not Foreign Keys   * Refactor the Data Access Layer to use a more efficient connection? Maybe using TransactionScope?   * Is the always connected app efficient?
