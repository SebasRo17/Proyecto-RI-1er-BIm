I'm working with `Vectors` type in `Mathematica` 9. For this purpose I use the following command:               Assumptions = v Ïµ Vectors[3]      Now I want to find gradient from the next vector expression: $\vec{v}/\mid \vec{v}\mid$, but the usual `Grad` function doesn't work with `Vectors`. I tried this:               Grad[v/Norm[v], v]      Question: Is it possible to find `Grad` or at least `Norm` from variables of `Vectors` type?
