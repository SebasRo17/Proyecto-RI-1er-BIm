I have a project where I will be collaborating to build a fairly simple site with some database access. I will be doing the back-end work, and my colleague will be doing the web design. The problem is that my colleague has only worked with PHP developers and I have a lot more experience in Perl. The options would be to either learn PHP while doing the project or for my colleague to learn how to design around Perl. (I guess a third option would be to decline the project because this obstacle is just too insurmountable). If the answer is to use Perl, the next question is which templating module would be easiest for my PHP-aware web designer colleague to adapt to. HTML::Mason? HTML::Template? Something else?
