I'm new to mathematica and I don't know what I do wrong, I have written the following PDE problem, with both initial and boundary (four in total)               eq = D[u[x, t], t, t] + D[u[x, t], t] - 2*D[u[x, t], x, x] == 0     bc = {u[0, t] == 0, u[2*Pi, t] == 0, u[x, 0] == 0, Derivative[0, 1][u][x, 0] == sin (2*x)}          DSolve[{eq, bc}, u[x,t], {t, x}]      I need it to solve the PDE, but it doesn't even try to make a solution... what to do. I hope you can help me
