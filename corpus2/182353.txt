For my final project in school we have to develop an online shop. This shop should have a cart where items can be placed whether or not you are logged in. If you log out the cart shouldn't empty and should still be shown. So my question is would it make sense to store the cart as xml in the database(ms sql server)? There is potentially a (relatively)fair amount of data that should be kept, is it possible that this could deliver any performance benefits or am I way off base?
