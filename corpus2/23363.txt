I tried these               ContourPlot[ 1 + (1 + x)^3 - 3 (1 + x) y + y^3 == 0, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]     ContourPlot[(x + y + 2) == 0, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]     ContourPlot[(x + y + 2)^2 == 0, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]     ContourPlot[(x + y + 2)^3 == 0, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]      the third and fourth one produce graphs contrary to my mathematical common sense. Especially, the third one does not produce anything. Could someone explain why and how to fix it?
