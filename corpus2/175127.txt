Once in a while, a co-worker will check-in bad code which blocks my application from initializing properly. To get around this problem quickly, I comment out the offending code. I then forget to uncomment the offending code at the time of my check-in, so I want to prevent this from happening again. Do you have any suggestions on how to:   1. Disable bad code that stop you from working    2. Prevent yourself from checking in unwanted changes? I'm currently using Visual Studio as my IDE and TFS as my source code repo.
