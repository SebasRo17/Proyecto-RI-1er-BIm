I just started writing some ruby in my spare time and am currently using Netbeans 7 with the Ruby and Rails plugin v0.111. I'm primarily a Java programmer coming from IntelliJ and Eclipse. One downside of my Ruby programming setup is that my Netbeans isn't very helpful when it comes to code completion. This seems due to the fact that Ruby is not strongly typed and since the IDE doesn't know the type it can't suggest methods. As a result I must spend a lot of time in my browser looking at documentation and switching back to my IDE to manually type in the method there. Are there any changes I can make to my setup to get code completion for Ruby or is it pretty much impossible due to the nature of the language? How do other developers work with Ruby, other than memorizing all the methods in the Core Library?
