Comparable questions have surely been asked before but I'd like to hear some words about my specific way of implementing Javascript classes. Let me first start with a Javascript example taken from a real-life application I've been working on recently. **Example**               PageControl= new function() {       var self= this;            // example additional control bound to page control       var grid= new GridControl();            self.initialise= function() {         // initialise form fields, controls etc.       };            // example function       self.load= function(id) {         // reloads form with new data       };            $(document).ready(function() {         self.initialise();       });     };      Each page has its own PageControl instance with specific tasks solely relevant for the given page. **Question:** I'm not looking for alternative ways of how to implement it, I'd just want to know if the above example is bad or wrong code. The above structure has worked great so far, even if I work with sub controls like `PageControl.grid.reload();` but I don't want to stick to error-prone code.
