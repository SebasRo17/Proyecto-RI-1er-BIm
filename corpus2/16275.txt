I'm using `PlotLegends` in v9. It seems that in the documentation examples, plots and legends are combined into one graphic: Here's an example from `LineLegend` in the documentation:               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 5}, PlotLegends -> LineLegend["Expressions"]]      Which outputs this (notice how the legend is selected within the graph): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FHJK6.jpg) However, if this same line is evaluated by me, it becomes this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qHYSu.jpg) Is this default behavior? Did Wolfram put graphics in place of output for their documentation? If this is default behavior, can they be combined without creating a rasterized image? **UPDATE:** It turns out that _Mathematica_ documentation sometimes contain rasterized images for output which was causing the initial confusion. The main point of the question is the behavior of the `Legended` (and related) function and exporting images with it included. The context menu and `Export` command treat this different.
