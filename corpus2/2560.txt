Inspired by How can this confetti code be improved to include shadows and gravity? I would like to create my new experiment/stimuli using Mathematica. The idea is to study how people move their eyes in a dynamic scene. To do so I need to build some animations (1 minute long to start) where we feel like going forward in a perspective grid like the one below. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGtaT.png) I will need to make some object appear/disappear/change within that scene. The grid itself could just be made out of point, and i will add some geometric colored shapes. While I know how to draw perspective I don`t know how i could "program" it and then animate it.
