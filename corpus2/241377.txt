Let's say I need to write a test for the front end, in the following BDD style:               A user visits buysomething.com,      saves something to their wishlist,      and a saved item count is updated.       The result of the test is that DOM gets manipulated. In my heart I feel this is better suited as an integration test - but my team is currently using jasmine to load fixtures and test such interactions. This can lead to brittle tests as they are reliant on a static fixtures instead of the actual markup. Are we misusing Jasmine here?
