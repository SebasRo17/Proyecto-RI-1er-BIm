As the title indicates, I want to delete some unwanted regions in a three- dimensional surface created using `ContourPlot3D`. Here is the corresponding code               Clear["Global`*"];          V = 1/2*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2*y^2 + x^2*z^2 + y^2*z^2 - x^2*y^2*z^2);          E0 = 7;          S0 = ContourPlot3D[V == E0, {x, -4, 4}, {y, -4, 4}, {z, -4, 4},      PlotPoints -> 70, PerformanceGoal -> "Speed", Mesh -> None,      ContourStyle -> Directive[Green, Opacity[0.3], Specularity[White, 30]],      ImageSize -> 550]      which produces this output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8icXX.jpg) I want somehow to keep the inside closed 3D surface (which looks like a 3D star) and delete the eight open parts which surround it. I tried several combinations using `RegionPlot3D` but the particular range of $x$, $y$ and $z$ prevent me from obtaining what I want. Any suggestions? **EDIT** If you increase the value of E0 then after a certain value the three- dimensional surface opens and eight channels of escapes (holes) appear. Using this code               Clear["Global`*"];          V = 1/2*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2*y^2 + x^2*z^2 + y^2*z^2 - x^2*y^2*z^2);          E0 = 8.5;     R0 = 6;          S0 = ContourPlot3D[V == E0, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, {z, -5, 5},      PlotPoints -> 100, PerformanceGoal -> "Speed", Mesh -> None,      ContourStyle -> Directive[Green, Opacity[0.3], Specularity[White, 30]],      ImageSize -> 550, RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, Sqrt@(x^2*y^2 +      x^2*z^2 + y^2*z^2) <= R0]]      you get this output ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dxzwf.jpg) OK, my question is the following: How can I draw the surface and manipulate the openings at the minimum width. Let me be more specific. Now, using the current code the size of the openings is controlled by the cutoff surface and the particular value of $R0$. If for example, I use $R0 = 2.5$ then I loose essential parts of the surface. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ovkJG.jpg) What I want is to define such a cutoff surface or find the specific value of $R0$ so that the external cutoff surface to abut exactly against the inner surface thus, drawing the openings at their minimum width. Any suggestions?
