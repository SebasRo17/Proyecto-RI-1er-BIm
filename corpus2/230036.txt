I am looking to create a challenging AI project. There is an online card game that allows you to build a deck to play with out of randomly presented cards. You have to choose one each time out of a couple of cards. I want to build an AI that picks the cards as I would pick them myself using my knowledge of the game. My guess is that I would have to create a system that can be trained based on "experience" (taught by training) and adapts its choices based on which previous cards it has already selected. I am looking for the specific name for this type of AI so I can start finding some resources for it or similar projects if you know any.
