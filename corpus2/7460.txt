> For more info about the difference between 0. and 0 I am a self-taught Mathematica user and I have some elementary questions-- perhaps too elementary for this site, but here they are. ![Matrix](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XFQkd.jpg)   1. If you look at the identity matrix, you'll see a "dot" in each entry in the upper triangular portion of the matrix. Why are they there? Is it because those entries are not really zeros?    2. How do I get the entries in MatrixForm[Inverse[M]] to appear as fractions?  Thanks everyone! So I just found this link: Expressing a decimal as a fraction in lowest terms and tried the following: ![Matrix2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cJfBZ.jpg) Isn't there a way to tell Mathematica to not show entries like -9.71445146547012`*^-17 (up to 17th decimal place)?
