I'm getting into .Net development, I'm pretty much a beginner programmer, except for an intro class I took in college and just playing around at home. I intend to watch videos online to go along with the book. I have decided on two books, **Learning C# 3.0** by O'Reilly or **Beginning Visual C# 2010** by Wrox. I like the O'Reilly book better, it just has a friedlier and nicer style of writing but it only covers C# 3.0, and the Wrox book obviously covers C# 4.0. Is it a bad idea to go with C# 3.0? I will I be missing out on a lot of stuff? Any advice will be greatly appreciated.
