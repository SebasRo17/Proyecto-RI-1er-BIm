I have a problem where `Column` will occasionally cut off a single pixel from the top of images. To reproduce the problem, evaluate this:               image = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/2dEty.png"]     Column[{"text", Image[image, Magnification -> 1], "text"}]      The output I get looks like this in the front end: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VJqZh.png) Note that in `Out[2]` a single pixel wide row is cut off from the top of the image. It does not occur with all images, but it does with this particular one. **How can I work around this problem?** This is on Win7. Can you reproduce on other platforms? I need this for the image uploader palette (`SOUploader`uploadWithPreview[]` function to be specific). * * * It is interesting to note that if I wrap the image in a `Pane`, and set a pane-size explicitly (as in the original code of the palette), whether the row is cut off depends on whether the size is even or odd (I suspect a rounding issue): Try this and notice that the cropping happens for even `k` only:               Table[      Column[{"text",         Pane[Image[image, Magnification -> 1],          ImageDimensions[image] + {0, k}], "text"}],      {k, 0, 5}      ]
