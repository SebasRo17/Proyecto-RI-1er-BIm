I have an implicit function expression               F[x, y] :=        -E^(-2 a) (-1 + (c (1 - 1/y^2))/a)          (-1 + (b (1 - 1/y^2))/(2 a)) + (1 + (c (1 - 1/y^2))/a) (1 + (b (1 - 1/y^2))/(2 a))      where               a = Sqrt[x^2 - (1 - 1/y^2) y^2]          b = Sqrt[x^2 - 2 y^2]          c = Sqrt[x^2 - y^2]      I plot the expression `F[x, y] == 0` with `ContourPlot`, and I get something like this: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/t2E41.png) I need to obtain a plot like this: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LrUIy.png) If I try to plot `Re[F[x,y]]==0` and the result looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WajU3.png) But there is one more solution(branch in the left) that I don't need. How can I separate there solutions?
