I can not access the directory on my remote kernel these days. Therefore, I want to export the output of the computations to my local machine. Some details:   * My remote kernel is on a Tyan TX46 with 4 Opteron 2.2Ghz cpus and 32GB of ram and my local machine has a Intel(R)Core(TM)2CPU 6600 @2.40 GHz processor and 4gb ram.   * I don't use parallel remote kernels.   * I installed my remote kernel by some settings on Evaluation>Kernel Configuration Options. Is there a way to do that?
