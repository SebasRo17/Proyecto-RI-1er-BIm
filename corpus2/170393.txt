As I understand, the term "Backporting" is used to describe a fix which is applied in a future version which is also ported to a previous version. Wikipedia definition is as follows: > **Backporting** is the action of taking a certain software modification > (patch) and applying it to an older version of the software than it was > initially created for. It forms part of the maintenance step in a software > development process... For example:   * A problem is discovered and fixed in V2.0. The same fix is ported and applied to V1.5. What is the term when this is done in the opposite direction?   * The problem is discovered and fixed in V1.5. The same fix is ported and applied to V2.0. Would the term "Backporting" still apply? Or is there a term such as "Forwardporting" (which amusingly sounds a lot like "Port Forwarding")?
