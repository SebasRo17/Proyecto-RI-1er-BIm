I was solving recurrence relation of Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS, 3rd. edition. Problem 4-3 (i)   $$ T(n) = T(n-2) + \frac{1}{lg \; n} $$ I tried few ways, like expending with iteration method. With that i came up with the following equations - For even - $$ T(n) = T(0) + \frac{1}{lg \; n} + \frac{1}{lg \; (n-2)} + \frac{1}{lg \; (n-4)} + ... + \frac{1}{lg \; 6} + \frac{1}{lg \; 4} + \frac{1}{lg \; 2} $$ For odd $$ T(n) = T(1) + \frac{1}{lg \; n} + \frac{1}{lg \; (n-2)} + \frac{1}{lg \; (n-4)} + ... + \frac{1}{lg \; 7} + \frac{1}{lg \; 5} + \frac{1}{lg \; 3} $$ We can assume $T(1)=1$ and $T(0) = 1$. So to solve it I need to be able to sum up $$ \sum ^{n}_{i=2} \frac{1}{lg\;i} $$ Some help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
