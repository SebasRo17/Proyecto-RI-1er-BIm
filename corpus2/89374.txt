Please help me identify and understand this visual pattern, what's the common name used for such mindmap / constellation visualisations? http://asterisq.com/products/constellation/roamer/demo http://apps.asterisq.com/mentionmap/#user-scobleizer I am also looking a for a framework, library or **math formula** that will help me build something similar. I am especially interested in the auto arranging functionality as I will have plenty of nodes that I need to arrange on the screen in the best possible fashion. What's the math behing auto arranging somethoing in 2D? I also need combine to that all with extensive zooming and map-like navigation. If you know about anything that could help achieve my goal please don't hesitate to leave an answer. My preferred language is ActionScript 3 / Flash but I will be thankful for any info, tutorial or article in any language.
