I read in a book that both _methods_ and _fields_ are considered the _attributes_ of a class in Python. However, recently I was told by a friend of mine that methods may **not** be considered the _attributes_ of a class. Then I decided to check this out again, and found this question mentioned on Wikipedia saying that this is a Python "tradition" to refer to methods as attributes, in contrast to other object-oriented programming languages. So my question is: why are methods considered the class atributes along with the fields in Python in contrast to other languages? Thank you!
