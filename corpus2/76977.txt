I was recently approached by a software firm that specializes in Quality Assurance and Testing. Up until this point, the developers at our (small) company have been responsible for their own QA for the most part and we've had mixed results. We're at the point where we are ready to hire a full time QA guy, but I was curious as to whether or not other's have used teams like this in the past and what the results were? I'm a bit skeptical but trying to be open-minded. **tl;dr What was your experience with an outsourced QA/testing team? Pros and cons?**
