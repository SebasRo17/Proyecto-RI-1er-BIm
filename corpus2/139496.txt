In large scale applications (e.g. Banking Domain), what is the criteria of upgrading an existing project to a newer version of the technology on which it is built? For instance, a .NET application built on .NET Framework 3.5 and using Oracle 9i back-end. There are not any specific urgent requirements, but should I think of upgrading to .NET 4.5 and Oracle 11g in the near future? Is it advantageous to keep pace with the technology version?
