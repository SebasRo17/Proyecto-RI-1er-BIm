I have an external data file (can be downloaded here: link 1 or link 2) which contains a dense grid of initial condition in the (x,y,z) space. I read it with Mathematica and plot these initial conditions with different colors according to some specific properties               m = Import["data_3d.out", "Table"];          getColor[m_List, i_Integer] :=      Module[{s = m[[i, 6]]},      Which[s == 0, Black, s == 1, Red, s == 2, Darker[Green], s == 3,      Brown, s == 4, Blue, s == 5, Orange, s == 6, Cyan, s == 7,      Magenta, s == 8, Yellow, True, White]];          data = Table[{PointSize[0.004], getColor[m, i],      Point[{m[[i, 1]], m[[i, 2]], m[[i, 3]]}]}, {i, 1, Length[m]}];          P0 = Graphics3D[data, Axes -> True, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1},      PlotRange -> 6, ImageSize -> 550]      and here is the output ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bUOJY.jpg) We observe, that several color patterns appear but we can see only the surface of the three-dimensional grid. So, the question: Is there a way to penetrate inside the 3d surface and visualize how these color patterns are? Any suggestions? Please, us the original data file for testing. I think, generating simpler but random 3d grids in this case, could be very illusive since all the story is about the color patterns that appear and obviously cannot be replicated randomly. **EDIT** A second working link for retrieving the data file is added.
