I've recently finished reading a couple of Gerald Weinberg books on Quality Software Management. In them, he strongly recommends that organizations distinguish between software **failures** (which we would call bugs) and software **faults** , i.e. coding errors. He also recommends than an organization keeps separately track of failures and faults, linking one or more of the former to one of the latter. The specific terms he uses are **System Trouble Incident** for a failure report, and **System Fault Analysis** for the work that leads to the discovery of a fault. I've searched for any further references to these terms on the internet but didn't find anything. Does anyone work in an organization where failures and faults are recorded separately? And if yes, are there any tools out there that will let you do this seamlessly, and let you link failures to faults? Is it worth the trouble?
