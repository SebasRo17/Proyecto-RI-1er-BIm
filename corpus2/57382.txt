I'd like to be able to use MMa's graphics to make something like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m2zUo.gif) which I know must absolutely be possible (and probably easy) with MMa. I don't actually even need different colors (though that'd be nice!), but my problem is I don't even know what to search for, to learn. I tried googling "mathematica network graphics" and similar things but didn't find anything explaining how I can do it. Can someone point me in the right direction? Thank you!
