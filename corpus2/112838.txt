I'm writing a lot of estimates lately and I'm finding that quite often, a client might argue scope, deliverables or (most often) cost. In an effort to ensure that the breadth of coverage (of client requirements and mutually understood scope) for the estimate is clear (and given most clients will view an estimate as a fixed quote from Moses himself), what common assumptions do you include with your estimates such that expectations are clearly set with clients and disagreements around what is being delivered or charged are minimised?
