Consider these two examples: ### Passing an object to a constructor               class ExampleA     {       private $config;       public function __construct($config)       {          $this->config = $config;       }     }     $config = new Config;     $exampleA = new ExampleA($config);      ### Instantiating a class               class ExampleB     {       private $config;       public function __construct()       {          $this->config = new Config;       }     }     $exampleA = new ExampleA();      Which is the correct way to handle adding an object as a property? When should I use one over the other? Does unit testing affect what I should use?
