All I can find online is stuff about search result rankings, which I'm not concerned with at the moment. We're going to have a cloud-based online database and we want Google search results for something relevant to our site to display our website's search results for the same query. For example, if someone types in "lunchbox" to google, there might be a result that says "Amazon search results for 'lunchbox'" and then you click that and it takes you to amazon, and it's already searched 'lunchbox' for you. What can we do to enable this capability for our site?
