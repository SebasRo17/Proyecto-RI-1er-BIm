I'm using Django as an application framework and it only needs to consume web services (no need to have traditional Django Models and the related ORM). In this case, since Django is a variant on the MVC architecture (MVT, to be precise) should I wrap the web service calls into a 'model' that my App uses or should I just call those web services directly from the Django View and remove the model layer?
