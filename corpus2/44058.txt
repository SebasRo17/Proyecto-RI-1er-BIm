I'm looking to choose open source project hosting site for an F# project using SVN. CodePlex is where the .NET community in general and most F# projects are hosted, but I'm worried TFS + SvnBridge is going to give me headaches. So I'm looking elsewhere and seeking advice here. Or if you think CodePlex is still the best choice in my scenario, I'd like to hear that too. So far, Google Code is looking appealing to me. They have a clean interface and true SVN hosting. But there are close to no F# projects currently hosted (it's not even in their search by programming language list), so I'm wondering if there are any notable downsides besides the lack of community I might encounter. If there is yet another option, I'd like to hear that too. Thanks!
