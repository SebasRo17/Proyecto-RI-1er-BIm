I am aware that building MathLink executables is not without its challenges. However, I am trying to compile the MathLink example 'addtwo' from a makefile within cygwin on a 64 bit Windows 7 machine. I'm using cycgwin as I already have a substantial codebase built in this environment, and I have tried the following compilers:   1. The default gcc compiler. This would not compile, as the -mno-cygwin flag has been removed.   2. i686-w64-mingw32-gcc. This compiles but generates undefined references for the MathLink functions.   3. x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc. This appears to compile and link correctly. In all three cases the command line flags to the compiler are the same for compile and link:               ${CC} -c -mno-cygwin -mwin32 -I${INCS} $<     ${CC} -I${INCS} addtwo.o addtwotm.o -L${LIBS} -lML64i3m -mwindows -o $@      Although the third configuration compiles and links, it won't run correctly. When the prebuilt addtwo.exe is run from the command line, it puts up a dialogue box requesting the link parameters as expected. Mine will very briefly put up a dialogue box that is minimised, and then exit. Unfortunately gdb does not recognise the file format of the executable built with x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc. Any insights will reduce hair loss, and I can supply whatever additional information is relevant.
