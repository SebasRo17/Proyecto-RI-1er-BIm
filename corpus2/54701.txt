I usually expand expression containing absolute values, with the PiecewiseExpand[] function.               Delta[m1_, m2_, m3_] := -Abs[m2 - m3] + 1/2*(Abs[m1 - m2] + Abs[m1 - m3]) + 3/2 (Abs[m2] + Abs[m3])          PiecewiseExpand[Delta[m1, m2, m3], {m1 ∈ Integers, m2 ∈ Integers, m3 ∈ Integers, m2 >= m3}] // FullSimplify      This usually splits the absolute value in the various chambers in which it assumes a certain functional form which does not contain absolute values anymore, and also the conditions which define the cells are given by the PiecewiseExpand[] function. However, the last chamber is never given, but it corresponds to the bool vale "True". How can I recover it?
