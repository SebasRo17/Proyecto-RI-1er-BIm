Im a beginner in Java, I have the following code:               public class operations {         public ArrayList<Integer> stream;         public ArrayList<Integer> funct;         public ArrayList<String> name;         public ArrayList<Integer> funcgroup;         public ArrayList<Integer> source;     }      I read and understood that classes in Java are comparable to structs in C. In my program, I have to get an input from the user for name and search through the class and provide the other fields (stream, func, funcgroup, source) as output. My question is similar to Efficient way to shuffle objects From the first and best answer, I understand that rather than parallel lists, I should create a single list and then call a list with this class. But how do I add all my elements to the various fields in List in that case? I already have a separate `ArrayList` of these fields collected in another class.
