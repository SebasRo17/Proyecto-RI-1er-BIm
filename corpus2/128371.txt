By "enterprise ready" I am referring to availability of tools: dependency management, build management, message servers, databases, application platforms and servers, and are secure and scale well? For example, is there a lisp (or ML) alternative to j2ee? Please exclude FP's ported to JVM or .NET CLR. EDIT: I know that one could use an FP jvm port i.e. clojure or F# on .NET CLR however I am curious to know if it is possible to develop a purely functional application for the enterprise without the JVM or CLR?
