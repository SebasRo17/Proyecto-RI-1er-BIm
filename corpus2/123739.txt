Hello I think I have a nice idea to implement for human kind goodness. I call it FixTheUnFixed. The idea goes like this, imagine you are driving or traveling all over the world and when you see some obstacle or damage - broken light, trash covering the street or any other problem you would like the responsible authority to fix it. All you have to do is twit it, maybe add a photo, and of course provide the location using the inherit location service of twitter or Facebook.                    @FixTheUnFixed there is broken fire hydrant here          @FixTheUnFixed my cellular company charged me 18,572$            for using my iPhone aboard.      I thought a lot about how to process the messages. The most frequent issues that will come up are municipality concerns and I would like them to receive that location either by a retwit or an email. My two ideas for getting this address are by googling it (with google API) or just make a regular query mentioned in this pseudo Algorithm:                      1. get the location from the Twitter or Facebook status that was sent from.            2. look for key words such as trash, cats, animals etc.            3. find the relevant authority e-mail, twitter or Facebook account.            4. send the message to the authority account and retwit it to the public               world so they can follow if there is any cahnge.      In the third step, is there any smart way to implement it? I didn't find any good way to do this! I don't want to spam the authorities or publish spam of sneaky people.   * How can I improve the algorithm?   * How can I search for the communication resources of the relevant authorities?
