I am having a mobile app created for ios. The developers built the app in php. The app requires an algorithm so I found another programmer to develop it. The algorithm programmer built the algorithm in python. The developers refuse to finish the app because they say it won't work with python, while the programmer insist it will. The programmer says put the algorithm in its on server and connect then over http. Will this work and I'd so how risky is it to future problems?
