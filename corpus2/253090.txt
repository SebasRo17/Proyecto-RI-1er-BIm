One day I went to a Stack Overflow chat and saw a phrase, that was stating that inheritance, incapsulation and polymorphism are the pillars of OOP (in the sense that they are fundamental, a construction sole). Also, there's a similar question, that I have been asked very often on college exams and job interviews, and the right answer always was the statement pronounced in the title of the question ("Yes, inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism are the pillars of OOP). But in the Stack Overflow chat I was severely ridiculed, participants strongly disagreed with such a statement. So, what's wrong with this statement? Does programmers seem to be trained in different things in post-Soviet and United States colleges? Are inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism not considered to be the pillars of OOP by US/UK programmers?
