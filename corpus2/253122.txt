I've used various dependency management tools for installing software: homebrew, cabal, rubygems, etc. Invariably, despite someone's simple instructions for installing their package, there are times when dependencies don't get worked out by the package manager and the installation fails. This is more common than it ought be. And frustrating! You end up trying to troubleshoot the installation process which I feel is something users (even if they are developers) shouldn't have to do. This is one reason people knock Linux (which I love!) as compared to Windows: installations can be associated with complications. Windows users aren't tasked with compiling source. Is someone aware of a dependency management tool (or dependency management strategies) that has been especially successful at eliminating the bumps associated with installs? Clearly some package managers must be better than others. Or does this remain an unsolved problem?
