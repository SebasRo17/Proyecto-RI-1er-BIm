My team recently inherited a project from a team where the amount of developers dropped so low they had to offload some work. One of the projects we inherited was a project littered with nested code, and awful exception handling (Exceptions were in effect handled as goto statements and thus used as a part of the normal program flow.). All in all it was a hairy code ball someone had been coughing up for a few years. Now we've been having a few team guidelines in place for quite some time, but all of the regards to the structures of objects, coding styles and what not. But we havn't covered exception handling. So I'm wondering if you have any guidelines in your teams regarding exception handling, and if so how you enforce them?
