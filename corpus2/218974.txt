I'm designing a schema table that will manage the auth tokens for integrations // app with social networks. At the moment only for Twitter and Facebook. I'm thinking in this mode               id  social   tw_token   tw_token_auth   tw_secret   tw_secret_key   fb_token  fb_secret     1    twitter   aaa         bbbb           cccc        dddd            NULL       NULL     2    facebook   NULL        NULL          NULL         NULL            AAA1      bbb3      I don't like that many NULL, but for a so-simple-schema I would not realize a different table for social networks. How to perform this better than I'm doing now?
