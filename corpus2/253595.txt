When I execute the following loop :                unsigned m;      for( m = 10; m >= 0; --m ){             printf("%d\n",m);         }      the loop doesn't stop at m==0, it keeps executing interminably, so I thought that reason was that an unsigned cannot be compared to 0. But when I did the following test                 unsigned m=9;     if(m >= 0)         printf("m is positive\n");     else         printf("m is negative\n");      I got this result:               m is positive       which means that the unsigned variable m was successfully compared to 0.   Why doesn't the comparison of m to 0 work in the for loop and works fine elsewhere?
