Currently got a good job, spending 70% of my day doing what I love, the downside of this is of course that I am working for someone else and not my self. Ideally would love to get something of my own going, a night project etc which could trickle in some funds. The downside of this of course if that it would be a conflict of interest. I could of course just go ahead an start up my own little thing but if it got discovered I could risk my job. I could quit my job, but then I would miss the income (family + mortgage) and my ideas might not pan out. Thinking about it tonight, I will discuss it with my boss tomorrow - he's a good guy but I just hope he doesn't burry it or just offer over time. Anyone in this boat? Do what you love during the day (for someone else) and can't peruse it during the night.... Edit: Just to clarify, that what I want to do at night is very similar to what I do during the day. It's not a 'I love programming' in general, but I like doing data mining - and thats what I do at work. Very closely related.
