Here's an example to illustrate the issue I'm having.               right = 8 - y;     left = y^2 + 6;          integrand = HoldForm[Evaluate[right]] - HoldForm[Evaluate[left]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mEEbM.png) (I realize this is a strange form for `integrand` but it is the form I need to work with.) Here, `HoldForm` allows its argument to be evaluated, and then holds the form of the resulting output. This is what I wanted. Then               simpleintegrand = ReleaseHold[integrand]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H6JC4.png) which is fine. However,               HoldForm[Integrate[Evaluate[simpleintegrand], {y, 0, 1}]]      yields ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7YQfY.png) (removing the `Evaluate` doesn't help) when I was after $$\int_0^1 (2-y-y^2)\,dy.$$ (In another direction, I'd actually prefer to get $$\int_0^1 (-y^2-y+2)\,dy$$ and am happy to hear how, but **the crux of my question is how to use`HoldForm` when its argument involves nested commands like above.**)
