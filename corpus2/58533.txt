By this autumn my two small websites should be generating around a total of $1200 a month with minimal/zero input which is enough to for me to live on comfortably enough. Rather than embark on another business venture, I would love to spend the next few years doing something genuinely good or that helps other people that need it. I want to spend 4 or 5 years dedicating my time to a worthy cause and do the most I can to help with the web development & programming skills that I already have. The problem is that I don't know where to start. I don't have an awesome idea of my own and am very sceptical of many large charities. Ideally I'd like to find a small project where everyone is unpaid and focused on helping. Are there any such small organisations? Does anyone have an idea for a project/website/app that can help people in need that they would like me to work on or work with them on? I know this isn't a typical StackOverflow 2+2=? type question and some of you will be itching to delete it but considering the philanthropic nature of the IT industry (just look at S.O. itself) this is very relevant question to many developers either now or at some point in their careers. Given the recent events in Japan this question is particularly relevant with many people looking for ways they can help others with the skills/time that they have available. Really looking forward to reading your thoughts/answers on this, thanks guys
