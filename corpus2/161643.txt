I wanted to add timezone support to my blog app but got stuck with a design problem. Every post has a published_on field which stores the publication date in a timezone aware format (UTC converted to user's timezone). So far so good. But the permalink of a post is created from the publication date as well. It has the format: /year/month/day/slug. This of course is **not** timezone aware and must be the same for all users around the world. So I have to define a timezone to use for the **permalink**. There are three options which make sense:   * The author's timezone   * UTC   * The default timezone of the server. Which would be the most appropriate?
