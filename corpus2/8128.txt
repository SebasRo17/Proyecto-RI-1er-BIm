I want to bundle up a Mathematica package that I've written and distribute it as open source. It has a couple of dependencies that I'd like to automatically download independently from my package as well. Is there any sort of established Mathematica package manager and package distribution site? (I'm thinking along the lines of pip for Python, gem for Ruby, nuget for .NET, hackage for Haskell, that sort of thing.) I've seen Wolfram MathSource, and as near as I can tell its aim seems to be to collect various contributed packages from around the web into a central place, but it doesn't feel very active (maybe I'm wrong?).
