Given a binary search tree, I understand why I can use breadth-first and pre- order traversal to list the entries of the tree in such a way as to reconstruct the tree in the order in which its traversed. However if we now consider an AVL tree and we want to traverse the tree in such a way as to recreate the same AVL tree (similar as to what we did with the plain binary tree) then why does breadth first traversal always work and why does pre-order not work with this case given that it works for standard binary trees?
