Is there a "gallery" view of all the graphs available in `GraphData`? I realize that some graphs may not lend themselves to such representation (e.g. some may have so many nodes that their thumbnails would all be unrecognizable, and indistinguishable, dark blobs). But even a gallery limited to those graphs that lend themselves to such representation would be of great help. EDIT: the "gallery" does not need to be represented within Mathematica itself. A web page, PDF document, etc. would do just as well.
