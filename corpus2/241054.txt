I have a use case where I need to create say two javascript objects & use their properties in one another. eg -               var Object1 = {       settings: {        property1: 'someValue',        property2: 'someValue'       }     }          var Object2 = {       foreignProperty: Object1.settings.property1;     }      I wanted to know if its alright to use a reference object for settings if I know that I will be using the settings property a lot. eg-               var Object1Settings,         Object1 = {           settings: {           property1: 'someValue',           property2: 'someValue'         }     }     var Object1Settings = Object1.settings;          var Object2 = {       foreignProperty: Object1Settings.property1;     }      Is this approach acceptable in terms of right ways of coding & performance? Thanks
