Have you had any experience in which a non-IT person works with a programmer during the coding process? It's like pair programming, but one person is a non-IT person that knows a lot about the business, maybe a process engineer with math background who knows how things are calculated and can understand non-idiomatic, procedural code. I've found that some procedural, domain-specific languages like PL/SQL are quite understandable by non-IT engineers. These persons end up being co- authors of the code and guarantee the correctness of formulas, factors, etc. I've found this kind of pair programming quite productive, this kind of engineering-type users feel they are also "owners" and "authors" of the code and help minimize misunderstandings in the communication process. They even help design test cases.   * Is this practice common?   * Does it have a name?    * Have you had any similar experiences?
