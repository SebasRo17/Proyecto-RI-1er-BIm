I need to execute just few lines of PHP code on every single page of my website. This PHP code does not require more than 4MB memory. That is why i want to allocate just 4MB memory to all pages by using following code :               ini_set('memory_limit','4M');      Does it give any benfits in any of the following areas :   1\. Website speed   2\. Bandwidth optimization   3\. Optimizing server memory usage
