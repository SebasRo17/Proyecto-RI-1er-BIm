Implementing threading in a program is hard, yes, however why is it that some people will not implement them even when there is an obvious need for it. An example: Program has to load a dataset from a database, the thing to do would be to make the connection and get the data from the database in a worker thread and then load it into the GUI, leaving the GUI thread responsive for the user. But no, I've talked to people whom seem to think that threads are evil and bad and whatnot and one should avoid them at all costs. I've even heard that some class instructor advised against to use of threads and therefore did not want cover their use. WHAT??? With the hardware going into multi-core, I think that we need to understand threads better and not be afraid to use them. I find it a fascinating subject personally. So what are things you've heard about threading that are false?
