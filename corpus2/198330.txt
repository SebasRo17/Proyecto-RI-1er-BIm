The more I write code the more I realize that writing the code is not the hard part. The hard part is making sure all the dependencies are in order, there are no hard coded paths, that I don't have weird implicit library dependencies, that there is documentation on how to get it up and running, etc. Tools like vagrant, rake, chef-solo, and fpm definitely help me with some of those problems but there is almost always something that I overlook and when it comes time to deploy the code something almost always goes wrong. I'm also a little disheartened by how little most programmers care about making sure their code is easy to deploy. So how do people usually solve the last mile problem? How do you make sure your code is deployable with as little fuss as possible?
