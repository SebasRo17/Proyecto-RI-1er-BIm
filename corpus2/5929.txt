I want to use a distribution I have only aggregate statistics on, namely its CDF sampled at certain points. I would like to keep it "nonparametric" (remain noncommittal on the parametric form), but I need some interpolation over these points. Also, I would like to use a PDF of the distribution. So I would need an interpolation that is monotone and differentiable over a list. What is there to do? (FWIW: With `Interpolation[]`, only a first-order interpolation is monotone, but then there are non-differentiable breakpoints in the piecewise linear function.) Here is a list I would interpolate over: **EDIT** : This is the US taxable income distribution for 2009 which I manually extended with two endpoints to help it look like a CDF. This latter point might be silly, let me know how you'd do better.               {{0,0},{5000.,0.00373625},{10000.,0.0269361},{15000.,0.0621601},{20000.,0.121612},      {25000.,0.178247},{30000.,0.234482},{40000.,0.3516},{50000.,0.453972},{75000.,0.654898},      {100000.,0.78906},{200000.,0.952381},{500000.,0.991166},{1.*10^6,0.997134},      {1.5*10^6,0.998442},{2.*10^6,0.998977},{5.*10^6,0.999727},{1.*10^7,0.9999},{10000000000,1}}
