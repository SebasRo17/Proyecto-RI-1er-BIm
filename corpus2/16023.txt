I would like to create a chord using multiple instruments. This started as an attempt to explain music to a friend but my curiosity has taken over. I am familiar with the SoundNote function. I know that SoundNote can create a chord using the same instrument:               Sound[SoundNote[{"C4", "G3"}, 1, "Harpsichord"]]      And it can create a series of notes with different respective instruments:               Sound[{SoundNote["C", 0.5`, "Oboe"], SoundNote["G", 0.5`, "SynthVoice"], SoundNote["C5", 0.5`, "Organ"]}]      What I'm wondering is if there is a way to play more than one sound with specific notes at the same time.
