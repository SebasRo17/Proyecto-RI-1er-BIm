Currently I'm working on an basic application that has a 'tutorial mode'. Initially hints (bubbles with text) will be displayed above various ui elements, explaining how they work. Currently I have a main view which contains a hint object that can be updated (position, text, etc.) and I'm dispatching update events from the various views that need to display a hint. In most cases when the user click a hint, it disappears, but there are a few situations when the user must perform another action(like dragging-dropping an element, clicking another,etc.) to progress. Phew, that's the background in a nutshell. My main question is: Should there be dispatching events from various views and handle the hints centrally or should hints only be handled locally within each view ? What's the recommended approach ?
