In this problem is very difficult to analyze the roots s. Firstly I thought that the problem is in precision, but I am not sure. The criterion which I want to obtain is that one of these roots has a positive real part. Characteristic equation has the following form: $$\frac{2 \pi }{\int_{-\infty }^{\infty } \frac{1}{\text{D1}(k,s)} \, dk}+\text{a6} s^2+\text{k0}=0$$ The imaginary axis of the complex s-plane can be parametrized by conidering s=i*r (i=sqrt(-1)). So the equation has new form for consideration                 k0 = a6 r^2 - (1/(2 Pi)       NIntegrate[1/(       a1 a3 k^4 - a2 a4 (-k a5 + r)^2), {k, -\[Infinity], \[Infinity]}])^-1      where               a1 = 2*10^11;     a2 = 7.687*10^-3;     a3 = 3.055*10^-5;     a4 = 7849;     a5 = 500;     a6 = 70;     \[Alpha] = Sqrt[(a1 a3)/(a4 a2)];     c = Sqrt[k0/a6];          a5 > < Sqrt[4 \[Alpha] c];      The mapping rule follows from the characteristic equation, which should be rewritten to express the chosen parameter explicitly. Once the mapping is accomplished, a mapped line is obtained, which divides the parameter plane into domains with different number of roots s* possessing a positive real part. Every line is normally shaded from the side, which is related to the right-hand side of the imaginary axis of the (s)-plane now. Obviously, crossing a decomposition curve in the direction of the shading, one extra root with a positive real part is gained. This curve (rule) should be obtained for parameter r from -Infinity to +Infinity for discuss. So I need two separately diagrams for a5 > Sqrt[4 [Alpha] c] or a5 < Sqrt[4 [Alpha] c]. I am completely not sure how to obtain curves from the equation                 k0 = a6 r^2 - (1/(2 Pi)       NIntegrate[1/(       a1 a3 k^4 - a2 a4 (-k a5 + r)^2), {k, -\[Infinity], \[Infinity]}])^-1      presented here ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/urHhH.jpg) where N is number of roots in the region
