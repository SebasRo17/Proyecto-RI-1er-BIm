Here is another problem with Mathematica plots and PDF. I have Mathematica 9.0.1 on Mac OS X. I want to export my plots to PDF to include them in a LaTeX document. If I export the plot with the command `Export["test.pdf",plot]` I get inconsistent results. The PDF exported from OSX looks good in Preview, but the font is missing if I open it on Adobe Acrobat on Windows, and it is replaced by Adobe Serif MM. Here is `pdffonts` output:               name                                 type              emb sub uni object ID     ------------------------------------ ----------------- --- --- --- ---------     Mathematica1                         Type 1            yes no  no       8  0     Times                                TrueType          no  no  no      11  0      Finally, if I open the file exported in OSX with Preview and save it again, it looks good on both platforms. Here is the `pdffonts` output of the new file:               name                                 type              emb sub uni object ID     ------------------------------------ ----------------- --- --- --- ---------     AQZZRA+Mathematica1                  Type 1            yes yes yes     10  0     HPLGMT+Times-Roman                   TrueType          yes yes no       8  0      Is there a way I can get Mathematica to produce the same output as Preview? If not, is there a command line tool that can re-save the PDF file so that the fonts are embedded correctly?
