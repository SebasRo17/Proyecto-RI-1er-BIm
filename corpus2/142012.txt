I am building an iOS application, and I am planning to incorporate an AGPL 3.0-licensed library to it to provide some _extra (non-essential) functionality_. Iâ€™ve got a couple of questions regarding this:   1. Do I understand it right that this still obliges me to publish the source of my app open? If yes, does it have to be open to the general public, or only to those who have downloaded the app?   2. Does this allow me to distribute the app for a fee?
