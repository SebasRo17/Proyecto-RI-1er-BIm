I am new in programming. I have an array containing, let's say 20 elements and first I want to randomly select two elements from it and record them. Then I will select two elements from the array of twenty elements again and record them. The process continues, let's say 10 times and in these 10 draws, I do not want to repeat any of the two elements that I have already drawn. I used `RandomSample` to generate random numbers.               j = 0;     For[i = 0, i < 2, i++,       Yarray[j] = RandomSample[Range[8], 2];       Print[Yarray[j]];       j++;]
