Background: Consider the following graphics directive.                   EdgeForm[          Directive[Thickness[Large],           Dashing[{Small, Small}],           Opacity[0.1`],           RGBColor[0, 0, 1]]]      In a Manipulate I want to interactively change Thickness, Dashing, Opacity and Color of the edges of Polygons in a pattern. So, for each of them I will have to create a control. The EdgeForm is stored in Excel =as is=. So I will need to extract the values which will become the starting values for the controls out of the EdgeForm above, i.e.:                   Large,          {Small, Small},          0.1,          RBGColor [0,0,1]      for the four controls respectively. My strategy was to ToString[EdgeForm[ ...everything ] and then do string manipulations on them but that turned out to become a lot of ( messy, still not working ) code. Considering this is Mathematica ( I thought that ) there must be a simple way to get the values out of that EdgeForm. **Question: How to change the EdgeForm above to {Large, {Small, Small}, 0.1, RBGColor [0,0,1] }. Needless to say that the values change per pattern, i.e. Tiny, Large, etc.**
