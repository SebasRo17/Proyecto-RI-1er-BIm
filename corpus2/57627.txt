I'm making a small social networking web site for a specific university's students (where I study) and I'm concerned about security (access to the database). What should I do? What I have to check for last time until I went online? (Yeah, Facebook Facebook. Facebook don't have that community sense. You cannot find all your department mates on Facebook. You cannot see all foreign students on Facebook. You cannot hide your identity on Facebook while commenting, etc etc. Just please don't compare it with Facebook, we had a great _local_ social network until it went _public_ . * ))
