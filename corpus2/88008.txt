We're going to meet a potential new client today and between ourselves started discussing the need for a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and whether we need one at this juncture. In this case we don't think we'll be talking about technical specifics as it's an initial meeting about who we are. Is there any precedent on when is the right time for small ISVs to insist on NDAs and when perhaps the insistence might appear over the top and precious. All ideas welcomed, though in our case we're interested in UK law.
