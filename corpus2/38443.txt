I have noticed cases where `Line` produces dots in a graphics object when I think it shouldn't. The first of these is:               Line[{{0., 0.}}]      The second is:               Line[{{0., 0.}, {0., 0.}}]      Longer lists of same point do not produce dots. To see this evaluate               repeatPts [pt_, n_] := Line[ConstantArray[pt, n]]     Graphics[{Thickness[.125], repeatPts[{0., 0.}, #], repeatPts[{1., 1.}, #]},       ImageSize -> 50, Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> None, PlotRangePadding -> .3] & /@ Range[5]      ![Dots.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6IKI.png) Is this version or platform depended? I got the results shown above on with V9.0.1 running on OS X. Should it be considered a bug or a weird feature?
