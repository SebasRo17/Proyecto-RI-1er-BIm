I need to Manipulate a ListLinePlot using a parameter P. The problem is that this Curve is a ListLinePlot of a Transpose[{T,B}], in which T is a normal table and B is a list of minima got using FindMinimum in f[x]. This is a simplified code that contains my concern:               f[x_] := (b/a)*x^2 + (x^2/b)     Quiet[Xmin = Table[        FindMinimum[{f[x], a >= 1, b >= 1}, {a, b}], {x, 250, 310, 20}]];          T = Table[T, {T, 250, 310, 20}];     B = b /. Take[Xmin, All, {2}] // Flatten;     Transpose[{T, B}];          ListLinePlot[Transpose[{T, B}]]      I'm able to plot this ListLinePlot as it is presented in the code but the idea is to insert a parameter P, multiplying the constant "a", inside of f[x] (P varies from 1 - 50). When I just put this ListLinePlot correctly inside the Manipulate expression, setting P as a changeable parameter and also insert the parameter P, multiplying the constant "a", the routine is not able to output B and I get a list of errors. I really need B, so, is there any way to Manipulate it? The Manipulate code that is not working is this:               Manipulate[ListLinePlot[Transpose[{T, B}]], {P, 1, 50}]      But with this Manipulate code above is evaluated only if I change "a" for "a*P" in the f[x]. Thanks a lot!
