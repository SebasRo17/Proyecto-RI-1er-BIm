Prof. McClure, in the work "M. McClure, **Newton's method for complex polynomials.** A preprint version of a “Mathematical graphics” column from _Mathematica in Education and Research_ , pp. 1–15 (2006)", discusses how _Mathematica_ can be applied to iteration functions for obtaining the basins of attraction (or their fractal images). Below, I provide his code for the fractal image of the polynomial $p(z)=z^3-1$:               p[z_] := z^3 - 1;     theRoots = z /. NSolve[p[z] == 0, z]     cp = Compile[{{z, _Complex}}, Evaluate[p[z]]];     n = Compile[{{z, _Complex}}, Evaluate[Simplify[z - p[z]/p'[z]]]];     bail = 150;     orbitData = Table[        NestWhileList[n, x + I y, Abs[cp[#]] > 0.01 &, 1, bail],         {y, -1, 1, 0.01}, {x, -1, 1, 0.01}     ];     numRoots = Length[Union[theRoots]];     sameRootFunc = Compile[{{z, _Complex}}, Evaluate[Abs[3 p[z]/p'[z]]]];     whichRoot[orbit_] :=        Module[{i, z},        z = Last[orbit]; i = 1;       Scan[If[Abs[z - #] < sameRootFunc[z], Return[i], i++] &, theRoots];       If[i <= numRoots, {i, Length[orbit]}, None]      ];     rootData = Map[whichRoot, orbitData, {2}];     colorList = {{cc, 0, 0}, {cc, cc, 0}, {0, 0, cc}};     cols = rootData /. {       {k_Integer, l_Integer} :> (colorList[[k]] /. cc -> (1 - l/(bail + 1))^8),       None -> {0, 0, 0}     };     Graphics[{Raster[cols]}]      ![Newton-Raphson fractal](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rd9q2.png) My main question is here. He nicely obtained the fractal images on the complex plane, while it would be an interesting challenge to obtain these images on the Riemann sphere, e.g. ![Newton-Raphson fractal on the Riemann sphere](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jFPjV.jpg) It seems the complex plane in this case has been replaced by a sphere, but how? I will be thankful if someone could revise the code given above for obtaining such beautiful fractal images on the Riemann sphere. Any tips and tricks will be fully appreciated as well.
