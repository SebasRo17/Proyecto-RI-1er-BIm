I have a JSON-based data which contains many fields from a particular model. Any value from the list of fields can be null. I am trying to find the best object oriented way of parsing it and also it has to be light-weighted as it's a mobile application. PS: Want to avoid numerous "if-checks" Structure of JSON Data:               data=(                                 classId=""             classDesc=""             items=(                 {                     //Array of 50 Items                 },{                     //Array of 50 Items                 },{                     //Array of 50 Items                 }                );         },        //Remaining Items         );
