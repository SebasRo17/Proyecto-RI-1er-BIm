Are flag variables evil? Are the following kind of variables profoundly immoral and is it wicked to use them? > "boolean or integer variables that you assign a value in certain places then > down below you check then in orther to do something or not, like, for > example using `newItem = true` then some lines below `if (newItem ) then`"    I remember doing a couple of projects where I totally neglected using flags and ended up with better architecture/code; however, it is a common practice in other projects I work at, and when code grows and flags are added, IMHO code-spaghetti also grows. Would you say there are any cases where using flags is a good practice or even necessary?, or would you agree that using flags in code are... red flags and should be avoided/refactored; me, I just get by with doing functions/methods that check for states in real time instead.
