I am currently learning Javascript, and there is one element of the syntax that I can just not seem to nail down. That element is adding semicolons at the end of each line. I have learned Python and Ruby, and written a ton of both, so the lack of semicolons is stuck in my mind! Is there a way to drill that (or even any syntax, to make this more useful to future readers) into my brain?
