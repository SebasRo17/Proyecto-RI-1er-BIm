I am looking for a good way to **rate the expertise** in a particular **programming language**. The idea arose when I found the following article: Taking falsely all the credits? You don't know JavaScript. It lists, in a comprehensive way, **language features and concepts** of JavaScript. I wish there would be a list for every programming language. In particular I would be interested about:   * Java   * C   * Python   * C# / .NET   * C++   * JavaScript Any other language or technology would be also interesting. In a similiar question What's a good way to rate your own code skills the Programmer Competency Matrix was suggested. I think it's a good approach, but I think it's too generic. Do you know any other summaries of language concepts which could help to rate the programming language expertise?
