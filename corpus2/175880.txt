Often testing is regarded as a dynamic analysis of a software. Yet while writing my thesis, the reviewer noted to me that dynamic analysis is about analyzing the program behind the scenes - e.g. profiling and that it is not the same as testing because its "analysis" which looks inside and observes.   I know that "static analysis" is not testing, should we then separate this "dynamic analysis" also from testing? Some books do refer to dynamic analysis in this sense. I would maybe say that testing is a one mean of dynamic analysis? As for testing definitions: > IEEE 829 broadens the idea to “analyzing,” thus including “static testing.” > And ISTQB takes the full step and includes both “dynamic and static.” > Testing is both dynamic and static. So maybe it is just a matter of semantics? If testing is considered to be an analysis, then its both static and dynamic analysis is a testing approach.
