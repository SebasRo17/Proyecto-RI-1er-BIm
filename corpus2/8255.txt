I've run into some problems using `Factor` on polynomials with complex coefficient factors. Reading the documentation it looks like it only factors over the `Integers` by default. So I've found I can factor some polynomials with complex factors like this:               Factor[ poly, Extension -> I ]      For example `x^2+1` won't factor with just `Factor[x^2+1]` but it does factor properly when I add the imaginary unit extension. However another polynomial such as: $$8x^3-7x^2+10x-5$$ still won't be factorized even with the imaginary extension added. What am I missing here? How do I simply get `Mathematica` to completely factor any polynomial with complex factors I give it?
