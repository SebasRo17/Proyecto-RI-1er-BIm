I have a device that can measure different values over time, one sample per second. After one measurement run I can export the data in form of a CSV-file. One row per second with timestamp and about 20 columns (values). The question now is how to store these data masses to make the data accessable. I want to work with it using Matlab. I have for example 50 files of data, each representing one measurement run. Each containing around 120 tsd. samples of 20 values of type float, for example a temperature. It would be great if I could request all samples at the same temperature for example. So actually I am looking for a software that can handle and organize that data or a hint how (and what kind of) database to build. Thank you for your help!
