Why in some frameworks the logic layer is called "Model" whereas in some it is called "Service". Are they different from each other or just different by naming conventions? * * * UPDATE 1 The reason I'm asking is because in Zend Framework, a classical MVC framework, everybody uses the concept of Model. Now I'm learning AngularJS and it seems that the word Model disappeared and was replaced by the word service. What I noticed is that a service is more like a singleton that can be reused again and again (example: a REST client) whereas a model is more related to the data manipulations coming from the controller in the MVC pattern.
