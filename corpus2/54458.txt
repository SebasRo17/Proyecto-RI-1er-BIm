I have the following function to minimize for `a > 0`               f[a_?NumericQ] := Log[ Exp[ (a^2) * 6.47368e-07 + 0] +                             Exp[ (a^2) * 7.44746e-06 + 0] +                            Exp[ (a^2) * 8.59531e-07 + 0]] /a      `NMinimize` gives me:               NMinimize[{f[a], a > 0}, a]      > >     Minimize::nnum: -7 + 0.0541561 e    -6 + 0.0623024 e >     The function value 10.9333 Log[E + E -7 + 0.0719048 e ] is not a number >     at {a} = {0.0914636}. >   The error happens even without `?NumericQ`, but I found that specifying it could have helped, but not in this case. Given that I'm a complete beginner with _Mathematica_ , I'd love some hints about what I'm doing wrong and how to fix it.
