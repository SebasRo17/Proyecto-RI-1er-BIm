So I've been trying to evaluate the following integral in Mathematica 8.0 Student version:               opsnum[a_, \[Omega]_] := (c^5*(3*10^25))/\[HBar]*           NIntegrate[\[Rho][y, \[Omega]]/             Hubble[y, \[Omega]]*(1/Hubble[z, \[Omega]])^3, {y,              a, \[Infinity]}, {z, a, y}]      with                   Hubble[z_, \[Omega]_] :=       H0 Sqrt[\[CapitalOmega]M (1 + z)^3 + \[CapitalOmega]\[Gamma] (1 +            z)^4 + \[CapitalOmega]\[CapitalLambda] ((1 +             z)^(3*(1 + \[Omega])))]          \[Chi][a_, \[Omega]_] :=       NIntegrate[c/Hubble[z, \[Omega]], {z, a, \[Infinity]}]     \[Rho][a_, \[Omega]_] := (3*Matter[a, \[Omega]])/(      4 \[Pi]*(\[Chi][a, \[Omega]])^3)      My problem is that this refuses to converge, and gives me an `NIntegrate::inumr` error, due to the nested integral nature of the function. Furthermore, I cannot think of another definition for the function as it relies on the cube of an integral which has limits different from the limits of the total integrand, of which it is a part. Anyone got any ideas? I would be eternally grateful!
