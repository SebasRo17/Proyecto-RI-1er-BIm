A colleague of mine works as a consultant. He is recently asked to help a software development company to improve their processes. The company is aware of some of the issues, like the number of bugs or the fact that they can't release their lead product more often than once per year, but nobody there knows what to do. My colleague identified that they have a primitive in-house process which they call Scrum, but which isn't. My colleague wants to suggest moving to “the real Scrum”. If he does that, he will encounter two issues:   * Managers will reply that they already use Agile, and that it wasn't helpful.   * It would be particularly tricky¹ to explain both to the managers and to the CEO of the company that it was not the real Scrum which was used until now, but rather a mix between Scrumfall and Scrumbutt. What to do? * * * ¹ In this company, two of the three managers claim they know perfectly well Agile and Scrum and apply it flawlessly to their respective teams. Claiming that they know nothing about any of those two subjects would create a hard to handle situation. My colleague's role is also not only to give his opinion, but to apply the “good” methodology for the next three months within this company. Starting by claiming that managers are incompetent in this context is not a solution.
