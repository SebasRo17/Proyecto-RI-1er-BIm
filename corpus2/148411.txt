Our clients need to authorize our partners to release data to us. We can collect this data via a push/pull mechanism. Since our partners have never shared data before, they don't have OAuth implemented. What is the best way for clients to tell their service providers (our partners) to release data to us without having each partner bear the overhead of implement OAuth. Is there a standard practice for this sort of an authorization? Thanks!
