I am interested in knowing more about how ringtone download web services work. I do web programming in java, and i would like to make a web service that sends a ringtone to the user's mobile phone when the user sends a SMS to the web service.   * Is anyone familiar with this type of service?   * What do I need to be able to create somethig like that?   * Does the ringtone system get some profit for each SMS, or does the mobile company get all of it?
