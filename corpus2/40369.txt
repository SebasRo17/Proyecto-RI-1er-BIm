Say I have a density plot such as               DensityPlot[Sin[x]*Sin[y],{x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]      Is there a way to see a projection of this plot. For example is there a way to see a plot of the maximum values from x=-2 to x=2? Or perhaps the values from x=-2 to x=2 along the line y=0? Maybe a way to get the numerical values and plot it? Thanks! P.S. I am looking to do this from the plot, not setting y=0 and solving mathematically.
