I'm working on a project where I have to give users the ability to build their own tables, each user can create more than one table. (the type of all data is string). The user can create a table and specify what columns he wants inside it. What is the best way to do that:   1. to create databases dynamically   2. to have a table for tables (key,value ...).   3. something else Another issue is: is it better to separate my database into two, so one is for the internal use (users, accounts,....) and the other is for the tables of the users (or for the table of tables)?
