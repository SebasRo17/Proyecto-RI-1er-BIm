This simple task is giving me trouble. Suppose I'd like to take the output from               TraditionalForm[Integrate[x^2,x]]      and post-process it to append a vertical bar like $$ {x^3\over 3}\Bigg|_0^1 $$ or a set of left & right brackets like $$ \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^1 $$ I am trying to figure out the best way to _approach_ this problem. Is to convert the output to a string and then use `StringJoin`?
