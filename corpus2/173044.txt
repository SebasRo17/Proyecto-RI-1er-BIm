Are there any well-defined conventions when programming in PowerShell? For example, in scripts which are to be maintained long-term, do we need to:   * Use the real cmdlet name or alias?   * Specify the cmdlet parameter name in full or only partially (`dir -Recurse` versus `dir -r`)   * When specifying string arguments for cmdlets do you enclose them in quotes (`New-Object 'System.Int32'` versus `New-Object System.Int32`   * When writing functions and filters do you specify the types of parameters?   * Do you write cmdlets in the (official) correct case?   * For keywords like `BEGIN...PROCESS...END` do you write them in uppercase only? It seems that MSDN lack coding conventions document for PowerShell, while such document exist for example for C#.
