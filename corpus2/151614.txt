In IP agreement IP is define as below > Intellectual Property (whether or not patentable and whether or not made > during working hours) is defined as but not limited to: all product > specifications, developments, inventions, works of authorship, derivative > works, technologies, programs, systems, software, mobile applications and > other mobile programming interfaces, designs, methodologies, encryptions, > ideas, techniques, patents, formulas, processes, concepts, know-how and date > made or conceived or reduced to practice or developed during employment > period ,remain the property of XXXXXXX[COMPANY_NAME]XXXX or its affiliates. This is the first time I have seen any IP agreement. Isn't it too stringent? or its standard practice across industry?
