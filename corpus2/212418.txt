I work for a company whose point-of-sale service uses IIS servers tied to static IP addresses at each of our stores. My boss wants a better real-time stat tracker than what the point-of-sale service provides. I would like to connect to these servers from a central location and retrieve the data. If possible, I'd like to be able to do so from Python, PHP, or Ruby. What are some recommended approaches for doing so.
