This is the form of my list               list1 = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};     list2 = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};     list = {{list1, list2}};      I want to plot list1 and list2 in a ListPlot with Manipulate like this               Manipulate[ListPlot[list[[1,count]],PlotRange->{{0,10},All}],{count,{1,2->"Label 2"}}]      This works perfectly well. However if I want to label the SetterBar 1, too, like this               Manipulate[ListPlot[list[[1,count]],PlotRange->{{0,10},All}],{count,{1->"Label 1",2->"Label 2"}}]      There always occures the error Part::pspec: Part specification 1->Label 2 is neither a machine-sized integer nor a list of machine-sized integers. >> edit: I can't figure out how to solve this problem. I hope I posted this correctly, this is the first question I ask in this marvelous forum. Thanks for your help
