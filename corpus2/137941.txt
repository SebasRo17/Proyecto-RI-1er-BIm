"Extract Till You Drop" is someting I've read in Uncle Bob's blog, meaning that a method should do one thing alone be good at it. **What is that one thing?** When should you stop extracting methods? Let's say I have a login class with the following methods:                public string getAssistantsPassword()      public string getAdministratorsPassword()      These retrieve the respective accounts password in the database. Then:                public bool isLogInOk()      The method compares the password that has been called or selected, and sees if the password the user provided is in the database. Is this an example of "Extract Till You Drop"? **When will you know when you are doing too much of extracting?**
