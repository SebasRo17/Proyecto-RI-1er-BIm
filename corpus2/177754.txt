As a developer, can you tell your project manager that an application is _unworkable_? Or, if you're a project manager, how would you need this presented to you in order to be compelled? This isn't about "how to work on a poor project", it's assuming you cannot. I can provide an example of the situation if anyone thinks it's important, but I'm trying to avoid proposed solutions to "plodding through".
