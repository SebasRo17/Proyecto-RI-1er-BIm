I would like to find the best way in Perl to insert a char every N chars in a string. Suppose I have the following :               my $str = 'ABCDEFGH';      I would like to insert a space every two chars, so that I get:               my $finalstr = 'AB CD EF GH';      The innocent way would be:               my $finalstr;     while ($str =~ s/(..)//) {         $finalstr .= $1.' ';     }      (But the last space does not make me happy.) Can we do better? Is it possible using a single substitution pattern s///, especially to use that same string $str (and not using $finalstr)? * * * The next step: do the same but with text before and after patterns to be cut (and to be kept, for sure), say for example '<<' and '>>':               my $str       = 'blah <<ABCDEFGH>> blah';     my $finalstr1 = 'blah <<AB CD EF GH>> blah';     my $finalstr2 = 'blah << AB CD EF GH >> blah';  # alternate
