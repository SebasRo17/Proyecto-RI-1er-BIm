For example, Process P is listening to events E(A) and E(B), but to process either of the events, P needs the other event available too. Naively, when P receives either of the events, it will check if the other event is already received. If not, it can wait. But 1) this does not sound very efficient, especially when each process has many different types of events to process. 2) Also as the number of distributed processes increases to a large number, events are more tangled between processes, processes dies/restarts, etc. all these make the events handling more complicated. So I would like to know if there are any reference doc / model/ implementations for events handling under such a distributed computing environment?
