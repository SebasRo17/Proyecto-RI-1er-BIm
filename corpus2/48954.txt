I am stuck on a problem. I have outputs generated at every iteration of a do loop. However, I want to save the outputs in some other file format, like text file etc, in such a way that i must be able to use any output from iteration later. But the more I am searching about it, the more I am getting confused. Please guide in this respect. Like I read the options 'import', 'export', 'sow', 'reap', 'get' etc but i need simple description. Please guide me in this respect.   I quote the example as   I have some initial $a$ as $V0 +\Delta V*\Delta t/T$. Then I update the value of $\Delta t $ by having an increment of value $T/ntmax$ and define $b$ as $V0 +\Delta V*\Delta t/T$ . And then I have to multiply both $a$ and $b$ as $Exp[b]*Exp[a]$   I have to repeat this process until $\Delta t $ $/T$ reaches equal to $T$, as shown in the below loop.               Do[      a = V0 + ΔV*Δt/T;      Δt = Δt + T/ntmax;      b = V0 + ΔV*Δt/T;      f = Exp[b]*Exp[a],      {Δt, T/ntmax, T, T/ntmax}]      As during each iteration I will obtain the new value of $f$. I have to plot few values of $f$. However, I want to keep the record of all, so that I may be able to plot any one of them.
