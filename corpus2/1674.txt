i wonder apart from those very simple hello world apps, what other programs should i try developing for learning. i am entering uni next year and wonder what kind of programs will be developed in that environment. this is not really a language specific thing, but if you want to know what i use currently mainly   * windows: C#/WPF - i studied java/vb etc in poly but i think C# is the way to go, maybe even F#   * web: PHP/MySQL, Zend Framework/Doctrine, + HTML/CSS/JS(jQuery) of course. looking to try google app engine with python too.  for now, i am thinking of   * todo lists   * apps that integrate with api eg. twitter/tumblr which i use   * text editor - i am currently trying to develop a text editor that uses markdown and generates html files for viewing (link to blog entry). not very pratical after i started developing it. cos when editing theres no formatting and in HTML format, i cannot edit directly    * blog software (for web)
