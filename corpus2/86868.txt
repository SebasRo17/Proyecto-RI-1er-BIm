While I have plenty of project management "booksmarts" and a handful of PM experience, I don't seem to have enough experience to get the sort of job I want. Since "I read another PM book/blog today" doesn't really count, I was thinking I could find some free/open source software (FOSS) projects who are looking for/hiring project managers or developers and see if there was anything I could volunteer for. Does anyone know of any FOSS employment sites where I might be able to find such projects? Something similar to careers.stackoverflow.com. I know I could just go to sourceforge/freshmeat and look around, but I was hoping to find some site that fills this need (and if any such sites exist, my google-fu is apparently VERY weak at finding them).
