I was wondering if it is possible to have Mathematica generate all graphs with a given number of edges and nodes (and possibly restricting the adjacencies) and draw them I know that there are some commands in Mathematica but I don't quite seem to find this particular one if it exists. For the physicists among you: I'm basically looking for a way to generate all possible Feynman diagrams at 4 loops given only cubic interaction for 1 or 2 external particles excluding internal bubble graphs :)
