As noted by kguler the Front End option: `MessageOptions -> "MaxMessageCount"` does not appear to have any affect on the number of times a Message is repeated before `General::stop` is issued and that particular Message is suppressed. I would like to know if supposed to have this effect but is broken, or if it does something else entirely. I cannot find any documentation for this Option, and I cannot find any examples of its use either here or in the MathGroup archives.
