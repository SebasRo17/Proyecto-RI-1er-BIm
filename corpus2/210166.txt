I will understand if you find this is more a discussion than a technical question and if you close the topic (then, where would be an appropriate place to discuss about that? thank you in advance). The question : how do you decide between improving the user interface with a great design or adding more and more technical features? I would like to meet people interested in Windows coding beautiful user interfaces in order to improve an existing (very powerful but not good- looking) open-source project, which has a lot of potentiality! I know this is probably not the appropriate place for such a question, but maybe you would know a better place?
