http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdarg/va_list/ According to the above link, `va_list` is an argument or parameter used in some macros - `va_start`, `va_arg`, `va_end`. These macros are present in the `stdarg.h` file. I know that `va_list` can hold multiple values but what kind of an entity is `va_list`? My question is what is the underlying mechanism behind `va_list`? How is it able to hold multiple values? (For example, an array can hold multiple values and the mechanism behind it is multiple memory locations referenced by subscript values. Array is a predefined data structure present in C.) My second question is where is `va_list` defined?
