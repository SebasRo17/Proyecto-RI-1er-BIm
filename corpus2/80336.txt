Following up my previous question I wonder if `resumable exceptions` make any sense. It looks like nobody uses them in `Java`. Don't they use `resumable exceptions` because of Java limitations or just because they don't really need them? Suppose, I want to create a file in a directory, which should exist but does not. I would probably prefer use a `resumable exception` (i.e. throw an exception, catch it and create the directory, and resume the execution) instead of testing if the directory exists every time I create a file. Does it make sense in general ?
