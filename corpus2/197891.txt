Is there a way to show and save all "final" definitions entered into a Scheme REPL into a text file? Say, if I have defined in the REPL:                   (define (increase x) (+ 1 x))         (define (multbytwo x) (* 3 x)) ; let us say this was an error         (define (multbytwo x) (* 2 x))      I want to save this into an .scm-file with the content:                   (define (increase x) (+ 1 x))         (define (multbytwo x) (* 2 x))        * i.e. the multbytwo function that got defined erraneously shall be "forgotten" due to re-definition. Is this possible?
