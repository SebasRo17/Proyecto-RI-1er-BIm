I make a `Polygon` with size of {width=0,length=50,height=30}; I want to overlap `Image` on `Polygon` at position {width=0,length=25,height=15}. For this purpose I wrote some code: myImage= ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6LF9n.jpg)                    Show[Rasterize[Show[Graphics3D[Polygon[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 30}, {0, 50, 30}, {0, 50, 0}}],                                     Lighting -> {LightBlue}, Boxed -> False                                        ](*Graphi3D is closed here*)                             ](*Show is closed*),                         "Image",Background -> None, ImageSize -> {300,300}                        ](*RasterSize is closed here*),                Graphics[Inset[Image[myImage(*its a variable*), ImageSize -> {50, 50}],Scaled[{25, 15}]]]             ](*Show is closed here*)      After evaluation of the above code I faced two problems   1. Graphics3D is not rotated,   2. `Image`is not overlapped, I want to overlap `Image` at a specific position on `Polygon` and if we have rotated `Polygon` automatically that overlapping `Image` was also rotated.
