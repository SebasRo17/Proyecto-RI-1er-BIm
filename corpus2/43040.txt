I want to get continuous point between two equations. My equations are:               To[x_] := 2 c1 Cosh [x Sqrt[((f0 - b g0)/q)]] + g0/(f0 - b g0);               Tu[x_] := 10 Exp[-m x];      I try to find c1 and m constants which are in terms of g0. I have boundary conditions which are; > >     T = Tu   @ x = +L/2 >   >     D^2 k T'[x] = Du^2  ku Tu'[x]     @ x = + L/2 >   So, I have two uknown "c1,m" and two boundary conditions for single point. It should be continuous at L/2. Actually boundary conditions for +- L/2 ( because cosh is symmetric, but I assume m is positive , so just for positive part of boundary) Like that plot,for example, he had found Tu= 10.3 e^-598(x-0.005), it is continuous at 0.5 mm with cosh function. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GxDDd.png) In the same manner, it should be obtained thanks to boundary conditions. Then I applied boundary conditions in order to find "c1,m" to be continuous at L/2.               Solve[g0/(f0 - b g0) + 2 c1 Cosh[1/2 L Sqrt[(f0 - b g0)/q]] -         10 E^(-((L m)/2)) == 0, c1]          {{c1 -> -((         E^(-((L m)/2)) (-10 f0 + 10 b g0 + E^((L m)/2) g0) Sech[           1/2 L Sqrt[(f0 - b g0)/q]])/(2 (f0 - b g0)))}}      c1 is okay, then for finding m I applied derivative boundary condition,               Solve[2 c1 Sqrt[(f0 - b g0)/q]          Sinh[1/2 L Sqrt[(f0 - b g0)/q]] dia^2 k - (-10 E^(-((L m)/2))           m Du^2 ku) == 0, m]      And program gave error as:               S`olve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Solve.`      How can I get c1 and m in terms of g0 ? When I obtain c1 and m in terms of g0, constant temperature condition will be used for g0:               int=Integrate[To[x],{x,-L/2,L/2}]          NSolve[int=220,g0]
