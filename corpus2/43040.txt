I'm currently working on my thesis, and I'm looking for an/some online medical image processing grand challenge(s). I already know this site but I need a challenge which has microscopic image dataset like cells, chromosomes, bacterias, viruses etc with classification or recognation objective. Like karyotyping. Maybe someone is working on this field or his university made a challenge what I'm looking for, and can help me.
