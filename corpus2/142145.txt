My question is primarily concerned with making a CV. Normally under the Language section we list the individual programming Languages we've used. For example, C#, C++, PHP. Under the Platform section we can list the various operating systems and devices. Under which category would Web Services/Windows Services fall? My point is these are not platforms by themselves and surely they aren't a language. Is there any common term that can be used to describe these?
