When you read C, C#, Java, Python, PHP and many other programming languages all the syntax is written in English. Simple code like this               if (X+1 > 4) {     }     while (A == true) {     }      Is written in English even if the programmer's native language is something else. Would it not be more effective to allow the programmer to use their own native language in the source code, like this (my bad Spanish so forgive me if it's wrong)               si (X+1 > 4) {     }     mientras (A == verdadero) {     }      There is no technical reason why a compiler or parser should be _stuck_ with it's syntax hard coded. Any developer who has done internalization knows there are many easy ways to support other spoken languages. You can run most IDE platforms in different languages. Yet, the programming language the developer is using is stuck in English. Why have none of the major languages added support for language packs?
