In my JSP web application, I want to redirect sample users to a different page from the real users. Currently we do something like               if((user.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("Sample")) ...      This is (a) hardcoded and (b) executed for each normal user as well. Is there a better way to handle this logic? I am loathe to redirect these users via Javascript validation - which is one of the suggestions given internally
