I am wondering how to test .aspx.cs and .ascx.cs code behind. Can I use unit testing and if so how? Are there alternatives that will help test the functions in the code behind files? I don't know how to mock the page or control. I would like to try to apply tdd methodology but I don't know how to unit test the code behind. Do you setup tests for the code behind or move the code to alternate files that are easier to test. Is moving the code out of the code behind a better practice? Also, how would you go about unit testing the code behind files?
