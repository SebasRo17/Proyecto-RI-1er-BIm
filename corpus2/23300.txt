I'm trying to write Mathematica code to use Kramers-Kronig on a csv file with 2 columns. Column 1 is h(eV). It goes from 0 to 6, in increments of 0.1. Column 2 is alpha (cm^-1). For some reason, my code just outputs a blank graph. Can someone please tell me what's wrong with it? This is the equation I'm trying to implement (thanks J.M. for doing the latex) $$n_r(\hbar\omega)-1=\frac{c\cdot h}{2\pi^2}P\int_0^\infty \frac{\alpha(\hbar\omega^\prime)}{(\hbar\omega^\prime)^2-(\hbar\omega)^2}d(\hbar\omega^\prime)$$ The reason I posted on this forum is that my code is based on the code from another topic on this site (Update: wrong link, see comments below)               c = 300000000;     data = Import["kk.csv", "CSV"];     column1 = data[[All, 1]];     column2 = data[[All, 2]];     Delete[column1, 1];     Delete[column2, 1];          output :=        1 + (c PlanckConstant)/(2 pi^2)          NIntegrate[column2/(column1^2 - omega^2), {omega, (column1)^2, 0, infinity},            Method -> "PrincipalValue", Exclusions -> Automatic]          Plot[output, {column1, 0, 6}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]
