How can the contents of the Palettes menu be refreshed (preferably programmatically) without restarting the Front End? When droppping a new palette notebook into `$UserBaseDirectory/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Palettes`, it will appear in the Palettes menu after restarting the Front End. How can I make it appear there without restarting the front end? When using the `Palettes -> Install Palette...` feature, this refresh happens automatically, so I assume it must be possible. The source of the installation dialog notebook is available in `$InstallationDirectory/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/SystemResources`, but I did not manage to figure out how it works yet.
