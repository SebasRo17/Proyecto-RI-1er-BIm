**A little background** : I am working at a large company, using Windows XP and coding Winforms in VB6/VB.Net and some WebForms in VB.Net (95% maintenance code). I have one 4:3 19" screen. A more modern version of Windows isn't happening soon, neither is any greenfield work by the sounds of it! I wasn't told about any of this when I joined the company, I was mislead to think I would be working with much more up to date technologies and frameworks. I have much more up to date experience from previous jobs, both with more modern frameworks and other programming languages, and when I am catching up with developer friends from other companies all I hear about is how they are using the latest ASP MVC framework, or Vagrant/Ruby on Rails/etc and I am getting the green eyes! I could sort myself out with another job pretty quickly, but I feel as though I should give this one more of a chance. **The question** : I am trying to convince myself that my current job isn't that bad. So what are the advantages to this sort of role? Are there advantages to working with outdated technologies? Maybe some techniques that I wouldn't pick up working with more modern ones? Or is this the sort of place where careers go to die, and I should get out while I still have my soul?
