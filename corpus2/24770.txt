I have a binary data file in format 212, and I want to import the file into _Mathematica_. How do I read or import binary format 212? I almost have no direct experience of working with any binary format. I would appreciate your help. Here is the link to the data file: physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/100.dat The specification of the format is "Each sample is represented by a 12-bit twoâ€™s complement amplitude. The first sample is obtained from the 12 least significant bits of the first byte pair (stored least significant byte first). The second sample is formed from the 4 remaining bits of the first byte pair (which are the 4 high bits of the 12-bit sample) and the next byte (which contains the remaining 8 bits of the second sample). The process is repeated for each successive pair of samples." From the following link: http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/signal-5.htm#sect9
