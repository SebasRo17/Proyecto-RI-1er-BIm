Here is an integral I've been studying in my research and I've just realized that Mathematica $8.0$ is unable to correctly compute it. I have 2 simple questions to ask: $1)$. Is my code below correct?                             Integrate[x^(a - 1)/(1 - x) - c x^(b - 1)/(1 - x^c), {x, 0, 1}]      $2)$. Are the newer Mathematica versions able to correctly compute it (how about W|A)? Please do not provide with mathematical solutions, I like to attend this part on my own.
