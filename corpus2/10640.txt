I'm looking for a function that finds the index of the zero-crossing points of a list. Before I go making my own subroutine to do this, I was wondering if anyone knows of any built-in Mathematica function for it. Example of what I want:               list = {-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,3,1,-2,-4,8,9,10};     ZeroCrossing[list] returns: {3,10,12}      Thanks, EDIT: Per whuber's suggestion, I'm adding my findings to the initial question, instead of just in a solution. I've checked LabVIEW (the other language I know well), and it considers "Bounces" ({1,0,2}, {-2,0,1}) and duplicates ({1,0,0,2}) to be zero-crossings. It outputs a T/F value for each array index. Example:               ZeroCrossing[{1,0,2}]     (* Returns: {F,T,T} *)     ZeroCrossing[{1,0,0,2,3}]     (* Returns: {F,T,T,T,F} *)
