I've got a file such as this:               #ifndef STDINCLUDE     #define STDINCLUDE          #include <memory>     #include <stdexcept>          #endif      I want this file to be included in every header file, because I use stuff from those headers so much. Is it preferable to include this via compiler options (`-I stdinclude.hpp`), or should I physically include them in each header? (`#include <stdinclude>`). Note that I am attempting to be cross-platform- minded. I use cmake to serve atleast Unix and Windows.
