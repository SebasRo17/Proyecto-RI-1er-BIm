I just got started on some web development, and got my feet wet by creating a basic facebook app using Django. I am thinking of publishing the app, and consequently now need a development app that I could make subsequent changes to and roll them out to the production app. I'm completely new to this, and would be really thankful if someone could guide me on how I could go about this, and what the best practices are. (I also plan on letting my friend contribute to the app, so I would need to integrate git or some other vcs in the process right?) Thanks!
