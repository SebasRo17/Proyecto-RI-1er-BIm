When I execute the following,               Integrate[ Exp[-w^2 + I w^3], {w, -∞, ∞}]      I get > >     (2 E^(2/27) BesselK[1/3, 2/27])/(3 Sqrt[3]) >   which agrees with the result obtained from `NIntegrate`, which is `1.38811`.   However, when I execute               Integrate[ Exp[ -a w^2 + b I w^3], {w, -∞, ∞}]      I get > >     ConditionalExpression[ 0, b ∈ Reals && Re[a] > 0] >   which evaluates to `0` when `a = 1` and `b = 1`. This is obviously wrong. The integral itself has no convergence issues, as the integrand is simply a Gaussian multiplied by a modulus-one third-order chirp factor, which clearly converges when integrated over the real line.   Why does _Mathematica_ give an incorrect answer for the second integral?
