As a research scientist, I divide my code broadly into (1) Cohesive projects and (2) one-off scripts that perform an isolated task. I manage code from category (1) using a DVCS like git or hg in tandem with github and bitbucket and this works quite well for me. I would like to use a DVCS for category (2) and I am looking for suggestions on a good strategy to do so. The problem is that all of these scripts are scattered throughout my file system, usually living in a directory related to the data that they work on. It doesn't make sense to have a repo for each script as this would totally clutter my github/bitbucket accounts. On the other hand having one massive repo with random scripts seems like a mess keeping track of where each script contained in the repo is suppose to operate, and giving them descriptive names might be difficult given their specificity. Does anyone have experience managing random scripts in a sensible way that works well for them using a version control system? Suggestions would be most appreciated.
