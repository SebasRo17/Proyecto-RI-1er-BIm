**Is there, somewhere, a freely usable/accessible script, source file, or whatever, that is able to measure the compliance of a given C++ compiler?** For example, the Acid3 test for browsers: http://acid3.acidtests.org/ The results I dream of would be a global percentage note (or multiple notes, one for each standard, e.g. , c++98, c++11, c++14, etc.), and then detailed tests with "success" or "failure" for each of them. _Background: I had a discussion at work about boost and some challenged compilers. My interlocutor spoke about boost being an academic project, because it won't work in major C++ compilers, and me answering that mentally challenged compilers should not count. Being able to measure with code the actual conformance of a compiler would help both in evaluating the compiler, and discovering the "corner cases" that should be avoided in cross-platform code compiled with them._ ### Edit: 2013-06-22 Not an answer, but apparently, the C++ committee is working on the subject: > _**SG10, Feature Test:** Clark Nelson (Intel).
