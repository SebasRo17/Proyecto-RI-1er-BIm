So, last semester I had an Information Systems course where we were supposed to create a typical CRUD site. We were given a couple of Use Cases and from then on we created Dataflow Diagrams that were used to design our database. I've been looking around on the net, but I'm having the impression that people nowadays rarely use DFD's - at least so it seems. Is it just an impression of mine, or are they actually used?
