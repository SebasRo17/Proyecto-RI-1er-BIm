Consider the following code in C:                   if(34)               if(0)                   printf("Stat1");         else             printf("Stat2");      Here,the first **if** condition is true,while the second **if** condition is false.So I assumed,that control should **NOT** pass over to the _else_ block,as there are no parentheses enclosing both the 2nd **if** and _else_ statements together. But when I compiled it in GCC compiler,the output was : **_Stat2_**   This means that the code compiled in a similar fashion as the following code:                     if(34)           {             if(0)                   printf("Stat1");             else                 printf("Stat2");         }        I am unable to understand why the compiler treats both the above pieces of code in the same way.Please explain.Thanks. PS-Please ignore the indentation,I wrote it that way to show my line of thought about how the code should run.
