I have a basic question but i cant seem to find an answer for it. How do i draw a rectangle in mathematica with either clockwise or counterclockwise arrow heads. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yGSqD.jpg) In this picture i know two points i.e. (xmin,ymin) and (xmax,ymax). I want to stepwise quench my system and show it in this picture and hence many rectangles between min and max. Rectangle command doesnt seem to provide an answer. And i want to do it with very many points, hence couple of answers that are available in forum are not so useful.               (-1+X+1/(1/3+(-3.+3 X)/(3 (1.*10^-18+4.5*10^-12 (2+X)+2.59808*10^-9 Sqrt[4.*10^-12-4 (-1+X)^3+1.*10^-6 (8-(-20+X) X)])^(1/3))+333333. (1.*10^-18+4.5*10^-12 (2+X)+2.59808*10^-9 Sqrt[4.*10^-12-4 (-1+X)^3+1.*10^-6 (8-(-20+X) X)])^(1/3)))/X      This is the plotted function f. Now i want to select two `X` values say `X=1.1` and `X=3` and divide interval into N parts `X = {X1, X2, X3, X4, X5}` and directed rectangle between each of the two consecutive values. Because i cant do it in mathematica i drew it in paint and it looks something like this with clockwise arrows for each rectangle. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDOzR.jpg) Thanks, Nitin
