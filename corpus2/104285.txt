I was wondering if it is wise or advisable to send over a large amount of source code of one's application for debugging and error solving purposes, I'm working on an iOS app that I hope to release to the App Store and am seeking help on Stack Overflow and I'm tempted to send over a large amount of the code so someone (they requested it) can help me. Would you recommend sending over a significant portion of your app to someone for debugging purposes?
