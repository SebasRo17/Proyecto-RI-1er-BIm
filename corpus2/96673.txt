In business they say that to succeed > "Pick one or two things and do them very well". This is the antithesis of the modern programmer. We are exposed to a constant stream of changes in business, technology, tools and everything else. There are a handful of guys lucky enough to concentrate on one core technology, say C#...then blog about it, be an expert at it. But all in all, knowing C# well (but no other technology) + 50 cents will buy you a Coke. So, are we all doomed to miserable customers and generally miserable careers? Or, is there some way to succeed despite the "law of business"?
