Suppose I have a variable `var1`, a function `MyFunction`, and a graphic `SomePlot`. I remember seeing a feature, which returned information about a particular object (either it was in Mathematica or in Python, but I don't recall the exact form or place in which I read about it). Suppose it was in a form `objects_name?`, for example:               var1?      would return: `a variable, var1 = 4` etc.               MyFunction?      would return: `a function, MyFunction[#1,#2,...] = ...` etc.               SomePlot?      would return: `2d plot...` etc. Is there something like that in Mathematica? I suppose there is, but I wasn't able to skillfully enter a proper search query in the Documentation nor in Mathematica.SE...
