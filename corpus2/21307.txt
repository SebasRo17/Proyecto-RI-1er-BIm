To install a new package on one's machine, one first downloads and unpacks the package into the `$BaseDirectory/Applications` directory. The tutorial Installing NewAddons of Version 5.2 then recommends one go to Menu > Help and click on the Rebuild Help Index menu item. However, the tutorial was written for the version 5.2. S0 now I cannot find the Rebuild Help Index item under the Menu > Help. What should I do instead in version 9.0.1.0?
