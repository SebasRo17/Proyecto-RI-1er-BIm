How can I make definitions inside `ParallelTable` to use them outside? For example, if I execute:               ParallelTable[a[i] = i, {i, 1, 3}]      and after that, I try to access the value of `a[1]`, I don't get `1` as I'd expect. Is there a way to make definitions inside `ParallelTable` so that I can access to them outside? Note that what I want to do is more sophisticated than the trivial example above. Though there would probably be a way to do it without making definitions inside `ParallelTable`, it would really make my life easier if I could do it.
