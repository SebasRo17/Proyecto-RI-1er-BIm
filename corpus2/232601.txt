http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/helloturtle.html I'm stuck on question 3. Give three attributes of your cellphone object. Give three methods of your cellphone. This is just a intro question. We haven't created a cellphone class, so I don't know how to instantiate a cellphone object yet (Is this the right lingo?). Can someone help me with what are looking for? How do I find the properties and methods of the cellphone object? Is the question just asking for possible future properties of my cellphone? Is it just assuming that I will create some code that will allow me to change the properties of my phone? So all I need to do is list 3 properties of my cellphone like color, brand, and length? Is that it? Oh, and possible methods would be cell number dial, web browser address, and address book addition? Is that it? If so, please upvote this so I can ask questions again in stackexchange.
