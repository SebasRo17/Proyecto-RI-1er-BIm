Is `else while` without intervening braces considered "safe" maintenance wise? Writing `if-else` code without braces like below...               if (blah)         foo();     else         bar();      ...carries a risk because the lack of braces make it very easy to change the meaning of the code inadvertently. However, is below also risky?               if (blah)     {         ...     }     else while (!bloop())     {         bar();     }      Or is `else while` without intervening braces considered "safe"?
