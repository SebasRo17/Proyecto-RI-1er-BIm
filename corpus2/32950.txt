I have an expression               2^n / Sum[ 2^i Binomial[ n - i - 1, 2n/3 - 1], { i, 0, n/3}]      > >     2^n / ( Binomial[ -1 + n, -1 + (2 n)/3] Hypergeometric2F1[ 1, -(n/3), 1 > - n, 2]) >   I would like to find if there is an exact asymptotic expression for this for large $n$.   I suspect it is something like $\;\sqrt{n}\;\;1.06^{\;n}\quad$ from numerical experiments.   Is it possible to work out it out exactly using _Mathematica_?
