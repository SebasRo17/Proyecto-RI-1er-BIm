**Edit:** As a lot of you have pointed out, efficient can mean a lot of things. I guess when I say that the device 'requires efficient programming', I mean that the device does not have lots of memory or a very high CPU clock rate, and therefore needs to be programmed with these limitations in mind. **Original Question:** Sometimes, to train themselves, athletes will work in higher altitude places to workout. This is because there is less air, meaning working out is much more difficult. Once athletes have gotten used to exercising in these conditions, they find doing physical work in normal altitude places much easier. I want to do this same thing, except with software development, and more specifically, game development. I want to find some system with a low amount of RAM (in the kilobytes), low CPU clock speed, and few registers. I figure learning to program games on this kind of system would be very useful in teaching me to write efficient code. Also, it would be very fun :) The systems that I have thought about programming are the old Nintendo ones; GBA, NES, SNES. But I have learned the hard way that obtaining these, then obtaining the flash cards for them are very difficult, and on the border of being illegal. So, my question is is there a crummy device that will teach me to write efficient code that is still out there and being sold? I would like it to be a _physical_ device, looking at my programs run on physical machines would be a lot more satisfying then watching it on an emulator, and also, emulators can be buggy.
