I'm trying to implement a phone number based login and not sure if I should ask the users for full number, i.e country code + number or just the number. What I have in mind so far:   * Attempt optimistic login using whatever number user gives.   * Most likely, it'll come back with a single user match.   * In case there is a collision, throw an error (and show some helpful clue to the user asking them to enter full number) I guess this is a simplistic approach with minimum friction and complexity (as opposed to IP detection, geography based resolution etc.).
