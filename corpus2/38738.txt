Is there a way to force getting the numerical values of `WindowMargins` instead of `Automatic` for a window? For example let say I want to create a new Notebook that is $62$ pixels below and $62$ pixels to the right of the current `EvalutaionNotebook`. If I run the following it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't depending on the window position on the current screen.               x = CurrentValue[EvaluationNotebook[], "WindowMargins"];     NotebookPut[Notebook[{        Cell["Some text.", "Text"]}],      WindowMargins -> {        {x[[1, 1]] + 62, Automatic},        {Automatic, x[[2, 2]] + 62}        }      ]      For example sometimes the expression throws an error and results in the following because _Mathematica_ is returning a different answer.                {{131, Automatic}, {Automatic, 62 + Automatic}}
