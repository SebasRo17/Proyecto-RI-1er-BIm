I currently have a recursion done in 3D. At the moment, I am able to manipulate the points, but I cannot use "Joined->True" to connect them Currently this is what I have               z[1, t_] := {1, 1, 1};     A3[t_] := {{1, -t, 0}, {t, 1, -t}, {0, t, t + 1}}     W[t_] := Inverse[(IdentityMatrix[3] + A3[t])];     z[n_Integer, t_] /; n > 0 := W[t].z[n - 1, t];          Manipulate[      ListPointPlot3D[Table[z[n, t], {n, 1, 10}], Mesh -> Full,        Joined -> True, PlotRange -> All, InterpolationOrder -> 1], {t, 0,        1}]      Any idea on how to connect the points?
