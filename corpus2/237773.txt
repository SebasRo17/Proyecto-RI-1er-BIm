I was thinking to make some jQuery functions that will use ajax to control mysql. The whole idea is to make separate files of PHP (e.g query.php, addRow.php, update.php and delete.php) provide data to them via the `GET` variables like `query.php?sql=SELECT * FROM table` and then control them with jQuery AJAX functions that I'll make later. Expected code:               $(element).click(function (e) {         mysql.query("DELETE row FROM table WHERE name = 'John Doe'");     });      And then it'll send query through AJAX and the query will be performed.   So the problem is **SECURITY** . I mean anyone can just change javascript from browser's inspector or use console to control my databases. What can be done for this problem. Is there anyway to not let anyone change elements in the browser console. If not is there **ANYWAY** to overcome this security problem?
