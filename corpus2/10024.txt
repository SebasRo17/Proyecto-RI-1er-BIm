Below first case which gives particular solutions of an OED correctly:               ClearAll[soln];                            (* case 1 *)     soln[a_?NumericQ] :=      soln[a] =      DSolve[{y''[t] + y[t] == Sin[t], y[0] == a, y'[0] == 0}, y[t],       t];          res1  =  Grid[     Partition[      Table [soln[i][[1, 1, 2]], {i, 0, 2, 1}] // FullSimplify , 1],       Frame -> All]       As the OED is manipulated elsewhere in my notebook I need to rewrite the above code using an assignment for the equation:                ClearAll[solp];                                       (* case 2 *)      eqd := {y''[t] + y[t] == Sin[t], y[0] == a, y'[0] == 0};      solp[a_?NumericQ] := solp[a] = DSolve[eqd, y[t], t];           res2  =        Grid[Partition[       Table [solp[i][[1, 1, 2]], {i, 0, 2, 1}] // FullSimplify , 1],       Frame -> All]      However this time I only get the general solution with the particular solutions left unevaluated for the arbitray value "a". What's wrong here? I checked that it is possible to use an assignement for the equation given to DSolve but after rewriting the first case like that:               solq = DSolve[eqd, y[t], t] ;                 (* case 3 *)     res3  =  Grid[     Partition[      Table [solq[[1, 1, 2]] /. a -> i, {i, 0, 2, 1}] // FullSimplify ,      1], Frame -> All]        res3 == res1       Why is it OK here and not in case 2? Thanks
