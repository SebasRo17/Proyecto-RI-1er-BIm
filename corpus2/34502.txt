I'd like to write my own indicators to use with functions like `TradingChart`. From the context, it's clear that one needs to write a function whose parameters provide access to the underlying list of `"OHLC"` bars. Also, I don't know whether these indicator funtions are called after every bar is seen or just once. If the latter, then the list is sufficient but if the former, then there has to be another parameter that lets you know where you are.
