This is probably an extremely simple question. I have a manipulate that sets variables used to define an offset, amplitude, frequency and phase of a trigonometric function.               Manipulate[       Module[{Vac,Vdc, ω, ϕ, f},         Vac = ctrlVac;                      (* AC Voltage *)         Vdc = ctrlVdc;                      (* DC Offset *)         f = ctrlf;                          (* Frequency *)         ω = 2 π f;         ϕ = ctrlPhi;                        (* Phase Offset *)         gFunc = ctrlgFunc;                  (* Function *)         Plot[ Vdc + Vac  gFunc[ ω t + ϕ],{t,0, 0.4}]],       {{ctrlgFunc,Sin,""},{Sin,Cos, Tan, Cot }},Delimiter,       {{ctrlVac,1.5,Subscript["V","ac"]}, -10,10},       {{ctrlVdc, 0.5, Subscript["V","dc"]}, -1,1},Delimiter,       {{ctrlf, 10, "Frequency"}, 0.001,100},       {{ctrlPhi, 0, "ϕ"}, 0, 2 π},       ControlPlacement->Left, Paneled->True]      I would like to use the `Manipulate` as an editor that sets the values of the variables in the code snippet above and then passes them on as parameters to a function along with other sets of variables. Is there a way to add a button to save the current values to a dataset?
