In the answer for one question someone wrote that `assembly is not a language, it's a process`. I tend to agree, since the assembly "language" is dependent on the architecture it will run on, which may differ quite a bit from one CPU to another. So if you've written assembly for one architecture, does that mean you can include it in the CV under merely `assembly` along with the other programming languages? Or do you explicitly say that you've written assembly for that particular architecture? **EDIT:** Changed 'dabbled' to 'written'. English isn't my native language and I misunderstood the term, thinking it meant that you've used it a lot instead of just a bit.
