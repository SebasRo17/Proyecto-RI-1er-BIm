I'm using `SingularValueDecomposition` for a least-squares regression, the instruction that works fine for what I need is               SingularValueDecomposition[X,Length[SingularValueList[X]]]      Is there a way to do the same thing but without calling `SingularValueList` as I suppose similar computations are done two times in `SingularValueDecomposition` and `SingularValueList` ?
