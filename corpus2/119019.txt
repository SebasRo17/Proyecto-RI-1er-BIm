I read here that you should avoid coding JavaScript inline (see item #1). It sounds like a great idea; however, I'm not sure how to use js to select dynamic content without setting the id in the function call inline. For example, I have a simple blog. The comments are hidden, but can be displayed by clicking an anchor (generated dynamically) that calls a JavaScript function to toggle the comments for that specific post:               $commentsButton = "<a name='comments" . $post->id . "' href='#comments" . $post->id . "'> comments (" . count($comments) . ")</a>";      `toggleComments()` function:               function toggleComments(id) {         $('#' + id + ' .commentsContainer').toggle(500);     }      How do you keep from doing this kind of thing? Is it always appropriate to avoid inline JavaScript? Or is this a case where it's necessary? **Update:** I ended up using this:               $('.commentButton').each(function() {         $(this).click(function() {             $(this).parents('.post').find('.commentsContainer').toggle(500);         });     });      with this:               $commentButton = "<a class='commentButton'> comments (" . count($comments) . ")</a>";
