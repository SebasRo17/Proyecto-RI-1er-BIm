When I write code in Visual Studio, ReSharper (God bless it!) often suggests me to change my old-school for loop in the more compact foreach form. And often, when I accept this change, ReSharper goes a step forward, and suggests me to change it again, in a shiny LINQ form. So, I wonder: are there some _real_ advantages, in these improvements? In pretty simple code execution, I cannot see any speed boost (obviously), but I can see the code becoming less and less readable... So I wonder: is it worth it?
