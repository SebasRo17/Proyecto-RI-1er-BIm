I'm looking for a tool that can do semantic search in a body of C code.   Example query: "give me all references to field y in struct x defined in file z.h". I would prefer an open source, command line driven tool. C++ support is an advantage. Is there such a tool other than cscope? cscope doesn't preserve the type of tags. In hostapd for example there are more than 900 references to the tag "ifname". However, I'm only interested in the ifname field of a specific struct. cscope can't filter tags according to type.
