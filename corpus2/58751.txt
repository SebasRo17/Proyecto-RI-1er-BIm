The evaluation speed of _Mathematica_ often depresses me. It did it again when I wrote a code to solve a Project Euler problem. https://projecteuler.net/problem=206 Here's my code:               ClearAll[a];     a =       Compile[{},        NestWhile[# + 1 &, 10^9, ! MatchQ[           IntegerDigits[#^2], {1, _, 2, _, 3, _, 4, _, 5, _, 6, _, 7, _,8, _, 9, _, 0}] &],     CompilationTarget -> "C"]      I think it is the simplest solution. I can't find other solutions which are simpler. But my _Mathematica_ runs a long time before getting the answer. How can I speed this up? I've run into similar problems while I was solving other problems.
