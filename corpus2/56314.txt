In version 9, `DensityHistogram` worked with `PlotRange` as expected:               SeedRandom[0]     DensityHistogram[      Transpose[{RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], 1000],         RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], 1000]}],      PlotRange -> {{0, 3}, {0, 3}}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nQ1QZ.png) In version 10, the upper bound (3) is obeyed (with some new padding) but the lower bound (0) is ignored: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uVaJU.png) How can I make DensityHistogram obey the lower bound in PlotRange?
