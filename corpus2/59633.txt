I sometimes hear about pain points of customers using our app from sales people, but there really isn't a good way for us to currently keep track of these. I was going to write one myself but figured I would ask first. I was thinking something so simple it would literally just be a small form for adding a new feature, and then it would appear in the list, like stackexchange questions. Then users can upvote them, or even record each time a user complains about something related to the request so we can order them in priority based on real data. Then I can easily go look every few days and see what's going on. That's really it, nothing more complicated than that. Know of anything?
