I am setting up OAuth2.0 on Azure. I am at the stage where I have been allowed access to the application and a Code has been returned in my redirect URL. My application is a local windows application. When i type my OAuth endpoint address in the browser with the client ID, i successfully get redirected to my redirect URL, and the AuthCode is attached to the URL. Problem: When I have tried doing webrequests and similar strategies (in my C# code, not the brwoser) using my OAuth2.0 endpoint address, I cant seem to get the REDIRECTED url in my C# code. I have seeing some stuff about changing my redirect URL in azure to localhost and listening for a return, but I feel like that brings more variables into the equation. any advice?
