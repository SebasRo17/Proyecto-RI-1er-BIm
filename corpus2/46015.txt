Imagine I have a list: `tList = {item1,item2,item3,item4,item5,item6,...}`, and I'd like to take a random sample of `numItems` elements of the list: `RandomSample[tList,numItems]`. Is there a way to specify the random sample should contain some subset of the elements in `tList`, e.g. `{item65,item70,item2,...}`? The hope is then that all of the elements from the random sample are returned scrambled, including the order of the elements in the subset?
