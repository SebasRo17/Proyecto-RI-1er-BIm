I have an external data file with several columns and thousands lines of data. For the sake of this question, let's assume that we use               I1 = Import["data.out","Table"];      to import a sample data file which is the following               data = {{2,-1,0},{-4,0,2},{7,5,-1},{},{8,1,-3},{-5,2,-3},{},{-4,-1,3},{3,7,2},{0,0,2},{}}      We see, that there are empty sub-lists {} corresponding to blank lines to the external data file. Also, at the end there is always a blank line. Each blank line acts as a separator distinguishing between different piles in the data file. So, my question is the following: how can plot using `ListPlot` like               S1 = ListPlot[Flatten[List /@ data[[All, {2, 3}]], 1], Joined -> True,                   Frame -> True, Axes -> False, AspectRatio -> 1,                    PlotStyle -> {Black, PointSize[0.001]}]      all the different sets of data? In other words, how can I plot only the first sequence until the first blank line (`{2,-1,0},{-4,0,2},{7,5,-1}` according to the sample), or the data between let's say, 4rd and 5th blank lines, the last set, etc?
