Here is the question I'm having trouble with: > Give the resource graph and determine whether a deadlock state results. > Assume that when a thread requests an available or unallocated resource, the > OS immediately allocates that resource to the thread.   * There are three threads: T1, T2, T3   * There are three resources: R1, R2, R3 Here is the sequence of events:   1. T1 requests R1   2. T1 requests R3   3. T2 requests R2   4. T2 requests R3   5. T3 requests R1" Now, I have written out the graph for the problem.   ![Allocation Question](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DeSE0.jpg) Have I drawn the graph appropriately? Based off of this graph, I assume there is no deadlock because there are no cycles. I am unsure if my solution is correct. Can anyone help clarify this? Thank you!
