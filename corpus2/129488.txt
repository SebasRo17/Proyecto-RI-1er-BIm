I want to use IBM Rational DOORS for software development, but I would probably have to install and maintain it myself. How much effort is required? Is it something I can easily deploy on a server and start using right away, or do I have to basically become an IBM Rational specialist in order to properly deploy it? In other words, do I run a couple setup programs and, "Voila, it's done!" or do I have to install and perform deep configuration on a dozen other enterprisey prerequisites before I can even run the DOORS installer?
