I am quite proficient in C and know some C++, but never touched Java. Recently I got an idea for an app which I think has potential, and I want to develop it. I am planning to go Android first, cause it doesn't require a mac/iPhone. So my question is: can I go straight to learning Android development, picking up the Java syntax as I go along and need it (after all I don't think it's much different from C/C++), or should I take a couple of weeks to learn the basics of Java first and then start with Android development?
