I'm designing within an application that I inherited. I have done a lot of work to "consolidate" the CSS which was extremely overworked through much copying and pasting without a lot of strategy behind it. One curious thing I found was to style ALL divs as:               <style>     div{ float: left; }     </style>      Do any other applications do this? I would be "unfloating" divs all the time because the majority of my use of divs is in fact a division of content, forcing a new line for items like cell phones and tablets. In my practices, I will style a div float-left if I specifically need it to do that.
