Developing a website aiming to the Chinese market, I am wondering whether I should do compatibility tests with the 360 secure browser, which is based on the Trident layout engine (like Internet Explorer). Any developer experienced in designing websites for China? Did you test on this browser? Is it really different from IE? What is its market share in mainland China? _Note: Multiply by OS versions x use cases x website releases, and testing ends up costing a lot, so I need to think carefully about adding a browser to the supported browsers list._
