It is a language agnostic question, e.g. I have a unit test like               # Unit test     User user = User.create('john');     assertEquals("User name is john", "john", user.getName());          # Web test start from here     goTo("/user/john");     assertTitleEquals("john");      Do you think it is an anti-pattern? Although I can write a full selenium test suites to do the same thing, but using the above code save much of my time (e.g. no more click('Login'); waitUntil etc, and I don't need to worry if my UI is changed at all, sound like it is a quick and more stable approach to test?
