For almost all of my professional development career (15+ years) I have been working on or managing development teams that primarily use Microsoft technologies (VB6, ASP, ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server, etc.) I've recently been approached by a company that seems very interested in me for a job managing their development team, which happens to be a Java shop. Although I did recently take some college level Java courses, it was the typical programming academic environment, that is, lots of theory,excessive focus on syntax, and mostly console type apps, with only a trivial app at the end of the course with anything remotely resembling a modern Windowed UI. I'm not worried at all about the syntax elements, picking up new programming languages isn't all that difficult and C# is so similar to Java that I think it should be fairly seamless in that respect. However, thinking back over all the tools, frameworks and platform specific knowledge, lingo that I have amassed for MS development, I worry about how quickly I can get up to speed enough to be productive in that environment and earn the respect I will need to manage effectively a team of veteran programmers, who potentially may have biases against MS developers. Have any of you made the transition from a .NET shop to a Java shop? If so what were the toughest aspects of making the shift? Also, did you find it harder to get street cred on the team based on your experience in another platform? For those of you who already work on a Java team, how would you feel if a veteran .NET programmer/manager took over the reins of the team? What could that person do or say to make you feel more comfortable trusting them?
