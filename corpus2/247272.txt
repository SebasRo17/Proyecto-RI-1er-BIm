I am mainly a C programmer. In my world, writing `likeThis` or `like_this` is just a matter of style. In Haskell however, it seems that camelCase is the definite choice. Personally, I find the later much more readable. Think `pthread_mutexattr_init` vs `PthreadMutexAttrInit`. What's more, I have configured vim to swap the numbers and their alternate symbols (in C), since numbers happen to be written much less frequently than symbols such as parentheses, star, ampersand etc, which makes life easier on my wrist. As a bonus, this lets me write `this_sort_of_thing` without using the shift key. My question is, from the Haskell programmers, whether using underscore in names is acceptable to the Haskell community or not. Is camelCase an unwritten rule or common convention? Would it be ok to make the public functions `likeThis` but internally write `like_this`?
