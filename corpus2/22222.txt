I need to specify the length of the tick marks on the x axis in a `BarChart` plot:               BarChart[      {{1, -2}, {2, -3}, {3, -4}},      BarSpacing -> {0, 1},      Axes -> True,      Ticks -> None,      TicksStyle -> Red]       ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/91rdN.png) I can modify the style settings for the tick marks on the x axis. However, I found no possibility to remove (see code above with the option `Ticks -> None` ) nor to give the specified positions of the tick marks. In particular, I want to specify the lengths in the positive and negative directions, like described in the `Ticks` description in the documentation center.
