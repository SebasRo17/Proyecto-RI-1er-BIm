Is there a way to prevent ugly collision of axes labels and axes number like in the following examples, without the need of adding white space: ### Plot1:               Plot3D[Sin[x] Cos[y], {x, -Pi, Pi}, {y, -Pi, Pi},          AxesLabel -> {"ω", Subscript["E","F"], "Log[σ(ω)]"}, LabelStyle -> Directive[16]]      ![Plot1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wecGc.jpg) To avoid this distant axes label "Log[$\sigma(\omega)]" one can rotate it, but then: ### Plot2:               Plot3D[Sin[x]Cos[y],{x,-Pi,Pi},{y,-Pi,Pi},         AxesLabel->{"ω",Subscript["E","F"],Rotate["Log[σ(ω)]",90 Degree]},         LabelStyle->Directive[16]     ]      ![Plot2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p8XS9.jpg) I cannot imagine that using a 2-dimensional column with one element `"Log[σ(ω)]"` and the other a blank square is the only solution to cure Plot2. Is there a nice solution to prevent such an overlay?
