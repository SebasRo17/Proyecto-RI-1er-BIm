I don't do much algebra in Mathematica and was surprised to discover, while attempting to answer this question, that I had no idea how to factor out an expression from a polynomial. The question was, given               τ = (1 + Sqrt[5])/2 (* golden ratio *)      and               coords = {{0,0,1},{0,1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),-1},{1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),1/2 (1+Sqrt[5])},     {1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),0,1/2 (1+Sqrt[5])},{1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),1,1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5])},{1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),     1/2 (3+Sqrt[5]),1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5])},{1/2 (3+Sqrt[5]),-1,0},{1,1/2 (-3-Sqrt[5]),     1/2 (3+Sqrt[5])},{1/2 (-3-Sqrt[5]),1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),0},{-1,1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),1/2 (3+Sqrt[5])},     {1,1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),1/2 (-3-Sqrt[5])},{-1,1/2 (3+Sqrt[5]),1/2 (-3-Sqrt[5])},{1/2 (3+Sqrt[5]),     1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),0},{1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),1/2 (-3-Sqrt[5]),1/2 (1+Sqrt[5])},     {1/2 (-3-Sqrt[5]),1,0},{1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),-1,1/2 (1+Sqrt[5])},{1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),     0,1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5])},{1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),1/2 (1+Sqrt[5]),1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5])},     {0,1/2 (-1-Sqrt[5]),1},{0,0,-1}}      how can `coords` be expressed in terms of `τ`. I came up with               Map[       If[         AtomQ@#,          #,          (Simplify[#/τ]*HoldForm@τ) /. {           τ -> HoldForm@τ,            -τ -> HoldForm@-τ}] &,         coords, {2}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hXAmt.png) but obviously this is not a generally robust solution, and it is ugly. I assume there must be better ways to do this. This overlaps somewhat with the original question, but I am hoping for a more comprehensive explanation than that question requires.
