What is the best way to draw a path (red color, dashed) along the surface of the smoothHistogram3D. Assume the paths desired to be the X=0 and Y=0 Axes.               data = {{0.798333, 1.21167}, {-0.415, 0.915}, {-0.675, 0.715}, {0.785,      0.675}, {-0.55, 0.645}, {-0.125, 0.57}, {0.15, 0.27}, {-0.3,      0.115}, {0.925, -0.685}, {0.748333, 1.27167}, {-0.465,     0.975}, {-0.725, 0.775}, {0.735, 0.735}, {-0.6, 0.705}, {-0.175,      0.63}, {0.1, 0.33}, {-0.35, 0.175}, {0.875, -0.625}, {0.628333,      1.18167}, {-0.585, 0.885}, {-0.845, 0.685}, {0.615, 0.645}, {-0.72,       0.615}, {-0.295, 0.54}, {-0.02, 0.24}, {-0.47,      0.085}, {0.755, -0.715}, {0.718333, 1.23167}, {-0.495,      0.935}, {-0.755, 0.735}, {0.705, 0.695}, {-0.63, 0.665}, {-0.205,     0.59}, {0.07, 0.29}, {-0.38, 0.135}, {0.845, -0.665}, {0.738333,      1.23167}, {-0.475, 0.935}, {-0.735, 0.735}, {0.725, 0.695}, {-0.61,      0.665}, {-0.185, 0.59}, {0.09, 0.29}, {-0.36,      0.135}, {0.865, -0.665}, {1.07833, 1.43167}, {-0.135,      1.135}, {-0.395, 0.935}, {1.065, 0.895}, {-0.27, 0.865}, {0.155,      0.79}, {0.43, 0.49}, {-0.02, 0.335}, {1.205, -0.465}};     SmoothHistogram3D[data]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A4pdw.png)
