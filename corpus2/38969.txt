I have an integral that I compute with Mathematica and as a result I get a seemingly complex expression (i.e. the expression contains the imaginary unit, $i$, at some places). However, if I try to numerically compute the values of this expression at some values of my variables, I notice that in fact the value of the result is always real (for real values of variables); the imaginary parts cancel out in a right way to make the result real. This is also evident from the fact that the expression is a solution to a physical problem that is supposed to give a real solution. How do I make Mathematica simplify the expression so that it doesn't contain any imaginary units anymore? Edit: The expression I'm trying to simplify is: $$\frac{\sqrt{1-\frac{2}{-i x+y+1}}}{x+i (y-1)}+\frac{\sqrt{1-\frac{2}{i x+y+1}}}{x-i (y-1)}$$ In Mathematica form:               Sqrt[1 - 2/(1 - I x + y)]/(x + I (-1 + y)) + Sqrt[1 - 2/(1 + I x + y)]/(x - I (-1 + y))
