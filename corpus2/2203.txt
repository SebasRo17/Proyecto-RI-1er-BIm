I want the centrality measure of a particular vertex in my graph, and for Closeness, Betweenness and Degree centralities I have been using :               Pick[bc, VertexList[graph1], 1 ]      However, for `HITSCentrality`, the result is in two lists, and I'm not sure how to pick out the two values for a single node. Something like this isn't working...               Pick[bc, VertexList[graph1], {1,1} ]
