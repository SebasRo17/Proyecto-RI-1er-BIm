I'd like to prepare some presentations in Mathematica to help students visualize functions of two variables (it's a usual calculus course). I thought it would be both cool and useful to have the graphs as red/cyan anaglyphs. Is it possible to do that, and if yes, how? **Edit:** Simon Woods' answer below is great, but it produces a static image. I'd prefer an interactive version (rotatable - is it a word? - with a mouse); if this is not possible, then I'd like to have at least an animation. (I guess the latter shouldn't be too hard - I'd only have to put suitable commands in some loop, export the images and mount them as an animation; the point is, I'm a Mathemathica newbie and don't know (yet) how to do it - but I can probably figure that out on my own.)
