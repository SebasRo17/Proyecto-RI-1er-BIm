I have never published an app to app store. I have a chance to buy an apple mac from someone. Is it possible to use that to publish to app store? What if the first owner was also a developer? If I buy Mac with the only intention of publishing an app should I only go for a new one to get developer license or I can do it in a second hand Mac also?
