I am trying to expand all the terms in a sum in order to apply assignment rules later, but can't figure out how to do it. I've tried pretty much the commands I've seen around here. I have the following integral: $$\iint(x^2+y^2) f(x,y)dxdy$$ and I would like to extend it to $$\iint x^2 f(x,y)dxdy+\iint y^2 f(x,y)dxdy$$ in order to apply rules like $\iint x^2f(x,y)dxdy \to a$ and so on. I would like to do this in a generic way since the integrand would not always look like the one in the example here. Any idea?
