Kind of a REST lightweight here... Wondering which url scheme is more appropriate for a stock market data app (BTW, all queries will be GETs as the client doesn't modify data): Scheme 1 examples:               /stocks/ABC/news     /indexes/XYZ/news     /stocks/ABC/time_series/daily     /stocks/ABC/time_series/weekly     /groups/ABC/time_series/daily     /groups/ABC/time_series/weekly      Scheme 2 examples:               /news/stock/ABC     /news/index/XYZ     /time_series/stock/ABC/daily     /time_series/stock/ABC/weekly     /time_series/index/XYZ/daily     /time_series/index/XYZ/weekly      Scheme 3 examples:               /news/stock/ABC     /news/index/XYZ     /time_series/daily/stock/ABC     /time_series/weekly/stock/ABC     /time_series/daily/index/XYZ     /time_series/weekly/index/XYZ      Scheme 4: Something else??? The point is that for any data being requested, the url needs to encapsulate whether an item is a Stock or an Index. And, with all the RESTful talk about **resources** I'm confused about whether my primary **resource** is the **stock & index** or the **time_series & news**. Sorry if this is a silly question :/ Thanks!
