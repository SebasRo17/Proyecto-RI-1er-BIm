One of the most popular questions on stackoverflow.com is this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4025768/what-do-people-find-difficult- about-c-pointers Many of the answers seem to gravitate toward the fact that students often don't get a good understanding of what is physically going on when code executes... the very most basic part of this seems to be stack/heap. I've read through K&R twice and finally have a good understanding of the language, but I don't think that is enough. Nearly every tough question here has the work "stack" or "heap" in the answer, and while I have a limited understanding of what those mean just from context and wikipedia searches, I prefer the comprehensive approach of a textbook. So, please recommend a textbook which explains things like stack, heap, memory allocation, etc from a physical standpoint, as it relates to C programming. I tried asking this question on stackoverflow and apparently it was not the right place to ask it. So I hope this site is a better location. If not, please consider migrating it to the proper stackexchange site. Thanks.
