I'm learning git and I've noticed that it has a two-step commit process:   1. `git add <files>`   2. `git commit` The first step places revisions into what's called a "staging area" or "index". What I'm interested in is why this design decision is made, and what its benefits are? Also, as a git user do you do this or just use `git commit -a`? I ask this as I come from bzr (Bazaar) which does not have this feature.
