The following series expression holds:               BesselJ[1,a x]BesselJ[1,b x]==a b (x^2)/4*Sum[(-1)^n*(a x/2)^(2n)*Hypergeometric2F1[-n,-1-n,2,b^2/a^2]/(n!Pochhammer[2,n]),{n,0,Infinity}]      Where `BesselJ[1,x]` is the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1. `Hypergeometric2F1[a1,a2,b1,x]` is Gauss hypergeometric function. `Pochhammer[2,n]` is the Pochhammer Symbol. This series expression can be found in e.g. Bateman Manuscript Project, Higher Transcendental Functions, Vol.2, and it holds without any constraints. For this series expression, if the relatively small parameters are chosen, e.g. `a=1`, `b=2.5`, `x=3`, and just replace the sum index `Infinite` with `100`, the product of Bessel functions gives `0.045857190997445` and the series gives `0.045857190997469`. They coincide well. However, for a relatively large `x`, the product of Bessel functions must be decreasing, e.g. `a=1`, `b=2.5`, `x=100`, the product of Bessel functions gives `0.003338005199477126`, but the series gives `6.410492282570008*10^131` which is apparently divergent. The reason of this divergence is unknown for me. It can't be better to increase the terms of the series expression or improve the precision of the Gauss hypergeometric function. Could anyone help? Thanks!
