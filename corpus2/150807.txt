I have been conducting some research into RESTful web service design and I've reached what I think is a key decision point so I thought I'd offer it up to the community to get some advice. In keeping with the principles of a RESTful architecture I want to present a discoverable API, so I will be supporting the various HTTP verbs as fully as possible. My difficulty comes with the choice of representation of those resources. You see, it would be easy for me to come up with my own API that covers how search results are to be presented and how links to other resources are provided, but this would be unique to my application. I've read about the Atom Publishing Protocol (RFC 5023), and how OData promotes its use, but it seems to add an extra level of abstraction over what is (currently) a rather simple API. So my question is, when should a developer select AtomPub as their choice of representation - if at all? And if not, what is the current recommended approach?
