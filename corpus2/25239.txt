I am very new to _Mathematica_ (first time!) and I'm already having troubles with arrays. I basically have a 4D tensor, that is a matrix (call it `M`) which has for each entry another matrix. I want to select the elements of the nested matrices that are bigger than zero, but `Select[M, # > 0 &]` doesn't work. I suspect it is because I do not respect the dimensions. I am kind of lost. Thanks in advance
