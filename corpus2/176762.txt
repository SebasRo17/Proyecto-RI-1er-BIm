Is there a single scenario (other than compatibility with ancient JVMs) where using `synchronized` is preferable to using a `Lock`? Can anyone justify using `wait` or `notify` over the newer systems? Is there any algorithm that **must** use one of them in its implementation? I see a previous questions that touched on this matter but I would like to take this a little further and actually `deprecate` them. There are far too many traps and pitfalls and caveats with them that have been ironed out with the new facilities. I just feel it may soon be time to mark them obsolete.
