Internationalized applications usually display links in header for translating in different languages, e.g.: Spanish | English | Italian. These links usually translate current page in the selected language, and usually the url includes the language: http://www.mysite.com/myapp/es/somePage. Questions:   1. Does this only apply to static content?   2. Is it possible to internationalize this way dynamic content? For instance, a page which results in some form submission, clicking a different language might result in undesirable consequences. Some dynamic requests where transactions are not involved (simple queries, for example) might present no problems with this.    3. For authorized content, I guess I must ask for language in login page and use that language, i.e., disallow changing locale for authorized content, which, probably, has a lot of transactions. Is this correct?   4. How do I structure template files? One JSP for each of the languages? One JSP with a properties file for each of the languages?   5. How do I construct the link according to current request? I guess that url requested and param string should be remembered and reconstructed in JSP.
