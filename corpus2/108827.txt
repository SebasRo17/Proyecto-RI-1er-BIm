I know design principles and design patterns in theory. But it's embarrassing to realize that it's not clear when applying it in practice. For example, let's think about simple tic tac toe console game. How would you decide what class is for certain responsibility and how do you determine that responsibility/class is necessary for the system even before applying design patterns or principles? I understand it should be based on requirements and domain knowledge, but there are lots ways to satisfy the requirements. If I take agile (TDD) approach, there are still many ways to achieve the key requirement by making it testable. I wish there are many materials (books or web sites) on this but most of them are on theory but rarely on practices. I would appreciate if anybody can refer to such materials with which I can practice the class designs.
