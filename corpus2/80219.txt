I don't like writing open-ended questions but I have a quick security question. I have a PHP login script that shows a CAPTCHA on the third failed login attempts. The way I'm counting failed logins is by using session data. Is this secure? Is there a better way to do this? Maybe store the IP in a database table? I'm not really sure how bots and programs that try to use word list actually work. Thanks
