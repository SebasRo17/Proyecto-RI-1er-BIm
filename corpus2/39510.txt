Here is an old quaternions package. There is a function named `MatrixToQuaternion`, References are here Matrix in that document is `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15`; you can see it in the top of the page. `m1` is a test matrix               m1={{-0.825927,-0.56376,0.00445629,-166.077},{-0.56376,0.825813,-0.0144323,-109.866},{0.00445629,-0.0144323,-0.999886,200.868},{0.,0.,0.,1.}};      Part of the `MatrixToQuaternion` function in the package `Quaternions.m` You can check this according the web page.               S =  2*Sqrt[1 + m1[[2,2]] - m1[[1,1]] - m1[[3,3]]];               Quaternion[m1[[1,3]] + m1[[3,1]],              m1[[1,2]] + m1[[2,1]],                      1/2, m1[[2,3]] + m1[[3,2]]         ]/S      gives value1 (you can simply `Total[#^2]&` to see it's wrong unit quaternion)               Quaternion(0.00233201,-0.29502,0.130827,-0.00755253)      The right value should be some order of value2               {-0.29502,0.955461,-0.00755253,0.}      It looks two components of value1 are wrongly calculated. Where does it go wrong?
