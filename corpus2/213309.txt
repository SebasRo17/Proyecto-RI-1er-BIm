Perhaps there's a name for what I want, but I'm not aware of it. I need something similar to a `LinkedHashMap` in Java, but where it returns the 'previous' value if there's no value at the specified key. That is, I have a list of objects stored by an integer key (which is in units of time in my case):               ; key->value     10->A     15->B     20->C      So, if I were to query for a value for key 0-9, it would return `null`. The special part is if I queried for something 10 <= i <= 14 it would return A. Or, for i >= 20, it would return C. Is there a data structure for this?
