I am using `FindRoot` to find solutions to a large, highly oscillatory equation which I generated using other code. When I run `FindRoot` in _Mathematica_ 8 on my old macbook with OS 10.6, 1 GB Ram it takes maybe 2 hours to find a solution, but it can find a solution. I tried to run `FindRoot` on the same equation in Mathematica 9 on a PC using Windows 7 with 6 GB Ram and the system runs out of memory giving an error > No more memory available. Mathematica kernel has shut down. Try quitting > other applications and then retry. I am just running `FindRoot` so I cannot change the code, but I am wondering why I would run out of memory in Windows and not on my mac and how I could solve this problem in Windows? Are there just settings I can change in _Mathematica_ or Windows?
