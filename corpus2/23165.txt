I'm using Mathematica 8 I've been searching the net without luck for this specific solutions: Suppose I have an inequality f(x;M,m)>0 where I KNOW that M>4m and m>0. How can I let _Mathematica_ know this so that when solving the inequality using `Reduce` I don't get twenty irrelevant solutions, but instead only solutions where 0<4m I've used assumptions and so on but without luck, for instance:               Assuming[m > 0, Reduce[(x + m)*(x - m) < 0]]      Produces;               x \[Element] Reals && (m < -Sqrt[x^2] || m > Sqrt[x^2])      `m<-Sqrt` is unnecessary here, so why does _Mathematica_ write it out? How can we stop it?
