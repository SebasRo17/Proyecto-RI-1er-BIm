Although I've been developing web applications for close on 6 years now I still do not know what happens when a request reaches the server. I am looking for book that works through what happens when a request reaches the server and how the server knows which code to call. I'm assuming that there is a old book from the early eighties/nineties, when the internet was still relatively new to developers, that would be able to explain this; but my google-fu is failing me in my search for this book. Whether the book deals with IIS or Apache, I think it would be quite interesting to read and may be useful to know so any recommendations are welcome. Thank you
