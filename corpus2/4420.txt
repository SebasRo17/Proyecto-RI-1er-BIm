Background: In a module containing an outer / inner manipulate I select the key of data with a dropdownlist in the outer manipulate. Data is read and displayed in the inner manipulate for edit purposes. The outer manipulate contains buttons, one of which is a save button. I want to get the edited data back at that level so that it can be saved. Consider the following _simplified_ example:                 Manipulate[        Column[{j,        Manipulate[k, {k, 1, 5, 1}],         Button["Check", Print[k]]        }],       {j, 1, 10, 1}]      the question then becomes: **"What is the best way to get the variable k scoped to the first / outer manipulate" ?**
