So I have three matrices that represent say the R, G, and B channels of an image:               mR = RandomInteger[{0, 255}, {2, 2}];     mG = RandomInteger[{0, 255}, {2, 2}];     mB = RandomInteger[{0, 255}, {2, 2}];      I would like to add these to get an overall image made of these three channels, but I can't seem to be able to do that. Trying to understand the documentation under "Image", I tried               Image[{mR, mG, mB}, "Byte"]      but this gives me an image that's 3x2: ![RGB](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0srHu.png) Also when I try               Image[{mR, ConstantArray[0, {2, 2}], ConstantArray[0, {2, 2}]}, "Byte"]      I don't get the red channel. I just get the first row of the image above with zeros everywhere else: ![R](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vCR48.png) I can't understand the documentation here, and any help would be greatly appreciated!
