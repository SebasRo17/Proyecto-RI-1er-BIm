I came across this article proposing a style of coding in c++ that looks a bit weird at first. But after reading it over and pondering for a bit I'm really considering giving it a try. The most appealing benefit is the ease of refactoring methods. I find myself constantly changing method names, parameters and so on while writing a new class and in c++ it's quite annoying having to change a method name in two files (.h, .cpp). I tried to find something wrong with this style but apart from the fact that the code will look and feel **really** strange to seasoned c++ programmers I can't spot any major flaw. But since I am quite a inexperienced c++ programmer I hope that someone here might alert me to any potential dangers. So my question is: **Are there any serious drawbacks of using this style of coding?**
