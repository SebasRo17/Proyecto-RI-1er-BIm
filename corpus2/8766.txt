What is the best way to right align a button in a dialog window, regardless of the window's `WindowSize`? Here is a resizable window to test on:               CreateDialog[      Column[{"Here's some text text text text text text text",               ChoiceButtons[]}],       WindowFrameElements -> {"ResizeArea"},       WindowFrame -> "Normal"]      I would like the button to always be right aligned. Some unsatisfactory solutions I thought of:   * Put the button in an `Item` and right align. Then the right margin is determined by the `Column` size which can't easily be set in pixels.   * Put the button in a `Panel`, right align it, and set a fixed size on the panel. Again, the size is determined by the panel size, not the window size. **Use case:** Suppose we need to create an alternative to `MessageDialog`. This new function, `myMessageDialog`, should take the `WindowSize` option, and the created notebook should respond to `SetOptions[nb, WindowSize -> ...]` The dialog buttons should always be aligned to the right edge of the window regardless of the window size.
