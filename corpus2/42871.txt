The `Nearest` function can receive as a threshold parameter a radius to look for elements inside that. From the documentation: > >     Nearest[data,x,{n,r}] give up to the n nearest elements to x within a > radius r >   What about if instead of a circle I want to use an ellipse as a threshold? So I would have an X and Y limit for the `Nearest` function. I know that `Nearest` can receive a `DistanceFunction` as a parameter but I can't think of how to use that for this purpose. Any ideas?
