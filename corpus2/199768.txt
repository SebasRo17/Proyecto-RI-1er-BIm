My understanding is that the first step of defining user stories is to define roles. The problem with role-based systems is that this form of authorization is often too coarse-grained. Hence, people created task-based authorization where roles are still used to lump tasks into groups (see for example rhino security . At least that's my understanding. How do I write user stories for task based authorization? Any feedback would be very much appreciated. Many thanks!
