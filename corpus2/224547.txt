I am a self taught programmer. I have only 1+ year of experience in development. Majority of my knowledge is gained by reading books and from little bit from the engineering degree. Currently I have no go to guy or person to discuss ideas / solution. I am their go to guy and they are not interested in the idea of the solution they just want it to work. So can people who are already there have they done it on there on i.e using internet and books or they have been cultured into the role?
