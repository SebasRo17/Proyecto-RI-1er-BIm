Most of you would probably just call me a kid (I'm 15). I'm doing hobby programming (I started fiddling around with ActionScript 2.0 in Flash 8 when I was 11, now I do mostly C, Python and Java). As I'm 15, I won't get a job for a long period of time (I'm going to spend years in academia before that) and thus this question is _not_ about which programming methodologies you recommend me to read up on for a software engineering _job_ , but instead **which methodologies should a _hobby_ programmer read about?** What will a hobby developer learn from reading about your recommendation(s)?
