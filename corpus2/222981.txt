The book _C++ Templates: The Complete Guide_ , (c) 2002, looks very appealing to me, but as it's 12 years old, I'm concerned it may be out of date. There are some highly favorable Amazon reviews dated as recently as a year ago, and I don't see any other very recent titles on C++ templates. Does anyone know whether a book about templates published in 2002 (as opposed to a book specifically about the STL) would have syntax or concepts that have been superseded or added to by, say, C++11? The following is from the Amazon book description: > Templates are among the most powerful features of C++, but they are too > often neglected, misunderstood, and misused. C++ Templates: The Complete > Guide provides software architects and engineers with a clear understanding > of why, when, and how to use templates to build and maintain cleaner, > faster, and smarter software more efficiently. > > C++ Templates begins with an insightful tutorial on basic concepts and > language features. The remainder of the book serves as a comprehensive > reference, focusing first on language details, then on a wide range of > coding techniques, and finally on advanced applications for templates. > Examples used throughout the book illustrate abstract concepts and > demonstrate best practices. > > Readers learn > >   * The exact behaviors of templates >   * How to avoid the pitfalls associated with templates >   * Idioms and techniques, from the basic to the previously undocumented >   * How to reuse source code without threatening performance or safety >   * How to increase the efficiency of C++ programs >   * How to produce more flexible and maintainable software >
