I have seen 2-3 ERPs in action. I am wondering what is better. Desktop based application or webbased displayed on a browser. My first experience was with a web based ERP when i was 14 years old.. It was web based and terribly slow... For most simple task you had to do lots of clicks... no keyboard support ..... Pages took ages to load. Last year I worked for migrating to a newer computer some old terminal based cobol application. The computer that worked till today and still has no problem was from 1993.   The user interface ofcourse was textbased.. The speed that guys placed orders was amazing! just typing the name of the customer , then 5-10 keys to add a product to order.... Comparing to this ERP the page for placing orders Link (click sales orders) seems terribly slow to add a product... No keyboard shortcut works to save what you added and generally I believe you need 4 times more time to place an order compared to the text interface...   Having to use both mouse and keyboard for this task is BAD and sadistic... So how can the heck these people ever use a system like that ??? So in the long run desktop application seems the only way... Of course browsers support shortcuts but the way to overide the defaults that browsers uses isn't cross compatible... That is a huge problem. Finnaly, if we MUST/forced use cloud in near future what about keyboard shortcuts?? I feel confused... I have seen converters of desktop applications to browser applications but are SLOW as hell... The question is what about user friendliness? What kind of application would you use?
