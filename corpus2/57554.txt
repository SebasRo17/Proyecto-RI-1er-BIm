Is it possible to set the following function `f[a]`, where `a` can be any real number? > $$ f(\alpha) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } 2\pi n < \alpha < \pi (2n+1) \\ > 2 & \text{if } \pi (2n+1) \le \alpha \le 2\pi (n+1) \end{cases}, \ n \in > \mathbb{Z}\ $$ The issue here is `n` which I want to be substituted consecutively by an integer in order to produce propriate continuous conditions. I guess, it is not the case where `Assumptions` should be used as my attempt underneath doesn't work.               f[a_] := \[Piecewise] {        {1, 2 \[Pi]n < a && a < \[Pi] (2 n + 1)},        {2, \[Pi] (2 n + 1) <= a && a <= 2 \[Pi] (n + 1)}       }, Assumptions -> n \[Element] Integers      Thanks.
