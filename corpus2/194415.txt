Some Agile job posts have a requirement "strong understanding of multiple lifecycles application development", what does it means ? So my question would be: what's that field for, and what would I need to learn, knowing that I got Java EE experience and Agile more than 2 years. Sorry if my question isn't constructed well, nor I putted some time searching the meaning :) my self, but all my research yielded job posts :D.
