Why do browsers use different rendering engines, this causes the problem I hate the most "make your HTML/CSS compatible with all major web browsers". Why don't they use one rendering engine as a standard and this will save a lot of time and effort for all developpers. In fact this is what I hate about IT industry "Concurrence at the expense of the user". We can say the same about Operating systems. Why not only one ?
