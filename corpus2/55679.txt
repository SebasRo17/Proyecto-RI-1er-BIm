When calculating derivatives a expression is the result:               in:= f[x_,y_]:= 1 + 2 x + 3 x^2 y + 4 x y^2     in:= D[f[x,y],x]     out= 2 + 6 x y + 4 y^2      how do i make this result into a function? What i would like to do (syntax is illustrative):               in:= fx[x_,y_]:= D[f[x,y],x]     in:= fx[2,1]     out= 18      Also, how do i evaluate a list of expressions?               in:= D[f[x, y], {{x, y}}]     out= {2 + 6 x y + 4 y^2, 3 x^2 + 8 x y}      E.g what i would like to do (syntax is illustrative):               in:= {2 + 6 x y + 4 y^2, 3 x^2 + 8 x y}[2,1]     out= {18,28}      I am very new to mathematica and i don't find the official reference to be of much help on this subject, even though i think it is quite basic, and nothing closely resembling on google.
