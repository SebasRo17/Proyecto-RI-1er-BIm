We are going to track user engagement (i.e. time spent on site, most viewed part/page of the system, etc). I don't see Google Analytics / MixPanel being able to do this, since we have to analyze based on factors only present in OUR backend (such as users who go to specific school, users who are a specific type, etc) - not the general stuff like Country, Gender, etc. I can think of a REALLY simple solution, but I am not sure if it is, serverwise, bad. You have a table that looks something like this:               CREATE TABLE `log` (       `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,       `uri` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,       `date` timestamp NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,       `user` int(11) NOT NULL,       PRIMARY KEY (`id`)     ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;      And then whenever a page is loaded, a row is added to the "log" table, with current timestamp, the user id and the uri. Now I got the data I want, which is great. I can figure out when the user was last online and how many minutes people spend in average. BUT. Is this bad for the server? It is going to add a row each page load, which is a lot of rows, if you have 500 or 1000 active users. But will it matter? What are your thoughts?
