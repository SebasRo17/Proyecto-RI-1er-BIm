I was wondering what are some techniques to locate which code implemented a specific feature, on a desktop application. I am a junior developer, with only professional programming experience lying around web programming. In the Web it is easier to do that. For example, you "inspect" a button with the browser tools, and you can see what is being done when you click it. And then, presuming you have the full source code, you can drill down the hierarchy of the calls. But how do you do this in desktop applications? At least, without having to dive into the full codebase?
