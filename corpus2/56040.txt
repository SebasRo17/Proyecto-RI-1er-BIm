So I've been tinkering around with the built in stylesheets and the `Export` command and I've noticed that in principle equation numbering _should_ work. When you look at PublicationDefault.nb or Notebook.nb stylesheets you'll notice the use of the `IncludeCount` function, which looks like it should print a number into EquationNumberedLabel class of html code. Here's what I'm talking about:               Cell[StyleData["EquationNumbered", StyleDefinitions -> StyleData["Equation"]],      ConversionRules:>{       "HTML" -> {{"", ""}, {"<table class='EquationNumbered'><tr><td>", Automatic,        IncludeCount[           "</td><td class='EquationNumberedLabel'>(`1`)</td></tr></table>",             "EquationNumbered"]}}},...]      I've tried exporting it with commands: `Export["test.html", SelectedNotebook[], "HTML"]` `Export["test.html", SelectedNotebook[], "HTML", "MathOutput" -> "TeX"]` both don't seem to give me the equation numbers. Is this functionality really not intended to work?
