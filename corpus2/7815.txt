Can someone clarify how to perform a `DialogInput` operation within a `Button`? I wrote some code for that but it's not working.               Button["Enter value",       DialogInput[{name = ""},        Column[{InputField[Dynamic[name], String],          Button["Hi", Dynamic[name]]}]]]      My problem is this â€” when I run the above code, the given text is displayed but when I click on the button, the actual operation is not being carried out.
