I've made a Manipulate app. in Mathematica where I vary the value of a function f(a) by varying the parameter a. However, I seem to only be able to edit my input for a for a value up to 5 decimal places (if I enter in a number with more than 5 decimal places, it rounds the figure). Is it possible to increase the number of decimal places with which I can enter in my value of a into the manipulate input?
