I attempted to import a very short .txt file string using the `Import` command:               Import["C:\\TestFile.txt"] // AbsoluteTiming          Out: {0.020001, "Test"}      Why does this take 20 milliseconds? `Export` is about an order of magnitude faster for the same string:               Import["C:\\TestFile.txt","Test"] // AbsoluteTiming          Out: {0.002000, "C:\\test.txt"}      Are there any hidden options for `Import` like the following (concerning TIF files) from a previous question of mine Slow import of multigigabyte TIF image stacks?:               Image`ImportExportDump`ImageReadTIFF      Quoting the user cormullion from my previous question: "For the OP's single frame, it's 0.015 for Import, but 0.000745 for ImageReadTIFF on Mac/M9. That might be worth having."
