I used Mathematica's function PearsonChiSquareTest to test whether the data were drawn from a normal distribution. As in the reference, I expected Mathematica to compare the result to a normal distribution, by running: `PearsonChiSquareTest[data]`. As I wanted to extract the test statistics from properties, I was "forced" to name the distribution I wanted to compare it to, namely the normal distribution: `PearsonChiSquareTest[data, NormalDistribution[],"PValue"]`.   What is surprising is that the _PValue_ for the first case is _different_ from the second case where I use the Normal Distribution explicitly. Anyone knows what's the difference here?               data = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], 10^4];          PearsonChiSquareTest[data]          (*     ==> 0.3248593157     *)          PearsonChiSquareTest[data, NormalDistribution[]]          (*     ==> 0.4704917701     *)
