Although its generally agreed by organisations like the OSI and the FSF what is and isn't an open source software (basically, the the terms of the source code license) what are the guiding principals for open source projects? Other software movements have principals like the Agile Manifesto. It seems as though open source share some common values (such as transparency, collaboration, etc.). Are these documented somewhere?
