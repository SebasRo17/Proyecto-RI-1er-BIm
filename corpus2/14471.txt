You should have already seen such a thing, specially in documentaries about ancient life: the movement of a tribe is shown on an ancient map along a route with a dashed arrow. I want to do the same thing in Mathematica. Given a bitmap image of a map like this one and a list of points on the 2d map such as `{{123,233}, {177, 279}, ...}`, I want to make a movie that shows an arrow along the given route on the map. The movie looks like it is captured from a helicopter flying on the map. _Edit:_ This is what I did after `rm -rfâ™¦`'s comment:               map = ImageResize[        Import["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/China_\     old_map.jpg"], 500];     path = .3 {{300, 500}, {350, 600}, {450, 700}, {600, 750}, {650,           750}, {700, 780}, {800, 800}, {850, 900}, {900, 1000}, {1000,           1050}, {1100, 1050}, {1150, 1100}};     ListAnimate[      Table[Show[map, Graphics[{Thick, Dashed, Arrow[Take[path, i]]}],         ImageSize -> {500}], {i, Length@path}]]
