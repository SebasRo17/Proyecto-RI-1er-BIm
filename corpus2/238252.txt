We're setting up Jenkins for CI and deployments. We have .NET website that isn't managed through visual studio. Its a Logi Analytics application, so we develop exclusively through LogiStudio. As such, there are no build files (.sln). However, there are web config and other XML files that need to change depending on the environment they are deployed in. Slow Cheetah looks like a good solution for transforming non-web.config xml files, but again the problem is we aren't managing this as a visual studio solution, ergo no .sln file. In the past I would have used NAnt for this kind of thing, but I like the MS convention used by slow cheetah for defining transformations. I'd hate to have to put the application in a solution just to make this work, and I'm hoping to get away from NAnt since I'm the only one around here that is comfortable using and maintaining NAnt scripts. Are there any great options out there that I'm missing?
