First, note that $4^{96}\equiv96\ (mod\ 100)$. _Mathematica_ claims that `PowerMod[96, 1/96, 100]` has no integer solutions. Even more obviously wrong, I get `{}` for               Solve[4^96 == x^96, Modulus -> 100]      which obviously has at least one solution (4). Is this a known bug? Can I work around it somehow? EDIT: I'm on _Mathematica_ 9.0.1, running on OSX 10.10 Yosemite developer beta. Perhaps that could be the cause of this issue for me (also, mathematica crashes whenever I try to paste.).
