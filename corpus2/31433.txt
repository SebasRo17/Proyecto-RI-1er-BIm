Looking at the LibraryLink examples, there are several new functions and objects, as well as example programs, that appeared in version 9. Are these documented? If yes, where? If would be nice to have a summary of the new features available, and a summary of how and when to use them, so people can more easily decide whether there is something that's useful for their project. Some things I noticed and would like to learn more about:   * `MInputStream` and `MOutputStream` types, `WolframStreamLibrary.h` header   * `DataStore` type   * `WolframIOLibrary_Functions` (comparable to `WolframLibraryData`, contains function pointers)   * all the `async-*.c` examples which use these features It should be possible to figure much of this out using the (uncommented) example programs, but I'm hoping that someone has already done this and can contribute and answer.
