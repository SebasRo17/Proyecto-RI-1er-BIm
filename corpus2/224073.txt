I have some code, which I want to present in UML, but I've stuck at one point. Let me tell you something about code's functionality. I have a workspace in which I can place some `Component`s, select them, delete, add new, move etc. I can also connect them according to some rules (there are different types of `Component`s available). In order to determine if a group of `Component`s can be connected or not, I've implemented some easy mechanism. In this mechanism the following parts appear: **`ConnectionRule`** \- get the type of connection, and checks if a collection of `Component`s given as a parameter can be connected according to this `ConnectionRule`. **`ConnectionRulesSet`** \- has many rules inside. Client asks a set with rules like this: "according to which rules definied in a set, components given as a parameter, can be connected"? `ConnectionRulesSet` gives a list of `ConnectionRules` as a response. A concrete Connection rules set are exposed only throug interface - Client cannot create an instance of a concrete RulesSet. **`RulesSetFactory`** \- depending on many circumstances, application can use different `ConnectionRulesSet`s. That's why I've created a factory which gives a proper implemetation of `ConnectionRulesSet` interface depending on specified circumstances. And now let's take a look at the Client's code:               // list of components which should be verified in terms of connection plausibility:     List<Component> selectedComponents = ... ;     // Get set of rules for normal conditions:     ConnectionRulesSet setOfRules = RulesSetFactory.getRulesSet(NORMAL_SET);     List<ConnectionRule> fulfilledRules = setOfRules.getFulfilledRules(final selectedComponents);     // Do something with fulfilled rules:     for(PlausibilityRule rule : fulfilledRules){        addToAvailableRulesList(rule.getConnectionType().getName()); // display names of connetion types...     }       My problem is, that I'm not sure how to create an UML class diagram for such solution from Client's perspective... How to expose relationships between presented solution and a Client. Client uses actually all: ConnectionRule, RulesSet, RulesSetFactory... There is one of my ideas below... What do you think? Have you got any better solution? ![Sample UML class diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gyPMc.png)
