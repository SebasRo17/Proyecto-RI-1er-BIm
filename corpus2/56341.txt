I have a list in this style               data={{a1,b1,c1,d1,e1,f1}, {a2,b2,c2,d2,e2,f2}}      I need to delete all elements in which `b1` is equal to `b2` and so on. I only have to test b. The list I use have more than 15000 elements. I used `DeleteDuplicates`:               DeleteDuplicates[data, {_, #1, _, _, _, _} == {_, #2, _, _, _, _} &]      I know this method gives a correct result because I tested it on a small amount of data. But in a list with more than 15,000 elements after 20 minutes of running without success. Is there a more efficient method?
