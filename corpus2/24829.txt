I am trying to plot a sum of multiple `HeavisidePi` functions. A typical example would be something like this:               Plot[HeavisidePi[1/10 (-595 + x)] + HeavisidePi[1/10 (-535 + x)] +        HeavisidePi[1/10 (-425 + x)] + HeavisidePi[1/10 (-365 + x)], {x,        300, 800}, Exclusions -> None]      In this interval in the code above, I can see all four of them. However, if I were to back out to an interval of {100,800}, for instance, only two of them show up for me (the one at 595 and 425). Any idea why this would be the case? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
