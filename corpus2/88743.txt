I am looking for a good book about parallel programming with focus on C++. Something suitable for a person reasonably good in C++ programming, but with no experience in concurrent software development. On the other hand, I'd prefer a practical book, without loads of silly examples about philosophers eating lunch. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information on parallel programming with focus on C++ ? What about that book makes it special?
