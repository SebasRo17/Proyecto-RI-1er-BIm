Sorry if this is the wrong place for this question. I'm starting to develop an Android application, but I would like to choose a license and a business model before to write any code. My requirements are the following:   * Make the app open source (completely or partially)    * Sell the app for a small price on Google Play I see essentially two alternatives to choose from:   1. Let's say I want a single paid binary on Google Play and I let the (advanced) users build the app for itself, if they want (or maybe take the app from F-Droid or similar third party stores). In this case, which open source license should I use? I'm not sure whether the GPL license allows me to sell the binary.   2. Let's say I want to provide, on Google Play, a basic version of the app for free and a _pro_ version for a small fee. The basic version would be open source, but what about the pro version? Open or closed source? Feel free to suggest an additional model!
