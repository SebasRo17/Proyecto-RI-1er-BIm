When I was in college and as a programming language learner I wrote program for finding out prime numbers but then I never mind the program performance in terms of speed. Now after long time just started solving the problems from projecteuler.net. Now I wonder is there any best and most used algorithm for finding the primality of a given positive number which produces the result fast? Thanks
