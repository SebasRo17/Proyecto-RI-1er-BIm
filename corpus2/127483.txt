I applied for a job in a company. The initial conversation went well.They sent me an assignment and asked me to write a web application, and send it in a specified time. It seemed fairly simple. I completed and sent it to them. Now my mind is completely revolving on the code that I wrote, and now I feel that, there was one small requirement which I did not fulfill. Before they give the verdict shall I be proactive and admit it. Definitely they will find it and I am certain of it. I can send them email saying that I forgot to add that. What shall I do? Is there anything I do for damage control?
