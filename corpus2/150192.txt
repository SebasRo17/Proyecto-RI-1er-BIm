**Background** : IT Recruitment in UK has absolutely exploded over the last five years and I get quite a few calls from recuiters each week with positions. One recruiter offered to put me forward for a great looking position at a great salary in the area I wanted, so I had a phone interview which went very well and genuinely expect the face-to-face interview to go well. Unfortunately, as I do have to sift through quite a few wildly inappropriate positions I either confused two job descriptions or simply didn't read it properly. Anyway it turns out that the job is a VB.NET developer and I am a C#/Java developer. While I'm confident I can do the job, I'm concerned that accepting it might hinder me later in my career if I ever wanted to return to C#. I'm also concerned that many of my peers are quite snobbish about VB and am not sure how popular that position is. **Actual Question(s)** : As as C# developer (with 4 years exp), considering accepting a position as a VB developer, in 5 years will I be able to take another position back in C# (or Java) without having to return to my current level of seniority? Also, if anyone's actually made this transfer - was working in VB disappointing or did it feel limiting?
