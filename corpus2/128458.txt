My friend and I have started to try to collaborate on some projects. For background, I come from a PHP/Wordpress/Drupal coding background, but recently I've become more experienced with the RoR framework, while he is more experienced as an HTML/CSS designer, working with PHP and WordPress. We're both relatively new to RoR I think, and so we're trying to figure out our collaborative workflow, but we have no idea where to start. For instance, we were trying to figure out how he could do some minor edits to the CSS file without having to do a full RoR deploy on his box. We still haven't figured out a solution, so I think it's best if we start to set some sort of workflow based on best practices. I was wondering if you guys have any insight or links to articles/case studies regarding this topic?
