I am a completely new to _Mathematica_ , and I am sorry if this question is dumb. I have to solve a system of two second order non linear coupled differential equations (that I got from the Lagrangian equation of motions for a particular system). The following is my code: I hope it is clear.               NDSolve[      {       -29.4 + 9.8 Cos[y[t]] + x[t] Derivative[1][y][t]^2 - 4 x''[t] == 0,          9.8 Sin[y[t]] + 2 Derivative[1][x][t] Derivative[1][y][t] + x[t] y''[t] == 0,        x[0] == 1, y[0] == 1.57, Derivative[1][x][0] == 0,        Derivative[1][y][0] == 29.4      },      {x[t], y[t]}, {t, 0.1}     ]      But I am getting exactly the same output as the input. _Mathematica_ is returning the same piece of code.
