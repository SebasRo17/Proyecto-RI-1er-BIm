**Q:** I'm putting together a strategy on how its best to maintain cdf documents with multiple users in a source code repository. Ideally I wish for users to create (unit tested) cdf's with data and calculations specific to their role. Once the cdf's have been code reviewed, approved to be checked into source control (TFS or possibly SVN). _TFS would be a better solution over SVN since we require integration with the Office suit of applications: Sharepoint 2010, Excel 2010, Word and Outlook._ **Is there a preferred way to manage the cdf files in a source control system? or will any do?**
