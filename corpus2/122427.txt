Some open source licenses don't allow its usage in commercial products, but I bet some people/companies use it anyways. Is it possible to prove that a closed source, commercial product illegally incorporates open source code? If so, how? Example: Say Microsoft just gets the Linux kernel, slaps a new GUI on top of it and calls it "Windows 9." Would it be possible to prove they did this?
