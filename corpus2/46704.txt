I have a really trivial question. I want to create a table containing the text "this number = k" where k is the value of the iterator in the Table function. I tried               Table["This number = "  k, {k, 3}]      but the output is               {"This number = ", 2 "This number = ", 3 "This number = "}      when want I want is               {"This number = 1", "This number = 2", "This number = 3"}.      How can I achieve this?
