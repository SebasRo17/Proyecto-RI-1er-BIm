In thinking of making a good introductory resource guide for new Computer Science students... **What is a good list of expected knowledge and ability for a computer science BS grad?** And if you graduated a while ago, how does this compare to the standards for graduates at that time? And, are there any things you would want college grads to know that most entering the field don't? Many thanks!
