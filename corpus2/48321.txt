Is there such thing? I designed a while back a rudimentary form based app for my users. We receive from our suppliers hardware manufacturing data in XML files: file name is made of eleven fields separated by tildes, with each field having its own meaning. R&D guys wanted to be able to search each field of the file names so I used regex() with decent results. Problem is that we have now in the upwards of 2.5 million files. And my app can't hack it anymore. I looked at Apache Lucene & Solr. Though it seemed like the best solution to my problem, the fields in the filenames are not peers to the file content. Big no-no with Solr. What is the best way to implement a PHP app with indexing and search capability with such large number of files? Do I have to buy Zend and use Zend_Search? Is it the only way? Thanks for your input.
