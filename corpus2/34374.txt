# Update 1 @ Michael E2, my effort - for what it is worth!:               f[x_] := Im[(-1)^(-1 - x/2) 2^(1 - x) \[Pi]^-x x! Zeta[x]];     f[a_] := -a Zeta[1 - a];     Manipulate[With[{{x0 = Clip[p[[1]], {3, 10}]}, {a0 = Clip[p[[1]], {3, 10}]}},     Plot[{f[x], f[a]}, {x, 3, 10}, ImagePadding -> 20, LabelStyle -> (FontFamily ->      "Ariel"), Epilog -> {PointSize[Large], Red, Tooltip[Point[#], #] &@{x0, f[x0], a0,      f[a0]}}]], {{p, {3, 0}}, Locator, Appearance -> None}, AppearanceElements -> None]      # Original question I would like to control two locators at once (both moving with same x value), outputting 2 sets of coordinates simultaneously. The plot I am working looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O1IaI.gif) generated by the following code:               Plot[{Im[(     N[Zeta[x]] x!)/(\[Pi]^x (2^(x - 1) (-1)^(x/2 + 1)))],      -x Zeta[1 - x]}, {x, 3, 10}, Epilog -> {PointSize[Medium], Red,      Point[{{5, -5 Zeta[1 - 5]},      {5, Im[(N[Zeta[5]] 5!)/(\[Pi]^5 (2^(5 - 1) (-1)^(5/2 + 1)))]}}]}]      Michael E2 and Timothy Wofford provided a code that controls one locator in this post. I would like to achieve the same thing with multiple locators (ideally by moving one locator with cursor & both locators moving with equal x values at the same time - both generating their separate coordinates). If possible also, I would like the manipulate cell to output the value of a function of each point as it moves, along with the sum of both functions. I hope I am making sense here!
