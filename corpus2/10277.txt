In my experience as a freelance developper, I've had some difficulties with clients, whom insist on getting an estimate over flimsy requirements. They then expect me to deal with requirements changes, sometimes late in the project, and stick to that estimate. Since I've never come up myself with some T.O.S. tailored for this situation, I ended up bound by a contract of a more general nature, which inevitably became unsasatisfactory... Legal lingo not being my forte, I've been lookin for some publicly released T.O.S. to try to remedy this situation. Ideally these would be from an agile shop, under a licensing scheme allowing derivatives. This would help me lay out the contractual groundwork for a sane customer relationship, especially when dealing with changes.
