I have a colleague sitting next to me who designed an interface like this:               public interface IEventGetter {              public List<FooType> getFooList(String fooName, Date start, Date end)             throws Exception;         ....          }      The problem is, right now, we are not using this "end" parameter anywhere in our code, it's just there because we might have to use it some time in the future. We are trying to convince him it's a bad idea to put parameters into interfaces that are of no use right now, but he keeps on insisting that a lot of work will have to be done if we implement the use of "end" date some time later and have to adapt all the code then. Now, my question is, are there any sources that are handling a topic like this of "respected" coding gurus that we can link him to?
