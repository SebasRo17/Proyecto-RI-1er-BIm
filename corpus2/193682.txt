I'm heading a new team of developers working on a software project that makes use of continuous integration (circleci) w/ a pretty fleshed out suite of busterjs unit/integration/acceptance tests. Our project is primarily written w/ coffeescript, and I try to make use of coffeescript-linter to ensure everyone working our code base keeps code consistent and as organized as possible. My question is, does anyone have any thoughts on when/if/how to enforce linting? Should I integrate linting into my tests that are executed by circleci before deployment? Another thought I had was writing a simple shell script that combines git-push and the linting utility into one step and then including it in the project & having everyone use it. I'm pretty new to managing teams of programmers so anyone else's feedback is much appreciated. EDIT: In the last 3 seconds it just occurred to me that git-hooks is probably perfect for this. Specifically a git-hook on commit.
