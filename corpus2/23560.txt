I have hand-written 60 pixel times 60 pixel squares. I need to detect whether they are empty, x or circle. TextRecognize function fails. Is there some other function to process this kind of raster images with text? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NWXCe.png) **Harder example** > **Circles:** (0,0..9), (0..5,0), (0..5,9), (5,0..9) > > **Crosses:** (2,3..6), (4,4..5) > > **Empty:** (1,1..8), (2,1..2), (3,1..8), (4,1..3), (4,6..8) * * * I try to summarize and help people to solve the harder puzzle.
