ExportString["Test","HTML"]     Export["Test.html","test","HTML"]           <link href="HTMLFiles/m-478f1adf-0b36-429c-9ee2-ff6f5c953e52.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />      the Directory is HTMLFiles How to make it be the absolute directory, For instance               Directory[]<>"\\HTMLFiles"      One reason is Windows-Live-Writer too dummy to recognize the Directory `HTMLFiles` but Absolute Directory is ok. I done it by `StringReplace` before. Is there any setting in Mathematica?
