I saved an `InterpolationFunction` in a ".mx" files using `DumpSave` on a variable that was scoped by a `Module`. Here is a stripped-down example:               Module[{interpolation},        interpolation=Interpolation[Range[10]];        DumpSave["interpolation.mx", interpolation];     ]      Is there a way to find out the variable name, presumably of the form `interpolation$nnn`, of the expression when I `Get` the interpolation? It is not apparent what the variable is when using               <<"interpolation.mx"      Next time I will not use a `Module` for scoping the save variable, but meantime I'd like to access the saved data and assign it to a new variable.
