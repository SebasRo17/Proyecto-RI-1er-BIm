I didn't ask how the quality of the software is important to the product itself, the customers/users, the manager or the company. I want to know how it is important to the **programmer** that build it. I'll be interested in any **books** (please specify the chapter), **articles** , **blog post** , and of course your **personal opinion** on the subject regardless your experience.
