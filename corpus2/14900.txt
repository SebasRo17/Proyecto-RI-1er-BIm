The documentation for `SystemDialogInput` shows how to restrict the types of files shown.               SystemDialogInput["FileOpen",".nb"]      ...only shows _Mathematica_ notebook files. This also works for other file extensions such as ".txt", ".html", etc., but doesn't work for other file types. If I have a tab delimited file that with extension ".data" and try:               SystemDialogInput["FileOpen",".data"]      ...the dialog box defaults to all files. Is there a way to only show other "non-standard" file types?
