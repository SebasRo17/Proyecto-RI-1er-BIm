I'm sole developer of a complex critical software system, written in Visual C++ 2005. It's deployed on a classical Microsoft cluster scenario (active/passive), that has Windows Server 2003 R2. If a server A goes down, the other one (B) starts and take the ownership of its duties. You have to know that:   * Both servers have the same Microsoft patches/fixes, same hardware, same everything.   * Both servers use the same memory storage (a RAID-6 through fiber channel).   * This software has a main module that launches the peripheral modules. if a peripheral module crashes, the main module restarts it. When I switch the application in one of the two servers (let's say the B server) two of the peripheral modules of the main applications just started to crash apparently without reason about 2 seconds after the start of the peripheral module. **What could I do to analyze/inspect/resolve this weird situation?**
