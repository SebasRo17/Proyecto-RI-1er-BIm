I need to rename a number of files. These are graphic jpg files, and I have an Excel table in which the initial names of these files are collected. For example, this is the name of one of these files taken from the table: 121026_DeviceData\63486504438_Osc.jpg My problem is that the above name in my Excel file is a hyperlink, rather than a string. By directly addressing this hyperliknk from Mathematica a notebook with a mess inside opens, instead of the desired image. My question is: How could I clean the text of this file name off from its hyperlink property, such that after the cleaning I get a pure string "121026_DeviceData\63486504438_Osc.jpg" instead of the hyperlink? Added later: I have found such an approach:               (hyperlinkText/.Hyperlink->String)[[1]]      that returns me a string: "121026_DeviceData\63486252521_Osc.jpg" With this the question is answered, though somebody might propose a better solution.
