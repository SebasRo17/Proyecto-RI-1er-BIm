I have an MVC3 project that uses SQL Server. I use data from the SQL database all the time and I often find that I'm reusing/duplicating some SQL queries. I thought I'd solve this problem by creating a few static "helper" classes that just contain a bunch of static methods for retrieving common things.               GetAllUsers(database As MyEntity)     GetAllNonActivatedUsers(database As MyEntity)     GetUser(database As MyEntity, userId As Integer)      The problem is that this made things slightly worse. Now instead of having SQL queries all over my controller actions, there are large numbers of them in these helper classes. The names of these methods are becoming silly.               GetPendingUserApplicationByApplicationId(database as MyEntity,         applicationId As Integer, userId As Integer)      At this stage I'm thinking of scrapping the helper classes and going back to just random SQL queries throughout my controller actions. Where have I gone wrong and how do people manage their SQL queries? Is it ok to duplicate SQL queries?
