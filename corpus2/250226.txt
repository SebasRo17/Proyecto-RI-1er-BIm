Our security team at work did a security scan of our soon-to-be-deployed website and one of the items that was found was "Hidden Directory Detected". It shows up for 3 different folders, aspnet_client, scripts, and content. The software recommends to throw a 404 instead of a 403, or to remove the folders completely. First, are the folders actually needed? How can I determine which folders in my visual studio project are actually needed in order for the site to actually run (without removing folders one-at-a-time and trying to access the site)? What is the proper way to handle this/resolve the security scan alert? Do I need to add special routing rules in the routeconfig.cs for when these paths are accessed? Edit, I should note that this is WebApi/REST service, not a regular MVC site. (Therefore, using the CustomErrors configuration section will not work)
