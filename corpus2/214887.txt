I'm creating an application that sits in the background and records all key presses (currently this is done and working; an event is fired every keydown/keyup). I want to offer a feature for the user that will show them their WPM over the entire session the program has been running for. This would be easy if I added a "Start" and "End" button to activate a timer, but I need to detect only when the user is typing continuously - ignoring all one-time keyboard shortcuts and breaks the user takes from typing. How in the world do I approach this? Is this even realistically & accurately possible?
