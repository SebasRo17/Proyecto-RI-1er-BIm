I got about 100 images of the sun and have to find the centre of the star in the images. I have binarized the images and used `ComponentMeasurements`to find the `Centroid` and the `EquivalentDiskRadius`. So far so good, but I have noticed that in Mma's calculation the centroid appears to have the tendency to gravitate slightly towards the right bottom edge. I first thought that is due to the fact the the disk of the sun is a slight ellipse due to objective imperfection etc but I can replicate the effect with an image I create in Mma using the `Disk` command.               disk = Rasterize[Graphics[{Disk[]}], ImageResolution -> 100];     ndisk = 1 /.        ComponentMeasurements[        ColorNegate@disk, {"Centroid", "EquivalentDiskRadius"}];     pdisk = 1 /.        ComponentMeasurements[disk, {"Centroid", "EquivalentDiskRadius"}];     Show[{disk,        Graphics[{{Red, Circle[ndisk[[1]], ndisk[[2]]]}, {Green,           Circle[pdisk[[1]], pdisk[[2]]]}}]}]      The result of the centroid calculation depends also on whether the disk is positive or negative. What am I missing here or how could I fit a circle to a binary image which contains a **slightly** distorted disk? ![Result of the above Show command](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wTFDS.png) **Edit:** Based on some of the answers I simpified the input image by using an even and an odd sized array.               m = {{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},{0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0},{0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},        {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0},{0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},{0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0},        {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}};          k = {{0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0},{0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0},{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},        {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},{0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0},{0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0}};          circ = 1 /.        ComponentMeasurements[m, {"Centroid", "EquivalentDiskRadius"}]     (* {{3.5, 3.5}, 2.03421} *)          circ2 = 1 /.        ComponentMeasurements[k, {"Centroid", "EquivalentDiskRadius"}]     (* {{3., 3.}, 2.76395} *)          Show[{ArrayPlot[m],        Graphics[{Red, Thick, Circle[circ[[1]], circ[[2]]]}]}]     Show[{ArrayPlot[k],        Graphics[{Red, Thick, Circle[circ2[[1]], circ2[[2]]]}]}]      Gives the results below. ComponentMeasurements finds the right centre in both cases what is off is the Circle that I draw over it. Look at the sizes of the small triangle the circle cuts off the black squares. ![ArrayPlot 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Qlz6.png) ![ArrayPlot 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4xTTI.png)
