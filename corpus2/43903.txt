Suppose we have many expressions involving irrational ArcTan expressions (such as `ArcTan[Sqrt[3],5]`) along with other irrational factors (such as `1/Sqrt[2]`). I want to simplify all of these ArcTans. For example, I might want to apply `N@` to them to get their decimal approximation, or, I might want to apply `Rationalize` as in               N@ArcTan[Sqrt[3], 5]     (* out: 1.23732 *)             Rationalize[ArcTan[Sqrt[3], 5]/Pi, .0001] Pi       (* out: 13 Pi/33 *)        However, I would like to be able to implement either of these options throughout large expressions involving many ArcTan functions and not act on any other forms. Simple example would be:               m = 1/Sqrt[3]+ Sqrt[2] ArcTan[Sqrt[3], 5]        How can I apply a rule or something to m that will allow me to implement one of these types of solutions to the ArcTan but not act on the other irrational factors?
