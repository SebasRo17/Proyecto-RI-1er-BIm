I found out that,it is INCREDIBLY(like 100 times) faster to use `Dot` instead of `Sum`,to perform long sums. But I have not been able to use this alternative to perform the following sum:               a={{b,c},{d,e}};          a[[1]]+a[[2]]      I want to get this output: > >     {b,c}+{d,e}={b+d,c+e} >   I tried:               a.{1,1}      but did not work. The easy way to do it is:               Sum[a[[i]],{i,1,2}];      But I want to avoid this slow way. Any faster alternative?
