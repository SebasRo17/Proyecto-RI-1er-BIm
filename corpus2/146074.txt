We use TortoiseSVN, but we have no bug tracking system. I know, lame, but beyond my control. There were times when svn wasn't in daily use. Now I've had succeeded in pressing for using it regularly, with proper merging, branching, tagging etc. As you could expect, the number of revisions increased in result, which makes browsing repository log a bit troublesome now. I thought about utilizing some convention based on keywords ("[bugfix]", "[feature]", "[refactored]", "[minor]", "[merged-from-trunk]"... :) so as to make it more searchable. It feels like reinventing the wheel, though. Is there any established convention for that? Or is my approach wrong from the beginning? Any better, alternative solution?
