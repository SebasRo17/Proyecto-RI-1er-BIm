I'm trying to do some operations to a matrix in a loop, and then I want to graph the results. The results are pair of numbers. Can I store the results of each iteration on "something" and the use that to graph it? Or can I convert this loop in some kind of function that I an use for instance in `Plot[myfunction, {x, 0, 10}]`               For[i = 2, i < 50, i++,      iM = {{0.3, 0, 0.5, 0.2}, {0, 0.4, 0.3, 0.3}, {0.3, 0.2, 0,          0.5}, {0.4, 0.1, 0, 0.5}};      staDis = {0.300400534045394, 0.12683578104138837,         0.18825100133511352, 0.38451268357810403};      iMP = MatrixPower[iM, i];      iMPV = iMP[[4]];      y = Norm[iMPV - staDis, 1]/2;      Print["i ", i];      Print["y ",  y ];      Print[" "];      ]
