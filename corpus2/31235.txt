I want to add a new vertex to a graph, with fixed VertexCoordinates but when I use VertexAdd, the new graph does not have the VertexCoordinates of the previous one.               g = Graph[{1 -> 2}, VertexCoordinates -> {{0, 0.5}, {0.5, 0}},        PlotRange -> 1]      This is the initial graph               g = VertexAdd[g, 3]      Adding a new vertex makes a new graph with automatic coordinates. I tried to see if there is a way to define the coordinates when adding a new vertex but I could not find anything. Also I was looking if there is something like:               SetProperty[g, VectorCoordinates -> {list of coordinates}]      To set coordinates for all vertices in a graph, but I could not find anything.
