How is the `end()` function implemented in deque-STL of C++ with array? As per my knowledge it returns past-the-end element. But when a loop is run like, `for(i=deq.begin();i!=deq.end();i++)` and the whole array is full (suppose size=4), then I think `end()` will point to the position where `begin()` is pointing, in this way it won't go in the for loop. How to resolve this problem?
