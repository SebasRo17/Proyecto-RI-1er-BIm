I have a question regarding generalization. I know when it is needed to be done, but is it worth having an extra class for 1 field? e.g.: `StatisticsCustomer` has fields: `Customer customer` and `int projectCount` `StatisticsCountry` has fields: `Country country` and `int projectCount` What is best in this situation? Creating an extra class just for projectCount or keeping it twice in the two classes?
