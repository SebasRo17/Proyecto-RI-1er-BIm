I`m a guest here, and thought I could just ask you guys. `I've tried filling in mathematica's support form on their website, but all I got was an e-mail telling me to use their support form!` \- and I'm not phoning them! - I live in Scotland! My problem is that I have downloaded mathematica 10 upgrade, and have opened new notebooks, closed them, and when I try to open them again, a message comes up with something about the book having potentially damaging "dynamic content" - which it doesn`t! - tried it with just saving a notebook with a simple quadratic equation in it! If I press the "enable dynamic content - nothing happens, and I have to create blank documents in mathematica 8 that will successfully open in version 10. What can I do about this myself, if anything? * * * I've given up using it and I'm just using my laptop with mathematica 9 the exact message is: " this notebook contains potentially harmfull dynamic content. Do you still wish to open?"
