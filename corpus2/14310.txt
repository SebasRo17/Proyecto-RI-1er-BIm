I have defined an expression, such as               a = x      I would like to convert this into a function, such as               f[x_]:=x      However, in my case, the expression on the right-hand-side of `a` is rather complicated, so I do not want to manually write the expression on the right- hand-side of the function definition. I would like to write something like               f[x_]:=a      I know that this will not work. Is there a way to evaluate `a` in the function definition to ensure that I have actually defined a function in the end?
