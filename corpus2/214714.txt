Current field-of-use restrictions defined in "Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products" prohibit its use in embedded systems. > "General Purpose Desktop Computers and Servers" means computers, including > desktop and laptop computers, or servers, used for general computing > functions under end user control (such as but not specifically limited to > email, general purpose Internet browsing, and office suite productivity > tools). The use of Software in systems and solutions that provide dedicated > functionality (other than as mentioned above) or designed for use in > _embedded_ or function-specific software applications... are excluded from > this definition and _not licensed_ under this Agreement. Do these restrictions also apply to OpenJDK and other possible implementations? Is the only way to use Java in such an environment to acquire a separate license from Oracle?
