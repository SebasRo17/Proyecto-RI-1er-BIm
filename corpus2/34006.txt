I have a 4x4 symmetric matrix that is obtained by solving some equations. I tried deleting duplicates with `DeleteDuplicates`, but that's not working with nested lists (elements of those lists that are the same). So I have this $$\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} \\ a_{41} & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44} \\ \end{pmatrix}\to a_{nm}=a_{mn}\to \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\ 0 & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} \\ 0 & 0 & a_{33} & a_{34} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & a_{44} \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ I'd like to be able to remove lower triangle of a matrix but only if they are the same. How to do that?
