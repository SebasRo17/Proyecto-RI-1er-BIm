I want to get the end points of an Edge of a Graph. For example see the following source,               In[1]:=gFriendShip = ExampleData[{"NetworkGraph", "Friendship"}];     In[2]:= EdgeList[gFriendShip, "Rose" \[UndirectedEdge] _]     Out[2]:={"Anna" \[UndirectedEdge] "Rose", "Ben" \[UndirectedEdge] "Rose",       "Rose" \[UndirectedEdge] "Nora"}      Now I want to write something like `EndPoints["Rose" \\[UndirectedEdge] "Nora"]` (actually, `EndPoints[%2]` in the above example) and want to get `{"Rose", "Nora"}` as output. It might be a basic thing, but I am new to _Mathematica_. I am using _Mathematica 9.0_.
