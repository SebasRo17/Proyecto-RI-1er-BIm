After reading rcollyer's post I'm still not able to understand how grouping rules work. Here is a problem I'm facing. What I want is to create a new title, section and subsection styles. I want the title to group everything below till the next title. The section should group everything below till the next section. To see what I mean, open up a new notebook. Go to `Format > Edit Stylesheet...`. On this stylesheet make a new cell. Then select this cell and go to `Cell > Show Expression`. Here enter the following:               Cell[StyleData["MyTitle"],      CellGroupingRules->{"MyTitleGrouping", 0},      CounterIncrements->"MyTitle",      CounterAssignments->{{"MySection", 0}, {"MySubsection", 0}},      FontSize->26,     ]       Once this has been entered now go to `Cell > Show Expression` to revert back. Let us create two more cells in the same fashion, one for the section and subsection.               Cell[StyleData["MySection"],      CellGroupingRules->{"MyTitleGrouping", 10},      CounterIncrements->"MySection",      CounterAssignments->{{"MySubsection", 0}},      CellFrameLabels->{{         Cell[          TextData[           CounterBox["MySection"], " -"], CellBaseline -> Baseline], Inherited}, {        Inherited, Inherited}},      FontSize->20,     ]      Finally, the subsection:               Cell[StyleData["MySubsection"],      CellGroupingRules->{"MyTitleGrouping", 20},      CellFrameLabels->{{         Cell[          TextData[           CounterBox["MySection"], ".",            CounterBox["MySubsection"], " -"], CellBaseline -> Baseline],          Inherited}, {Inherited, Inherited}},      CounterIncrements->"MySubsection",      FontSize->16,     ]      After creating those new styles, now we can use them, here is a screenshot of what I obtained if I use the "MyTitle", "MySection" and "MySubsection" styles. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zh8fg.png) Don't mind the text I entered there. The main point here is that there is no grouping. How can I make it behave as the regular "Title", "Section" and "Subsection" styles? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/t7Rxh.png)
