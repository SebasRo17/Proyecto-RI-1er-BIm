There is a new developer in our team. An agile methodology is in use at our company. But the developer has another experience: he considers that particular parts of the code must be assigned to particular developers. So if one developer had created a program procedure or module it would be considered normal that all changes of the procedure/module would be made by him only. On the plus side, supposedly with the proposed approach we save common development time, because each developer knows his part of the code well and makes fixes fast. The downside is that developers don't know the system entirely. Do you think the approach will work well for a medium size system (development of a social network site)?
