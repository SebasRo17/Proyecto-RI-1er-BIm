I can load my library, but I cannot unload it with `LibraryUnload`. I do have a `void WolframLibrary_uninitialize(WolframLibraryData libData)` (which does nothing). I get the following error:               LibraryFunction::unloadlib: The library "/my/library.so" cannot be unloaded.      I am not loading any function after loading the library. The OS is Linux x86_64. I don't seem to be able to unload not even the demo library:               LibraryLoad@"demo"     LibraryUnload@%      This gets me the same error. EDIT: As worked out by Szabolc and halirutan, I need to load one function at least (`LibraryFunctionLoad`) to have the initialization function called, and so being able to call `LibraryUnload` successfully. Yet, my ultimate goal is to be able to reload a new build of the library: this seems impossible because calling `LibraryUnload` doesn't actually close the handle of the library, and further calls to `LibraryFunctionLoad` reuse it. I checked with `lsof`, and if I delete the library and try to reload it I get that the new file is ignored and instead a handle to the old file (tagged correctly as `DEL` in `lsof`) is kept.
