I'm trying to force _Mathematica_ to use following transformation function               tf[e_] :=        e /. {BarnesG[1 + 2 x_] :>           2^(x (2 x - 1)) Pi^(-x - 1/2) (           BarnesG[3/2 + x] BarnesG[1/2 + x] BarnesG[1 + x]^2)/           BarnesG[1/2]^2};      After evaluation of the previous line simplification               Simplify[BarnesG[1 + 2 x],       TransformationFunctions -> {Automatic, tf}]      does not yield desirable result but instead returns original               BarnesG[1 + 2 x]      What am I doing wrong? Any help is appreciated, thank you!
