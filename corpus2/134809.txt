My current project takes 8 seconds to build one C++ file. Is this common? Other files take 12-15 seconds but most at the moment are about 8 seconds. I use Visual Studio to tell me the time. I have gone into the headers and removed things I didn't need and used forward declaration. It did save me about 2 seconds per file and one header takes about 4 seconds to go through alone. In that header I need all its declarations and using a lite version which removes private methods public functions I don't need. Should I be happy it's 8 or so seconds or is that too long to compile one file?
