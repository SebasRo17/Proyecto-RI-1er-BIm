The following was the code:               Directory[]     NotebookDirectory[]      The output was               "/media/Dataholder/final"          "/media/Dataholder/final/"      In the second case, there is a trailing **"/"** (I am on Mathematica 8 on Ubuntu) Just curious, why is there a difference ? Is is specific to my machine ? I found this when this was breaking the code, wherein I wanted to change the working directory to another one relative to the current directory, i.e. using               simFldr = Directory[] <> "anotherSubDirectory"      Though this sounds trivial, the patchwork needed to get to that directory will be non trivial since I have a code which must work **both on Windows and Unix**. Any _smart_ solution to set the directory to a subdirectory ?
