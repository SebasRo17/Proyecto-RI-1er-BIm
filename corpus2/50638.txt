Suppose I have a matrix               A={{1, 2}, {3, 4}}      that defines the positions of non-zero values in a sparse array:               S=SparseArray[Table[p1 = A[[i, 1]]; p2 = A[[i, 2]]; {p1, p2} -> 77, {i, Dimensions[A][[1]]}]];     ArrayRules@S     {{1, 2} -> 77, {3, 4} -> 77, {_, _} -> 0}      Is it possible to construct such a sparse array without explicitly building the table of correspondence, by using a single rule that extracts the positions of non-zero elements from matrix A? Mathematica documentation shows examples of such rules, e.g.               SparseArray[{{i_, j_} /; Abs[i - j] <= 1 -> -2 + 3 Abs[i - j]}, {5,5}]      How should a similar rule be devised for my case? Thank you!
