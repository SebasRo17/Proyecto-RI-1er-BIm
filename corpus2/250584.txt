I have a main View which has several sections and a main dropdown at the top which defines how the rest of the view looks like. All these sections have some data that is visible all the time, and some that need to be hidden when certain values are chosen in the main dropdown. As of now, I have partial views for each section, and I am having lots of if/else statements in my view to show/hide the specifics, which is getting clumsier by the day.
