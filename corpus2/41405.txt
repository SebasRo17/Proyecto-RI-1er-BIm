Has anyone figured out how to coerce ContinuousMarkovProcess to work with a state vector, transition matrix, and rate (propensity) vector, and RandomFunction to return pairs of state vector and time, so one can model chemical kinetics? The state vector contains the number of molecules of each species, and there are an infinite number of states in the traditional sense, so the state graph is infinite. I have code for version based on version 8, but would like to make use of the new functions in version 9. Here is a simple example of Lotka-Voltera system: ![LT reactions](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sD1uF.png) ODES:               {Derivative[1][Subscript[Y, 1]][t] ==        Subscript[c, 1] Subscript[Y, 1][t] -         Subscript[c, 2] Subscript[Y, 1][t] Subscript[Y, 2][t],       Derivative[1][Subscript[Y, 2]][        t] == -Subscript[c, 3] Subscript[Y, 2][t] +         Subscript[c, 2] Subscript[Y, 1][t] Subscript[Y, 2][t]}      Initial conditions:               {Subscript[Y, 1][0] == 4, Subscript[Y, 2][0] == 10}      Parameters:               {Subscript[c, 1] -> 1., Subscript[c, 2] -> 0.1,       Subscript[c, 3] -> 0.1}      Transition Matrix:               {{1, 0}, {-1, 1}, {0, -1}}      Propensities:               {Subscript[c, 1] Subscript[Y, 1][t],       Subscript[c, 2] Subscript[Y, 1][t] Subscript[Y, 2][t],       Subscript[c, 3] Subscript[Y, 2][t]}      Initial state vector:               {4, 10}      Thanks, Bob
