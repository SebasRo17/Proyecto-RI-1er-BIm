Actually I tend to write with 4 fingers, my actual typing speed is in average 110~120 ( using http://www.typingtest.com/ with an spanish from spain ) I have some time trying to force myself to use 5 fingers, It's kind of weird, but I have noticed that when i'm writing a text like this, fingers tend to be in a really natural position, with time I could handle this... But when i'm programming everything is weir,using alt+tab is weird, using ctrl+b is wird, and all those shorcuts that some terminal related programs use, the "natural 5 fingers way" is natural just when i have to write text, but that don't apply when there is a lot of symbols like . -> ( ) [ ] " " && || , etc... Is there somebody that actually use 5 fingers to type?, is comfortable to write code using 5 fingers using that kind of "natural way" ? worth the effort to learn to use the 5 fingers?
