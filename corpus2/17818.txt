I am interested in working alternative to _Mathematica_ 's FrontEnd for rendering `Graphics3D` produced by _Mathematica_. The requrements are:   * An ability to import `Graphics3D` objects exported from _Mathematica_ in any of 3D export formats supported by _Mathematica_.    * It seems that in most cases _Mathematica_ 's support of 3-rd party 3D geometry formats is incomplete ( _Mathematica_ does not export the complete scene description). So the second requirement is that recovering of dropped parts of the scene description would be as easy as possible. I am most interested in rendering polygonal surfaces computed by _Mathematica_ which are presented internally as `GraphicsComplex`. It will be very appreciated if an answerer show the complete way to render some simple _Mathematica_ -generated surface with several point light sources like this:               lightSources = {{"Point", Red, {1/2, 1, 1}},                      {"Point", Green, {1, 1/2, 1}},                      {"Point", Blue, {0, 0, 1}}};     pl = Show[       Plot3D[Sin[x*y*Pi^2], {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1},         Lighting -> lightSources],        Graphics3D[{PointSize[Large],          Point[lightSources[[All, 3]],           VertexColors -> lightSources[[All, 2]]]}]]      ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Arypd.png)
