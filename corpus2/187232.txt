I am working on sorting out my **Javascript** code. Currently I have views implemented without any Model or collection. Now I working on separating Model from View. So for this transformation, I am planning as follows:                        View --->  X  <--- | ---> Server               <  Client side  >      Assumptions:   1. View will not have any data that is to be loaded form server.   2. X will talk to server and get the required data. Then X will fire event.   3. View will listen to events and update themselves accordingly.   4. X is not an exact replica of some entity on server. X will just take those entities/ data from server and then View can request this data from X.   5. There will be exactly one X for each View. Now question is -- What is X called?   Options -- Model, Controller, ViewModel, Presenter, or anything else.   Or Is this very crude thing which can not have terminology?
