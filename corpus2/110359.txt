I'm a senior in college and am getting close to graduation. I love programming, and I certainly want my first job to involve programming (I'm also looking at fit, culture, location, etc. etc.). I've noticed that some major consulting firms are recruiting from my school's engineering department and are looking for computer science majors. I'm considering going out to a few info sessions to get a feel for the work, but in general, what does a programmer do at a company like this? If the company is looking to fill a position called "Business Analyst" with a computer science major, will the job likely even involve any programming? If it does, how might this work vary from a typical programming job at a software company? Here is an example of the type of company I see recruiting.
