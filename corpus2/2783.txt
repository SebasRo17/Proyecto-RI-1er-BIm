Personally I prefer space around operators. For me it makes the code much more readable. What are the arguments not have space around them? Line length? An example from the Python style guide (I agree with this): Yes:                 i = i + 1       submitted += 1       x = x * 2 - 1       hypot2 = x * x + y * y       c = (a + b) * (a - b)      No:                 i=i+1       submitted +=1       x = x*2 - 1       hypot2 = x*x + y*y       c = (a+b) * (a-b)
