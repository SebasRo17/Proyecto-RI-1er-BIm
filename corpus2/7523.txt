I am looking for a concrete code example where `EvaluationNotebook[]` and `ButtonNotebook[]` will return different results. The docs for `ButtonNotebook` say: > If a button in a palette initiates evaluation in another notebook, then > `ButtonNotebook[]` will be the palette, but `EvaluationNotebook[]` will be > the other notebook. How can a palette button initiate an evaluation in a different notebook? A basic test where they return the same (the palette):               CreatePalette[      Button["press", Print@{EvaluationNotebook[], ButtonNotebook[]}]]      I am looking for an example where `EvaluationNotebook` and `ButtonNotebook` return different results _when invoked from the same button_. Of course `ButtonNotebook` will return `$Failed` when not invoked from a button. * * * **Addendum** I'd like to point out that this question is not merely of theoretical interest. The fact that `ButtonNotebook` exists at all suggests that it must be different from `EvaluationNotebook` in some non-trivial way. Understanding the behaviour of `EvaluationNotebook`/`ButtonNotebook` is important to create robust code that will work correctly in edge cases too. I can not see their difference, so there must be some edge case I have not thought of.
