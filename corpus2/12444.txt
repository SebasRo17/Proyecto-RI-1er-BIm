In maths, a variable means you can put any number there, and an equation will still be true:               root(square(x)) = abs(x)      In programming languages, this is not so: a var can change. In Python:               y = (x**2)**.5     x *= 2     assert y == abs(x)      will raise an exception, since x in the last line is not the same. Are there programming languages that use immutable variables?
