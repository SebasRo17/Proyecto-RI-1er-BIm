I'm currently writing a python script. It's currently about 400 lines long, and it seems like it's getting a bit long, as when I'm trying to scroll through it with eclipse it takes a bit to get from function A to function B. The structure is that it reads in a file, and then performs actions on what it reads in depending on the flags passed in by the user on the command line. Everything is more or less related (and in fact many functions call on other functions), so it makes sense in that regard to just leave everything in the same file. I'm currently adding more features, or more things that can be put in for command line flags, and I'm wondering if there are any standards about how long a file should be before you start putting things into a new file. PEP 8 mentions the length of a line but nothing on the length of a file. In summary: Are there any standards for how long a file should be before you just start throwing stuff into a new file?
