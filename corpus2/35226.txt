I have two images from motor scan, Image1 is shifted by MxN pixels from Image2. How can I find the shift between Image1 and Image2 ? Image -1 ![1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/laZeT.png) Image -2 ![2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LAHyF.png) If we compare the shift between the images in terms of {X,Y} I will be able to tell how many steps of the motor scan corresponds to the pixel shift on the image array sensor.
