I have a list of strings called `mylist`:               mylist = {"[a]", "a", "a", "[b]", "b", "b", "[ c ]", "c", "c"};      I would like to split `mylist` by "section headers." Strings that begin with the character `[` are section headers in my application. Thus, I would like to split `mylist` in such a way as to obtain this output:               {{"[a]", "a", "a"}, {"[b]", "b", "b"}, {"[ c ]", "c", "c"}}      (The `a`s, `b`s, and `c`s represent _any_ characters; the string inside the section header does _not_ necessarily match the strings that follow in that section. Also, the number of strings in each section can vary. I have tried:               SplitBy[mylist, StringMatchQ[#, "[" ~~ ___] &]      But this is not correct; I obtain:               {{"[a]"}, {"a", "a"}, {"[b]"}, {"b", "b"}, {"[ c ]"}, {"c", "c"}}      Likewise, using `Split` (since it applies the test function only to adjacent elements) does not work. The command:               Split[mylist, StringMatchQ[#, "[" ~~ ___] &]      yields:               {{"[a]", "a"}, {"a"}, {"[b]", "b"}, {"b"}, {"[ c ]", "c"}, {"c"}}      Do you have any advice? Thanks.
