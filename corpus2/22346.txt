Question 1(Color Lost Question[Solved by using `Item`]): When I evaluate the cell generated by               Grid[WordData /@ {"what","my"}, Frame -> True,        Background -> {None, {LightRed, Pink}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SSGH8.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qtSIh.jpg) it looks good in my notebook, but the color get lost when I save the notebook as an HTML file. The same thing happens with some other functions, such as `Column`. I've spent some time to solve the problem and I found a solution which can partly solve the problem is to use `Item` to set the background colour. However, the `ItemSize` is still not working properly when the notebook is saved as HTML format. Here is the code:               Column[Table[Grid[Map[Item[Text@Style[#, FontSize->50,        FontColor->RGBColor@@RandomReal[{0,1},3]],        Background->RGBColor@@RandomReal[{0,1},3],        FrameStyle->AbsoluteThickness[3]]&,        resultListToUse[[i]],{2}],        Alignment->{{Center,Center,Center}},        Frame->All,        ItemSize->{20,5},        Spacings->{{20,20,20},1}],{i,Length@resultListToUse[[1;;4]]}],        Background->LightRed]      Here is my sample blog: quaternions.blog.163.com/blog/static/206082147201323095141897 Now I can select the words in the colored frame, however the words in one row are two tight with no enough spaces. Because some options such like `ItemSize` and `Spacings` didn't work properly when the notebook is saved as .html question2(Spaces Lost question): I want to convert the cell generated by `Grid` to HTML format with content is "Plaintext". I found that the `ItemSize` setting will no longer work properly when convert the output cell to HTML format. As cormullion show in the answer, when The output content in HTML is gif pictures, they looks good. How to make the words in one row with enough spaces?
