I sought help from this entry at Calling MATLAB from Mathematica to see if I could CONVERT a mathlab program which simulates polymer dynamics that is provided at the download section at http://tx.technion.ac.il/~yoniw/CompPhysProjectHtml/PolymerSimProject.htm#_Toc353147515 into a mathematica-10 code. Any ideas as to how the conversion can be done? The origin program simulates the behaviour of chained polymer placed in a solvent of interacting particles, and employs dissipative particle dynamics. There is a linear search via parallel computing. Not clear how this can be implemented in MMA.
