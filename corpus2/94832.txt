I work at a small software company where the owners are also the managers. My concern is that any and all progression in technology is met with utter disdain by management. Some of the comments are as follows:   * LINQ, nHibernate, and ORM are bad programming practice, we will never use them.   * The majority of large applications are still written in VB6.   * The web is just a waste of time, its not meant for applications. Every time a new version of development software is released, I have to listen to the management complain about it for hours. Technologies like WPF, WCF, MVC and Entity are completely ignored. All that said, its not a horrible place to work, the pay is average and its close to home. My concern is that, even though we are technically using the latest version of .NET, we are hardly using the latest technologies, we might as well be using .NET 1. If I decide to move, will this "experience" limit me career wise? I have been here for a few years already. EDIT: I am really grateful for the superb response. I honestly think it might be in my own best interest to make a move.
