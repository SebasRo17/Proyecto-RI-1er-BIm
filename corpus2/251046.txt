I'm trying to redevelop a mobile website so we can integrate it into a mobile app that is being developed by another department, but still keep it functional on the web. The app has its own menu, so it's redundant to leave the menu on the mobile site. We considered simply removing the menu, headers and footers from the site, and provide the links to the pages to the other department so they can add them to the app menu. This obviously leaves our website menu-less. I've considered creating a new front page, that has a similar menu to the app, and loading the pages either in frames, or using jquery .load(), or ASP includes... Frames would give me the functionality I want that is most similar to the app opening pages in a browser using it's native menu, but frames are so... 1990's. What is best solution that uses modern standards?
