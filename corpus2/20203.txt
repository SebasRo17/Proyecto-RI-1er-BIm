When considering this question about re-formatting `Cell` (also this one), I encountered an issue which confuses me. I'll let the code itself speak: Consider the following simple `Cell` expression, which contains a comment line:               cellexpr =        Cell[BoxData[{RowBox[{RowBox[{"a", ";"}], "\[IndentingNewLine]",             RowBox[{"(*", RowBox[{"b", ";"}], "*)"}]}],           "\[IndentingNewLine]", "c"}], "Input"];      Write it to a `Notebook`:               testnb = NotebookCreate[];     NotebookWrite[testnb, cellexpr];      It looks like the following, which is what one would expect: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9ozU1.jpg) Now read the `Cell` expression back from `testnb`:               SelectionMove[testnb, Before, Notebook];     SelectionMove[testnb, Next, Cell];     NotebookRead[testnb]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DDMrU.png) Note the first `RowBox`, it has a structure as `RowBox[ item1, item2, ...]`, which is ill-posed since _the first argument to RowBox must be a list_. And the obtained `Cell` expression is therefor ill-posed, which can be seen by `CellPrint`-ing it: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PY050.jpg) I noticed that if the comment-line part is removed (e.g. by deleting `"(*"` and `"*)"` in `cellexpr`), everything works fine. And for the example in this question, the second comment is correctly obtained: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rwS6u.png) # My question: Did I miss something? Or is this a bug?
