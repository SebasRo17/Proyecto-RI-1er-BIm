I used to analyse performance of programmers in my team by looking at the issues they have closed. Many of the issues are of course bugs. And here another important performance aspect comes - who introduced the bugs. I am wondering, if creating a custom field in the issue tracking system "Blamed" for reporting the person who generated the problem, is a good practice. One one hand it seems ok to me to promote personal responsibility for quality and this could reduce the additional work we have due to careless programming. On the other hand this is negative, things are sometimes vague and sometimes there is a reason such us "this thing had to be done very quickly due to a client's...". What to you think?
