I have the expression `Sin[c x]/c`. Clearly it is undefined at $c=0$, but that is merely a removable singularity, since $$\frac{\sin(cx)}c=x\frac{\sin(cx)}{cx}= x\operatorname{sinc}(cx),$$ which is continuous everywhere. Is it possible to get this sort of transformation automatically in Mathematica using the built-in formula manipulation tools? I tried a few things like `FullSimplify`, `TrigReduce`, etc. but nothing helped. I'd like to be able to do this for `(1 - Cos[c x])/c`, too; that is, automatically transform it into a form that has no singularity at $c=0$.
