I have two curves (drawn from points) in a plane, one is drawn with `ListLinePlot` and the other drawn with `ParametricPlot`. How can I determine the intersection between both curves? I cannot use (don't know how to) interpolation directly, since the curves are not graphs. Let's say we have                r[\[Phi]_] = 1 + 1/20 Sin[20 \[Phi]];       tb = Table[{r[\[Phi]] Cos[\[Phi]], r[\[Phi]] Sin[\[Phi]]}, {\[Phi], 0, 2 \[Pi], 0.1}];      ListLinePlot[tb]       and we interpolate data stored in `tb`. E.g. at `x = 0.95` there are 4 (or 5) different values for `y`. How can I plot interpolating function? I am sure I am missing something. Theoretically, I could use interpolation across segments of points on a curve but this is something I want to avoid. Any ideas?
