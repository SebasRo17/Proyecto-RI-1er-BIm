I'm not sure if this is a Mathematica problem, math problem or a CS problem, so if this is off-topic please transfer it. In the package `Combinatorica` there is a function `ListGraphs[n,m]` which returns all nonisomorphic undirected graphs with `n` vertices and `m` edges. What algorithm does it use? All I can think of is to enumerate all graphs with `n` vertices and `m` edges brute-force, and check isomorphism for each graph. But I don't think that's effective. Is there a better algorism for this task? Thanks!
