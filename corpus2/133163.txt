I'm fairly new to SVN and I would be interested in hearing about how other people would organize projects in SVN. We have projects that have different types of source files: C#, SQL, and Matlab. In addition to these types of files, we have Excel and Word file reports that we do not intend to put into SVN. So let's say we have a projects directory:               Projects\     Projects\Project1     Projects\Project2     ...      Now for the SVN repository, would it make sense to categorize things by source file type (C#, SQL, Matlab) then project:               SVN\C#\Project1     SVN\C#\Project2     SVN\SQL\Project1     SVN\SQL\Project2     SVN\Matlab\Project1     SVN\Matlab\Project2      Or would it make more sense to categorize things by project first then source file type:               SVN\Project1\C#     SVN\Project1\SQL     SVN\Project1\Matlab     SVN\Project2\C#     SVN\Project2\SQL     SVN\Project2\Matlab      Or maybe there's a better way to do this? Also, what is the best way to indicate in the Projects folders (not SVN) that a project contains files saved in SVN? Like, if I went into a the project folder for Project1 (Projects\Project1) and only saw Excel and Word reports, what would be the best way to indicate that there are other files checked into an SVN repository? Also, how does everyone feel about putting checked out SVN files on shared drives? So for instance, let's say Projects\Project1 contains the following files:               Report1.doc     Script.sql (This is a checked out SVN files in the Projects folder, which is a shared network drive)      In this situation, it would be very easy to see when there are SVN files used with a project, BUT having the checked out SVN file on a shared drive would make collaboration much more difficult. Is this others do to?
