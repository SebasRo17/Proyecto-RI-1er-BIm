I have a Java code which is writing some data in string format to Messaging queue. Now any one can subscribe to this queue and fetch this data. Here the client fetching this data can be written in any programming language. I was planning to expose this data in JSON format, but then as per my understanding I have to expose my Bean Object, as the Object is needed to parse this JSON string. And in this case I am limiting client to be Java only. I don't want to have any of such a limitations, so now I am looking to expose this data as XML. Any other way so that I can still use JSON here?
