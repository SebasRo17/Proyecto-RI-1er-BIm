I'm trying to make a function `f` that takes a symbol, a value, and a context, and creates the symbol in the requested context and assigns it the passed value. The obvious doesn't work. I.e.:               Attributes[f]={HoldAllComplete};     f[symbol_,value_,context_]:=(Begin[context];Set[symbol,value];End[])      Creates the symbol in the current context, as opposed to the one that is passed as an argument. This seems to happen because the FrontEnd, as soon as it sees `f` getting evaluated, creates the symbol in the current context despite `HoldAllComplete`. I tried adding `Remove[symbol]` to the function but that doesn't work. Any thoughts?
