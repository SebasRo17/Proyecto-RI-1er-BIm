Why does               Solve[Sqrt[x + Sqrt[x]] - Sqrt[x - Sqrt[x]] ==           m Sqrt[x/(x + Sqrt[x])], x, Reals, Method -> Reduce]      give a different result than               Reduce[Sqrt[x + Sqrt[x]] - Sqrt[x - Sqrt[x]] ==            m Sqrt[x/(x + Sqrt[x])], x, Reals]      note that the first one says $1<m<2$ while the second one says $1<m\le 2$.   The documentation says > With `Method->Reduce`, `Solve` uses only equivalent transformations and > finds all solutions.
