I'm trying to implement the differential equation of a Cellular Neural Network in _Mathematica_ as seen below:               A = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};        B = {{9, 8, 7}, {6, 5, 4}, {3, 2, 1}};        u = {{10, 11, 12, 1}, {20, 21, 22, 1}, {66, 77, 88, 1}};     Ioff = 1;          NDSolve[{x'[t] == -x[t] + ListConvolve[A, x[t], 1] + ListConvolve[B, u, 1] + Ioff,     x[0] == u}, x, {t, 0, 2}]      But `NDSolve` returns two errors: > `ListConvolve::kldims:` "The kernel {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}} and list x[t] > are not both non-empty lists with the same tensor rank." > > `NDSolve::ndfdmc:` Computed derivatives do not have dimensionality > consistent with the initial conditions. I would really appreciate any help since I'm a beginner in _Mathematica_ and I don't know what I'm doing wrong
