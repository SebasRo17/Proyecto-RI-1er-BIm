I know some of the basics of these technologies already, but it is mostly limited to more static sites. Using things like HTMl5 semantic elements, CSS3 gradients, shadows, `@font-face` etc. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information on creating highly interactive websites with HTML5/CSS3/JS/jQuery? What about that book makes it special?
