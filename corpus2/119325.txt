I am taking the Stanford Online Machine Learning class which is outstanding. http://ml-class.org Is anyone taking the Stanford Online Database class: http://www.db-class.org? Does it seem useful if you have a few years of fairly simple database experience, but no formal education in the area? Or is it mostly academic and not relevant to developing and maintaining databases in the "real world"?
