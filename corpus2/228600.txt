I've noticed that with remote support services, a technician usually sends you a download link to an executable. When you click on that link, it installs a software which automatically connects with the remote technician and allows him/her to access your computer. Basically, what's happening is that somehow the installed application has a session ID which it's using to identify and connect with the technician. How is that session ID passed onto the downloaded application? Is a custom executable compiled/generated for each session and the executable has that session ID embedded within it's resources? any other method of achieving the same?
