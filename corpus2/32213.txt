I have trouble defining the following function in _Mathematica_               sp[M_, u_] := 1/Sum[u^k M!/(M - k)!, {k, 0, M}]      After defining it _Mathematica_ displays an error. And in fact it prints a pair of values, but my application requires only one, i.e 2 argument function. As the result I need to plot this function in 3D with `u` changing from `0.01` to `1`, and `M` changing `1` to `100`. Any suggestions?
