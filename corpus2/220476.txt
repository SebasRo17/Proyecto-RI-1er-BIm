This is one of the questions that I came across while preparing for a programming interview. > Design a system for Greek philosophers to exchange messages using stone > tablets carried by dumb slaves. Well, the guys who had this question have suggested to use analogy of a TCP/IP protocol to describe the communication and some suggested packet data communication to explain the design. Here is what I think of it going by the clues:   1. The Greek philosophers would act as 'machines' that are trying to communicate.   2. The dumb slaves would be the message carrier which is the 'network' in our analogy.   3. Stone tablets would be messages carried like the 'data packets'.   4. May be the slaves would reach philosophers by asking for the route from some random guys that will lead them to the philosopher's place just like the packets arrive at a destination using routers in the network.   5. And the message could be split in to multiple tablets and so, a message could be eventually carried by more than one slave who might take different paths and arrive in any order. There shall be a way to arrange the message in the correct order on their arrival at the receiver's end. (sequence number in the tablets?)   6. The system should also be able to handle missing tablets and in which case should the sender philosopher try and send the entire message again after a timeout?  **EDIT:**   I would like to ask the following questions:   1. Am I thinking on the correct lines?   2. Are there any important things that I am missing in the things that I have listed above?   3. This question to design a system looks vague to me. How would someone depict such a system in an interview ? Using diagrams to show interactions between entities?   4. Am I handling the missing tablets issue correctly (Mentioned as point 6. above)?
