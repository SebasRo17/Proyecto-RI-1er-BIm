There is a finite set of points on a plane (about 1500 points in the current task). I need to construct triangles on those points such as each triangle lies completely inside one larger triangle: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GSvTE.png) Now I want an algorithm to maximize the number of such triangles. Where can I start? I think one of the ways would be to choose a "center" and to find three directions from this center with most point density near those directions. Or just choose an arbitrary center triangle manually and then iteratively choose a larger triangle with the least area or the least distance.
