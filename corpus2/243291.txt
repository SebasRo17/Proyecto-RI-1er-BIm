Some applications (for example Minecraft) have the 'free-to- deobfuscate'-model. It means that you are free to make and distribute changes to the applications code, but you must decompile and deobsuscate the application first. This makes less than zero sense to me. Isn't the whole point of obfuscation the prevention of people messing with your code? Why not just use the open- source model?
