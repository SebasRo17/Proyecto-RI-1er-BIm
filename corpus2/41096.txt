Last time, I got a satisfying answer for simulating a toggle mechanism, just as expected. `NDSolve` is great. I tried playing with it (as a matter of fact, @MichaelE2 left me with an exercise). Now, I'm trying to simulate the quick return mechanism (to incorporate that in another video of mine). In the toggle mechanism, the crank drives another crank by transmitting power through the connecting rod. But here, the crank itself drives the connecting rod whose end is fixed at some distance directly below the crank's center. The crank rotates. But since that drives the link fixed to one end, it slides over the link itself. Here's a similar one I found by googling. Um, I find those methods (quite old) really annoying, and it's not really nice. Moreover, they were using some kind of package called "Modeler 2D", which no longer exists now, in _Mathematica_ 9. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x2VgN.gif) I think this can be done by using `NDSolve`. But, as I'm still dumb in _solving_ using _Mathematica_ , I don't understand how exactly should I add the constraint. I tried modifying the toggle mechanism, but I still fail because I should rotate the crank and cause it to slide along the link, so that it moves forwards and backwards. I personally feel that they've exaggerated a little bit in the simulation. Actually, the the slider should be placed towards the left or else that'd be a quick _forward_ mechanism. But, I just need how the crank slides along the rod. The rest, I can try it as an exercise :D
