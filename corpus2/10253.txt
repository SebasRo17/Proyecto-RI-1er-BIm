I have a problem with the DSolve[] command in mathematica 8. Solving the the following 4th order differential equation spits out a complex solution although it should be a real one. The equation is:               y''''[x] + a y[x] == 0      Solving this equation by hand yields a solution with only real parts. All constants and boundary conditions are also real numbers. The solution I get by hand is:               y1[x_] = (C[5] E^(Power[a, (4)^-1]/Power[2, (2)^-1] x) +      C[6] E^(-(Power[a, (4)^-1]/Power[2, (2)^-1]) x)) Cos[     Power[a, (4)^-1]/Power[2, (2)^-1]     x] + (C[7] E^(Power[a, (4)^-1]/Power[2, (2)^-1] x) +      C[8] E^(-(Power[a, (4)^-1]/Power[2, (2)^-1]) x)) Sin[     Power[a, (4)^-1]/Power[2, (2)^-1] x];      Now I have to solve for the constants `C[5]...C[8]`. This arises a similar issue. I use the `Solve[]` command with the boundary conditions               Solve[{y1''[-c] == ic0, y1''[c] == ic0 , y1'''[-c] == ic1 ,      y1'''[c] == - ic1 }, {C[5], C[6], C[7], C[8]} ];      The constants `C[5]...C[8]` are now real if using `//Simplify` and complex if using `//FullSimplify`. Any idea what the reasons are? The notebook with my calculations can be downloaded under: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4920002/DGL_4th_Order_with_own_solution.nb In further work I have to use DSolve[] and I would like to understand the issue here.
