At my job, I'm currently a programmer, but in the next few weeks I'll be taking control my own project. I was wondering if anyone else here has been in the same situation, and if so, what advice you can offer to help me be able to better run my project. Experience in dealing with contractors would be greatly appreciated. A little more info:   * Project will have 3 people including myself, with extra people coming in when needing testing.   * The project has been programmed mainly by 2 people   * I would like to contribute to the programming as I like doing it and think I can add to the program, but am afraid of how the contractors will react. I don't want to create bad feelings which may harm the project. EDIT: Forgot to mention that I'll have to be picking up communications with customers to make sure their needs are met. Any advice on talking to customers cold would be greatly appreciated. EDIT 2: This is not a new project, I'm picking it up around version 6. Sorry that I didn't make it clear before.
