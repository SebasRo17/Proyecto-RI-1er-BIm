In Google App Engine, you can upload up to 10 different versions on your appspot project. For instance, if I have a project called `example`, the URL would be:               http://example.appspot.com      Each version I upload is given a version string. Possible examples are:   * dev   * 1   * 1_2   * staging   * anystring To access a specific version, I would prefix the domain with the version string, like so:               http://1.example.appspot.com      Of course, if that version is made the "default" version, then I can access it without prefixing with the version string, such as in the original URL at the beginning, http://example.appspot.com. What are the current best practices for managing version strings on Google App Engine Apps, in your experience? Also, once I surpass the max 10 versions and have to start deleting them, what is the suggested practice?
