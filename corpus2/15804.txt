I wrote a .NET Windows application using framework 3.5. At that time, 3.5 was very new and I had knowledge of framework 2.0 only. Due to deadline, I didn't use any new features of version 3.5 and delivered the application. There was no time. It is now two years and the app. is running fine, but my clients have requested new features. There is a major scaling needed. The new code that I wrote so far uses many new features of .NET 3.5 and I am concentrating on reducing the new code size. The problem is that the new classes that I want to write are sometimes creating redundant methods for doing the same thing. I am not disturbing the old code. How to manage? If I replace old classes with new ones, it risks functionality and need thorough testing again. If I don't, the project size is increasing.
