I've recently been working on a project and I've been seeing two different forms of url's being used.               src="../MyLinkUrl"      and               src="/MyLinkUrl"      We are using MVC .NET and the times I have seen the .. usages have been in Javascript code files and not when it's been generated by the MVC URL helpers. Typically the usages range from specifying a controller action to specifying images. Both seem to work but I'm wondering which is the better practice or if it depends on the context. Some questions I have are:   1. What benefits/pitfalls does one have over the other   2. Is one better practice than the other   3. Does it depend on context and if so what context?
