Including customizable, JavaScript-based scrollbars (and scrolling functionality in general, i.e. bind the control to the mouse scroll wheel) in your webapp can be a great temptation. However all solutions I could find were developed by individuals (which can equal lack of formal or future support). In addition I fail to remember any mainstream site using them. In my particular case, no-JavaScript or IE6/odd-browser environments are not intended to be supported. Should custom scrollbars be avoided nowadays? If not, what's the best option one can choose?
