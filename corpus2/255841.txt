I'm looking for a graphing tool that allows you to plot multiple series with 2 vertical axis, and with different graph types (at least that is how I would describe it in excel). I've never looked at graphing before, though have a reasonable knowledge of javascript. Where is a good place to start? Here is an example of the type of graph that I'm hoping to produce. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IUCmR.png)
