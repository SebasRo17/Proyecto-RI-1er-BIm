I'm starting to work with datasets. They seem like a useful addition to Mathematica. However, there's one fairly major stumbling block I can't get over. How do I update data in a dataset? I have a dataset created from JSON data. It uses a Month/Day/Year format, which I'd like to convert to YYYMMDD. Date format conversions are easy, but I don't know how to assign that data back into my dataset (or create a new one based on that if they're immutable).               Import["http://msi.nga.mil/MSI_JWS/ASAM_JSON/getJSON?typename=\     DateRange_AllRefNumbers&fromDate=19900101&toDate=20140801",         "JSON"];      Needs["GeneralUtilities`"]     asamdataset = Dataset[ToAssociations@asamjson];          td=asamdataset;      I would think something like this would work, but I get an error that Date is protected.               td[[2]]["Date"] =      DateList[{asamdataset[[2]]["Date"], {"Month", "Day", "YearShort"}}]      What am I missing here? The documentation on Dataset is extensive, except for updating values. Which I expect a lot of people will need to do when loading messy datasets.
