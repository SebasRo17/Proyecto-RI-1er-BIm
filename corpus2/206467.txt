In this thread, an Oracle Product Manager (username "Alex Keh") refused to make Oracle's EF provider to conform with .NET's `PascalCase` coding standard for class names and property names, saying that it is only "cosmetics" without any "functional needs". > I discussed it with my team.

For me, the main reason is that I don't want to see Oracle's `UPPER_CASE` name convention mixing in my .NET code, but it seems that this is not enough. How would you justify effort to support PascalCase convention?
