I would like to replace `RandomInteger[{1, 10}, {10, 10}]` in the following code:               DynamicModule[{c = 11},        Grid[         Map[Button[ToString @ #,                     c = #,                     Background -> Dynamic[If[Mod[#, c] == 0, Green, White]],                     ImageSize -> {32, 32},                     Appearance ->  "Frameless"] &,            RandomInteger[{1, 10}, {10, 10}],           {2}],          Frame -> All,          FrameStyle -> Directive[GrayLevel[0.8], Dashed],          Spacings -> {.2, .2}]]      with a series of lists; e.g., `Transpose @ Partition[Range @ (10*10), 10]`.
