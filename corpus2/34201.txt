I observed that there is no Q-function representation in Mathematica. The definition of Q-Function is: \begin{align} Q(x) &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-\frac{u^2}{2}}du \\ &=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{erfc}(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}) \end{align} a nother representation of Q-function is: \begin{align} Q(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} e^{\left(\frac{-x^2}{2\sin^2{\phi}} \right)}d\phi \end{align} there is only Complementary Error Function representation Erfc. $\mathrm{erfc}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{x}^{\infty} \exp(-t^2) dt$ Is there any possiblity that define a new function in _Mathematica_? so that it will be a permanent function. Note: In statistics, the Q-function is the tail probability of the standard normal distribution. In other words, Q(x) is the probability that a normal (Gaussian) random variable will obtain a value larger than x standard deviations above the mean.
