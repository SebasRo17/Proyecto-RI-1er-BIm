I am trying to search people from Wikipedia(For example `.*John.*` in REGEX). The following query is close, but it isn't generalized like `.*John.*` ~~and only gives back historic figures that have passed~~ (They only aren't Alphabetized).               Import["http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&\srsearch=wikipedia&srprop=timestamp&eititle=Template:Persondata", "XML"]      link The following query works although I can't seem to limit the results to people only.               Import["http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=embeddedin&eititle=Template:Persondata&eilimit=100&format=xml&redirects", "XML"]      link2 | API sandbox Although currently I'm running into Wikipedia API issues, I am looking for a way to get the results in Mathematica (and therefore I believe this question makes most sense on M.stackexchange).
