**a bit of background:** I come from an environment where we all started to learn programming with Excel VBA and later VB6 (yeah, VB6 - but we were young and it was great fun these days). So to me, it was a completely natural way of getting started with programming. I later worked in a VB-related programming forum where a major part of the community comprised exactly these young amateur programmers. Now of course, VB is a dying language so we made a transition into .NET languages (C# and VB.NET), **but the number of visitors was (and is) steadily declining.** It's these **young programming kids that we'are lacking** in particular. We could have well attributed this solely to VB, but I looked around in other forums and they all seem to face similar problems. **So my question is** > Where are today's programming kids gone? Is .NET "more professional" in a > way that it attracts fewer junior programmers than the older languages (VBC, > Delphi, Pascal, whatever one used to start with) did? Or is it a broader > phenomenon that we've got fewer "new blood" today? Does anyone have similar (or contrary) experience in this points? Where have the kids gone and which languages are they using (hopefully not all Java/Javascript :D )? Or maybe it's the concept of forums that's on the decline?! I'd just want to _collect some thoughts_ here, and hopefully _hard data_ if it should be available. Thanks
