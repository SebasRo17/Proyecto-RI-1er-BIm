Given:               titanic = ExampleData[{"Dataset", "Titanic"}]      Why does this correctly delete Missing[] elements:                titanic[GroupBy@Key@"class", DeleteMissing[#, 1] &, "age"] // Normal      but not the default level spec? Seems to violate key transparency in `Associations/Datasets`.                titanic[GroupBy@Key@"class", DeleteMissing, "age"] // Normal          (* <|"1st" -> {29, 1, 2, 30, 25, 48, 63, 39, 53, 71, 47, 18, 24, 26, 80,         Missing[], 24, 50, 32,... |>  *)      `DeleteMissing` also works on the bare list, as would any function applied at that Dataset slot. On the other hand:               <| "key" -> {29, 1, 2, 30, 25, 48, 63, 39, 53, 71, 47, 18, 24, 26, 80,         Missing[], 24, ... |> // DeleteMissing[#, 2] &      Level 2 is the minimum needed to delete missing element?
