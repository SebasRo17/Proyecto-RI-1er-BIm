Certain datastructures, like Python's Dictionary, are unordered/random read/written. As programming in python is iterative (and programming in general is?), how do these unordered datastructures work? I understand that Python's Dictionary is in essence a hashtable. But I figured that the datastructure gets stored in the memory by order of inserting, and are thus read, when iterating over the full datastructure, in a similar order. But this is not the case. Aside from not understanding how this works, I also wonder of the benefit of this. But that may be all too clear when I understand how it works :) ps. Didn't think this was a StackOverflow Question, so put it here...
