I would like to count the number of line intersections and number of n-gons in a complete graph (which forms a regular polygon). The only way I've come up with that would allow me to do both in _Mathematica_ would be to:   1. Produce an image of the graph;    2. Apply some image processing tricks. I'm completely new to the world of image processing though. Here is an example of a 10-graph:               n = 10;     firstCorners = Table[{Cos[2 Pi i], Sin[2 Pi i]}, {i, 0, 1, 1/n}];     lines = Subsets[firstCorners, {2}];     img = Image[Graphics[{Thick, Line[lines]}, ImageSize -> 350]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZPD8.png) I've got no idea how to proceed from here, everything I've tried has failed.
