Iam not able to create a ODBC connection on mac through mathematica even though i have created a connection successfully through ODBC Administrator. The error message iam getting was: JDBC::error: ""File input/output error conHR10.properties java.io.FileNotFoundException: conHR10.properties.new (Read-only file system)". ## Problems in detail: My back end was microsoft sql server(2012) which was in a windows 8 machine. My front end was mathematica which was in MAC PRO(OS X 10.9.3). Iam trying to connect to my database through LAN. Iam able to make a connection in MAC using ODBC Administrator. But when i try to use the connection in mathematica the error above keeps coming.
