At our shop we use SVN for source control and CruiseControl for CI on handling automatic builds and deployments to our development, test, and integration environments. This all works smoothly however due to hardware and resource constraints our integration environment is not a 2 server load balanced environment like our production environment. While everything else is equal that would be the only difference between our integration and production environments (although a big one!) Theoretically the difference is a slightly different configuration of our app servers and the deploy script merely would have to drop the build artifacts into two servers instead of just the one, but why am I so nervous to automate our production deployments?! I am generally not a control freak but I always feel the insatiable need to deploy production to production manually. I have heard from colleagues that this is generally a **Really BAD Thingâ„¢** but they failed to make a case against it. I know that when I do it manually I can SEE that I am physically copying the correct files, I am physically shutting down the app servers and ensuring they closed successfully, I am physically starting the servers back up and then physically inspecting the logs to make sure it started up okay and the deployment was successful. It gives me a peace of mind. What are arguments against this OR arguments for automatic scripted production deployment?
