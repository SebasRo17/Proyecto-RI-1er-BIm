I frequently encounter the situation where I have a function of two real variables defined, e.g.:               f[x_, y_] := 9 - x^2 - y^2      But then I need to feed into `f` not just two numbers but rather a pair, i.e., a 2-element list, e.g.:               p = {3, 4};     f[p]      How might this be done simply -- _without_ having to make a separate definition               f[{x_, y_}] := f[x, y]       Naively I used to expect that the following would work:               f[Sequence[p]]      But it doesn't. What does work, though, is:               f[Sequence @@ p]      Are there other, simpler techniques? I bring this up as an advocate for relatively new users of _Mathematica_ , because I think `Sequence` along with `Apply` is much too sophisticated for them! Note: The root cause is the typical "abuse of notation" in math, where a "function of two real variables" is really a function of ordered pairs of reals but the notation $f(x, y)$ obscures that.
