I am writing some agile user stories and acceptance stories for the first time, and was hoping for some feedback from an experienced product manager or developer. I only need to capture the main points in the acceptance criteria. ## User Story AS A registered jobseeker, I WANT TO create and edit my CV on the user interface on my mobile device SO THAT employers and recruiters can view my career summary and contact details ## Acceptance Criteria   1. The user must sign into a registered account to create a CV   2. The user cannot save a CV unless all the mandatory fields on the form are complete    3. The user should be able to edit and delete the form at any time   4. Data from the saved form is stored in the CV database   5. Only registered Recruiters and Employers can view the users CV and contact details    6. The jobseekers user account is linked and synchronised on both mobile and desktop versions Does this acceptance criteria sounds suitable for the given user story? Is there any way they can be more focused, and if so how?
