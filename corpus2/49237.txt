I need to use four functions of $x$               DD11 = @(x) x+0*x;     DD12 = @(x) x^2+0*x;     DD21 = @(x) cos(x)+0*x;     DD22 = @(x) 1+0*x;      and since they all represent the same physical quantity, and also for the sake of convenience, I would like to define in a matrix form:               DD = @x [x x^2; cos(x) 1];      If I do this, how will I recall the different elements at a given point later on? For example, the syntax `DD[1,2](0)` or `DD(0)[1,2]` don't work... Thanks!
