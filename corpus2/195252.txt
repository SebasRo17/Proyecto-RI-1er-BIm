I am trying to explain the dependency inversion principle to my (mostly junior) colleagues. How can we define which one is the "high-level policy" and which one is the "low-level detail" in a software? For example, if our software automates workflow of several business applications, why do we say that the workflow automation is the high-level policy and the business applications are the details?
