If I generate two tables inside a function which are               function[n_, x_, y_]:=(      table1 = Table[i* x/n^x, {i,1,n}];      table2 = Table[i* y/n^y, {i,1,n}];     )      where `y - x = z`. So I can notice that I am making very similar evaluations and generate two almost identical tables. Can I do it faster, I mean: after generating of `table1` can I generate table2 based on values from table1? Of course I am looking for some solution which is faster than generating `table1` and `table2` as above. I was trying to use ParallelTable but it was wrong direction I think. I will be grateful if someone can suggest something.
