I find Maximize doesn't work well under **conditional statement**. Here is an example. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q44hN.jpg) A car is driving up a slope. I want to find out the largest slope angle the car can drive upwards. I choose the slope angle `θ` and engine torque `τ` as decision variables. The friction force can be described by Coulomb friction model, which is a conditional statement ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3OCva.jpg) The complete formulation is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DFbvG.jpg) Therefore, the Nonlinear Optimization can be solved by                 Maximize[{θ, 0 < θ < Pi/2 && 0 < τ < 2 &&                  If[τ/r < μs*G*Cos[θ], τ/r, μd G Cos[θ]] > G Sin[θ]}, {θ, τ}]      given the parameters: G = 70; r = 0.025; μs = 0.5; μd = 0.4; Mathematica gives `θ=0.380506`,,which is ArcTan[μd], whereas the expected result should be `θ=0.46364`,which is ArcTan[μs].
