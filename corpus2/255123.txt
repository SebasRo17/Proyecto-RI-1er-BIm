1 year ago I created wannabe-MVC in PHP (some parts procedural, some in classes), now I'm intending to expand it a further to be more like real MVC. Folder/files structure:               html/     html/images/     html/css/     html/js/ (my JS)     html/js/lib/ (jquery...)     app/     app/controller/     app/include/ (special functions)     app/lang/ (languages - en.php, de.php...)     app/lib/ (php mailer, image resize class, facebook sdk...)     app/log/ (error log)     app/model/     app/view/     app/view/include/ (part of views that repeat - navigation, pagination..)     app/config.php     app/ini.php     index.php      In index.php I call router class where I find what controller and view to load, but it's written in switch case way. Have problems with autoload because it's dependence on the Database. **URL structure (fixed router):**               / (homepage) -> homeController.php     /error404/ (error page) -> error404Controller.php     /users/ (list all users) -> usersController.php     /users/2/ (page 2 of all users)     /users/login/ (login page) -> usersController.php?action=login     /users/login/facebook/ (when logging in, facebook redirects to this page) -> ??     /users/some-username-{ID}/ (user profile - a-Z-0-9 username and ID of that user) -> usersController?action=single      **URL structure (custom router - DB dependent):**               /categ/ (default router, getting categ from DB and list news of that category) -> categController.php     /categ/2/ (2nd page of category list of news)     /categ/news-title-{ID}/ (get single -> newsController.php     /categ/subcateg/ (get categ and subcateg from DB) -> subcategController.php     /categ/subcateg/2/ (2nd page of subcateg)     /categ/subcateg/news-title-{ID}/      and its goes to level 4 - categ/subcateg/subsubcateg/news-title-ID/ **userController.php (simplified)**               userController extends mainController{         function index(){             $users = new user();             $users->limit = 10;             $users->where = "is_active='1'";             $users_list = $users->loadAll();         }     }      **userModel.php (simplified)**               userModel extends mainModel{         public $tableName = "users";         public $limit = 20;         public $where = '1=1';              function loadAll(){             global $db;                  $load = $db->fetch_all('SELECT * FROM $tableName WHERE $where LIMIT $limit');                  return $load;         }     }      Questions:   1. How to create **Router class** to match this mix of **fixed and custom urls** ? Now is simple **switch case** where **custom router** is in **default: case**   2. Where can I put **user data** \- check if user is logged in or not so i can pull data based on that ? **init.php, userModel.php, userController.php** or ? I need this info before view loads...   3. Where to put querys that repeats like getting top navigation or footer data when it loads on every page ? in some **master controller or model** that loads automatically no matter on what page user is.   4. Is this good start or am I something wrong about, if yes, what ? I readed many MVC tutorials and someone says you need **fat Model** , someone says **fat Controller** so what is good practice here ?
