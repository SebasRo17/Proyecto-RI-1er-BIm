I want to apply `Times` on the elements of a list such that:               {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19} =>      {{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19},{6,35,143,323},{210,46189},{9699690}}      I wrote this function :               listProduct[list_] :=       Apply[Times, Partition[list, Ceiling[Length[list]/2]]]          Nest[listProduct, {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}, 1]      Using `Nest` at each level generate the desired element but I am having difficulties with combining the results. Also, I want to be able to use each element once computed.
