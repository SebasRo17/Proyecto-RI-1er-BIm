I have been wanting to understand more of proper XAML design since most of my current experience is in what I grew up in: Windows Forms. More specifically, though it is really a specific subset of Xaml, I am interested in Windows 8 Application development. I do have read considerable parts of 70-502 exam book by Microsoft and of course I have visited the Microsoft site to learn how many pixels what where and how is supposed to go to meet Windows 8 design guidelines. All these resources however focus on very small scale problems. How to make a button, how to connect it to a controller... I am looking for resources that teach me how to translate a design into xaml. All the individual components I am aware of, though not indepth. DockPanels, StackPanels, buttons, boxes, borders and styles. But I don't have a resource that tells me how to combine them into a high quality design. Does anyone have resources that teach weilding Xaml on an application scale?
