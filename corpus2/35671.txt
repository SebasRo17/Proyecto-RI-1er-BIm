I recently joined a new development team where the language preferences are mixed on the .net platform.               Dev 1: Knows VB.net, does not know c#     Dev 2: Knows VB.net, does not know c#     Dev 3: Knows c# and VB.net, prefers c#     Dev 4: Knows c# and VB6(VB.net should be pretty easy to pick up), prefers c#      It seems to me that the thought leaders in the .net space are c# devs almost universally. I also thought that some 3rd party tools didn't support VB.net but when I started looking into it I didn't find any good examples. I would prefer to get the whole team on c# but if there isn't any good reason to force the issue aside from preference then I don't think that is the right choice. Are there any reasons I should lead folks away from VB.net?
