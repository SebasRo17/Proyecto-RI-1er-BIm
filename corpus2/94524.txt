I registered myself in github a few days ago. Mainly for starting projects to share some of my ideas with others as well as get the source available from anywhere. This is my first open-contribution site. I mean, I haven't used sourceforge or Google Code. Now the client software installation and other setup process are not done yet. Because I found it a bit confusing. Probably the cause is, I have very little idea about git as a source control system. I have only used perforce with a GUI(p4v) in the workplace and knows the very basics like get a revision/open for edit/commit/revert etc. Moreover I shall be mostly working with C#. And I shall be using Visual Studio and Windows. I have found in internet that there are other clients for visual studio. May those will suit better for me. So, what are your suggestions? How can I get started and proceed?
