I have this differential equation:               eq=D[ψ[r],r]+A*ψ[r]-(B/(A*r))ψ[r]==0;      And `DSolve` sucessfully solves it:               sol = DSolve[eq,ψ[r],r];      But when I check by replacing all, in this case it doesn't replace the derivative of the function:               Simplify[eq/.sol]      Derivative still must be replaced too. If I do:               Simplify[eq/.sol/.D[sol,r]]      Then this gives `True`. In other cases _Mathematica_ replaced the function and its derivatives in one shot. What's happening in this case?
