I'm trying to determine reaction functions of a Cournot equilibrium for $n$ firms using the same optimal condition, using the fixed point method. This is the method I'm using:               fixedPoint[Gs_, X_, X0_, tol_, nmax_] :=       Module[{G, sol, oldsol, iter, n, i},       (*Vectors Gs and X must have the same length*)       n = Length[X];       G[s_] := Gs /. Table[X[[i]] -> s[[i]], {i, 1, n}];       infNorm[s_] := Max[Abs[s]];       sol = X0;       oldsol = sol + 2*tol;       iter = 0;       While[And[iter <= nmax, infNorm[sol - oldsol] > tol],        oldsol = sol;        sol = G[sol];        iter++];       Print["Performed ", iter, " iterations"];       If[iter >= nmax, Print["WARNING: Maximum number of iterations was reached"]];       sol]      The equilibrium condition is (the derivative of profit with respect to quantity):               (((qt)^(-1/eta)) - (1/eta)*((qt)^(-1/(eta - 1)))*qi )-ai*q1 == 0      Where `eta` and `ai` are parameters, `qt` is the sum of the quantities produced by the $n$ firms, and `qi` is the quantity produced by a single firm. So, my problem is determining the `Gs` argument of my method for $n$ firms. How do I generate $n$ optimal functions, each assuming its corresponding values for `ai` and `qi`?
