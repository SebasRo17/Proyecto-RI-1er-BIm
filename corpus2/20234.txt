The question is what is the method to solve the implicit function has real and imaginary number. For example, The function is $$F(x,y)=(-I*x + 2*y^2)^2 + x^2 - 4*y^4*Sqrt[1 - I*x/(y^2)]$$ Although I used a `NSolve` and `Solve` I can't get the solution. (It is too complicated to solve by those command i think.) What is the value y? (y may be a complex number when x is given) And is it possible to draw a graph of `Real[y] - x` and `Imaginary[y] - x`?
