http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative I'm curious whether there are, anywhere in the world, worker's cooperatives that center on a technology business that involves either programming, IT, or some sort of IT or programming related consulting or services. The wikipedia link above is an overview of the concept. The short form explanation is that a co-op is a worker-owned business. Also there is the notion that every worker owns shares in the business. I am interested in knowing whether an example of a "programmer's/IT co-op" even exists. Note: I am not talking about nor asking about a government-funded incubator nor any other socialized, state supported group. I also don't mean "co- working", which is renting an office with other self employed people doing their own thing. I mean a going, profitable IT business operating in a competitive environment that is worker-owned and run.
