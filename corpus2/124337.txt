I came across seemikecode.com and it got me thinking how this could be used for live coding sessions when screening applicants for a job. For example:   * Email telling the interviewee what to expect   * Problems attributes of coding problems that are suited for this setup   * How to responded to the code presented   * Recording the session What are your thoughts on this? Are tools like this helpful or do they get in the way of evaluating a candidate?
