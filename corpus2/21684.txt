Is there a way to control the scaling of `ColorFunction` beside just to turn it off and on with `ColorFunctionScaling`? Two problems with this approach are:   1. Repeating colours if the scaling is small compared to the plot range. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/90xBU.png)   2. Uniform colour if the scaling is large compared to the plot range. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ETpJT.png)
