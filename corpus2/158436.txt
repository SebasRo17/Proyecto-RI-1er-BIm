OK so I'm not so sure that "project" is the right term, but for my purposes, I define "project" as similar to what Visual Studio uses, or Microsoft word - files that the user can open and work on and then save, and when the user runs the application again the program is aware of the files that were worked on last time the application was open. So I ask, what is a good design strategy for retaining history of user activities and files like Visual Studio projects?
