Suppose we have some random 3D distribution of points. I'll use the spherical ball defined below as an example and a starting point for the discussion here :               Ball[num_]:=Table[     {         #1 Sqrt[1-#2^2]Cos[#3],         #1 Sqrt[1-#2^2]Sin[#3],         #1 #2     }          &[         Random[NormalDistribution[1, 0.5]],         Random[Real,{-1,1}],         Random[Real,{0,2Pi}]     ],{num}]          Graphics3D[{AbsolutePointSize[2],Point[Ball[10000]]},Boxed->True,BoxRatios->{1,1,1},ImageSize->800,SphericalRegion->True]      This code produces the ball shown here : ![A spherical distribution of points in 3D space](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ONB8Q.jpg) I would like to colorize the whole distribution with a color shade defined on the density of points, from **_color1_** (highest density of points) to **_color2_** (lowest density of points). Adding more colors to the shade is a desirable option ( ** _color1_** to **_color2_** to **_color3_** ... to **_colorN_** ). How can I do that ? What Mathematica code could do this ? Please, the suggestions should be compatible with **_Mathematica 7.0_**.
