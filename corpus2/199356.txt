This might seem like an odd question, but I'm worried that I'm putting too many things as constants/finals at the top of my java class. I've started to put every value that is in my program into a constant (At least the ones that influence it's overall effect). The reason I'm doing it is because then it's easy to find the values and change them latter, even if they are only used once, it's easier to find them at the top. Is this a bad or good practice, I really have no idea. Here's an example:               private static final Color COLOR_SELECTED = Color.BLUE;     private static final Color COLOR_ALTERNATE_ONE = Color.WHITE;     private static final Color COLOR_ALTERNATE_TWO = new Color(240, 240 , 240);     private static final Color TEXT_COLOR = Color.black;
