When the QA find an error like 'broken design in web programming', do you call it a bug and the corrections 'patches'? (Assume all this is before delivery.) I was of the feeling that the corrections for bugs found after delivery were called patches. Developers don't add bugs intentionally and it's QA's duty to find bugs. Sure I agree a programmer should be able to solve the bug, **but should the programmer be blamed for these bugs?**
