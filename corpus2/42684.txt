I was trying to fit a set of data onto a logistic equation, however it ended up telling me that the initial value when $t=0$ is greater than the maximum limit, thus I am led to believe that it isn't working. My approach: Here are the data points with the top row being day and the second row being height (cm) $\begin{matrix}7&14&21&28&35&42&49&56&63&70&77&84\\\17.93&36.36&67.76&98.1&131&169.5&205.5&228.3&247.1&250.5&253.8&254.5\end{matrix}$ I put them into mathematica by the following:               points={{7,17.93},{14,36.36},{21,67.76},{28,98.1},{35,131},{42,169.5},{49,205.5},{56,228.3},{63,247.1},{70,250.5},{77,253.8},{84,254.5}};      I need to fit this data into this equation $\frac{C}{1+\frac{C-N_0}{N_0}e^{-rt}}$, where $C$ is defined as the maximum possible height, $N_0$ is the height when $t=0$, $r$ is some constant, $e$ is Euler's Constant and $t$ is time Since $C$ and $N$ are already used by mathematica, i used $c$ and $n$               FindFit[points,c/(1+((c-n)/n)*E^(-r*t)),{c,n,r},t]      The output was:               {c->163.363, n->653566, r->236.408}      What have I done wrong to get these values? Also I am positive I have the correct equation as this is what the assignment tells us is the equation and all the other questions work. (Although they are a different style and we are given $N_0$ and $C$ in those ones) My expected output for $C$ and $N_0$ I believe is around               {c->256, n->9}      However I am unsure about $r$ but believe it to be under $1$ and positive
