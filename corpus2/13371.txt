We are currently developing a .net app in WPF, that will be a desktop app with a good bit of data-access to local (and some remote) servers. The business logic here is very complex, and currently it is built into the code along with the data access and whatnot (being WPF the UI is seperated pretty nicely).      Now I have been tasked with reorganizing this system to make it more maintainable in the longrun as certain logic changes. I know that workflows are supposed to seperate the logic out pretty nicely and allow you to visualize it a bit. Is workflow a good choice for an app that does not need to be run over long periods? (since workflows CAN wait in idle for months) What has been your experience with the platform? Is it slow for dealing with a mid- sized company; around 150 simultaneous users? If you liked it, do you know of any good online tutorials(preferably not MSDN) that can give me a taste for the platform and do some testing before I commit to implementing it on a huge app?
