I have a pet project where I am making a Grade Book Application to better teach several different topics in DB, OOP and Planning. Im running into some issues with the database planning of things. For the record I am learning all of this by using online resources, books and trial and error in no way am I professional. I have 3 Tables (Teachers, Courses, and Assignments). 1) Many Teachers can Teach Many Courses - So this would be a M2M Relationship where I would need a third table to cross reference Teachers and Courses by their PK. Is it okay to have that third table have extra columns to show unique data about the courses like Title of the course or should that go into the course table? And if it depends how would you know which is the best way? 2) One Course can have Many Assignments or is it Many Courses can have Many Assignments? I feel this is a stupid question but I can not grasp on which would be a correct fact statement? 3) Does anyone know of any Database Diagrams that shown an example of a very simple gradebook layout, I have been looking on google but couldn't find anything that was not in my realm.
