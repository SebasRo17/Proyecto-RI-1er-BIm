I am attempting to learn c# from the head first series, in addition i also consult other books such as Pro C# by Andrew Tolson. Now the thing is that i perfectly understand the interface,generics syntax and can also use it for the programs given in the exercises. What i find difficult is using these concepts into my own programs. For example the other day i was making a twitter account managing client and despite my best efforts i was unable to use any of the aforementioned concepts in code. I was even having difficulty in making useful classes. What are some guidelines I can use to decide what classes I need to create for my program, assuming I know the syntax of _how_ to create a class, but not the idea of _when_ to do so?
