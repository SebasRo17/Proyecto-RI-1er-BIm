When I run the following,               red = {{{-4, 50}, {100, 136}}, {{-19, 1}, {35, 73}}, {{-24, 0}, {26, 63}}};      y = {{0.01497, 1}, {0.04304, 3}, {0.07111, 2}, {0.09918, 1}};      red=Interval@@@red;     If[#[[1]] <= 0.05, xii = #[[2]]; If[IntervalMemberQ[red[[xii]], 47], #[[1]] = 999.];] & /@ y;     y      Instead of the following result               y = {{999., 1}, {999., 3}, {0.07111, 2}, {0.09918, 1}}      I am getting an error:                Set::setps:{0.01497`,1} in the part assignment is not a symbol. >>      I know based on this that it is to do with passing name of the variable vs. value of the variable, but not sure how to fix it. I tried `Insert[#, 999., 1]` and `ReplaceList[#, 1 -> 999.]` without much success :(
