I've been wanting to try out graphics in Haskell. From what I've seen, the available libraries are either front-ends to C/C++ libraries, or an abstraction of them with minimal features. The high-level libraries do not seem to suit my needs, and so I'm left with lower-level front-ends. **What I need is to render tiles and text** \- basics for a very simple game. I know how to do this with C, and was thinking I could write the graphics in C and interface it with Haskell. The alternative is to write the graphics using a Haskell library. **My question is, can available Haskell libraries achieve what I want?** I do not want to bend over backwards; if C can do it better than I would like to know.
