I've been trying to put together a palette of useful functionality garnered from this site. There is useful stuff scattered all over the place, for example:   * Post an image   * Copy code   * Duplicate a notebook   * Paste a table As an ugly, yet functional, way of putting them together, I have something like:               CreatePalette[Column[{         OpenerView[{"Duplicate Active Notebook", duplicating}, True],         OpenerView[{"Pasting a table", pasting}, True],         OpenerView[{"Copy for StackExchange", copyForStackExchange}, True]         (* etc *)         }],       WindowTitle -> "mathematica.stackexchange.com"];      where the definitions inside each `OpenerView` are slight modifications of the code from the above links. (Usually just stripping off any existing palette stuff is all that is required. I did find that a single button seemed to require `ImageSize -> Automatic` so it would display properly.) So the question is, what else can I add to this? **Are there any procedures _you_ use regularly that are suitable for a palette?** Things that have made your mathematica experience easier and more productive?   **Is there any enlightening information that could be continually displayed on a palette?** E.g. progress bars, memory usage, cursor position?   **Are there any tips and hints for beginners that could be nicely presented on a palette?**
