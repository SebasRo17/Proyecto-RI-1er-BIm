I recently passed the Oracle Certified Professional, Java SE 6 Programmer examination. Now, my boss would like me to take "the next step" to broaden my competence. I tried to explain that there is no equivalent Java EE 6 Programmer examination, but a number of different exams, such as Web Services, Web Components, and Enterprise JavaBeans. Is there a recommended path to follow for the various Oracle certifications in the Enterprise Edition of Java? Is it logical to take some exams prior to taking others because the content builds upon previous knowledge or are they all independent?
