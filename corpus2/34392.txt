By default `Histogram` generates `Graphics` expression with embedded `Dynamic` constructs as can be seen by looking on its `InputForm`. Is it possible to switch off generation of any `Dynamic` constructs and get non-interactive `Graphics` from `Histogram`? P.S. There are two reasons to turn off interactivity: 1) Interactivity is not needed when preparing graphics for `Export`. 2) Unnecessary `Dynamic` elements complicate generated `Graphics` expression and make difficult to modify it.
