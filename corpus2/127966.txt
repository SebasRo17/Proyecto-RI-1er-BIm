I'm a 4th year computer engineering student from a reputable university in Toronto and i'm curious as to how some of these software consulting positions with the large firms (Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, etc.) accept business grads as well as comp-sci and computer engineers? How does a business grad consult on software without having a background in software? Besides communication skills and other soft skills, what separates me from a business grad for these positions? Thanks.
