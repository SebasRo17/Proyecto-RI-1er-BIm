Firstly I would like an answer from an experienced person (not a one man band), someone whom has worked in a medium/large team and had to battle with this burning question before. **The problem** : I am constantly being asked to not submit **empty** rows by rows = I mean a list of items and properties. A good example would be, multiple file uploads.               <form>         <input type="text" name="pic[0][label]" />         <input type="file" name="pic[0][file]" />              <input type="text" name="pic[1][label]" />         <input type="file" name="pic[1][file]" />              <input type="text" name="pic[2][label]" />         <input type="file" name="pic[2][file]" />         <input type="submit" value="Upload" />     </form>       **The requirement states** : >   * As a user I should be presented with fields 3 (three) upload fields. >   * For each field there should be a corresponding title/name/label >   * There should be a "Add more" button, to allow me (the user) to add more > images. > The reason for the requirement above is user experience. (Less clicks are required) **The Backend argument** Submitting empty rows (to the server) is "error prone" or is seen as a "validation corner" **The Front-end argument**   * Backend should not dictate what the FE can/cannot do.   * JavaScript is very volatile and should not manage/validate whether empty rows should be sent or not **The question** if the user:   * Enters 1 (one) title/label   * Selects 1 (one) image from his/her local PC   * Clicks Upload   * Leaves the last 2 (two) upload fields empty. So in your opinion/experience with this kind of problem. Should the front end send empty rows or data to the server or not?
