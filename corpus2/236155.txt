I have recently been reading the Release It! book by Michael T Nygard.In the book he talks about Implementing an OpsDB to manage and record performance statistics of applications. Has anyone implemented any of the concepts in OpsDB? I've been trying to find some examples but am struggling and I really would like to implement something like this. This page gives a little background to the the details http://screamingtiger.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/release-it-176-standards-de-jure- and-de.html at the Operations database section Looking at the above I am not really sure what a Feature would be - would a client application count. Also, what would be some of the common things to capture for a web application. Any help would be most appreciated
