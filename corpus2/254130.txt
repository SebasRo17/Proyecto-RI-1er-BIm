Let's say we have a feature request come in and we begin work on it, which we'll call _feature-1_. It introduces some new logic to the application, which we'll call _logic-A_ and _logic-B_. A programmer branches from the release branch and begins work on the feature. Soon after, we get another feature request, which we'll call _feature-2_. It will implement _logic-A_ and _logic-C_ into the application. The _logic A_ being implemented by this feature is the same _logic-A_ as was implemented in _feature-1_. Let's also say that given _logic-B_ , _logic-A_ might be implemented slightly differently than it would have been given _logic-C_ , and also differently given both _logic-B_ and _logic-C_ (eg. with only one feature, the code would be less flexible than with both). How should this situation be handled? **Concrete Example** (to help with any confusion in my wording)   * _feature-1_ is a feed from programmers.stackexchange.com.   * _feature-2_ is a feed from gaming.stackexchange.com.   * _logic-A_ is the implementation of a feed at all (assuming the application currently has no feeds), which links to the content as well and gives related information.   * _logic-B_ is that the feed's source is from programmers.stackexchange.com.      * Adds to _logic-A_ that the related programming language is displayed.   * _logic-C_ is that the feed's source is from gaming.stackexchange.com.      * Adds to _logic-A_ that the related game's name and box art is displayed.
