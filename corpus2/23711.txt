I would like to resolve symbolically the following equation:               DSolve[{c1[x, y] + c2[x, y] == 0,        D[c1[x, y], {x, 1}] == a*Sin[Pi*(y - 1/2)]*Cos[Pi*(y - 1/2)]^3,        D[c2[x, y], {y, 1}] ==        b*Sin[Pi*(x - 1/2)]*Cos[Pi*(x - 1/2)]^3}, {c1[x, y], c2[x, y]}, {x,       y}]      which should correspond to a system: $$ \begin{align} c_1\left(x,y\right)+c_2\left(x,y\right) & = 0\\\ \frac{\partial c_2}{\partial y} & = a\sin x\cdot\left(\cos x\right)^3 ,\\\ \frac{\partial c_1}{\partial x} & = b\sin y\cdot\left(\cos y\right)^3 \end{align} $$ but Mathematica gives me an error:               DSolve::overdet: There are fewer dependent variables than equations, so the system is overdetermined.      What is it so?
