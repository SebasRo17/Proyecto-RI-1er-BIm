I'm working on an app which acts as a client for our web service. We sell this service to businesses, and we want to distribute the app to their employees for free. The app will be customised for each client. If we were in the US, my understanding is that we'd ask them to enrol in the volume purchasing program, and submit a version of our app for each business, for enterprise distribution at the free price point However, the businesses aren't all in the US, so they can't enrol in the VPP. They have thousands of employees, so promo codes won't be sufficient. What are our alternatives?
