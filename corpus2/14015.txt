I need to add locators dynamically to different sets. With one set this works OK:               Manipulate[      Graphics[{Point@pts}, PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}],      Control[{{pts, {RandomReal[1, 2]}}, ControlType -> Locator}],       Row[{        Button["Add L1", pts = pts~Join~{RandomReal[1, 2]}]}],      Dynamic@pts]      But when I try to use more than one set, it doesn't:               Manipulate[ (*fails*)           Graphics[{Point@pts, Point@ptsNA}, PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}],      Control[{{pts, {RandomReal[1, 2]}}, ControlType -> Locator}],      Control[{{ptsNA, {RandomReal[1, 2]}}, ControlType -> Locator}],           Row[{        Button["Add L1", pts = pts~Join~{RandomReal[1, 2]}],         Button["Add LNA", ptsNA = ptsNA~Join~{RandomReal[1, 2]}]}],      Dynamic@pts, Dynamic@ptsNA]      I could work out my way by adding all locators to the same set and manually assigning them to one "set" or another, but in my real application I have to add a different number of locators to each set at a time and also be able to delete them, so that complicates the code. **Edit** Thanks to Sjoerd's comment in another question, I found this limitation is covered in the documentation: > Due to internal limitations, it is not possible to combine individual > Locator variables with a variable that is a list of multiple Locator > variables: you can have only one multipoint Locator variable in a > Manipulate. However, in exchange, it is possible to add the option > LocatorAutoCreate->True to that one Locator multivariable specification, and > thereby allow you to create and destroy Locator points interactively > (changing the length of the list of points stored in the variable). So, no hope using `Manipulate[]`, accepting jVincent's answer.
