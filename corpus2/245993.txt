I use the Entity Framework often, but I have one area of confusion I would like to understand better. If I wanted to have a navigation property in an Entity such as               public virtual ExampleObject Example {get;set;}      it is also the done thing to have an Id property               public int ExampleId {get;set;}      My undertsanding is this creates a FK, but if I omit it, the functionality is the same and the FK seems to be created anyway. So, is there a reason for the additional field?
