The goal is to create an image like the one below ![Desired output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kjFI3.png) which was created using               ParametricPlot[{t, t^2}, {t, 0, 1}, Epilog -> Disk[{0.5, 0.5}, 0.09]]      but instead of using the Graphics primitive I want to use a Rasterized version of Disk. Using the commands below, how can I duplicate the result?               bkgd = Rasterize[Disk[{0, 0}, 0.09]];     pplot = ParametricPlot[{t, t^2}, {t, 0, 1}];      It is important that ParametricPlot remain un-Rasterized.
