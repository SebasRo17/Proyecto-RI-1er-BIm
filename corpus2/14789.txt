In What naming guidelines do you follow?, the author says: > Also I prefer to code using hungarian notation from Charles Simonyi. I've run in to several programmers who still prefer to use Hungarian, mostly of the Petzold/Systems Hungarian flavor. Think `dwLength = strlen(lpszName)`. I've read Making Wrong Code Look Wrong, and I understand the rationale for Apps Hungarian, where domain-type information is included in the variable names. But I don't understand the value in attatching the compiler type to the name. Why do programmers still persist on using this style of notation? Is it just inertia? Are there any benefits that outweigh the decreased readability? Do people just learn to ignore the decorators when reading the code, and if so, how do they continue to add value? EDIT: A lot of answers are explaining the history, or why it is no longer relevant, both of which are covered in the article I cited. I'd really like to hear from anyone out there who still uses it. Why do you use it? Is it in your standard? Would you use it if it wasn't required? Would you use it on a new project? What do you see as the advantages?
