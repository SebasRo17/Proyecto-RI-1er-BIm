I found the second definition of the function `FindGraphIsomorphism` not working. Here's the definition Mathematica 8 gives: > `FindGraphIsomorphism[g1,g2]` finds an isomorphism that maps the graph `g1` > to `g2` by renaming vertices. `FindGraphIsomorphism[g1,g2,n]` finds at most > n isomorphisms. I tried the following two tests. Define a simple graph by               graph = AdjacencyGraph[{{1,0},{0,1}}];      Then running `FindGraphIsomorphism[graph,graph]` yields `{1->1, 2->2}`, this is good. but running               FindGraphIsomorphism[graph,graph,2]      makes the Mathematica kernel dead. So I tried another graph,               graph = AdjacencyGraph[{{1,1},{1,1}}];      Running `FindGraphIsomorphism[graph,graph,2]` yielded error message: > FindGraphIsomorphism::nonopt: Options expected (instead of 2) beyond > position 2 in FindGraphIsomorphism[graph,graph,2]. An option must be a rule > or a list of rules. My conclusion is that `FindGraphIsomorphism[g1,g2,n]` is a bug. Or am I wrong somewhere? What should I do to obtain a result like: **Input:** `FindGraphIsomorphism[graph,graph,2]` **Output:** `{{1->1,2->2}, {1->2,2->1}}` * * * Update: It seems that the latest version of Mathematica does not support the third argument n in FindGraphIsomorphism. The form FindGraphIsomorphism[g1,g2,n] is no longer in the online documentation center. However, it exists in my older version 8.0.0, but fails to work. I still want to know if there is any way to make it work: FindGraphIsomorphism[g1,g2] gives one isomorphism, but how to get the list of more than one, or, all isomorphisms?
