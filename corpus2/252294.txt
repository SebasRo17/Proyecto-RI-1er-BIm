So I am just getting started with .Net WebApi and one thing that I am noticing straight away is that there is no Contract defining how the Api looks and should be consumed (Request/Responses from each Action), this is usually in the form of a WSDL for WCF/Soap. It seems to me like this is something that would be very valuable and make life a lot easier for consumers of your Api. Is there a reason there isn't one? Is there a programming paradime or principle that I am unaware of? Is there a way I could create one?
