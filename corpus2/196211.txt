Many projects on Github comprise a `LICENSE` file, usually looking like:               Copyright (C) 2012-2013 Mr. Creator          Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:          ...etc...      My problems are:   1. If I create a project, should I add the name of every single contributor in `LICENSE`?   2. If I fork other's project, should I add my name in its `LICENSE`?   3. What if I add some files under another license?
