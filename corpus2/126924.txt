It seems less common with newer websites, but many websites I need an account on (like for paying bills, etc.) prevent me from creating a password with spaces in it. This only makes things more difficult to remember, and I am aware of no database or programming restrictions on spaces in passwords, encrypted or (heaven forbid) otherwise. Why, then, is the spacebar so commonly discriminated against when it comes to signing up for a site?
