To make my notebook easier to read for non-Mathematica literate colleagues (myself included), I'd like to have the output from an assignment expression look somewhat more obvious. Normally an expression assignment would look something like this:               In[1]= myVariable = 1 + 1          Out[1]= 2      But I'd like to get an output that looks more like:               Out[1]= myVariable = 2      I'm sure there are very convoluted ways to get this as an output but is there some really simple thing I can do so that the input is also still fairly easily readable without a heap of other commands wrapped around it?
