I am using Entity Framework as my ORM in an ASP.Net application. I have my database already created so ended up generating the entity model from it. What is a good way to organize files/classes in the data access layer. My entity framework model is in a class library and I was planning on adding additional classes per Entity(i.e per database table) and putting all the queries related to those tables in their respective classes. I am not sure if this is a right approach and if it is then where do the queries requiring data from multiple tables go? Am I completely wrong in organizing my files based on entities/tables and should I organize them based on functional areas instead.
