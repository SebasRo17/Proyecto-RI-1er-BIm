Roles:   * Development Manager   * Program Manager   * Project Manager I have read a bit and independently I understand them well enough. However when you combine them, it seems to me that some responsibilities overlap and it becomes uncertain who is responsible for what. Does anyone have a clear way of defining how each role differentiate from the other? Or mainly which tasks are exclusive to each one? I want to avoid overlapping of responsibilities. I know there are other similar questions on the matter, but none exactly the same... Thanks EDIT: This 2 questions help a little, but still can't quite place each role when pushed together: What is the difference between a Program Manager and a Project Manager?
