Would anyone have an idea why the following doesn't work:               rule = {z -> x^2 + 2 x + y};     Manipulate[      Plot[z /. rule, {x, 0, 10}],      {{y, 2, "y"}, 1, 5}      ]      But the following do:               rule = {z -> x^2 + 2 x + y};     z /. rule;     Manipulate[      Plot[%, {x, 0, 10}],      {{y, 2, "y"}, 1, 5}      ]      and:               Manipulate[      Plot[z /. z -> x^2 + 2 x + y, {x, 0, 10}],      {{y, 2, "y"}, 1, 5}      ]      I was looking to `Plot` and `Manipulate` the results from a `Solve` of multiple equations, but it seems like I haven't understood the substitution rules correctly. Thanks, Jaleno
