I came across this link Parkinson Law where it says like "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." Do you agree with this? If yes, how do you enforce this with the people? In our case, if we ask the people to complete the task sooner and ask them to leave, some people they feel it as demotivate. What is your opinion to avoid the demotivate feel as well as complete & leave from work soon?
