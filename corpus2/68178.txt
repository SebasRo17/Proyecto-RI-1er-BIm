Suppose you have to interview a developer for a (not senior) developer position. The catch is that the developer is not from your country and your company would have to invest some money and time to bring him to your country. You have to make the interview. What skills would you look for in such a candidate? **For the sake of context** , suppose it is a position of a web developer or desktop developer. Thanks in advance **EDIT** : This question is related to the _developer_ point of view, so in this case, the answers should be oriented to help the developer in which to expect...
