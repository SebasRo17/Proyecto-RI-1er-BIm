Consider a database table of Items that have a status flag represented by an integer. A few of the status might be:               0 - Past Storage;     1 - Current Inventory;     5 - Scrap;     6 - Rework;     15 - Processing;      Now, I would like to avoid passing and querying for 'magic numbers' in my code, and in the past I have used a Dictionary to accomplish this, but this approach seems less elegant than what I hope to accomplish. How are these types of status flags retrieved from a database handled in object oriented code? Is it with enums, and if so, how? Or is it better to create a separate table with the status flag as the primary key?
