I often export images(plots, matrix, arrays, etc..) from mathematica which I end up putting in word documents or uploading to the web. The problem is that I often lose the original code and I am left only with the image representing the original output. I was thinking/considering of using one of the libraries discusses here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3335220/embed-text-into-png but was wondering what the Mathematica community new of any functionality built into Mathematica allowing to embed text(the code) into the image. ### Compatibility Table For Answers **Edit:** For documentation purposes this is the code I personally use. It varies slightly from the other answers because it embeds that data into the images pixels.
