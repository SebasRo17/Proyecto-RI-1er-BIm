I come from **php** community and just started learning **Python**. I have to create server-side scripts that manipulate databases, files, and send emails. Some of it I found hard to do in python, comparing to php, like sending emails and querying databases. Where in **php** you have functions like **mysql_query()** , or **email()** , in python you have to write whole bunch of code. Recently I found Django, and my question is: is it a good framework for network-oriented scripts, instead of using it as a web-framework?
