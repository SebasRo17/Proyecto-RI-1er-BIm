We are a group of students who are struggling with transforming this formula to run in mathematica. In fact there are many formulas that we are struggling with, but if we are able to see how this is solved we should be able to see how it is done and apply it to the other formulas ourself. We tried using spares Array but was not able to compute it. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XCcXf.png)               Subscript[x, 1]={{1,2}}     Subscript[x, 2]={{1,3}}\[Transpose]     Subscript[x, 3]={{1,4}}\[Transpose]     e={{2,4,5}}\[Transpose]          T is set to 3. and Subscript[w, j]= 1-j/H               1/T\!\(     \*UnderoverscriptBox[\(\[Sum]\), \(t = 1\), \(T\)]     \*SuperscriptBox[     SubscriptBox[\(e\), \(t\)], \(2\)]\)Subscript[x, t]Subscript[x, t]\[Transpose]+1/TUnderoverscript[\[Sum], j=1, H-1]Subscript[w, j]Underoverscript[\[Sum], s=j+1, T]Subscript[e, s]Subscript[e, s-j](Subscript[x, s]Subscript[x, s-j]\[Transpose]+Subscript[x, s-j]Subscript[x, s]\[Transpose])
