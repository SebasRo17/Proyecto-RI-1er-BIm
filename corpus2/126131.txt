I am planning on creating a compiler that will generate assembly, that is as far as I really want to go with this project (don't want to create the object files myself or any of the machine code). Since I'm doing this on linux, I would like to use the gas assembler. I'm not sure the best way to package the application. Should I require that the people have gas on their system already (which it is on most linux distros by default if I'm not mistaken, which I could be)? Or is it better to package the source with my application, or even package the actual application with my compiler? * * * By packaging I mean any form of distribution so that would include putting the code up on github as well.
