I can't figure out why an expression isn't evaluating, even though there's no `Hold*` in its `FullForm`:               Plus[Dynamic[a$65712],Dynamic[Part[MousePosition[List["Graphics",Graphics],List[0,0]],1]]]      I've been stuck for hours now, and have gone through all kinds of threads including the one about Trott-Strzebonski and `HoldCondition`, but I'm afraid I may have missed the answer even if it was staring me in the face, due to lacking experience. After reading How to | Evaluate Expressions inside Dynamic or Manipulate, I began to think it must have something to do with `Dynamic` or perhaps `MousePosition`, but my understanding is weak. Here's the full code, before I continue explaining:               opts = {Axes -> False, Frame -> True, ImageSize -> {600, 400}, AspectRatio -> 1/GoldenRatio};     testdata1 = Table[{i, 5 Sin[i/10] + RandomReal[]}, {i, 100}];     testdata2 = {Log[#], #2} & @@@ testdata;     map1 = MapIndexed[Rule[testdata1[[First@#2, 1]], #] &, testdata2[[All, 1]]];     map2 = MapIndexed[Rule[testdata2[[First@#2, 1]], #] &, testdata1[[All, 1]]];     Deploy@DynamicModule[{x1, x2, a, b}, Column[{         Graphics[{PointSize@Tiny, Point /@ testdata}, GridLines -> {{             x1 = test1 = Dynamic[MousePosition[{"Graphics", Graphics}, {0, 0}][[1]]] + Dynamic[a];             b = ((test2 = Nearest[map1[[All, 1]], x1]) /. map1)[[1, 1]];             x1         }, {}}, opts],         Graphics[{PointSize@Tiny, Point /@ testdata2}, GridLines -> {{             x2 = test3 = Dynamic[MousePosition[{"Graphics", Graphics}, {0, 0}][[1]]] + Dynamic[b];             a = ((test4 = Nearest[map2[[All, 1]], x2]) /. map2)[[1, 1]];             x2         }, {}}, opts]     }]]      The line in question is this one:                       x1 = test1 = Dynamic[MousePosition[{"Graphics", Graphics}, {0, 0}][[1]]] + Dynamic[a];      Instead of adding up the two `Dynamic`ed expressions, it's passing the held form to `Nearest`, which, of course, doesn't know what to do with such an input. That is, `debug1` and `debug2` output, respectively,               Plus[Dynamic[a$69525], Dynamic[Part[MousePosition[List["Graphics", Graphics], List[0, 0]], 1]]]      and               Nearest[{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,     31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,     61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,     91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100},1+0]      I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could point out where I went wrong.
