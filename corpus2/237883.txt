Now I'm only a novice programmer, but what my friends that are studying programming tell me is that recursive code is a good thing, it leads to less code duplication and it looks more elegant. Now it may be so, but everytime I've tried my hand with recursive code I've always found it to be significantly slower than non-recursive code, I'm not sure if it's something about the ways I've used it but I highly doubt it, I've used it for fairly simply thing's like Collatz Conjecture and Fibonacci number generation but whenever I've compared it against normal iterative code the recursive approach will consistently clock at around twice the time of the iterative solutions.
