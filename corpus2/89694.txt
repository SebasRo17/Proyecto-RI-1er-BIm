While going through RFC1321, I came across the following paragraph:                  This step uses a 64-element table T[1 ... 64] constructed from the        sine function. Let T[i] denote the i-th element of the table, which        is equal to the integer part of 4294967296 times abs(sin(i)), where i        is in radians. The elements of the table are given in the appendix.      From what I understood from paragraph, it means               T[i] = Integer_part(4294967296 times abs(sin(i)))      We know the following is true for all `x`:               0 <= sin(x) <= 1      Since `i` is an integer, `abs(sin(i))` may very well be `0` for all values of `i`. That means table will contain all zero values ( `4294967296` times `0` is `0`). In the implementation, this is not true. Why is this so?   Appendix contains just the raw values after calculation. It does not show how it is derived from the sine function.
