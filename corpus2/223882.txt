I am trying to develop a simple system for sharing data across several websites. Most of them are developed in PHP while some are developed in Wordpress/Drupal. Redundant information is spread across several websites and this has caused a problem where we have to update the information across several websites separately. I am trying to provide a solution where even static pages can get shared data. Here is my proposed architecture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h7JFZ.png) I am doing this for an academic institution. The data varies from simple fees structures to academic policies. For example consider academic costs. Academic costs -> ug, graduate, pharmacy... each of the departments will have a fees structure categorized by off campus, on campus, commuter.               "Undergraduate": {         "metaid": "0770",         "Offcampus": {           "FeesItems": {             "comprehensive": {               "label": "Comprehensive Fees",               "value": "2,141"           }         }       }     }      For front end using mustache, they just have to include the js and use something like below to get values,               <td>{{Undergraduate.Offcampus.FeesItems.comprehensive.label}} </td>     <td>{{Undergraduate.Offcampus.FeesItems.comprehensive.value}}</td>      My questions: Is this design scalable?   How to give the data owners the ability to edit the data?   How to store the data in sql?
