I have a xlsx file, that has some tabs with different data. I want to be able to save each row of a tab in a list. The first thing that comes to mind is a list of lists, but I was wondering if there is another way. I'd like to save that information in a object, with all its benefits, but can't think of a way to generate/create such diverse objects on the fly. The data in the xlsx is diverse and ideally the program is agnostic of any content. So instead of e.g. create a list for each row, than put that list in another list for each tab and each tab in another list, I'd like to store the information that each row represents in a single object and just have a list of different objects. The question can be summarized as : **What is an alternative to list of lists ?** A small graphic to visualize the problem :               +--------------------------------------------------------------------+     |LIST                                                                |     |                                                                    |     |    +------------------+ +------------------+ +-----------------+   |     |    | Class1           | | Class2           | | Class3          |   |     |    |------------------| |------------------| |-----------------|   |     |    | var1             | | var1             | | var5            |   |     |    | var2             | | var2             | | var6            |   |     |... | var3             | |                  | | var7            |...|     |    |                  | |                  | |                 |   |     |    |                  | |                  | |                 |   |     |    |                  | |                  | |                 |   |     |    |                  | |                  | |                 |   |     |    +------------------+ +------------------+ +-----------------+   |     |                                                                    |     +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
