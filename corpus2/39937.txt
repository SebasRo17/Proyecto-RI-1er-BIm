I wish to get a view plots from Mathematica trial version into a TeX editor, but cannot seem to do it (unless I print the screen and crop the image which leads to bad quality). Is there a way in which I can? I have tried saving the plot as an image file and copying the LaTeX code across but neither will allow me to do so. I should also note that I have a legend for the graph, which seems to be slightly separated... I'd ideally like both to be copied across. Thanks.
