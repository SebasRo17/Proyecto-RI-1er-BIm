For an `InterpolatingFunction` $y:\ \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, `Plus` is unaware of this, so when I do any modifications to it in an unevaluated form, it breaks the result               y = Interpolation[Table[{i, RandomReal[{0, 1}, 2]}, {i, 1, 10}]];     y[t]     y[t] + {1, 2}          (* InterpolatingFunction[{{1.,10.}},<>][t]`     {1+InterpolatingFunction[{{1.,10.}},<>][t],2+InterpolatingFunction[{{1.,10.}},<>][t]} *)      I ran into it doing things like:               y = Interpolation[Table[{i, RandomReal[{0, 1}, 2]}, {i, 1, 10}]];     f[t_] := Piecewise[{{ {1, 2} + y[t], t < 5}}];     df[t_] := Evaluate[D[f[t], t]]     df[t]     df[3]      And I can't figure out how to prevent expressions like `{1,2} + y[t]` from being evaluated while still being able to differentiate them. If `Plus` just realized that `y[t]` is $\mathbb{R}^2$ valued, I think that would simplify everything for me. Is there some way to set this property?
