I would like to be able to `Plot` a function (with an implicit `Integrate` command) with various values for a certain parameter (`phi` in the code below for values `0.01` and `0.02`) all on the same `Plot` to compare.Below is my code:               e = 1.60217657*10^-19;     n = 10^-9/e;     R = 1.5;     sigma = 50*10^-6;     p = (R*phi^3)/(24 sigma);     g = D[Exp[-((curlEprime)^2/2)], curlEprime];          G = p^(-(1/3)) (Exp[-((curlE - p)^2/2)] - Exp[-((curlE - 4 p)^2/2)]) +     Integrate[1/(curlE - curlEprime)^(1/3) g, {curlEprime, curlE - p, curlE}];          de = (2 e^2 n)/(3^(1/3) Sqrt[2 Pi] R^(2/3) sigma^(4/3)) G          Plot[de, {curlE, -10, 10}] /. phi -> {0.01, 0.02}
