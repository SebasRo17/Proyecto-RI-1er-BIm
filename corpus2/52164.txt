How are my results possible? CODE:               SetPrecision[FibersFailedNew, 40]      > >     3.612171938234261799295174910010284760488*10^-16 >                 SetPrecision[FibersFailedNewT2, 40]      > >     3.612171938234886971562562561866073555376*10^-16 >                 SetPrecision[FibersRemainingNewT2 = 1 - FibersFailedNewT2, 55]      > >     0.999999999999999666933092612453037872910499572753906250 >                 SetPrecision[FibersRemainingNew = 1 - FibersFailedNew, 55]      > >     0.999999999999999666933092612453037872910499572753906250 >   The values are calculated from previous equations in the specific notebook. If I would take only values and copy pasted them in a different notebook, of course, the results given are true. How is this possible? Does _Mathematica_ calculate in a different precision as set? of it calculates what is shown on the screen The values of `FiberFailedNew` and `FiberFailedNewT2` are different, but when subtracted from unity they give the same result.
