I am facing a problem in loading the package. My code is working in `Mathematica` but after deploying it into `CDF`, it is unable to load the package and shows error. The code was not even working in `Mathematica` when I evaluated it for the first time but when I evaluated it one more time it worked. I got help from this stackexchange question And now it is working in Notebook but not in `CDF`, after relaunching the Mathematica Kernel.
