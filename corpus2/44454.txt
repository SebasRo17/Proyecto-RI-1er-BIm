I'm extremely new to Mathematica, and I'm trying to import an edgelist representing a network, but I think I'm missing something major. **Here is my process so far just to import and visualize the data:**               SetDirectory["C:\\path\\to\\files"]     net = Import["data.csv"]     GraphPlot[net]      **The format of my data is as follows:**               A, B     A, C     B, D     C, E     C, F     C, G     D, F      I've imported a couple of different networks, and they all end up looking the same. I'm sure that I'm missing some major step, most likely in declaring that this is an edgelist.
