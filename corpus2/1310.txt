This is certainly a newbie question but I could not find the answer by searching. I am using Mathematica 8 under Windows 7. I want to use default magnification of 150% for all notebooks and help files which I open in Mathematica. At present I have to do it through Windows->Magnification for every single document I open which is of course tedious. I assume there is a way of setting some options which is saved across different sessions as well. Would appreciate any help.
