I need to aggregate multiple estimations, but I haven't been able to find a built-in function in _Mathematica_ that aggregates multiple probablity estimations (I am specially interested in estimations based on the `PERTDistribution`) I am being told that I need to:   1. Compute the standard deviation of each estimation   2. Compute the square of each taskâ€™s standard deviation, which is known as the variance.   3. Total the variances.   4. Take the square root of the total. First of all, is that correct? And if it is, is there a function in _Mathematica_ that can do all that for me? Something like a hypotetical `AggregateDistribution` that would work like:               AggregateDistribution[PERTDistribution[{min, max}, mode], numberOfEstimatesToAggregate]      Any guidance on a function that provides this or a way to do it would be welcome.
