It seems that more source control systems still use files as the means of storing the version data. Vault and TFS use Sql Server as their data store, which I would think would be better for data consistency as well as speed. So why is it that SVN, I believe GIT, CVS, etc still use the file system as essentially a database, (I ask this question as we had our SVN server just corrupt itself during a normal commit) instead of using actual database software (MSSQL, Oracle, Postgre, etc)? EDIT: I think another way of asking my question is "why do VCS developers roll their own structured data storage system instead of using an exisiting one?"
