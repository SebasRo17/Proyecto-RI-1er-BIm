In a Drupal programming guide, I noticed this sentence: > The theme hook receives the total number of votes and the number of votes > for just that item, but the template wants to display a percentage. That > kind of work shouldn't be done in a template; instead, the math is performed > here. The math necessary to calculate a percentage from a total and a number is `(number/total)*100`. Is this application of two basic arithmetic operators within a presentation layer already too much? Is the maintenance of the entire system severely compromised by this amount of mathematics? The WPF (Windows Presentation Framework) and its UI mark-up language, XAML, seem to go to similar extremes. If you try to so much as add two numbers in the View (the presentation layer), you have committed a cardinal sin. Consequently, XAML has no operators for any arithmetic whatsoever. Is this ultra-strict separation really the holy grail of programming? What are the significant gains to be had from taking the separation to such extremes?
