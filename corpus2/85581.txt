There are some job requirements of project management experience for a programmer, such as: > the candidate has to have some experience managing a project, not > necessarily with subordinates, but rather having worked on a project all the > way from design down to test. I was wondering   1. what "subordinates" mean here?   2. if there are some books, webpages or elsewhere with both **general guideline** and **simple practical sample projects** to help one get some basics about the whole process of a project. I am particularly interested in projects for both Linux and Windows, in C, C++, Python, Java. I am considering to start by playing on my own, not eager to find a company yet. My major was not CS, so I might lack the basics.
