I am researching programming languages used for AI programming. I know that LISP is taught as an AI programming language in my university, but Prolog rarely is. I am kind of fond of Prolog, but I'm not an AI programmer so I don't think I'm qualified to judge for myself why Prolog is better than LISP/Scheme. I was wondering if Programmers had any input on this topic. How could you argue that Prolog would be more useful for AI programming? I have been researching it a bit, and the basic argument I've seen over and over is that since thoughts are presented in logic, and Prolog is a logical programming language, Prolog can build decision machines easily, or something to that effect. Is there anything else that can be said for Prolog in AI?
