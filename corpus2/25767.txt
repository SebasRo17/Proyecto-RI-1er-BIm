In this question. I suggested that to test whether the input of a function was a matrix of numbers one could create the following test:               matrixnumQ[exp_] := MatrixQ[exp, NumericQ]      and then define the function as:               myfunction[W_?matrixnumQ]:=W      This is simple enough in this case but is there a way to test patterns on inputs in a single line if the pattern test is more complex than that above. Something like:               myfunction[W_?MatrixQ[#,NumericQ]&]:=W      This clearly doesn't work but just to give you the idea of what I'm looking for
