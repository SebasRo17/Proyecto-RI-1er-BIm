I’m working on a Markov Chain and hope there is a way to impose control over how Mathematica places edges to connect vertices in a Graph. My Markov Chain currently consists of 4 vertices with 2 of the edges crossing and is shown below. The edge coming out of Vertex 4 labeled “m” and connecting to Vertex 1 is what I’d like to change. Rather than being orientated as a vertical straight line, is it possible to direct this edge from Vertex 4 to the right in an arc so that the arc passes to the right of the “k” and then connects to Vertex 1 ? This will remove the crossing, be easier for others to read and be more architecturally correct. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XWS7X.jpg) My code is below. Thanks for any help.               softwareapplication =      DiscreteMarkovProcess[     1, {{0, b, c, 0}, {e, f, g, h}, {i, 0, k, l}, {m, n, o, 0}}];          transitionmatrix =      MarkovProcessProperties[softwareapplication, "TransitionMatrix"] //      MatrixForm          vertexlabels = {1 -> Placed["1", Center], 2 -> Placed["2", Center],      3 -> Placed["3", Center], 4 -> Placed["4", Center]};          edgelabels = {     1 \[DirectedEdge] 2 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 1, 2]],     1 \[DirectedEdge] 3 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 1, 3]],     2 \[DirectedEdge] 1 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 2, 1]],     2 \[DirectedEdge] 2 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 2, 2]],     2 \[DirectedEdge] 3 -> Placed[transitionmatrix[[1, 2, 3]], .25],     2 \[DirectedEdge] 4 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 2, 4]],     3 \[DirectedEdge] 1 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 3, 1]],     3 \[DirectedEdge] 3 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 3, 3]],     3 \[DirectedEdge] 4 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 3, 4]],     4 \[DirectedEdge] 1 -> Placed[transitionmatrix[[1, 4, 1]], .25],     4 \[DirectedEdge] 2 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 4, 2]],     4 \[DirectedEdge] 3 -> transitionmatrix[[1, 4, 3]]     };          Graph[softwareapplication, VertexLabels -> vertexlabels,      EdgeLabels -> edgelabels, VertexSize -> Small, ImageSize -> Medium,      VertexCoordinates -> {{0, 2}, {-1, 1}, {1, 1}, {0, 0}}]
