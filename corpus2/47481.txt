I've been playing with inline evaluation and I've came to the conclusion that it's most convenient to put the `Dynamic@` inside the inline cell, so I've started to search for a way to omit typing it altogether. I've tried using `CellEvaluationFunction` and `CellProlog`, but with no luck. How can I achieve this? Also, it would be best if the wrapping with `Dynamic[]` occurred only in inline cell evaluations (which happen in ordinary text cells)
