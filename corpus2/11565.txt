Let's say I have two `ArrayPlot[]`s. One is in redscale and the other is in greenscale, such that the lowest value is white and the highest value is pure red or green. How do I overlap the two `ArrayPlot[]`s such that intersections are a combination of red and green to give a yellow intensity dependent on the "red" and "green" values? **Edit** I understand that maybe the question is not so clear. I got my idea from a common technique in biology where red fluorescent and green fluorescent signals are captured separately, then merged together.   Areas of red and green together become yellow, but regions of red only or green only are just those colors in the merged image. I am aiming to translate this to data arranged in arrays such that the final merged image will show areas of red and green "signals" as yellow and red/green alone is still red/green alone.
