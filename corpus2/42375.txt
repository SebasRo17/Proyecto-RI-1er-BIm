Say I have one expression, for example $x^3-3 + c = y$, and I want to check if it implies another with some set of explicitly stated assumptions. With the previous example, assuming all variables are positive real numbers, we might ask if $x^3-3 + c = y$ implies $c = -x^3 + y$. This example is trivial, but I'd like to do the same where, perhaps, choices can be made about the use of various special functions or identities and there can also be inequalities. Is there something like `ImpliesQ[{exp1,exp2}]`?
