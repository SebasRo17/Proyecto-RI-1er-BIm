I'm not able to use `URLFetch` in my `$UserBaseDirectory/Kernel/Init.m` as it always returns `ImportString[Null, Text, CharacterEncoding -> "ISO8859-1"]`. Here is my test code, which works in a Notebook, but runs forever in the init file:               ip = $Failed;          While[ip == $Failed,          ip = Quiet@Check[URLFetch@"http://tyilo.com/ip/", $Failed]     ];     MessageDialog[ip];      The reason I would like to use `URLFetch` in my init script is that I have distributed it to a couple of friends and I would like to make it automatically update. Everything except the `URLFetch` part of the auto-update script works, so it would be nice to be able to finish this feature. If you could make it run asynchronously after Mathematica has fully started up, that would be fine too.
