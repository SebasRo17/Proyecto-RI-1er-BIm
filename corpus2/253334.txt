I'm trying to wrap my head around this article on OSS service discovery and I'm having a tough time seeing the forest through the trees. In that article, the author poses the main problem for service discovery: > The problem seems simple at first: How do clients determine the IP and port > for a service that exist on multiple hosts? But I'm not even sure what this means/implies. When talking about service discovery, what exactly are we talking about here? Is this like, if we want to connect to a database, we might need a host and port number defined somewhere, like:               host=mydatabase01.example.com     port=9300      ??? Is this what the author is talking about, and is what is implied by "service discovery"? If so, wouldn't the (obvious) solution be to just put a web service in front of everything? That way, clients don't care about what specific host/port they're connecting to, they just make RESTful calls to, say, `http://my-data- service.example.com`. It can't be this simple, as that article goes on to talk about things like ZooKeeper and Eureka, which seem to be very complex beasts. I'm clearly missing something; if so, can someone provide a specific, **concrete** use case of what is meant when we talk about "service discovery"?
