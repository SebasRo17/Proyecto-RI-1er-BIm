I am researching the Silverman rule of thumb for bandwidth selection. Below is a sample of my code, from which it seems that BW=63 is close to the default parameter given by _Mathematica_ (2 images are quite similar).               data4 = RandomReal[1024, {3600, 2}];     \[ScriptCapitalD]1 = SmoothKernelDistribution[data4];     \[ScriptCapitalD]2 = SmoothKernelDistribution[data4, 63];     {ContourPlot[PDF[\[ScriptCapitalD]1, {x, y}], {x, 0, 1024}, {y, 0, 1024}],       ContourPlot[PDF[\[ScriptCapitalD]2, {x, y}], {x, 0, 1024}, {y, 0, 1024}]}      ![2 images are similar](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xXVF4.jpg) Yet, according to articles the definition for Silverman R.O.T. should be:               H1 = (4/(dim + 2))^(1/(dim + 4))*n^(-1/(dim + 4)) StandardDeviation[data4[[All, 1]]]     (* -> 74.7864 *)      When I did this analysis for the 1D case, the _Mathematica_ results fit well to expectations. My question is: How does _Mathematica_ calculate BW by default? How can I see the BW results (other than trial and error until images are alike)?
