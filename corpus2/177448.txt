I am about to graduate from a good US school with a Computer Science degree, having good grades and high GPA. I have no freaking clue how to write a good program, how to properly test it... nada, zero. We were never taught how to write software. Yeah, sure the Computer Architecture class is important, and I can tell you a lot about how MIPS processor works, and I can tell you about Binary Trees and Red-Black Trees and running time of operations in Big Oh, but it has nothing to do with programming in "real" life. Heavens to Betsy, none of my classmates know how to use STLs or write templated code! To be honest, I found many of my classes to be a waste of time. What should I do? How do I step into real life and learn how to program ?
