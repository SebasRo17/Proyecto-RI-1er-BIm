I have a python program packed to .exe using cx_Freeze. I am trying to understand licensing implications:   * do I have to reproduce cx_Freeze license agreement?   * do I have to reproduce python license (PSF)?   * as python has standard modules incorporated into it, which might have yet another license, do I have to attach them (this is because cx_Freeze will pack them probably too, even if I don't use them)? Any hints would be appreciated!
