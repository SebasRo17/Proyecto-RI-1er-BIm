I have a polynomial $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_n)$ with coefficients in $Z[q,t]$, and I have a list of polynomials $g = g_1, g_2, \ldots , g_k$ where they are also polynomials in $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ and with coefficients in $Z[q,t]$. (Note that we are using specific values of $n$, like $n=3$ or $4$.) I am using PolynomialReduce$[f, \\{g\\}, \\{q,t\\}]$ to try to find the coefficients when $f$ is written as a $Z[q,t]$ linear combination of polynomials in $g$. However Mathematica always ouputs coefficients with $x_1, x_2,$ etc. when I only want $q$ and $t$ to be in the coefficients. Update: Upon suggestion, I also tried PolynomialReduce$[f, \\{g\\}, \\{x_1,x_2, \ldots x_n\\}]$ for the input, but mathematica still outputted coefficients with $x_1$, $x_2$, etc. For a couple of test cases I tried, I know for a fact that $f$ can be expressed as a $Z[q,t]$ linear combination of polynomials in $g$, so that is not the issue. Why is this happening? What can I do to fix it?
