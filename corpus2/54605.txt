After getting help from Rojo with Menu commands on Palettes and other windows without menu bars? I was able to create a Palette with a menu bar by:   1. Selecting the Palette and opening the **Option Inspector** with `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`O`   2. Setting `Editable -> True` and `WindowElements -> {"MenuBar"}` However the bar seems very glitchy:   * Sometimes it appears to be entirely disabled   * Then when I drag the window around or change focus a time or two it comes to life    * Then later becomes disabled again   * Sometimes it appears to be enabled (not grayed out) but I can't open any of the menus Further the menu commands themselves, when available, don't work right:   * Despite confirming that `Saveable -> True` the **Save** and **Save As...** items are disabled   * The **Palettes** > **Generate Notebook from Palette** item is also disabled; if not usable _here_ then where? Though I could not **Save** the Palette (Notebook) I captured its expression with `NotebookGet`:               Notebook[{Cell[        BoxData[ButtonBox["\"Beep!\"", Appearance -> Automatic, ButtonFunction :> Beep[],           Evaluator -> Automatic, Method -> "Preemptive"]], "NotebookDefault"]},       Editable -> True, WindowSize -> {700, 100},       WindowMargins -> {{Automatic, 51}, {266, Automatic}}, WindowFrame -> "Palette",       WindowElements -> {"MenuBar"}, WindowFrameElements -> {"CloseBox", "MinimizeBox"},       FrontEndVersion -> "10.0 for Microsoft Windows (64-bit) (July 1, 2014)",       StyleDefinitions -> "Palette.nb"]       ### Are other Windows users able to reproduce the series of bugs I described above? ### Has anyone figured out how to work with Palettes in Version 10 under Windows?
