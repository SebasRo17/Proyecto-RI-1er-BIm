I was wondering if it is possible to use a custom `Dynamic[var, function]` inside a `Manipulate`. The reason for the need is this: Suppose you have a time consuming computation like               timeConsuming[x_] := (Pause[1]; x)      and you want to use it in a `Manipulate`. Writing               DynamicModule[{y},      Manipulate[       y = timeConsuming[x]; {x, y, other},       {x, 0, 1},       {other, 0, 1}]      ]      entails the following issue: you have to wait for `timeConsuming` to be computed even when you change `other` and leave `x` unmodified. A (simple) solution is to code the dynamic by hand:               DynamicModule[{x = 0, y = timeConsuming[0], other = 0},      Panel@Column[{         Grid[{           {"x", Slider[Dynamic[x, (x = #; y = timeConsuming[x]) &], {0, 1}]},           {"other", Slider[Dynamic[other], {0, 1}]}           }],         Dynamic@{x, y, other}         }]      ]      This is feasible, but as a drawback makes you renounce all other `Module`'s conveniences. I tried coding something like               Module[(* result *), {x, 0, 1, some-suitable-function}]      but had no success in the attempt. A (clean) use of `Manipulate` would be much appreciated. Just to summarize, the question is: How can I make some statements be executed only when some specified controls are touched?
