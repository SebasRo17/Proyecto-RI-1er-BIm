This is an example from Mathematic Help,               DensityPlot[Sin[x] Sin[y], {x, -4, 4}, {y, -3, 3},         ColorFunction -> "SunsetColors", PlotLegends -> Automatic]      We can notice that the density values are from -1.0 to 1.0. However, I want to change this automatic density range to other values, for example, 0 to 0.5. Of course, the density plot should be different. This should be simple, however, I have no idea about it. Can you tell me how to change it? Thanks!
