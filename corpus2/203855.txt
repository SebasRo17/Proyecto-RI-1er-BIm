I have a problem I was hoping I could get some advice on! I have a LOT of text as input (about 20GB worth, not MASSIVE but big enough). This is just free text, unstructured. I have a 'category list'. I want to process the text, and cross-reference the items in the category list, and output the categories for each match, e.g. ## Input text The quick brown fox ran over the lazy dog. ## Category lookup _Colour_ Red | Brown | Green _Speed_ Slow | Quick | Lazy | Fast ## Expected Output Colour - Brown Speed - Quick, Lazy To add to the complexity of the problem, the source text probably doesn't match the categories exactly, e.g. there will have to be a fuzzy match algorithm of sorts applied here. I want to use 'Big data' tech to solve this (whether or not it TRULY NEEDS big data isn't the question - it's a secondary objective). My thoughts are to utilize Hadoop Map/Reduce with Lucene to do the fuzzy- matching. What do you think? Am I way off base? Thanks a lot - ANY advice appreciated!! Duncan
