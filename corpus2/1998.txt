I am wondering how do you set the parameters appropriately for $a_n,\,\alpha,\,\text{and }b_n$ to plot the family of solution of: > $u_n(r,t) = [a_n\cos(k_n\alpha t)+b_n\sin(k_n\alpha t)]J_0(k_nr)$ where the Bessel function of the first kind of zero order represents $J_0.$ $0<k_1<k_2<\ldots<k_n<\ldots$ are all positve zeros of $J_0$. The original equation is: $u_{tt}=\alpha(u_{rr}+\tfrac{1}{r}u_r), \quad 0<r<1,~ t>0,$ $u(1,t)=0, \qquad t>0,$ $u(r,t)$ remain finite as $r\rightarrow 0^+,$ $u(r,0)=f(r), \qquad 0<r<1,$ $u_t(r,0)=g(r), \qquad 0<r<1,~~$ where $f,g$ are initial displacement and velocities. I tried something of the type: > >     0<r<1; >     t>0; >     Plot3D[Cos[8.654 t] + Sin[8.654 t] BesselJ[0, 8.654 r], {r, 0, 1}, {t,0, > 10}] >   Choosing other parameters in the solution to have the value of 1. The output would resemble the following: ![vm](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ANTSt.png) First graphic is for $J_0(2.4r)$, Second graphic is for $J_0(5.5r)$, and Third graphic is for $J_0(8.7r)$.
