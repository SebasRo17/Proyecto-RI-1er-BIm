I'm trying to compare between Sqrt[3.] and Sqrt[3]. To display the result, I mapped HoldForm to display the expressions on the left hand column (code at end), but it seems like Sqrt[3.] had been evaluated before it was mapped on to. Is there any way to stop that to happen? ![Mapping HoldForm](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WnKid.png)               Grid[Prepend[{HoldForm[#], Precision[#],           MachineNumberQ[#]} & /@ {Sqrt[3.], Sqrt[3]}, {"Number",         "Precision[]", "MachineNumberQ[]"}],      Frame -> All]
