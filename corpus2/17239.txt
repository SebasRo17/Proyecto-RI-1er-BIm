I'm trying to write some code to programmatically replace a particular expression in my `init.m` file with a different expression. (It'll probably be some multi-line construct wrapped in a `Module[{someTag}, ...]` (where `someTag` is chosen to be unique and descriptive).) I was naively thinking `Import["init.m", "HeldExpressions"]` was going to be just what I needed, and would roundtrip nicely with an `Export[]`, but `Import[]` doesn't seem to help me preserve white space or comments. So I think I'm going to have to do this as text, and not as a list of expressions. I'm prepared to write my own (simple) expression splitter, but I'd be thrilled if there's some way for me to avoid going down that path. This might be crazy talk, but is there any good way to enlist the help of Mathematica's parser to spot where an expression begins and ends?
