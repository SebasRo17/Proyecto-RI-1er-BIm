If $d$ is a fundamental discriminant, `KroneckerSymbol[d,n]` is a Dirichlet character modulo $|d|$. _Which one is it?_ If $d>0$ is a prime $\equiv 1\bmod 4$, then it's `DirichletCharacter[d,(d+1)/2,n]`, and similarly if $d<0$, with prime $-d\equiv 3\bmod 4$ it is `DirichletCharacter[-d,(1-d)/2,n]`. In general, there is a function which, on input a fundamental discriminant $d$ outputs $j$ such that `KroneckerSymbol[d,n]` is equal to `DirichletCharacter[Abs[d],j,n]` for all $n$ relatively prime to $|d|$. The ability to compute such $j$ easily would allow one to use the built in `DirichletL` to compute the Dirichlet series attached to the Kronecker symbol. Of course one can build a table of values of `KroneckerSymbol[d,n]` and of all `DirichletCharacter[Abs[d],k,n]` for k=1,2,... `EulerPhi[Abs[d]]`, and then look for a match. I'm looking for something smarter and more efficient than that, for use with large composite d.
