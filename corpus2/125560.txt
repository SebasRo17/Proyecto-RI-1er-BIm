How worthwhile is it to take a job that will mainly involve working with an esoteric or niche language? Will this limit my prospect of moving back into languages that I prefer working with later in my career, or will the general experience of working in a software engineering job be enough? I suppose this question could be rephrased as: how much do employers care about specific language experience, as opposed to general programming experience and aptitude?
