Say you want to render a table with five columns, but you want the order of the columns to be different depending on some specific parameter. This would be very easy to accomplish if the model sets the order. The view can then simply use a loop and create the table accordingly. However, unless I have misunderstood things, we want to let the view handle how things are rendered (although I guess there may a gray area involved here in terms of what the view "should decide how to render")? It also feels ugly to let the model set formatting / order, but maybe this is another thing I might have misunderstood? If the view is supposed to deal with the order of the columns, what is a good way to accomplish it (read: having to use a lot of if-statements and other ugly code in the view)?
