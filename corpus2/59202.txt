I have a function `f[expr]` that is only allowed to take an expression `expr` that is a polynomial in `Subscript[x,_]`. By this, I mean that `expr` can be a sum/difference of terms (up to other multiplicative symbols) in $x_{\text{symb}}$, and symb can be any symbol (in Atomic form). The symbol $x$ cannot stand by itself, and it cannot appear inside other functions. Allowed form is: `expr = Subscript[x,i] Subscript[x,j] + b Subscript[x, k] Subscript[y, a] - 3 a Subscript[x,m]` (= $x_ix_j + b\, x_k y_a - 3\, a\, x_m$), But not   1. `expr = a Sqrt[Subscript[x,i]] + Subscript[x,j]` (Cannot be inside another function)   2. `expr = a Sqrt[Subscript[x,i]]` (same problem as 1.)   3. `expr = x + b Subscript[x,i]` (cannot be outside `Subscript`)   4. `expr = x` (same problem as 3.)   5. `expr = Subscript[x,i,j]` ($x$ cannot not have two indices)   6. `expr = $Subscript[y,x]$`. ($x$ cannot occur as an index) So, inside the body of `f`, I tried to do something like               Cases[expr, f_[x, y___] :> If[f =!= Subscript, Return[$Failed], "Pass"], Infinity]      But this misses the possibility that `x` is standing alone, outside of `Subscript`. Is there an economic way for checking if `expr` satisfies this property?
