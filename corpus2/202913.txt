I am currently in my last year of a Masters in Physics at Uni and I am looking to go into a job that is mainly programming based. As part of my course we have learnt C++, Matlab and as a hobby I taught myself HTML, CSS, JAVA and a bit of JavaScript. After getting to this stage in my degree I've realised that its actually the programming side of Physics that I enjoy most. I've been working on a few Android apps & websites in my spare time but only things that utilize what I know in JAVA, HTML etc. Using Physics in programming is good fun but I don't want to limit myself just to Physics based jobs. I just want to know a few things:   * What kind of jobs can I apply for that would require the kind of skills I already posses/can work towards possessing in a year   * Can I compete with graduates who have had a lot more programming in their course for example Computer Science?   * Are there any specific extra things I need on my CV before I start applying for these jobs?
