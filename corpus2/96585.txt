Every once and a while I find myself teaching others some techniques useful for writing effective unit tests (usually in Java where many people find writing tests challenging). However, I have yet to find a small-but-not-too- small problem to use to demonstrate the techniques. Likewise, I have not yet found a great problem we can use to practice writing tests. Some problems I have tried have felt completely unrealistic or irrelevant to real life. Does anyone know of a great problem I can use which is small but complex enough and realistic enough to use to teach and practice with? In this case _small_ = _low enough complexity to be a approachable for most developers_ , not necessarily _easy to finish in a short amount of time._ It is okay if we don't finish implementing a solution during the workshop.
