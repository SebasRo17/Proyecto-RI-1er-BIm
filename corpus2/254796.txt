I've written a `database` model class in PHP and have written a controller class that specifically validates the data before sending it to db. I'm getting criticism that I should handle the data in `database` model class rather than `controller` class. I wanted to write a generic db class which can be used anywhere for CRUD operations. Now can you guys please help me out in sorting this out? Whether I should validate the data in db model class or in db controller class?
