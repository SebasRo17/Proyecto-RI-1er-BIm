One has established design patterns so ingrained in their brain, that when sometimes somebody does something unexpected, it is a revelation. My colleague in an iOS project did call the delegate method from the delegate class itself. That means the delegator was not involved in invoking this method at all. Does this break some kind of principle or design pattern? Technically the delegate method is just like any other method and it is available in the class to call. But we are used to only delegators calling them. Is he breaking a promise of some kind?
