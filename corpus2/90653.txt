I just read a very compelling blog post from Scott Hanselman where he quoted colleague Erik Meijer as follows: > JavaScript is an assembly language. The JavaScript + HTML generate is like a > .NET assembly. The browser can execute it, but no human should really care > whatâ€™s there. - Erik Meijer He goes on to give examples of how some of today's biggest sites (the one he shows is from Google+, but cites also Bing, Facebook, etc.) are producing sites where when you do a "View Source", you will see a lot of tight "minified javascript". Essentially, unreadable on the surface. Simply put, you cannot go into a site and look at their source and see a pretty formatted version of the markup. My question to you is similar to what Hanselman asks: is that important to you? If it works, is that good enough? In my opinion, YES - results are what matters - Google is an example of that. But I must admit, as a developer, it is nice to have the ability to, once in a while, look at the source and get ideas and examples from sites I admire. Your thoughts?...
