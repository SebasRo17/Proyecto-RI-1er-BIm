I have heard a lot of good about JSF but as far as I know people also had lots of serious complains with this technology in the past, not aware of how much the situation has improved. We are considering JSF as a probable technology for a social network project. But we are not aware of the performance scores of JSF neither we could really come across any existing high performance website that had been using JSF. People complain about its performance scalability issues. We are still not very sure if we are doing the right thing by choosing jsf, and thus would like to hear from you all about this and take your inputs into consideration. Is it possible to configure JSF to satisfy the high performance needs of social networking service ? Also till what extent is it possible to survive with the current problems in JSF. What exactly are its problems ? * * * I am **not** worried about the development complexities with JSF what others usually complain about because as per my personal experience I believe that's not at all true, but I am more concerned about what performance and scalability issues. And please don't just abuse it on its old issues linked to previous versions. I just care about the present state whatever had been its past.
