When User A decides he want to pay a visit to http://example.com/ it all begins with a Request. A short moment later he is given a Response. In this cycle Request-Response a lot is going on, in different frameworks it's decoupled in different components among them Routing, Dispatching, etc. I'm looking to make a simple experimental MVP Framework for my learning, trying to use as many best practices, heck who knows it might even be worth using when I'm done. I'm not sure how I should decouple this cycle in to these different components and I'm not even sure of what each component is responsible for (Thinking SOLID, DRY, SRP, etc). That is what I am asking, looking at different frameworks these components seem to have different use-areas from time to time. What is each of these components responsible for and in what order are the used? Request, Response, Dispatcher, Router, Front Controller, Bootstrap, Events.
