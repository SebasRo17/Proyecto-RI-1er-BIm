Currently, there are two ways I know of to generate a package (.m) file from a notebook file; one is to set the `AutoGeneratedPackage` option in the Option Inspector, and the other is to use the menu optoin to "Save as" a package. The first doesn't really suit my needs because it creates the auto-generated packages in the same directory as the notebook file, which clutters things up (there are dozens of notebooks in this directory) and adds a needless complication to keeping the set-up version controlled. The second option is less than ideal because I don't know how to invoke the option programmatically. In theory, I know it might be possible with `FrontEnd` commands, but I'd really prefer to be able to do this without a front end if at all possible. This is something I want to do from GNU `make`, and while I know you can now set up front ends from the command line, ideally I could avoid that.
