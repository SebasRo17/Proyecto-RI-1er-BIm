I am currently designing a API and have come to a slight design issue and was hoping for a few other opinions. My url structure for accessing basic data from the API is: /clientName/appName/methodName/. Basically each client may have a different set of methods for each application, so the base application class is extended through each client if the file exists. My question is with limiting the data pulled back through a GET request. Should the limiting number be appended to the URL or is that something that should be handled through POST request only? Should it even be a option? Looking for best practices in this scenario, thanks.
