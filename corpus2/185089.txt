I was asked an interesting question: Should a database contains all data? Or heavy binary files should be stored in file system? Example of heavy binary files : videos or heavy pdf files (+200 MB) With an old aspx web app (1.1) I tried to open a 200MB pdf file stored as a blob in an Oracle 11g database, and it just run out of memory. However, same asp.net web application had no problem to open same pdf file stored in file system of a server. It could be that maybe there is some proper way to open heavy blobs fields with asp.net. For integrity reasons, I say that all data should be stored in database, but my described case showed me that maybe it's not the way. I read once that if your web application goes to cloud, then it would be very difficult to keep references of files stored in file system (file paths like: ../MyFolder001/MyFile.mpg), since you don't know where those files will be distributed. Should heavy binary files not be stored in database?
