In developing a notebook, I often find I have created a very boated file that takes a long time to save. I would like to slim it down. It is usually the result of graphics and images, but they may be hidden deep in the hierarchy of the notebook. Finding the wasted space is a pain. A very useful tool would be something that graphically indicated (perhaps in the cell marker) the number of bytes (or similar) that are within a cell. Anyone know of such a thing, or have a pointer on how to create?
