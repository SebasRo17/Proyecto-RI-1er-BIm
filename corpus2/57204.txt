This is an exercise from Power Programming with Mathematica by Wagner. I need a function which takes a function and a variable as arguments, like this: critpts[f_,x_]:= and then on the rhs I've got something like /;Derivative[f[x]]=0 as a condition at the end, and what I want is something that will generate a list of rules like x->0 which describe the values of critical points. An example would be that if the function worked it'd mean something like this: critpts[x^2,x] would generate something like this: x->0. I don't even know how I can generate a list of rules at all.
