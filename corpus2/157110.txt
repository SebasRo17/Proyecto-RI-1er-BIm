I'm developing a piece of software (a WordPress plugin) in PHP and Javascript and CSS. The PHP code must be licensed under GPL, but CSS and Javascript can be under another license (as far as I've understood). I'm thinking about writing a more permissive version of the AGPL license, and use it, for Javascript and CSS. It would be like the AGPL, but it would **only concern files accessible over the network** (e.g. Javascript and CSS). Motivation:   1. I want users of my software, and small companies that use and produce open source software, to be able to use my plugin for free, without having to publish any GPL licensed server side code (PHP code).   2. At the same time, I might not want "big companies" to copy all code I've written, without paying me something. — Most "big companies" would probably be unable to use the AGPL-like license discussed here, and instead I would offer them to buy a commercial license. **Question 1:** Is this a bad / impossible idea, for some reason? **Question 2:** Are there any obvious problems with the below license text? (Is this okay to ask here? If not, please consider editing this question to remove this part of it — or add a comment to me, that I should remove it)               ...The AGPL v3 license text..., see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html          Additional permission under the GNU Affero GPL version 3 section 7:          If you modify or combine this Program, or any covered work,     by linking or combining it with other code, then any such     other code not accessible remotely through a computer     network, is not, for that reason alone (i.e. linking or combining     it) subject to any of the requirements of the GNU Affero GPL     version 3 or later.
