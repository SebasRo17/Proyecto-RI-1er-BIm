How can I capture output from Print from a function which does not leave the printed object as its final output, (and which I do not wish to edit)? E.g.               Module[{},      Print[Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}]];      a = 123]      I would like to use something like a temporary setting for `$PrePrint` or `$Post`, rather than use cell selection (`SelectionMove`, `NotebookRead`). The aim is somehow to intercept the `Print` output -- the plot object -- and set it to a variable, (without altering the module). This attempt did not work:- ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mynMQ.png)
