I am trying to find the values of two parameters that allow for a specific result of my differential equations, under different initial conditions. Given a system of equations:               TestSystem = {H'[t] == p - H[t] (k1 sh[t]), H[0] == H0,        sh'[t] == -k1 H[t] sh[t] + k2 ss[t], sh[0] == sh0,             st == sh[t] + ss[t]};      I use `ParametricNDSolve` to compute the values of the dependent variables, while leaving `k1` and `k2` unspecified:               TestSolver[H0e_, st0_] :=      ParametricNDSolve[       TestSystem /. p -> 0 /. {H0 -> H0e}           /. sh0 -> st0 /. st -> st0         /. k2 -> k2estim /. k1 -> k1estim, {h, sh, st}, {t, 0,         300}, {k1estim, k2estim}];      The conditions that I want to evaluate are then specified by `m,d,hh`, at `t=300`:               m = 100 sh[k1estim, k2estim][300]/st;     d = 100 ss[k1estim, k2estim][300]/st;     hh = h[k1estim, k2estim][300];          cond1a[k1estim_, k2estim_] :=       Evaluate[m /. st -> 5.*^-6 /. TestSolver[1.*^-5, 5.*^-6]]     cond1b[k1estim_, k2estim_] :=       Evaluate[d /. st -> 5.*^-6 /. TestSolver[1.*^-5, 5.*^-6]]     cond1c[k1estim_, k2estim_] :=       Evaluate[hh /. TestSolver[1.*^-5, 5.*^-6]]          cond2a[k1estim_, k2estim_] :=       Evaluate[m /. st -> 5.*^-6 /. TestSolver[5.*^-5, 5.*^-6]]     cond2b[k1estim_, k2estim_] :=       Evaluate[d /. st -> 5.*^-6 /. TestSolver[5.*^-5, 5.*^-6]]     cond2c[k1estim_, k2estim_] :=       Evaluate[hh /. TestSolver[5.*^-5, 5.*^-6]]      Now, say that I wanted to find the following               1 < cond1a < 100,     0 < cond1b < 1,     1.*^-8 < cond1c < 1*^-5,     1 < cond2a < 50,     50 < cond2b < 100,     1.*^-8 < cond2c < 1*^-5,      How could I find the values of `k1` and `k2` that would satisfy such a thing? I was considering using `NMinimize` like this:               NMinimize[{1/cond1a+cond1b+cond1c+cond2a+1/cond2b+cond2c,cons},{k1,k2}]      (where `cons` would be the required constrains). Yet, this does not seem like an efficient and plausible way to solve this problem. Does anyone have any ideas on how I could approach this problem? Given that this is a multi-objective optimization problem, how would you suggest that I could specify the objective function? Thank you so much!
