I am working on generating some statistics by using twitter trends and streaming API. ( I have adjusted keywords such that traffic I get from twitter daily is of max size 1GB) I was currently working on localhost using PHP/MySQL combination(batch input to db, also using Redis in middle). For testing purposes, everything is fine but my question is Would a normal hosting server be enough to handle the load(of stream data from twitter+ cron script for fetching trends + the user traffic)? I have heard that app engine also supports php now. Will it be able to support the computational power with PHP as backend? I have worked with nodejs, but due to some reasons, I want this to be in PHP if possible. Please suggest if this is possible with PHP, otherwise I'll have to move my code to nodejs.
