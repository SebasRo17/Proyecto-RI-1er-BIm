Let's assume, for a second, that you're "the boss", or architect, or whatever position would permit you the authority to decide on the following question: You work on a product that's existed for a number of years and it's developed entirely in an imperative style/language. Let's also say that there is a feature or subsystem to be implemented that would benefit from a functional language/approach. A hypothetical example might be that the product is implemented in C# and the subsystem/feature could be implemented in F#. So your dev, who's a proficient F# developer, comes to you and says "I want to write this subsystem/feature in F#". Do you say yes, or no? Why or why not?
