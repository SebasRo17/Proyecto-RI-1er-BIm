I have around 8 years experience in software development. I have worked on application development all these years using C++ /win32. I few years from now I want to become a freelancer . I tried to look into some freelance sites and I am not able to find any projects on C++/win32. I feel C++/Win32 wont help me much and I need to learn new skills . But my job require me to still work on C++ , so I cann't learn any new skills. I can still learn some new skills but without good project , it won't make any sense. I have shortlisted few skills   1. php   2. jquery   3. perl   4. python   5. android I am still confused which one to start and how to get expertise in them.Any suggestions?
