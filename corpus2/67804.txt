I'm writing an application that will be made available for sale. I'd like to have a system to ensure that customers have paid to use the software. The variables to consider are: 1) Number of users in an organisation 2) Facilities available in the application to the users 3) Licensing period - ie one month or one year Are there any free or commercial offerings that can be used to help with this? What are the best practices for this kind of thing? What else should I be considering? My initial idea is to have a block of encoded text which is either emailed, or downloaded. The contents of the block of text would include a unique number for the PC, end date, facilities etc. I guess I would need a server somewhere to control the number of licenses for an organisation.
