If I have a photo album where each **Photo** can be commented on, Should the **Comments** be Entities or Value Object in these cases:   1. Comments can be added only anonymously (i.e. Comments have no relation to anything except the photo).   2. Comments can be added by registered users (i.e. there will be a relation between the Comment and User entity).   3. Comments can have comments (i.e. 1 user replying to another). I think modeling a Comment as Value Object in the first case sounds reasonable as a Comment won't have any relationships with any other entities. However, what about the 2nd and 3rd case? Does the need to identify which user Posted which Comment changes it from a Value Object into Entity?
