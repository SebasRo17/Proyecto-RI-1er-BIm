I have a function `Ca[t]` that oscillates like a Sine curve, that I used `NDSolve` to obtain. I want to calculate the average value of `Ca[t]` so 1/2(Max+Min) but I have not been able to do this successfully and I don't know what to do.                    Manipulate[                k1 = 0.5; k2 = 0.2;           r1 = -k1 Ca[t]^m;           r2 = -k2 Cb[t]^n;           xa = (Cao[0] -              0.5*(MaxValue[Ca[t], Reals] + MinValue[Ca[t], Reals]))/Cao[0];           Cao[t_] = 5 + A Sin[\[Omega] t];           sol = NDSolve[{              Ca'[t] == r1*\[Tau] + -Ca[t] + Cao[t],              Cb'[t] == r2*\[Tau] - r1*\[Tau] - Cb[t],              Cc'[t] == -r2*\[Tau] - Cc[t],              Ca[0] == 0,              Cb[0] == 0,              Cc[0] == 0},             {Ca, Cb, Cc}, {t, 0, 100}];             {{\[Tau], 5, "residence time/min"}, 2, 10, Appearance -> "Labeled"},        {{\[Omega], 0.6, "frequency"}, 0.2, 2, 0.02,                 Appearance -> "Labeled"},        {{A, 2, "amplitude"}, 0.5, 5, 0.05,                 Appearance -> "Labeled"},        {{m, 1, "m"}, 0, 2, 1, ControlType -> SetterBar},        {{n, 1, "n"}, 0, 2, 1, ControlType -> SetterBar}]      This is as much as I can trim my notebook, my latest attempt at calculating the average of `Ca[t]` inside the expression `xa`.
