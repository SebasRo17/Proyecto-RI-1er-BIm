We need to do pre-check-in code reviews. We are using Visual Studio and TFS. The built in code review functionality, is a bit odd to me. If I "reject" a check-in and comments what needs work, the review goes away. When the developer then makes the changes, he requests a new review, and I start all over again. Now, let's just say there are 10 files in this check-in. Maybe 7 of them were originally fine. Now, I have to review them again, as we are doing a brand new review. OR, I can track myself, what I have done. I can also, ONLY compare code with the original version, not the one from the reject review. So, my questions are:   1. what do you guys do?    2. What are your experiences with pre-checkin code reviews?
