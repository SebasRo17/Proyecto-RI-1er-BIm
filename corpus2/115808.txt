In my last job, I was hired for a specific project which the company lost before I even got a chance to start work on it: four people were made redundant on the same day. I spent three months there and while I did learn new dev skills (I worked on a minor project while waiting to start on the main one), I cannot consider myself an expert in the speciality of this company (barely passing familiar). As a developer, should I maintain this on my resume? Do I even say that I was made redundant or is it best to leave it out entirely? Rob :)
