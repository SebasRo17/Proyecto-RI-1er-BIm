I have a spectrum looking like List, and I want to convole it with a gaussian of the form               PDF[NormalDistribution[μ, σ], x]      (where σ also depends on x). The raw spectrum is convolved with the (gaussian) instrument profile. So I assume I should use `ListConvolve` rather then using Fourier transformations. `ListConvolve` takes two lists as its arguments, so I need to define my kernel. I tried               ker = Table[PDF[NormalDistribution[μ, C*x], x], {x, 4021, 4024, 0.05}]     ListConvolve[ker, data]      But the result doesn't seem correct. There must be a Gauss-function for every data point to get to the new dataset. Is there a better way to get the convolution done? I hope I could make my problem clear to everyone.
