in a WebLogic web application (bundled and deployed as a Jar) I sometimes get a NameNotFoundException when I try to fetch a datasource using JNDI lookup. The datasource is not shown in the JNDI tree then, but it can be seen under Services -> Datasources. It did work as expected and I don't think I changed anything since then. It seems like a race condition or something similar might play a role. This does not seem to be a common problem, which makes me think that I might be missing something very basic. I went through the wizard to create the datasource (Datasource and JNDI name are identical) and I tested it. Again, the programmatical access did work properly as well.               try {         Context context;         context = new InitialContext();         DataSource dataSource = (DataSource) context.lookup(datasourceName);         connection = dataSource.getConnection();     } catch (NamingException e) {         throw new ConnectionException(e);     } catch (SQLException e) {         throw new ConnectionException(e);     }      Are there any best practices or completely different ways to work with datasources? Anything you can think of that might make a difference?
