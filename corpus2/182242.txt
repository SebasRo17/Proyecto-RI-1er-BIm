I have an exam on Programming Concepts this Saturday and I am struggling to find some information to understand some concepts better. What is the difference between loop invariant and assertion? To me they look the same. Also, what exactly is `while` loop invariance theorem? Not sure whether it is me or it is ridiculously hard to find any specific information about algorithms and pseudocode online.
