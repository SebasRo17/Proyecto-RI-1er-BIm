I'm looking at UberSVN as a possible replacement to our existing source control package, VisualSVN Server. There are a lot of UI benefits for the decision, including having the integrated web UI, administration portal and collaboration features. The concern I have is what difficulties I'll face in migrating from VisualSVN to UberSVN and whether there could be any impact to our repositories. Any experience or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
