I'm a SQL guy, but I know there is _Not Only SQL_ databases - document- database mostly. As with most technologies there are pro and cons for each technology. I've read some articles, but they were too theorical. What I would like is two real cases :   1. when a switch from relational- to document-database gave an improvement    2. when a switch from document- to relational-database gave an improvement Improvement being any thing that makes better programs - less developpement time, scalabilty, performance, anything that is programming related. There is a caveat for 2. : stories like " falling back to relational database because everybody knows SQL" is not good
