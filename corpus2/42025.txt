The result of my calculations is quite large list (nested list to be precise). I would like to improve its visualization, to make it more legible, by setting the number of columns to let's say 5. Documentation Center suggests an option `AllowedDimensions`, but it is new in ver 9. How can I make it happen in version 7? Thanks for any hints. **Edit:** The list has two sublists of equal length, simple example would be:               list={{45.1,73.5,12.9,56.4,114.6,87.1,90.5,263.8,99.3,104.6},          {0.34,0.12,0.56,0.95,0.25,0.57,1.03,0.73,0.92,1.02}};      **Edit 1:** After setting the number of columns to 5 it should look more or less like this:               {{45.1,73.5,12.9,56.4,114.6,       87.1,90.5,263.8,99.3,104.6},      {0.34,0.12,0.56,0.95,0.25,       0.57,1.03,0.73,0.92,1.02}};
