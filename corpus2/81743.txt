I will not bother you with details of my discussion so I will present it in the form of a short instance. A java guy has been following articles and publications of a famous programmer (a kind of Martin Fowler of my country). He says that he is sharing some secrets which other famous programmers don't share. I never believe that there are some secrets like wizards in the programming area. But some programmers who are not good yet in this area think that other famous programmers are success because they know some secrets that we don't. I totally disagree with this and I discussed it with someone and finally he said to me you are 2 years in this area and he (java guy) is 20 years professional programmer so he knows better than you. I wanted to be sure that I am not wrong. That's why I wanted to know this.
