I think the world now programs in English-based programming languages not only because of historical/economic circumstances, but because the English morphology in particular has some properties that suit algorithmic thinking best. But anyway it would be interesting to hear your opinions on this, especially if you are multilingual yourself. I've seen some mentioning of German-based languages (see Plankalkul for example, in fact the first ever programming language we know very little about, thanks to WW2), also a Russian-based flavor of Algol which existed back in the 80's at least on paper, not sure if it ever existed in binary or not. Both looked a bit sluggish because there were more shortened words and weird abbreviations than full words like in the EN-based languages. So if you know of any other national language-based PL's, even completely archaic and irrelevant today, purely theoretical or whatever, would be interesting to take a look at them. And back to the main question: so what, if any, makes the Shakespeare's language so good for programming? (There is actually a list of Non-English-based programming languages on Wikipedia (of course, where else?), but it would be interesting to hear opinions of native speakers of those languages on how a given "national" programming languages really feels like.)
