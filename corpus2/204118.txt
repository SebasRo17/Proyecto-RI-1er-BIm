I'm in my second java course at school and am thinking of developing a web service client library for one of my projects. I'd like the library to be able to query the MusicBrainz web service and have it return a data object or search results depending on the query. Does anyone have any advice or a reference that I can be pointed to? Specifically, I'm looking for advice on how to structure my code (e.g. how do I break up my classes) as well as help understanding how communication should flow from some external app, my library, the web service, and back. There is an existing MB java client library, but I am trying my hardest not to go rummaging through it. I want to have the satisfaction of building my client from scratch and not just copy/pasting code and ideas from the existing app. **Edit:** Just to be clear, I'm not saying that I want to avoid looking at other libraries. What I meant above is that I know that there is already a library that does what I'm looking for, but since I'm fairly new at this stuff I want to avoid the temptation of just blindly copying ideas when I get stuck or when I'm not sure which direction to go in. Having multiple references would hopefully put me in a better position to know what to do. What I'm looking for is some kind of reference guide I can use to build my own library. I haven't found much on my own so I thought posting a question on here might give me a few ideas or some new things to check out.
