I've seen some people love and some loathe Perforce. As users or administrators with experience with other version control systems (free cookie to the ones with DVCS experience [git, Mercurial]), what is the main reason/feature that makes you love Perforce over other version control systems? **Edit** : No, I don't sell Perforce... this is just part of my ongoing research to pitch DVCS at my company (see my question history)
