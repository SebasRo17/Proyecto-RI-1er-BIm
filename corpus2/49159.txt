I am trying to solve the equation system `eq1==eq2` for $\sigma1$ and $\sigma2$ where `eq1` and `eq2` are functions of 5 positive real variables as defined below:               eq1=(2 Sqrt[5 + 4 x1 + x1^2 + 2 y1 + y1^2])/(Sqrt[5] (2 + x1) (1 +y1))          eq2= (2 (1 + s) Sqrt[5 + 5 s^2 + 4 x1 \[Sigma]1 + x1^2 \[Sigma]1^2 + 2 y1 \[Sigma]2 + y1^2 \[Sigma]2^2 + 2 s (5 + 2 x1 \[Sigma]1 + y1 \[Sigma]2)])/(Sqrt[5] (2 + 2 s + x1 \[Sigma]1) (1 + s + y1 \[Sigma]2))      I am interested only in those solutions which are only a function of variable `s`. As a matter of fact I can simply verify that `s+1` is a solution:               eq2 /. {\[Sigma]1 -> 1 + s, \[Sigma]2 -> 1 + s} //FullSimplify[#, s > 0] &      however, I have not been able to find this solution using Mathematica. I have tried the following               Reduce[eq1 == eq2 && 0 < x1 && 0 < y1 && 0 < \[Sigma]1 &&0 < \[Sigma]2 && 0 < s, {\[Sigma]1, \[Sigma]2},Reals] // FullSimplify      and               Solve[eq1 == eq2, {\[Sigma]1, \[Sigma]2}, Reals] // FullSimplify      but none of these result in the simple solution `s+1`. My question is what is the right approach to solving this kind of equations in Mathematica.
