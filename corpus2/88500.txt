I would like to switch from a 5 day week to a 4 day, but maintain a 40 hour working week. Would the 10 hour days affect your ability to be productive? I hate our public transit system so if I could reduce my transportation by 20% I would be happy.   If other developers who work 10 hours shifts could be clear as the their experiences with it that would help me. I think my boss is flexible enough that he would be cool with it.
