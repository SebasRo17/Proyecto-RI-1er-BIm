I need to combine two plots on the same graph to highlight the intersection of the two while being able to manipulate various parameters that are common to both functions. I need to have the slider simultaneously change the parameters for each function and continue to plot on the same graph. Here's my code:               Manipulate[      right = Plot[Cos[2*Pi*b*n/\[Lambda]], {n, 0, 2}], {{a, 25,         "x-separation"}, 20, 30}, {{b, 25, "z-separation"}, 20,        30}, {{r, 1, "Rod Radius"}, .1,        10}, {{\[Lambda], 100, "Wavelength"}, 50, 200}]          Manipulate[      left = Plot[        Cos[2*Pi*           b/\[Lambda]] + (\[Lambda]*Sin[2*Pi*b/\[Lambda]])/(2 a*            Log[a/(2*Pi*r)]), {n, 0, 2}], {{a, 25, "x-separation"}, 20,        30}, {{b, 25, "z-separation"}, 20, 30}, {{r, 1, "Rod Radius"}, .1,        10}, {{\[Lambda], 100, "Wavelength"}, 50, 200}]          Show[right, left] // Dynamic      Any help is much appreciated!
