Is there a "Mathematica Way", like Map or Apply to compute the following double sum? $\sum_{i=1}^{N_1}\sum_{j=1}^{N_2} m_i n_j \, f(\tau_{i} \gamma_{j})$ I have already stored the lists $m,n,\tau,\gamma$. $m$ and $\tau$ are of length $N_1$ and $n$ and $\gamma$ of length $N_2$. So my approach was to use something like               Outer[f, τ, γ]      for the function map, and then               Total[Total[Outer[f, τ, γ]]]      but how do Ι multiply `m`and `n` into the sum? EDIT: Undo Edit, figured out the bug in my code
