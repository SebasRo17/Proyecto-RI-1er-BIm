My contract has just ended and I'm wondering what possible jobs I might want to look at next. I've worked in banking and insurance industry for all my career (including one Fortune 500 company) and in my experience banking is the slowest (and most boring) industry to work for due to their strict business practices (which is fair enough). The upside is that they pay well. ### My questions are:   * What are the best and worst industries for developers to work in? That is, in the industries you have worked in, what was good and bad from a developer perspective (money, work, culture, benefits, colleagues, etc.)?    * How does working as a consultant affect your opinion of an industry?   * Seeing that I've mentioned boredom, which industry supports fast growth?
