This all may come across very newbish, but I'm trying to wrap my head around designing a website that is thoroughly RESTful. I understand applying RESTful design to things like Users, Photos, Blog Posts, etc. because I think of them like "objects". But, what about an "about us" page. What kind of resource is that? Is it even a resource in the RESTful sense of the word? Also, say I go to the URL "http://www.example.com/", what resource am I asking for? The index resource?
