I have a list of data as follows with repeated x-values:               data={{42, 2.73}, {41, 3.5}, {41, 3.16}, {41, 2.73}, {39, 2.83}, {39,        2.66}, {47, 3.22}, {41, 2.86}, {41, 3.38}, {42, 2.62}, {39,2.32}, {46, 2.99}, {49, 2.3}, {39, 3.22}, {42, 1.53}, {49,1.46}, {49, 1.88}, {49, 1.08}, {47, 1.01}, {41, 1.17}, {40,1.3}, {46, 2.32}, {43, 1.85}, {39, 2.63}, {40, 2.72}, {49,1.9}, {48, 1.76},      {40, 1.67}, {42, 2.73}, {48, 2.97}, {43,1.81}, {41, 0.88}, {41, 2.56}, {40, 2.4},      {39, 2.08}, {49, 1.84}, {48, 2.07}, {46, 1.84}, {45, 2.24}, {44, 1.29},      {44, 2.05}, {42, 1.78}, {41, 1.59}, {40, 1.27}, {49, 3.21}, {47, 2.81}, {44, 3.1},      {43, 3.29}, {39, 3.3}, {44, 1.71}, {46, 3.08}, {47, 3.7}, {46, 3.04}, {44, 3.04},      {45, 2.88}, {49, 2.69}, {47, 1.74}, {47, 2.36}, {45, 2.94}, {44, 1.97}, {44, 2.55},      {43, 1.53}, {43, 3.91}, {42, 3.22}, {39, 1.84}, {44, 1.13}, {46, 1.48}, {42, 2.85},      {41, 4.21}, {41, 2.4}}      a) How do I find the mean + standard error for each distinct x-value, and present the result as a graphical plot for all elements of the above list? b) How do I determine the linear fit based on these mean values?
