Suppose I have a function $p(x+\epsilon,y-\epsilon,t)$, and I want to expand it around $(x,y)$ like $$ p(x+\epsilon,y-\epsilon,t)=p(x,y,t)+\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial x}\epsilon+\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial y}(-\epsilon)+\cdots $$ A naive way to do it is               Series[p[x+e,y-e,t],{x+e,x,1},{y-e,y,1}]      which will result in the following error message:               General::ivar: "e+x is not a valid variable."     ....      Right now I do the expansion in the following clumsy way:               Replace[     Normal@Series[p[x, y, t], {x, a, 1}, {y, b, 1}],      {x - a -> \[Epsilon], y - b -> -\[Epsilon]},      Infinity]      /. {a -> x, b -> y}      **Question** : Is there an elegant way to do it? In the end, I want to expand $p(x,y,t)$ in $$ -(x+z)p(x,y,t)+(x+\epsilon)p(x+\epsilon,y-\epsilon,t)+(1-x-y+\epsilon)p(x,y-\epsilon,t) $$ and keep only the $\epsilon$ terms.
