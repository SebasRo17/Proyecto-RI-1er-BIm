I've unsuccessfully tried many ways of converting polygon points into a graph using _Mathematica_ 7, and I am frustrated. I looked at this post, but it doesn't work:               Needs["Combinatorica`"];     crds = {{1, 10}, {2, 4}, {10, 5}, {20, 10}};     vertices = Range[Length[crds]];     edges = Thread[vertices \[DirectedEdge] RotateLeft[vertices]];          Graph[vertices, edges]      produces errors:               Syntax::sntxf: "\!\(\*StyleBox[\"\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\"\", \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\!     \(vertices\), \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\"\\\"\\\\\\\" cannot be followed by \\\\\\\"     \\\"\", \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\!\(\(\(\\[ DirectedEdge]\)\) \(\(RotateLeft[vertices]     \)\)\), \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\"\\\"\\\\\\\".\\\"\", \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\!     \(\"\"\), \"MT\"]\)"          Syntax::tsntxi: "\!\(\*StyleBox[\"\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\"\", \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\!\(\\[      DirectedEdge]\), \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\"\\\"\\\\\\\" is incomplete; more input is      needed.\\\"\", \"MT\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\!\(\"\"\), \"MT\"]\)"          Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed.      Any ideas?
