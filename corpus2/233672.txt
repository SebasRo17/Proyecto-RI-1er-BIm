As far as I can tell, you can make your interface known to others by providing your .h file. Your .cpp is the implementation. Then they can see the function names, the parameter types, the return type, maybe a description of how to use a function, and maybe what it does in the .h file. Then I read in posts here about using namespaces to separate the interface from the implementation. What does that mean? Doesn't a namespace only let you know that a name exists in that namespace? So please provide an example, I can't find any.
