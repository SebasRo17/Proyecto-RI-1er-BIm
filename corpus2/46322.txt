I'm trying to obtain an equivalent system of inequalities to the one below but **without** the variables x and z. Somehow Reduce just repeats the command.               v[x_, y_] := a*x^2  + b*x*y + c*x       sc1 := ForAll[{x, z}, {z >= x && x >= 0 && z <= 1}, v[z, x] - v[x, x] >=0  ]     sc2 := ForAll[{x, z}, {x >= z && z >= 0 && x <= 1}, v[z, x] - v[x, x] <=0  ]     Reduce[(sc1 || sc2), {a, b, c}]      Is there some basic error I can't see? I looked at questions about using Reduce with ForAll but did not find anything similar.
