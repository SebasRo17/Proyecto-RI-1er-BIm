Yesterday I read this great article about Concurrency in JRuby from EngineYard and I realise I need to leverage my skills about concurrency in Ruby, by mentioning Ruby here I mean it could be **all** implementations of Ruby : JRuby, Ruby MRI, Rubinius, Ruby on Parrot / Cardinal except IronRuby, I don't code in Windows Environment. What I learned from Haskell world, especially from Simon Peyton-Jones, he said on his video that OOP is all about state. Note: I'm very very inexperienced when I mention Haskell, I only watched some good videos about Haskell, solved very few (less than 10) euler project in Haskell, read some good Haskell books and tutorials, I've never coded in Haskell professionally, I just read some source codes in Haskell, ex. pugs, Darcs, and some other Haskell codes I don't remember the source. I might want to use Jaskell to trick concurrency as long as I use jruby, but that's for my long term learning plan, I want to maximise my concurrency skill in ruby first, **do you have any suggestions for me to learn concurrency in ruby?** I wish there were a kind of Head First book for me to learn Concurrency in Ruby. Things like strategies / how to tackle concurrency problem in ruby, inspired from EngineYard article and Haskell. Maybe some good downloadable videos that explain step by step to strengthen my fundamental about concurrency generally and then move to concurrency in ruby specifically. Advice? Thank you.
