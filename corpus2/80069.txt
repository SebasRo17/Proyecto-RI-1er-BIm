I volunteered to instruct an after school computer club at my son's middle school. There has been a lot of interest in computer viruses. I was thinking about showing them how to create a simple batch file virus that will infect other batch files in the same directory. Also show how creating a batch file with the same name, but that is closer in the path, can replace another program. It could also allow for discussion of anti-virus techniques - recognizing viruses and virus like behavior. I mentioned the idea to my wife and she thought it was a terrible idea. Compared it to giving them loaded weapons. I don't see it as dangerous since this technique wouldn't be immediately applicable for any real mischief on any modern operating systems. Am I being too cavalier or is she being too concerned? This isn't a settle this argument for me question, I am just trying to get another opinion. **Update** : I don't plan to cover moving between systems (or even directories) or any malicious behavior. And lest anyone think I am revealing any deep dark secrets, here is a book from 1996 I found at the library that goes into a lot more detail than I planned to cover. If some is motivated to be malicious they will find a way.
