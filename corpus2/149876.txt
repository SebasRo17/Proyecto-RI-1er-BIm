I am in the second year of my CS degree, and so far most of the projects I worked on were pretty "programming intensive", which I like. For example, developing a Sudoku solver, creating a database management system from scratch in C, implementing algorithms to find the shortest routes between cities and so on. Recently I started working on some projects outside of my academic environment. Those include a web app and a couple of Android ones, which I shipped and got some people using. What I noticed with those "real world" projects is that I spend much less time programming, and a lot more time learning about the platforms, searching the web for that library I need, trying stuff until it works the way I need, learning to use tools that might help on the project and so on. In other words, I end up writing 5 to 10 lines of code per day because the rest of the time is spent learning auxiliary stuff. **My question** : Is this normal for real world projects, or once you master the platform you are working with you'll go back to programming intensive work?
