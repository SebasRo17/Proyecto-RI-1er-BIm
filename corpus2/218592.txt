I'm implementing a system that's basically a pipeline of XML documents: XML documents are retrieved over the Internet, validated, further processed etc. until they are ingested in a relational (non-XML) database. After the ingestion in the database they can be discarded. Since the various components of the pipeline are somewhat independent from each other I want to use a number of separate applications, each performing a "step" in the pipeline. What should be the reasoning behind choosing the file- system for data sharing between the above applications versus some noSQL database? The data to be shared is mostly XML files and total volume of data that goes through the pipeline maybe 10 gigabytes per day.
