I have successfully installed CUDA 5.0 on my Ubuntu 12.10, with driver 304.54, toolkit and samples. Running deviceQuery gives me a successful output:                   Detected 1 CUDA Capable device(s)                Device 0: "GeForce 9500 GT"           CUDA Driver Version / Runtime Version          5.0 / 5.0           CUDA Capability Major/Minor version number:    1.1           Total amount of global memory:                 512 MBytes (536543232 bytes)           ( 4) Multiprocessors x (  8) CUDA Cores/MP:    32 CUDA Cores                etc...      bandwidthTest is also successful:                    Device 0: GeForce 9500 GT          Quick Mode               Host to Device Bandwidth, 1 Device(s)          PINNED Memory Transfers            Transfer Size (Bytes)    Bandwidth(MB/s)            33554432         5628.6               etc...      I stress that my card is listed among the compatible CUDA cards for Mathematica. However, in Mathematica 9.0.1.0, running                   Needs["CUDALink`"]         CUDAQ[]      returns                   False      running                   CUDAInformation[]      returns                   CUDAInformation::invdriv : CUDA was not able to find a valid CUDA driver.         Refer to CUDALink System Requirements      and running                   CUDADriverVersion[]      returns                   CUDADriverVersion::nodriv :          CUDALink was not able to locate the NVIDIA driver binary.         Refer to CUDALink System Requirements      So it cannot find both the binary and the libraries, and referring to the CUDALink system requirements help page is not helping. Any ideas?
