I have designed a reporting system to be used in our enterprise level application.   I am able to open source it as this is not our business, and we can gain improved code by contributing it to the community.   My question, is there all ready a reporting system written in PHP, written for php 5.3 by the latest standards etc? Some features of the current version:   1. 100% MVC separation   2. Good framework to manipulate query results, before, during and after fetching   3. easily apply pagination to report   4. Extremely easy to apply numerous filters to reports   5. System, once is learned, can be easily extended (has hookups almost to anything)   6. easily re factored   7. statistical functionality. (Will also be happy to hear what other features I need to add).
