The _Mathematica_ help menu contains an entry _Find Selected Function_ (`Cmd`+`Shift`+`F` on OSX). If you are working with say `Transpose` and want to look up its _reference page_ , you just select `Transpose` with the mouse, hit `Cmd`+`Shift`+`F` and _Mathematica_ opens the _reference page_ for `Transpose`. Works beautifully. **Question:** How to get this to work for your own packages? So, suppose your package is correctly built, and it has its own functions:               MySuperFunc     FunkyMonkey     FunkMeister2      and the documentation pages are correctly created, correctly defined and correctly installed for each of those functions. You select `MySuperFunc` with the mouse, select _Find Selected Function_ , expecting _Mathematica_ to open the _reference page_ for that function but it doesn't work. Instead, _Mathematica_ opens up something akin to a Google search on "MySuperFunc", providing a list to anything it can find on that name. But that's not what I want. And it's also not what that menu function is supposed to be doing: Find SELECTED Function! Not a google-type search. Just open the _reference page_ for the selected Function. Anyone have some tips on how to make this work as advertised? * * * Addendum: If one enters:                ?MySuperFunc      ... you get the usual Help blurb on the function, such as:               MySuperFunc[b] returns blah given b. >>      ... and if you then click on those two little `>>` arrows, _Mathematica_ opens the Help _Reference_ page for `MySuperFunc` PERFECTLY, which is exactly what FindSelectedFunction _should_ be doing, but is not doing. And if it works perfectly for the `>>` info blurb, why can't it work just as perfectly for FindSelectedFunction?
