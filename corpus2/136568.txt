I could not differentiate between FreeBSD and GPL liecense. Can anyone tell me the in what respect these two liecense are different. Is it legal to use some source based on GPL license and release the new product as FreeBSD license? In particular, I have following scence: I would like to follow some of the implementation module of some implentation for my use. The implementation is standard algorithm implementation. So basically i am taking some reference to implement in my own way. I am not making use of verbatim copy, some module matches with the original one. The one which i am taking reference is in FreeGPL V3 license. The new product which i will release with FreeBSD license. Is it legal to do this or I should relase my product in FreeGPL license? [EDIT] Moreover, my case is, I am implementing some standard algorithm. Lets say here a data structure linked list. I think,whoever implements it, he/she will have same structure and similar kind of functions for search, delete and insert.Even the operations will be seen. I saw some code in internet and i got the influence of that of code my implementation which was so unavoidable. In this case how can a programmer can claim that the particular code is his own original code?
