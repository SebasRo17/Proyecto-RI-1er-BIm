I've noticed on MySQLWorkbench that you can choose how to store your indexes before forward engineering your design. The storage types are:   1. BTREE   2. RTREE   3. HASH Researching this, I found some information that was pretty much over my head, so I'm looking for practical information on what the difference is between these and/or why you should choose one over another. Also, I have never chosen a storage type before, so I assume MySQL is choosing a default storage type (BTREE?)
