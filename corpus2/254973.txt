I'm going to have a mySQL table with elements in it and would like to rank them in the same manner than Reddit but not quite. I'd like to know how to add or remove importance to a variable in my ranking algorithm. For instance, what I have is a time (a timestamp, so a huge value) and a number of upvotes (a smallish value, under 50). How do I give more importance to the upvotes and less to the time?
