I seem to be having some trouble with the `Sinc[x]` function, and I think it's due to rounding, but I'm not sure. The code is below, with relevant constants:               b = 0.1;     a = 8.7106181548*^-18;     alpha$of$r[r_] := alpha /. FindRoot[alpha - b * alpha + (b/a) * Sin[a * alpha] ==                                         r (1 - 2 * b),  {alpha, r (1 - 2 *b)}];          u[r_] := b * Sinc[a * alpha$of$r[r]];     Plot[b - u[r], {r, 10^9, 10^10}]      When we plot the function `u[r]` in the range specified, it does not seem to return a continuous curve as expected. Here's a picture of the plot: ![wacky-looking plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8ffaT.png) Could anyone offer insight as to why this happens and how I could fix it? I apologize in advance if I'm missing any information, as I'm new here. Thanks!
