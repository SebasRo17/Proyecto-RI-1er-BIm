**Question:** _what are the practical considerations for the syntax in`class` and `id` values?_ Note that I'm not asking about the _semantics_ , i.e. the actual words that are being used, as for example described in this blogpost. There are a lot of resources on that side of naming conventions already, in fact obscuring my search for practical information on the various _syntactical_ bits: casing, use of interpunction (specifically the `-` dash), specific characters to use or avoid, etc. To sum up the reasons I'm asking this question:   * The naming _restrictions_ on id and class don't naturally lead to any conventions   * The abundance of resources on the semantic side of naming conventions obscure searches on the syntactic considerations   * I couldn't find any authorative source on this   * There wasn't any question on SE Programmers yet on this topic :) * * * Some of the conventions I've considered using:   1. `UpperCamelCase`, mainly as a cross-over habit from server side coding   2. `lowerCamelCase`, for consistency with JavaScript naming conventions   3. `css-style-classes`, which is consistent with naming of css properties (but can be annoying when Ctrl+Shift+ArrowKey selection of text)   4. `with_under_scores`, which I personally haven't seen used much   5. `alllowercase`, simple to remember but can be hard to read for longer names   6. `UPPERCASEFTW`, as a great way to annoy your fellow programmers (perhaps combined with option 4 for readability) And probably I've left out some important options or combinations as well. So: what considerations are there for naming conventions, and to which convention do they lead?
