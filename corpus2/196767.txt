I hope this is not off topic. I have to save output from a command to file, but only if length of this output is positive. I've thought about two solutions:   * save output to a python variable, check length, if positive save to destination file;   * save output to a temporary file, check length, if positive rename to destination file. Is there any best practice for this little problem, or which one usually performs better between my proposed solutions? Typical configuration:   * file length is usually 1KB   * we are not using ssds, usually 7200rpm hard disk   * average RAM is usually 10-20 GB    * I don't know if filesystem is important, anyway ext3 I know this is a bit unclear, but I was hoping there was some best practice to apply in this case. Thanks
