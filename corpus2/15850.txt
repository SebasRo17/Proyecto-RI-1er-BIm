This is half tip, half question. If one tries to put a large amount of data inside the Initialization:>(code) part of a Manipulate, as one may be compelled to do in a Demonstration or where one wants to create a self- contained CDF document, I find that the Front End gets bogged down trying to format the input. One way around this that I've discovered is to embed the data inside a Raster. Thus:               embedded=Framed@Graphics[Raster[bigdata]] (*Framed is so you can see it*)      The visual output is meaningless. But ... you can then cut and paste the Framed object inside your initialization block and get the data out easily               Manipuate[f[data,n],{n,0,1},     Initialization:>(embedded=(*paste cut framed graphic here*);     data=embedded[[1,1,1]])     ]      So far as I can tell, this works. But it depends on an abuse of Raster and Graphics. Does anyone have suggestions about alternative means of putting large amounts of data inside a Manipulate?
