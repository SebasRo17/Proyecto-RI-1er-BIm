Websites that have membership systems and shopping carts usually show different information on the page depending on whether the user is signed in or not, whether there are items in the cart, etc etc. The rest of the page is often the same for all users, signed in or not. To show this user specific information you can either do it on the server side as the page is rendered, or on the client side with an AJAX call when the page loads. Doing it on the client side might have some benefits in performance of the server as server side load is reduced as the page can be served from cache, and although the user specific data still has to be generated on request it will be minimal. The disadvantage is another request to the server, of course. Looking for opinions on the pros and cons of each technique and what is commonplace on big high-volume websites. What do Stack do?
