I have a question about visualization of network in _Mathematica_ : for example: for this network               g = ExampleData[{"NetworkGraph", "Friendship"}];      when we calculate `ClosenessCentrality[g]` and visualize with               HighlightGraph[g, VertexList[g], VertexSize -> Thread[VertexList[g] -> Rescale[%]]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iqjsz.png) We can not see the vertex of James. Why? The value exists and is positive.
