Currently I'm working on a social networking project whose design is developed by the another company we are dealing with. We informed them that we need a task to be done on high priority to finish the project ASAP. We told them that what we need in the task and the party said, "What you do code or design?"? Is it their concern that I do design or code? When we have given them task, how can he ask a question that what I do? So I ask my boss what to do, and he said to tell him that "We need HTML and CSS". He the did the task. What exactly is this guy asking? I don't want to get into this kind of situation again. I want to handle these situations myself without talking to my boss. What am I missing here?
