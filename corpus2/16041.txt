When I evaluate the following expression in _Mathematica_ , it takes so much time that I don't want to wait for the evaluation to complete. So I think that there must be a better approach.               wewint[lx_?NumericQ, ly_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[         Cos[lx]*Cos[qx] + Sin[lx]*Sin[qx], {qx, -Pi, Pi}, {qy, -Pi, Pi},          Method -> Automatic];     NIntegrate[wewint[lx, ly], {lx, -Pi, Pi}, {ly, -Pi, Pi}, Method -> Automatic]      If I use `Cos[lx-qx]` instead of `(Cos[lx]*Cos[qx] + Sin[lx]*Sin[qx])`, the effect is the same. In reality, the expression I am working with is much more complicated and it couldn't be calculated analytically.
