I'm still a student, without much real life experience in programming. I've never written anything bigger than ~5k lines of code. I've written code in both Flash and Java, and I just can't understand why people are writing web applications like video players (YouTube etc.) in Flash, and not as Java applets. So I want to ask you, programmers with hands on experience, for some wise words on the subject. I see no real benefit of Flash over applets, while on the other hand, at least to me, it seems buggy as hell. I understand it is faster to make something in Flash, and I can see why it would be a good thing for fast prototyping, but in general, is it worth it? Every time a YouTube goes berserk, i curse the developers for writing it in Flash. And if you are using Linux with Opera, this happens all the time. So, basically, why are people using flash, and not applets?
