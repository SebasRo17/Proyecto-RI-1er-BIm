One limitation of a program that I maintain is that the end-users often don't know what changes have been made. To remedy this I would like to show my users a simplified list of changes made to their program. Is there a good methodology/approach to follow that would create a easy to update list that could then be fed into the user interface? For example: Should I store everything in a XML file that is read into a form? Should the change history go into a database? Note: The program is Winforms (C# 4.0). **UPDATE** Based on the excellent feedback I have decided to use SQLite as my information storage and will provide the users with a chronological list of changes in a TreeView control.
