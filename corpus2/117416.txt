There are various versions of Eclipse IDE available at Eclipse Download. Since, I am not concerned with Java development, I downloaded the Eclipse Classic 3.7.1. Now, I want my IDE to be setup for Python and PHP development. 1) Have i downloaded the correct version ?? 2) What tools should i download next. NOTE : I haven't installed anything yet, just downloaded the classic version from Eclipse website.
