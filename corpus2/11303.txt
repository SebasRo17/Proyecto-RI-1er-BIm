I'm solving many systems of two equations by varying the initial parameters. I'm running `FindRoot` in a `NestWhileList` where the `NestWhileList` counter allows me to alter parameter values and feed in current solutions as the start point for the next system. My `NestWhileList` index runs up to 5000 and when I run it I get 8 or 9 error messages, so far of two kinds. They are               line search decreased step size to within tolerance...          General::stop: "Further output of FindRoot will be suppressed during this calculation."      Now I'd like to know for which `NestWhileList` index was the error generated. This is a minimal working example similar to the code that I am running. In this example, I start with a start point `sol` and look for solutions. Then the counter increases, the new start point `sol` is the previous solution + the increment from the previous start point: `add`. The list `d` is some vector of parameter values.               d = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};     sol = {0, 0};     add = {0.5, 0.5}     counter = 5;          data = NestWhileList[{#[[1]] + 1,{x, y} = {x, y} /.FindRoot[{x + y == #[[1]]*#[[1]], x- y == d[[#[[1]]]]}, {x, #[[2]][[1]] + #[[3]]  [[1]]}, {y, \#[[2]][[2]] + #[[3]][[2]]}],{x - #[[2]][[1]], y - #[[2]][[2]]}} &,{1, sol, add},Not[2 < #[[2]][[2]] < #[[2]][[1]] < 3] &, 2, counter]      Of course, this simple example gives no errors. I'd love to be able to figure out which index is (or which all indices are) generating errors so I can go look it up individually in detail and see if the error is because a solution doesn't exist or it does exist but my output is not that solution or maybe everything is fine and I can ignore the messages. I'd love it if you can tell me how this `NestWhileList` error tracker can be extended to a `Table` setting.
