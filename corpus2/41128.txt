_**Note:** This question is not about the "obnoxious BSD advertising clause". The New BSD license does not contain that clause, and is compatible with the GPL._ I'm trying to pick between the New BSD license and the MIT license for my own projects. They are essentially identical, except the BSD license contains the following clause: >   * Neither the name of the <organization> nor the names of its contributors > may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software > without specific prior written permission. > Why would anyone want to use this clause? What's wrong with gaining some notoriety if someone makes a well-known piece of software using your code? Also, wouldn't dictating what users can and cannot do with your given name fall outside the domain of intellectual property?
