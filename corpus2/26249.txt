For my business studies, I need to explore the financial side of software engineering projects, but I am rather a technical person myself. What would be good place to start? What are the important financials (net-present-value does this make sense for software?) or performance-indicators of "good" software projects? What type of person in an organization I should contact? Thanks for any help.
