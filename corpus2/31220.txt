I would like to run MUnit tests from the command line. On Mac OS, I can do this:               AppendTo[$Path, "/Applications/Wolfram Workbench.app/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/bundles/13/1/.cp/MathematicaSourceVersioned/Head"];          << MUnit`      and then use the MUnit functions such as TestRun to run the tests. However, on Linux, the MUnit package is stored within a jar file (com.wolfram.eclipse.testing_2.0.126.jar), rather than being "bare" in the filesystem. Workbench must be able to load the package; is it possible to load MUnit from the jar file? One solution would be to extract MUnit into a temporary directory each time you wanted to load it, but this is quite ugly.
