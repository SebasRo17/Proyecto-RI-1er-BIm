I think that most people would agree that ASP.NET MVC is one of the better technologies Microsoft has given us. It gives full control over the rendered HTML, provides separation of concerns and suites to stateless nature of web. The last version of the framework gaves us new features and tools and it's great, but... what solutions should Microsoft include in new versions of framework? What are biggest gaps in comparison with another web frameworks like PHP or Ruby? What could improve developers productivity? What's missing in ASP.NET MVC? Why is this missing feature important? How do you do without it now?
