When I type the following code:               mus[] = 0;      mus[x__] := First[List[x]] + mus[Rest[List[x]]]      What one would think would happen is that if, `mus[1,2,3,4]` is input, the number 10 would be output. However, I get the error message, > $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded However if I use the following code:               lsum[{}] := 0;      lsum[L_] := First[L] + lsum[Rest[L]];      sum[x__] := lsum[List[x]]      It works as I thought it should, namely if input lsum[x1,x2,x3,...,xn], the output is the sum of the xi's.
