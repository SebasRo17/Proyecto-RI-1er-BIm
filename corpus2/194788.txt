I recently learned that when merging two branches in git, if there are changes on two _adjacent_ lines git declares this a conflict. For example, if file `test.txt` has this content:               Line 1: A     Line 2: B     Line 3: C     Line 4: D      and in branch `master` we change this to               Line 1: A     Line 2: B1     Line 3: C     Line 4: D      while in branch `testing` we change this to               Line 1: A     Line 2: B     Line 3: C1     Line 4: D      and then attempt to merge `testing` into `master`, git declares a merge conflict. My naive expectation was that the merge would happen without conflict and yield this:               Line 1: A     Line 2: B1     Line 3: C1     Line 4: D      I am sure there is a good reason why git doesn't merge this way. Can someone explain this reason?
