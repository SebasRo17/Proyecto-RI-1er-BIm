I'm having a play around with emulating a simple old CPU. I've set the structure up, so far anyway, as follows: The device is the main and creates an instance of the CPU. The CPU then creates instances of the registers, clocks and MMU. I'm in the position where the MMU needs to access the contents of the registers, how to do this? I figure I could probably bodge something together by passing the entire register object to the MMU when it's called but that seems unwieldy. The other thing I thought to do would be to initialise the MMU with the register object in the constructor. If I'm not mistaken that will still reference the same object? Meaning any changes I do to the registers in the MMU will affect the whole system?
