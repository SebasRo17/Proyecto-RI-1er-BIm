I have a series of symbolic manipulations (along with some coefficients). As a sample, here is one of the intermediate forms               -1.00 (-0.707 (1.00+0.500 ax^2+0.375 ax^4+0.313 ax^6+0.273 ax^8) ay-0.0884 (1.00+0.500 ax^2+0.375 ax^4+0.313 ax^6+0.273 ax^8)^3 ay^3-0.0387 (1.00+0.500 ax^2+0.375 ax^4+0.313 ax^6+0.273 ax^8)^5 ay^5-0.0228 (1.00+0.500 ax^2+0.375 ax^4+0.313 ax^6+0.273 ax^8)^7 ay^7) Sign[(1.00+0.500 ax^2+0.375 ax^4+0.313 ax^6+0.273 ax^8) ay      As part of the calculations, Mathematica generates large expressions that can be further simplified by dropping higher order terms (such as powers > 10). Is there someway to force Mathematic to drop high order terms in the evaluation? Thoughts much appreciated.
