The Mandelbrot set is defined by complex numbers such as $z=z^2+c$ where $z_0=0$ for the initial point and $c\in\mathbb C$. The numbers grow very fast in the iteration.               z = 0; n = 0; l = {0};     While[n < 9, c = 1 + I; l = Join[l, {z}]; z = z^2 + c; n++];l      If `n` is very large, the numbers become too large and impossible to calculate in practical time limits. I don't know what it would look after long time but doubting whether it would look like here. **What is wrong with this implementation? Why does it take so long time to calculate?**
