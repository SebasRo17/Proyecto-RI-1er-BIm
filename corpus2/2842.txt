What would be a good replacement for `$InputFileName` (which has been added recently to Mathematica 8) to achieve backwards compatibility with let's say M6 and M7? I am using it for loading auxiliary data from a package file and found that it is a convenient way to use relative paths for this purpose. However, I am not sure how to achieve this in M6 and M7. For example,               $PackageDir=DirectoryName[$InputFileName];     svgParser=XML`Parser`InitializeXMLParser["svg",          FileNameJoin[{$PackageDir,"Cache/svg10.dtd"}]]
