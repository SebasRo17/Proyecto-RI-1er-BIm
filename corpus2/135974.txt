My boss has tasked me with a re-write of our intranet website. The existing system is very old PHP that doesn't use a framework. My preference is strongly to do the rewrite in Python and Django but my boss does not like Python syntax (he is also a developer). I'm on the opposite end... I don't like developing in PHP and my PHP experience is extremely limited but I've done a lot of work in Python. My boss is aware of my experience but still wants me to sell him on Python. Some of the things he mentioned he does not like about Python:   * indentation is the only marking for the begin/end of a code block (he loves his curly braces)   * documentation issues (I told him python documentation is great)   * IDE support is limited (mentioned PyCharm and Wing IDE, not sure which is better)   * he's had compatibility issues moving between older versions of python He may be the only other pair of eyes on the new code. How can I convince him that Python is a better choice? Is Ruby a potential middle ground?
