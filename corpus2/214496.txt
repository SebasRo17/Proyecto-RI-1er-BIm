I have this complex windows application that I need to create an automated testing system for. I need to use VB.NET, and it needs to be able to click all kinds of things, be conscious of the windows that open in the application, the dialog boxes, and do the things that a human would do in this application. Through my research, I discovered FindWindowEx will be useful for me. I would appreciate any feedback as to what direction I should go on creating this automated testing system. (are there any function, libraries, or other built in stuff that can help me? If so, what are they) Thanks, Phil
