I, like many others, have been completely enamored with the recent successful landing of Mar's Curiosity rover. After reading a couple of articles, and following a few links, I've found a couple C based coding standards that NASA JPL uses to formalize their code and protect it from error. (See here and here.) This has me curious. Are there any open-source operating systems available that adhere to these coding standards that are available for common architecture, such as x86, x64 or possibly ARM?
