I was in the software industry for 3 years before going back and pursuing my masters. I have a year of grad school under my belt with a year left and a 4.0 GPA. I'm really itching to get back into do software dev full-time. I'm doing research and an area I'm interested in, Computer Graphics, but know that I probably won't work in industry using what I've learned. I think the main benefit to finishing my degree is to pad my resume and learn certain things that I wouldn't have learned other wise. Would it be dumb for me to quit grad school and get back into the work force? Is grad school a bad decision for passionate programmers( I consider myself one )?
