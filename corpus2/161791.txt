Long story short, I've spent the last two years in an entirely new career, transitioning from academia to a data analyst role (working towards a data scientist). Before starting at my current company, I knew next to nothing about coding, save for teaching myself SQL for a few hours per week over a couple of months. Besides SQL, I have since become conversant in Perl, have used PHP a bit here and there, and have made some headway into learning other languages (primarily Java and C). So, I still have a lot of catch-up work to do. In order to teach myself things, I've built a few side projects--a lot more sophisticated than `"Hello World, my name is $name."`, but not as complicated as, say, Minecraft or a device driver. I'd like to release the code for them in order to learn from constructive feedback and to build a portfolio to sit alongside my resume. However, a lot of these things are works in progress and, to be honest, I feel some trepidation at putting code out there for all to see that's not completely, 100% "done" and polished. Am I worrying over nothing? If not, is there some minimal polish threshold a project should have before releasing it as open source?
