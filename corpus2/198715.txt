I have a simple MVC project. My current packages:   * gui    * controller    * db    * domain I want to put extra classes which I will use, e.g. md5 hashing, email validator (methods which I will use in more than one class). Where do I put them? I will probably not use them in only one package, but in two or three (not in model for sure). Do I create an extra package, or do I put them in domain as they're "static" (unchangable)?
