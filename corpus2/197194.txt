Is there a guide out there on how to choose when to pay for web hosting vs. hosting your own? Assuming that root access is a must I would like to compare things like cost, scalability and personal stress. Here is what I could come up with. Paying for web hosting: Benefits:   * Much cheaper for a small scale. I assume anything under $50 a month would be cheaper than paying for the bandwidth of hosting.   * No stress in dealing with power outages, server restarts or internet going down.   * For the most part less busy work involved with setting up. Negatives:   * Cost goes way up when higher specs are needed (for example monthly cost triples with ability to use 8gb of ram that you can buy for $90 ). This means you have to target a particular ram usage and monitor so your instance stays within the threshold.   * root access for the most part is a premium.   * You may get tied into a vendor specific deployment process. Hosting on own : Positives:   * 100% control of specs and software.   * When you get past paying for the bandwidth you get much more bang for your buck by building your own machine. Negatives:   * Doesn't make financial sense if bandwidth costs are more than web hosting costs.   * Having to deal with power outages, server restarts or internet going down. I think the best of both worlds would be if there was a place that dealt with bandwidth, power outages and server restarts but you provided your own server. Kind of like a 24 hour day care for a server. Does anything like that exist?
