Suppose I have the following `ContourPlot3D`:               ContourPlot3D[     p1 p2^6 (C p1 - (-1 + C) p2)^3 ((-1 + C) p1 - C p2)^2      ==      (-1 + p1) (-1 + p2)^6 (-1 + C p1 - (-1 + C) p2)^3 (1 + (-1 + C) p1 - C p2)^2,     {p1, 0, 0.3}, {p2, 0.5, 1}, {C, 0, 1},       Lighting -> ({"Directional", White, #} & /@ Tuples[{-1, 1}, 3]),       Mesh -> None, ContourStyle -> {Directive[Red, Opacity[0.5]]},       AxesLabel -> {"\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(p\), \(1\)]\)",       "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(p\), \(2\)]\)", "C"}]      which looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zOokL.png) My question is: how to project this transparent red surface onto the $p_1,p_2$ plane and then convert the projection to a standard 2d plot (like what we will get by using `Plot[]`) **Additional requirement** : It would be nice if the resulting 2D plot is clean, because I may need to plot other curves on top of the 2D plot.
