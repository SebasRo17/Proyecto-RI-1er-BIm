The Apache License states: "You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License;" So if you've copied a bunch of functions from some Apache-licensed code (so it's not just linking, you've borrowed code) into a product _that is not itself Apache-licensed_ , what's a good way to indicate that the license you included only applies to some bits of code in your product, not to the product as a whole? (To avoid the suggestion that the product as a whole is freely copyable.) Should a list of projects you've borrowed from and their various licenses be included in the "About" screen for the product, _insisting_ that the licenses only apply to those bits? I'm asking because that seems to make sense, but I don't recall seeing that anywhere.
