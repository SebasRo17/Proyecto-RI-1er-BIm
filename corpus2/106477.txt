## TL;DR: What header/footer do you put on your Functional&Technical specifications to avoid people having different versions at meetings? ## Story: We're have a lot of documents, being changed by everyone. Functional specifications, technical specifications, addendums, etcetera. Problem is offcourse that during a meeting, after an hour someone notices their printed version differs from someone else's. I thought this could be solved by forcing everyone to use the same header/footer on each document: ### Header   * Project concerned   * Document title (center aligned)   * Document author (right aligned) ### Footer   * Last modification date   * Date on which document was printed   * Full document path and name (which always include the version number)   * Page X of Y This way, we could all easily check the filename and last modification date before starting the meeting, and make sure everyone has the same copy and is talking about the same document. Would this work? Am I missing something? What do you guys use for your specifications to avoid versioning problems?
