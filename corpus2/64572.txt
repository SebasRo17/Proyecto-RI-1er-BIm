i was working on a website with FF4 and while resizing an element with Firebug, FF4 just crashed my nVidia Display Driver. Fortunately Windows 7 was able to help me by recovering from this serious error and i was able to completely recover my work again. So my question is, should those browser developers get into low level hardware intricacies, something that was reserved only for game developers and complex graphic software?
