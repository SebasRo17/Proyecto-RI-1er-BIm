I am working on finding the plane tangent to a paraboloid at a given point. ![author's solution:](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XAHoy.png) My code:               z[x_, y_] := 10 - x^2 - 2 y^2;     Subscript[z, x][x_, y_] := D[z, x];     Subscript[z, y][x_, y_] := D[z, y];     z[1, 2] + Subscript[z, x][1, 2] (x - 1) +      Subscript[z, x][1, 2] (y - 2)(*The plane tangent equation*)      However, it doesn't work. My question is: where did I go wrong?
