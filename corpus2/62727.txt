Are there types of killer applications, classes of algorithmic problems, etc., where it is better, in the long run, to create my own language? PS: Just to be sure, I mean a new programming language and a compiler, not a new compiler for an existing language. **EDIT** : Thank you for the answers. Can you provide some examples, where it is absolutly unnecessary to create a DSL or cases in which a DSL might be a good idea?
