If I built some useful piece of python code to e.g. scrape a website or to calculate something big, at some point I might want to add a GUI to my project. For this I could use Tk, Qt, Pygame or any python graphic/GUI framework. Now I also want this tool to be usable by clients without the need for a python installation. Of course I could use something like py2Exe or py2Dmg. But wouldn't it be cooler to use a python-based web framework for this? Something like Django or Pyramid. What would be the drawbacks of doing this? Can I just use the framework to execute my code on a server and only return the result? Or will this get tricky when there are multiple users?
