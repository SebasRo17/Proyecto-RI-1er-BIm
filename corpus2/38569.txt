Our programming environment is dependent upon certain environment variables being set. For example, to use distcc, one needs to define the `DISTCC_HOSTS` environment variable. The way we handle this is forcing each developer to `source` a global `tcshrc` file upon invoking a new shell. The global `tcshrc` file contains statements to set the environment variables up (among other things). However, this is awfully discriminatory as each developer is forced to use `tcsh` since setting an environment variable is different per shell. The most obvious solution to this problem to have corresponding global `bashrc` and `zshrc` files, but that of course becomes cumbersome since now we have to maintain three different files all containing the same logic. Are there any clean solutions to solve this sort of situation?
