I'm a big fan of checklists. There is Travel Checklist, Moving Checklist and even a Scrum Checklist. **Context** : you have been hired by a large corporation and given the mission to setup the whole software development environment, processes, team, etc. You have "carte blanche". You will be responsible for the creation of the working increments of the software. Project size: 2000 man/days. What items would you add to the following (intentionally small and incomplete) checklist:   * Install a Continuous Integration Server   * Write a DoD   * Write a one page coding guidelines   * Create a product backlog   * Install a Bug Tracking System   * Schedule Regular Face Time
