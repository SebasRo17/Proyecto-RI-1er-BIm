Like a data stream in general, this can be an I/O stream or memory stream or a file stream or what not. I understand that it's some sort of stream of bytes, that you can read to parse very large amounts of data if needed, what I don't understand however, is how it works. Is it possible to 'miss' data from a stream if you start reading it too late? or does it wait for you? A lot of tutorials I find online just tell how to use a stream, but it doesn't actually get out of the way to explain how it works, one tutorial explained it like a river, but that just confuses me more; the water running in the river doesn't wait, which again brings me back to; what if I read it too late? Can someone explain this concept to me?
