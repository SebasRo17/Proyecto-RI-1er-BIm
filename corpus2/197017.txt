Why a single page application is a desktop client replacement why should I show certain url`s in the url bar of the browser. Why is mysite.com not enough. My question to you guys is now: What are the reasons and advantages for the user to show such an url like mysite.com/customers/3 Are there any reasons like the user wants to be able and bookmark a site and this would need an URI ?
