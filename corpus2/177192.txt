I have been searching for a tool to help my team organize its knowledge for resolving recurring support cases. Context: our team is developing and supporting an huge applications (lots of different screens and workflow processes. We already have a good tool for managing our documentation, but we are struggling with support cases.   Support action involve often quite a lot of manual steps to fix stuff and the knowledge for these actions is more 'oral transmission' than modern tools. We need an efficient way to store them in a knowledge base to be able to retrieve similar cases based on patterns (a stacktrace, an error message, a component name, a workflow step, ...) and ranked by similarity. Our wiki search is not very powerful when it come to this kind of search and the team members don't want to 'waste' time writing a report that will never be found... Do you know efficient knowledge base tool for this kind of use case ?
