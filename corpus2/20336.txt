I'm trying to plot something like this:               RegionPlot[0 < (.5*a2 - .25*a1)/(a2 - a1) < 1 && 0 < a1 < a2 < 1, {a1, 0, 1}, {a2, 0, 1}]      The above code yields an error message (it tries to use 1/0 in the inequality). I can solve the problem by simply starting the plot at an arbitrarily low value of `a2`. My question is: is there a more "elegant" way of doing that? I would expect the inequality `0 < a1 < a2 < 1` to take care of that.
