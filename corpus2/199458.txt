Halfway through the RabbitMQ tutorial, I noticed that the tutorial stops referring to producers "sending" messages and starts using the verb "emit" instead â€” and pretty consistently, too; after the second tutorial, the verb "send" is no longer used to describe a producer transmitting messages. Example: Second Tutorial > The main idea behind Work Queues ... encapsulate a task as a message and > **send** it to the queue. A worker process running in the background .... Fourth Tutorial > We'll use this model for our logging system. ... Let's focus on **emitting** > logs first. What is the difference between sending a message vs. emitting one?
