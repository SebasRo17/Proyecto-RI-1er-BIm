I've been trying to print information on the axes of a graphic. I'm doing that by the option `FrameLabel` in the `ErrorListPlot` function. But it failed. Here the code I'm using               Needs["ErrorBarPlots`"];          d    = Import["teste.txt", "TSV"];     dNew = Table[{{d[[i, 1]], d[[i, 2]]}, ErrorBar[d[[i, 3]]]}, {i, 2, Length[d]}];          ErrorListPlot[dNew, FrameLabel -> {"Position, x (inches)", "Photodetector output (V)"}]      The result ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vHfJH.jpg) How can I fix it? Thanks for the attention. Hellon
