I am using Mathematica for differential geometry studies using Frenet Formulae. The problem is that I need to graph the solution curve r[t]. Suppose the curvature of a curve is k(s) = |s|and the torsion of a curve t(s)(s) = .3. Starting with the initial conditions with T,N, B being i, j, k,I have to graph the solution curve r(t) that has this data. Can anyone suggest me how to go ahead with this? T'(s) = k(s) N(s), N'(s) = - k(s) T(s) + t(s) B(s), B'(s) = - t(s)N(s). Here T, N, B are the unit tangent and unit normal and B is the unit binormal B = T * N
