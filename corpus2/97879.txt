I am starting a new job in a company with many developers and media people, the layout of the place is open with computers around a skinny oval, I have worked in small teams and programming embedded C, the jobis for objective C I'm still in a medium stage, so I know what I don't know (haha), that means I have to google it and then implement it, So the question is how bad does it look if the guy next to you does lot of searching for coding I mean, at the end of the day I will get the job done, but want to look professional too!
