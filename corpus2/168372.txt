In tutorials and books, I have never seen a single word describing the object that the injected object is injected into. Instead, other terms are used, like "injection point" which don't denote the object containing the injected object. And nothing I can think of sounds right, except maybe "injection target" - but I have never read it anywhere. Is there a single word or a simple expression for it, or is it like the "He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" from a recent fantasy book series?
