I have found one of the most annoying issues in ParametricNDSolve. When a parameters occurs inside UnitStep (and Piecewise and If) the integration takes much longer time. I illustrate this by an easy example First, create two identical systems with an infusion running for 100 time units. In the first system we set the value of the infusion time and in the second system this parameter value will be set later on to the same value.               sys1 = {x'[t] == RATE*UnitStep[100 - t], x[0] == 0};     sys2 = {x'[t] == RATE*UnitStep[tInf - t], x[0] == 0};     vars = {x};      Create two ParametricNDSolve objects:               p1 = First@     ParametricNDSolve[sys1, vars, {t, 0, 200}, {RATE},      Method -> {"ParametricSensitivity" -> None,        "ParametricCaching" -> None}];     p2 = First@     ParametricNDSolve[sys2, vars, {t, 0, 200}, {RATE, tInf},      Method -> {"ParametricSensitivity" -> None,        "ParametricCaching" -> None}];      Now we crete a large set of of random parameter values for the parameter RATE.               runs = 10000;     rvs = RandomReal[{0, 1}, runs];      Solve the first system (with only one parameter) a large number of times and take the time.               AbsoluteTiming[Do[x[rvs[[i]]] /. p1, {i, runs}]]          {1.546088, Null}      Solve the second system, with parameters RATE and tInf where tInf=100, a large number of times and take the time.               AbsoluteTiming[Do[x[rvs[[i]], 100] /. p2, {i, runs}]]          {9.052518, Null}       The second systems take approximately 6x longer to solve. What is going on here? There might be a large issue here with the ParametricNDSolve environment.
