_I'm not sure if this is a math or Mathematica question, but I'm posting it here because I'm interested in possible Mathematica tools/functions to solve the problem._ I'm stuck. I want to simulate the effect of a EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse) disturbance on an FM signal. Here's my code:               f1[t_] := Sin[t]; (* baseband signal *)     f2[t_] := Sin[15 t]; (* carrier *)     f3[t_] := Sin[15 t + 8 f1[t]] ; (* antenna signal *)     f4[t_] := UnitTriangle[2 (t - 4)]; (* lightning EMP *)     f5[t_] := f3[t] + f4[t]; (* received signal *)     Plot[{f5[t], f1[t]}, {t, 0, 20}]      which results in this plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C19kk.png) So far so good, but here I am stuck. I want to demodulate the received signal to see the effect of the EMP on my baseband signal, and I don't know how to do this. The signal is there, I can _see_ it (and hear it when I listen to the radio). I prefer a continuous-time solution, because that's what my radio also works in, but if necessary a discrete-time solution is also welcome.
