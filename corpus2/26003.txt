Currently, I am a Ruby/Rails developers. Before I was .NET developer and got MCTS in Windows Client Development. But of the time I don't touch any HTML or CSS and I don't have any experience in doing layout at all. And I feel boring doing those tasks, but for sure every web apps has to have them. To be a professional do I need to learn them again?
