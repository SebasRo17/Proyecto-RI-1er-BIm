Here's the code.               Clear[x,y,z];     {x,y,z} /. x_ :> ("^_^" <> ToString[x])      I get the result `^_^{x, y, z}`, which is not what I intended. However, I want to have `{^_^x, ^_^y, ^_^z}`. I found the problem occurred was related to the appearance of `<>` or `ToString`. The problem seems so basic, but I've been debugging for a long while, still having not got the right answer.
