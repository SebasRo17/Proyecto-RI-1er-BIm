I am fairly new to Mathematica and don't have much experience with other programming languages, but I can already see that Mathematica and the Wolfram language are far easier to use than most others. With this in mind, I was wondering about the possibility of building apps for iPhone and iPod through Mathematica. Basically is it at all possible to use Mathematica to build apps? Even if it isn't possible to use Mathematica for iOS app development, what about using it to build programs for other platforms, like Windows, Macs, or browser programs? I've heard a bit about MathLink and Workbench but I don't really understand what they do or how to use them. Also i understand that the Wolfram Cloud will be launched soon but don't know what it will enable us to do. I would appreciate it if someone could give me a brief answer, or point me in the right direction.
