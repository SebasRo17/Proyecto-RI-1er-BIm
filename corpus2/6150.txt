I tried to fit some data with boundary conditions, but `FindFit` just could not work. Does anyone know the reason? **Details** : The function to be fitted is `A*Tanh[x+a]+B`. Data is provided from `x=0` to some positive number. I set the requirement that the fitted function should be same as `Tanh[x]` at `x=0` both for its value and its first derivative. I realized such a condition in `FindFit` through a direct setting; however, it does not seems to work, i.e. the function is NOT exactly connected to the expected one. There is still about 10^-7 to 10^-10 difference between the two. Following is my code and result                tL = Transpose[{Range[0, 5, .5], Tanh[#] & /@ Range[0, 5, .5] + RandomReal[.2, 11]}];     f = Tanh[x]; fD = D[tf, {x, 1}];     fitf = A*Tanh[x + a] + B; fitfD = D[fitf, {x, 1}];     fitf0 = fitf /. x -> 0; fitfD0 = fitfD /. x -> 0;     fit = FindFit[tL, {fitf, {fitf0 == 0, fitfD0 == 1}}, {{a, 0}, {A, 1}, {B, 0}}, x];     fitf=fitf/.fit;     F = Piecewise[{{f, x < 0}, {fitf, x >= 0}}]     FD = D[F, {x, 1}]     Show[Plot[F, {x, -6, 6}, PlotStyle -> Red, AxesLabel -> {x, "f(x)"}],ListPlot[tL], PlotRange -> All]     Limit[F, x -> 0, Direction -> -1]     Plot[FD, {x, -1, 1}, AxesLabel -> {x, "f'(x)"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1VeLZ.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WB6jD.png)
