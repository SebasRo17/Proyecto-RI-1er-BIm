I have a for loop running over a list of objects like:               [{a: 2001, b: "hello"}, {a: 54, b: "hi"}....]      In this loop, I filter out objects based on certain field values (like, b == hello?) and create a new list of filtered objects. Once the for loop is complete, I sort the remaining objects by the value of a. This is an oversimplified example, so presorting by field a isn't possible. My question is, is it faster to do the sort after the loop is complete vs doing something like a binary search at the end of each iteration and then insert the object then? That would avoid sorting at the end, but I don't really know if that ends up costing more.
