As the title says, I am a recent graduate with a mathematics degree, looking to develop software as a career. The job hunting has not resulted in a job yet but over the past couple of months I have picked up quite a bit of Ruby/Rails and Objective-C, as well as learning git and deployed a simple web-app to Heroku. I want to continue to build my resume and feel making a simple app and contributing to open source projects would look really good. Which leads me to my idea: My girlfriend is a botanist with the California Native Plant Society, and they just put together this really cool rare plant database. So I'd like make a simple iPhone app which would allow the user to query that database. Eventually it would be neat to do other stuff, but just getting a prototype together that would allow lookup via scientific names of different plant species is my first goal. I'm looking for any advice or resources as I'm not even sure what to google. I'm not sure if my app is physically filling in the text fields or if there is some other way to query an Internet database which I am unfamiliar. CNPS is a pretty great not-for-profit and it would be neat to give back to them in some way. I plan to host this on github as well if anyone else is interested. Thanks
