I have a background in computers and have programmed for about 7 years. I switched careers, and became a Technical Writer, and now think I should jump ship again, back to being a programmer. Of course the natural course of action, in which I can spend, say two whole years, learning to code, might not be available any more. I am keen on ASP.NET as its the language that most products at my company are written in. I am sure this has been asked before, but here I go: where do I begin? I would really appreciate some practical advise.
