When I try just a few items such as               WolframAlpha["1 whole wheat tortilla + 2 slices american cheese + 150 g steak + 2 tbsp beans + 150 g white rice"]      I get the following nutrition facts table: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/37ait.gif) However, when I enter a longer query such as               WolframAlpha["1 whole wheat tortilla + 2 slices american cheese + 150 g steak + 2 tbsp beans + 150 g white rice + 100g bell peppers + 200 g chicken breast + 2 slices of whole wheat bread"]      I don't actually get a nutrition facts chart as before. Is there a way to force a nutrition facts output every time? Also, is there a way to limit the output pods to only a nutrition facts table, as I don't need any of the other pods?
