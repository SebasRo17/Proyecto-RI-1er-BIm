I have a function g(x,y) and would like to plot it as g(x) with a slider to vary y. What I currently have is a g(x,y) plotted as g(x) but with y as a parameter which I can adjust:               Manipulate[Plot[g[x,y],{x,0,10}],{y,0,10}]      That works fine, but now I'd like to be able to vary the upper value of the x-axis so that we can adjust how much of the graph we see (or how much of the x-axis we see). This is what I've tried (but didn't work):               Manipulate[Plot[g[x,y],{x,0,Manipulate[x,{x,0.1,10}]}],{y,0,10}]
