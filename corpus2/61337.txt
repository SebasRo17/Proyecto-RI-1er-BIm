I've gotten pretty far in some interviews for a company which seems to use several technologies I've frankly never heard of. The big one which I'd be working with if I got the job is TCL. What is TCL, and more importantly, how marketable is it as a skill? Would working in a job using for TCL for a few years be like getting a case of the MUMPS?
