We already have a fully operational web service which caters requests from multiple paltform devices. Each device sends only one request at a time and immediately after a response for the request the device sends an applicative ACK, this ack message is like a regular request message, and it's all via http. During a performance/load test we discovered that the following situation happens alot: regular requests gets processed ok but when the ack message is sent, it is thrown because the server can't handle too many requests. We accept the case that the server throws requests because of overload, but we do not accept throwing ack messages. So essentially we want the server to process 2 requests at a time for each device, is there anyway to do it in the current situation? if not, what kind of changes do we need to do?
