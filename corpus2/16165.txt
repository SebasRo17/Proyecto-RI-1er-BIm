I want to use this to add a keyboard shortcut to an undo function I wrote. The basic problem is the following: I have a command, let's say `x=1`, and I want to run the command with a keyboard shortcut. Is there a way to do it? Editing the KeyEventTranslation.tr file is what I tried. Adding               Item[KeyEvent["z",Modifiers->{Command}],Evaluate[x=1]],      does not work.               Item[      KeyEvent["z", Modifiers -> {Command}],        FrontEndExecute[{FrontEnd`NotebookWrite[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],"x=1"]}]]      adds the text x=1 where the cursor is, but it still needs to be evaluated and I need to be at the right place with the cursor. Are there other ways? This might be related, but I couldn't get anything out of it so far.
