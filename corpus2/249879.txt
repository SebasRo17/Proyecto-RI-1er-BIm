I have recently been told that using `size_t` as declared in the global namespace is incorrect in C++, ostensibly because `size_t` is a C-feature. I looked this up and came across this question on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5813700/difference-between-size-t-and- stdsize-t The top answer makes it pretty clear that there isn't any _real_ difference between `size_t` and `std::size_t`, but that leaves open the question of style and correctness. Since I'm programming in C++, is it "wrong" to use a C feature such as `size_t` in place of the slightly longer but no better C++-specific `std::size_t`?
