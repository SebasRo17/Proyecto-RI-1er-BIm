For any standard web project you will have server-side code, server pages, JavaScript and CSS files as your code assets. It's pretty standard practice for server-side code to have a test suite and a scripted build process to compile/package/deploy code. Builds usually go on a schedule after code has been tested and validated in a QA environment. On the flip side, we frequently have a requirements to be able to push presentation layer code assets at will. Since they don't require compilation or restarts, this is feasible, but I'm of the mind that this code is coupled to the server-side code and is equally likely to destroy the whole site if it's broken. Therefore, it should never be pushed outside of a build cycle. What is considered best practice for this?
