By default Mathematica places the x-axis labels at the end of the axes like![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bUklD.jpg) Googling has suggested a way around this is to use `Frame`\- for example `Frame -> {True, True, False, False}, FrameLabel -> {"E/T", None}` which produces something like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nB2lv.jpg) Which is not too bad, but I do not want this vertical dividing line `x=0` and really would have preffered to keep the `y-axis` in the middle of the plot where this divider line now is. Can this be done? Is there a better way than this to move axes labels below?
