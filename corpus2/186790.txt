I recently started at a company and am working on statistical data analysis and data handling (market research). A lot of my tasks were previously done entirely by hand, so I created a few tools to automate much of my work. My boss asked if I could go ahead and look for other automation-possibilities. I certainly have the time and skill, but I don't know how to find processes which would be good candidates to be automated. I could ask co-workers, but most of them don't understand what is easy to automate and what isn't. I believe that there are processes for this sort of thing - but I don't know enough to start Googling. **What comes before requirements discovery and analysis?** **How do I identify business processes that will be more efficient as automated tasks?**
