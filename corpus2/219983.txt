I am working on a website with PHP as backend. There are things from the front-end which I'd like to accomplish using AJAX calls. Which of these methods should I use to design them and why?   * Call to different PHP files for different uses ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3EURr.jpg)   * Call to the same PHP file, with instructions on what to do ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KUIKq.jpg)   * A RESTful API   * Any other better way?
