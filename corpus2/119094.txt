> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  When is optimization not premature and therefore not evil? Whilst designing my own .Net SQL access library, I found that I want everything thing to run as fast as possible so I tend to look at the fastest ways of doing things. This often gets criticised as pre-mature optimisation when I am just looking for the fastest way of doing something. My question is there a cross-over between designing for performance and pre- mature optimisation?
