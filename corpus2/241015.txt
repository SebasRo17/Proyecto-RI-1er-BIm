I'm developing a desktop application with a GUI. To do so, I'm using the MVC design pattern for the GUI part. For now the application consists of a single window (view) with one controller interacting with the backend (model). The interaction is becoming more complex day by day with the controller getting more and more methods to handle inputs and adding more dependencies with model objects. Since it's a best practice to keep the classes and methods small I feel like delegating some tasks, is it right? Is there any clean way to do so? Regarding the dependencies with the model, I'm using a facade object, but again I feel like it's getting too overloaded.
