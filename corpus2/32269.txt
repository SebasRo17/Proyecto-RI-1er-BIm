Say I have a set of lists that look like this:               list = {{{151.335`, 245.102`}, {1, 1}}, {{41.435`, 245.021`}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}},             {{131.048`, 243.364`}, {3, 3}, {56, 56}, {76, 23}}, {{164.911`, 244.039`},               {4, 4}}, {{98.1685`, 239.618`}, {5, 5}}, {{196.333`, 239.212`}, {6, 6}},              {{184.767`, 234.228`}, {7, 7}}, {{213.044`, 234.24`}, {8, 8}},              {{26.6316`, 221.423`}, {9, 9}}};          appendList = {{{3, 3}, {"Yellow", "Red"}, {"Blue", "Majesty"}},                   {{76, 23}, {"White", "Avalanche"}}}      How can I use the first element in each sublist of `appendList` as an anchor to append the next set of elements in place in `list` generating something like the following?:               finalList = {{{151.335`, 245.102`}, {1, 1}}, {{41.435`, 245.021`}, {2, 2}, {3, 3},                   {"Yellow","Red"},{"Blue","Majesty"}}, {{131.048`, 243.364`}, {3, 3},                   {56, 56}, {76, 23},{"White","Avalanche"}}, {{164.911`, 244.039`},                    {4, 4}}, {{98.1685`, 239.618`}, {5, 5}}, {{196.333`, 239.212`},{6,6}},                  {{184.767`, 234.228`}, {7, 7}}, {{213.044`, 234.24`}, {8, 8}},                   {{26.6316`, 221.423`}, {9, 9}}};      After-the-fact question: This is a brief followup which doesn't quite deserve it's own question - how can we only look at the last element in each sublist of `list` to check to see if it matches the "anchor" value at the first position in `appendList`? In other words, where `{{{2, 2}, {"Yellow", "Red"}, {"Blue", "Majesty"}}, {{56, 56}, {"White", "Avalanche"}}}` yields a `finalList = list` since {2,2} and {56,56} are not at the ends of the sublists in `list`?
