I have been told that when there are multiple buttons on the page for same purpose but targeting different item e.g. delete item on a grid of items, they say it is recommended to just register for click handler only on the top most element like 'body' and check what was clicked instead of hooking up click with every delete button. Whats the benefit of this? Creating more handlers causes problems? Is it an optimization of some sort? Is it a pattern? Does it have anything to do with performance? Where can I read more about it?
