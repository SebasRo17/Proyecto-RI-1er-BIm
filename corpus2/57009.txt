I've had some freelance jobs in my country (Brazil), working for different companies. I like to work to Brazillian companies, but I'm looking for some international experiences and I would like some advice. How do you hire foreign developers/professionals? How can I proceed to become more "visible" to the international employers? I don't want to leave Brazil for now, so I wonder if its possible to get good freelance jobs outside here. If you have worked like I'm willing to work, I'll be glad if you share your experiences ;)
