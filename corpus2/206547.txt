There is a department at my company called Business Intelligence (BI). They mostly build reports and configure SSRS, SSIS and related Microsoft technologies. Most of them barely understand SQL (even though they work with databases all day long) and fewer know anything about writing software. At other companies, BI had very little to do with IT. I am curious if my current company is simply mislabeling/misunderstanding what these folks do. Or is this what BI is really all about? If they aren't true BI, does anyone know what the proper name for their position is? It will be helpful when trying to hire new people so we don't end up wasting their time.
