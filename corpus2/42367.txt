I have the following CDF:                F[x_] = Piecewise[{          {0, x < 0},          {0.1 x^2, 0 <= x <= 2},          {0.4, 2 < x <= 5/2},          {0.5, 5/2 < x <= 4},          {-0.5 E^-(x - 4)^2 + 1, 4 < x}         }];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7BPii.png) Now I define the a probability distribution as follows:                dist = ProbabilityDistribution[{"CDF", F[x]}, {x, 0, Infinity}];      G[x_] = CDF[dist, x];      But the plot of G now looks different: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wdas4.png) It seems I lose the discontinuity point and on top of that the CDF G doesn't even go up to 1 anymore. * * * Question: Why do I lose the discontinuity of my CDF, and is there a way to avoid this issue?
