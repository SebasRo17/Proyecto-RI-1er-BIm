When I try to run Mathematica processes in parallel on a Linux based server, I see that my server allows 7 MathKernels and 28 sub MathKernels. I was wondering what the difference is and how I can take advantage of the 28 sub MathKernels. I generally run my job like:               for i in $var       do       "path"/math -noprompt -script "scriptname" "parameters" &       done      This results in using different MathKernels. Therefore I am able to do this iteration at most 7 times. I was wondering if I could take use of the sub MathKernel licenses, I can somehow tweak this to run 28 times. Is that possible?
