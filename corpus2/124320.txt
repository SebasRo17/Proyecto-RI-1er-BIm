I was asked to lead "JAD sessions", which I've heard of before, but never facilated before; at least in name, they appear just to be a fancy name for stakeholder workshops. My experience has been that "group think" and "follow the leader" are common issues with this approach, but trying to stay open to the concept. Based on what I'm able to tell the phrase has been around since the 1980s, so clearly it's no "silver bullet". What are the key pros and cons of this approach?
