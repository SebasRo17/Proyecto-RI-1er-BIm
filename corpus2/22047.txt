I'm using Manipulate to visualize three datasets:               Manipulate[ListPlot[WHAT -> what], {what, {dataset1, dataset2, dataset3}}]      Now with this solution I can only plot data for either dataset1, dataset2 or dataset3. What if I wanted to plot the data for BOTH dataset1 and dataset2 on the same graph? Or for all three datasets? An easy way such as checking boxes corresponding to the datasets would be nice, but I don't know how to integrate this with Manipulate.
