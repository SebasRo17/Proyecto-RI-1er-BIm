When I installed the mathStatica application, it seems to have made some kind of change deep in my Mathematica 8.0.4 system files. That change causes the mathStatica palette to appear out of alphabetical order in the `Palettes` menu. And the palette notebook does _not_ set any value for `MenuPosition`. In `$UserBaseDirectory/Autoload/PacletManager/Configuration/FrontEnd/init.m` I see:               SetOptions[$FrontEndSession,     PalettePath -> {ParentList, FrontEnd`FileName[{$UserBaseDirectory,       "Applications", "mathStatica", "FrontEnd", "Palettes"},     "PacletManager" -> True]} ....      (Note that on my Mac OS X 10.7.3 system, `$UserBaseDirectory` is the same as `$BaseDirectory`.) However, if I delete the `PalettePath` option there, quit Mathematica, and restart it with clean preferences and clean cache, nonetheless:   * that same `PalettePath` option reappears in the same `init.m`; and then of course   * the mathStatica palette appears again out of order in the menu `Palettes` list. Question: what changes to some system file might cause this annoying and persistent behavior. I've looked at all the `init.m` files I could find inside the `Mathematica.app` package (which is how the Mac bundles the entire `$InstallationDirectory`) but don't see anything suspicious.
