I grasp that it can fetch internet resources, but I'm not really fully appreciating what that means. I was doing the challenges at pythonchallenge.com, and I got past the one that requires urllib to fetch the page and read the source, but I don't see how this is useful quite yet. And examples are kind of lacking in diversity. What else can it do, or how can I use this to my advantage? (Besides building a web browser...)
