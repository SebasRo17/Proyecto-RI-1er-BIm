Is there a way to obtain the coordinate of a point of interest in a `ListPlot`? As an example, I have a list containing many sets of 2D coordinates and the plot drawn is discontinuous at one point (the first derivative is not continuous and the gradient increases suddenly). Can I extract the location of that point interactively? Otherwise, I have to search through the list of data myself to determine the change of gradient, which defeats the whole purpose of drawing a plot. Also, using the Get Coordinates function from the right click menu does not give very accurate results.
