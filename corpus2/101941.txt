I have heard several times from multiple people that "you shouldn't stay at the job you first arrived at as an intern before you got your BS degree". The thing I don't remember is: why not? **History:** I have been at my current company for 2.5 years as an intern (got in during the last year of community college), I transferred to a four-year university and am finishing my degree in the next 6 months. I plan to look around for a new job after I graduate (at least to just get my interviewing feet wet), but wonder if I should strongly consider a job where I currently work. **Pros:** I am familiar with the company, really love the people I work with, and am generally familiar with most software products we work on. Additionally, I have completed several projects there that I solely support (slightly better job security). **Cons:** Academically and professionally, I have a strong interest in web development which is something my current company does not do (it focuses mostly on Java/C++ computer applications). Academically, the classes I specialized in were aimed at web development (HTML/SQL/n-tier server side development/PHP/JSP/JavaScript/...). Also, the projects I implemented were developed when I didn't know several of the development patterns that I know now. If I had to re-implement them, I probably would have made some greatly different implementation decisions than I originally threw together 2 years ago. **The Big Question:** Professionally why shouldn't someone stay at their first job, especially since its pretty close to guaranteed job offer.
