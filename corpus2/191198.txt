Every time when user hears one music on system, the system stores this music to recent list, but I am afraid to pass over than decimal(19,0) limit in future. If I do Reseed I will get some problems insert invalid duplicate pirmary keys, but if I reallocate all id's it is possible. Is there a better way for that? With possibility to clean the jump of id (55-60) without future headache with Primary key overflow? Note: I can limit this list for `255(smallint)` maybe, but I want evade use same id`s.
