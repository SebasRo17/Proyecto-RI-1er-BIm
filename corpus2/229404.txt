We have a number of tasks that need to be completed, but are probably not real user stories, or if they are, they are very developer-centric user stories which will never be visible to the end-users. The problem is that because they do not get estimated as a part of a sprint and very little gets done on them. Eventually, it becomes enough of a problem that someone takes time out of a sprint to deal with them, but that affects progress on "official" sprint work, which makes some people a wee bit unhappy. I've been pushing for making these tasks into official user stories, but no one else seems to like this. How else could I request official recognition for these tasks, so I can allocate full days on them without feeling like I'm affecting the rest of the sprint? Some examples of the tasks, just to give you an idea:   * Write small, custom maven plugins to simplify specific (and widely used, within the organization) build configurations.   * Refactor old project(s) to build with Maven and newer tool set.   * Refactor redundant (across multiple projects) code into independent libraries - could potentially be used by _many_ projects.
