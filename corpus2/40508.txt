I always come across people who like to bang on for ages over the smallest "technical things". Don't get me wrong, I'm a geek programmer who loves what I do, but you know the type of conversation.   * Mac is so much better than Windows   * Don't use a For Each loop, use a While loop   * Don't buy an Intel based PC, get an AMD based one.   * We should use one IoC container over another. All these "things" have valid pro's and con's for both sides, and you'll never get a "correct" answer, and the person will never concede the point. (of course there will be some where there is an answer, maybe :). My question (I'm getting there!!) is: In a software team, how do you cut through these long discussions without inhibiting innovation, so that a decision can be made and you can get on to solving the real business problems.
