I have a bit of trouble with Mathematica and it's plotting stuff. I tried to plot Jacobi amplitude function:               JacobiAmplitude[Sqrt[0.1]*x, 10], {x, 0, 50}]      but the result leaves gaps where the roots of the function should be (particularly for this function around `x = 3, 6, 10, ...`). I've done a bit of googling and found that either `Exclusions` set to `None` or raising `PlotPoints` should help. Well, it didn't. I even tried to set `MaxRecursion` to `8`, `PlotPoints` to one **million** , waited several hours for the plot and it didn't change. Funny thing is, that when I added `Mesh -> None`, I've found out, that mathematica added plot points even at the gaps, but it didn't join them with lines! This is something like bug, or how should I deal with that? Any help'd be appreciated. P.S.: I'm using Mathematica 9.0
