Is it possible to extend the _Drawing Tools_ palette and add a grid snap feature? Drawing points with discrete intervals would make it a _lot easier_ to draw nice free body diagrams, and other simple problem sets without needing to page out of _Mathematica_. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Oaac.gif) **Image 1** : Typical situation where I page out of _Mathematica_ to _Illustrator_. Grid snap makes it much easier and quicker than snapping to elements. Grid that I snap to is shown in the background. New students are intimidated by learning yet another tool. And frankly I can and do write these in code as well, but students take time to learn to do so.
