I am looking for a way to compare (or "diff") two Mathematica expressions, similarly to how to diff utility can compare two text files and report the differences. Has anyone already written such a thing? Do you know of existing implementations? I wanted to check before trying to implement it. The Workbench's MUnit tester has something like this but I'm not sure how to invoke it separately from the testing UI. Also, I'd need something that works on held expressions as well. * * * To answer @Rojo's question: A first and simplest implementation would detect "point-differences". Assuming that the two expressions have identical structure, it would detect the leaf that differs. For example, if the expressions are               Hold@{1, f[2, g[3, 4^5]]}          Hold@{1, f[2, g[3, 4.^5]]}      it would report that the difference is at position `{1, 2, 2, 2, 1}` (because `4 =!= 4.`) A second and improved version (what I'm really looking for) would also handle additions and deletions, i.e. in               {1,2,3,4,5}          {1,2,4,5}      it would be able to match up the `4,5` part and understand that only `3` has been deleted. This would of course work also if `1,2,...` are compound expressions and not atoms, and would also work at deeper levels. I need something that works on _expressions_ and not on text, and respects the expression structure. (E.g. an atomic expression should be treated as an atom and not a set of characters. Line breaks, spaces and different notation forms such as `f@x` and `f[x]` should be handled or ignored appropriately.)
