> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Best Java book you have read so far I have learned to program some in Ruby, but I'm having trouble grasping OO concepts. I've been told that there are a lot of guides/books that teach object oriented programming that use Java. I've heard that Java is a good language for learning OO for a number of reasons... haha, reasons that I don't know. Anyway, I tried to use an IDE (Eclipse) and I don't care much for it. Are there any good guides/books/videos that focus on teaching OO concepts using Java that don't use an IDE such as Eclipse to teach it?
