My team is currently working on a web platform and we are planning to divide the application in a set of independent services written in different languages, the problem is that these services rely on a domain model layer that will need to be duplicated across the different languages(C# and Java). The Domain layer is heavily cohesive and cannot be easily splitted out. Given that working with multiple languages is a requirement **what is a good architectural style that will allow a positive approach for this problem?**
