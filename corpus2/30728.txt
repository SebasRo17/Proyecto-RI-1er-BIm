Is this graph in the list among the so-called "standard" structures used in `GraphData`? However, I have not found, yet, anything like "Carpet" or "Sponge" in the list of the object that can be built. Maybe, this graph has a different name? For me, using `GraphData` helps to save time for constructing adj. matrix, therefore, I would rather prefer using this function than drawing the graph... Thank you very much in advance!
