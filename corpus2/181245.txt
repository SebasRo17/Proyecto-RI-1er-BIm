CodeIgniter has a very nice feature called a Profiler, which displays information at the foot of a page, information such as GET, Memory, POST data. It also shows database queries and how long they took to run which I find very useful. I have recently taken over a legacy PHP application and it would help a lot to see what tables in the database are being queried by PHP pages. Is there a library for raw PHP applications that could produce something similar to CodeIgniter's Profiler? I am already using xdebug, I am only interested in profiling database queries.
