I have a huge set of code to accomplish a data transformation. I have saved this set of code as eg:                codeset:=Module[{},                 FileNameSetter[Dynamic[Tab2excelFileLocation]];                 RawDataTonnages =Import[Tab2excelFileLocation, {"Sheets", "Tonnages"}];       (*...blah blah blah...data transformation and setting up graphs and stats tables...*)                 FileNameSetter[Dynamic[Tab3excelFileLocation]];                 Tab3RawDataTonnages =Import[Tab3excelFileLocation, {"Sheets", "Tonnages"}]      (*...blah blah blah....data transformation and setting up graphs and stats tables...*)                 ];      Button["Recalculate", codeset]      Later I want to use the two `FileNameSetter` buttons to locate new files. Once this has been done I then want to press the `Recalculate` button to re- evaluate `'codeset'` so that my answers reflect the data from the new files. I have get this to work partially - when I press the button the codeset re- evaluates for the 1st filename setter only even though I have changed both. If I test not by using the button but by re-evaluating the code using shift+enter it works for both filename setters. Why is this happening, I can't understand it.
