the question is relatively simple I think. This is the first example of the code which works:               DynamicModule[{tabClicked, buttonClicked},           TabView[{        "First" ->          Dynamic@Grid[{{ Button["xx", tabClicked = 2; buttonClicked = 1],              Button["xx", tabClicked = 2; buttonClicked = 2]}}],        "Second" -> Dynamic[buttonClicked]        }, Dynamic[tabClicked]       ]      ]      while this doesn't:               DynamicModule[{tabClicked, buttonClicked},      buildButton[idx_] :=        Button["xx", tabClicked = 2; buttonClicked = idx];     TabView[{       "First" -> Dynamic@Grid[{{ buildButton[1], buildButton[2]}}],      "Second" -> Dynamic[buttonClicked]      }, Dynamic[tabClicked]      ]     ]      I know I can "fix" it by removing the Dynamic in front of Grid. The problem is that in the real example I need it as the grid context and even it's size are dynamic. I would like to understand why separating construction of button's into a function I get this strange behavior. Looking at the variable names using InputForm[] shows that the presence of Dynamic in front of Grid somehow forces Mathematica to assign temporary names to variables used in the buildButton.
