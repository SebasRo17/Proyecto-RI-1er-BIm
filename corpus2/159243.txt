I was reading a text. It said,               "Information presentation must be compatible with the response time needs of      systems. The response time should be short enough that the information  does not      lose its freshness and value but it should be long enough to reduce volume (and      costs) and reveal important trends that signal the need for action"      What does volume mean in it? Please help out. Thanks
