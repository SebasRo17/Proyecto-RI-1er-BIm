Currently we are using Source Safe and have started migration to Subversion. All of our external SDK's(> 500 MB) are held in Source Safe right now, and I am looking for ways to move them from VSS to a repository. We have C++ (mostly), C# (many), Java (few) projects. Hundreds of projects, all running on Windows. I looked at a couple of dependency managers but I'm not satisfied:   * NuGet - good for .Net but painful for C++   * Ivy - not look in depth, but doesn't seem acceptable for C++ **First question: what else should I check? It should be easy to use for a front-end developer. Best case is a simple build within the IDE.** * * * Currently I am inclined to this solution: Allocate some rarely used drive, like S: and declare it as 'DEV HOME'. Then place externals here:               S:\SDK\boost\1.30\...     S:\SDK\boost\1.45\...     S:\SDK\oracle\agile_9.0.0.0\...     S:\SDK\IBM\lotus_8.0\...     S:\SDK\IBM\lotus_9.0\...     S:\Tools\NuGet\nuget.exe     S:\Tools\clr\gacutil.exe      Autobuild machine will hold mastercopy of this 'DEV HOME'. Every developer should copy necessary SDKs from autobuild machine to local and create a 'fake' disk with **subst**. I can't find any big problems with this solution:   * Branches. Projects in different branches contain references to different versions of SDK (boost for example)   * Version of external component will not change too frequently, so there will not be hundreds of, say, boost versions.   * Easy for developers to setup.    * Absolute paths supported by any tool. Minor problems:   * Personally for me it is not beautiful solution.   * Disk (S:) can be busy   * Can't be done in Linux (but currently we're not interested in it)  **Second question: what problems can you see with this solution?**
