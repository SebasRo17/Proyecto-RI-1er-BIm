This may be subjective and likely to be closed but I still wanted to know if its really helpfull to read Structure and Interpretation of Computer programs. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs The book does not use Java. Not that I wanted to learn Java. I am just curious as to know if it be will useful read to be a better programmer and what are the things that I can gain from the book or are their any other alternatives to this book more suited to Java programmers?
