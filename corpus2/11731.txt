I'm currently trying to compute the three smallest eigenvectors for a 34 by 34 matrix. While I was expecting this to take some time, Mathematica has been running for the past 3 hours, which seems maybe slightly disproportional to the task at hand. The matrix is a laplacian matrix, so it is relatively sparse. Here is my input (G is the graph itself):               A1 = AdjacencyMatrix[G];     D1 = DiagonalMatrix[VertexDegree[G]];     NL1 = IdentityMatrix[34] - MatrixPower[D1, -1/2].A1.MatrixPower[D1, -1/2];     EvecsNL1 = Eigenvectors[NL1,-3]      Any help is much appreciated. Edit: Sorry about that:               G = ExampleData[{"NetworkGraph", "ZacharysKarateClub"}]      I'm trying to get accustomed to working with graph laplacians in mathematica, so I'm messing around with some included datasets. Edit 2: Wow, I feel foolish. Thank you for your help.
