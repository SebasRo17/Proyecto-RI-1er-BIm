When starting to learn programming you would usually point someone over to Code Academy, or Learn Python the Hard Way or even The C Programming language and tell them start writing code until it works.   But how would one proceed if he wants to learn QA? More specifically, a programmer who wants to learn about the QA process and how to manage a good QA methodology. I was given the role of jumpstarting a QA process in our company and I'm a bit lost, what are the different types of testing (system, integration, white box, black box) and which are most important to implement first? How would one implement them?
