I have the following classes :               class Task     {         public void DoSomething()         {              var s = new Service();             s.First();             s.Second();             s.Third();         }     }          class Service     {         public void First() {};         public void Second() {};         public void Third() {};     }      If I want to add logging, should I put logging statements like this :                   public void DoSomething()         {              Log("new");             var s = new Service();                  Log("First");             s.First();                  Log("Second");             s.Second();                  Log("Third");             s.Third();         }      Or should I put each statement inside the called methods of Service class ? I know it is quite subjective, and won't change a lot of things, but I'm curious about the pros and cons of each approach. Update : I'm not asking about verbosity or level, just about placement of the logging statements.
