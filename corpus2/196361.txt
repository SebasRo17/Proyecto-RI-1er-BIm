I'm writing a program to automatically make the draw for a competition. There are four objects: `Debate` `Judge` `School` `Team` Each Debate has two teams and a judge. Each team participates in three debates. With this, there are the following rules: 1) A team cannot face someone from their same school 2) A team cannot face another team from the same other school (As in if they play a team from a school once, they cannot play again against someone from that school) 3) A judge cannot come from the same school as a team they are judging. So how would I create a draw? A draw looks like a table (I just need the data, but when you write it it looks like this) with a column for judges and then three other columns for each round of debates (the three debates each team participates in). Right now I'm basically choosing a random team, finding an opposing team that hasn't played the school of the first team before and doesn't come from the same school and then finding a judge from neither of those schools. Then I do the same thing until I have all the debates. The problem is the program sometimes gets into ruts where there is no other team/judge that fits. A human would then shift things around and try to find a way to move other judges around to figure it out, but how can I do that with a program. If I run the program again it figures it out just because it's random which teams it chooses for what. Basically, I'm wondering what the best solution is to the problem?
