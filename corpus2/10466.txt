I am trying to find a function that fits my almost linear data. A high order polynomial model has too much residual. So I was hoping to use Mathematica to **fit splines** to the **curve**. This is what I would like to see in an example.   * `FindFit` with a spline function   * How to get model stats like what `LinearModelFit` provides.   * How to dump the spline terms and control points so I can implement in "C" I can then use the cubic spline on my embedded platform. So can I get a symbolic representation of this function so I can implement it? You can get the sample data here
