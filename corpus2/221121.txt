I need to do the code review of fellow members. One of the member always defined the helper functions at the bottom and use them at top e,g               class Sample {          public function SendFile(){     file = $this-convertFile($file);     }          public function convertFile(){     //bla bla     }          }      I sometimes dont know if he has custom defined this function of it is inherited from base class or some builin php function . when i reach bottom then i find it was custom defined
