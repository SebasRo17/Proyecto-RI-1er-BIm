I'm working on a solution for an organization that needs to last them long term (as subjective as that is). They currently have a Joomla installation whereby the CMS talks directly to the database, from there I have started "bolting on" the additions that they need for their environment (mobile app, kiosk, and lobby display). I've also started writing a RESTful service to talk to Joomla (not the joomla database) and the apps. Here's a diagram of how it's currently going. ![current architecture direction](http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/3221299/L.png)   **_note:** they already have the "public & admin" as well as the central db, google cal, email, and vimeo_ Since I'm just getting started with this, I'm thinking that I should probably push for an appropriate design from the ground up. I'm suggesting this so that they have a good foundation moving forward. Here's my suggestion to them ![proposed architecture](http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/3221292/L.png) Being that they already have some pieces in place, is it worth pushing for a new architecture? Also, am I on the right track with regards to the new architecture? Lastly, it's worth noting that they're not totally satisfied with Joomla and are looking for a possible rebuild for that portion of their project anyways.
