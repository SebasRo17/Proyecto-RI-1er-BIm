Having had a number of instances of merge problems and other difficulties with a large Subversion repository and a team of 10+ developers I'm considering whether SVN is the right tool and what else to consider? Primary system being managed is a large PHP web application with release cycles averaging 2-3 weeks apart and 4+ concurrent projects in active development at any time. Is subversion the right system or should we adopt Git, Mercurial or something else?
