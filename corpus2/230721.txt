I have multiple tables in my database. Some tables have relationship to others and some don't have. My friend told me that it is not advisable to have a table that is not related to others. Is it substandard if I have multiple tables in my database yet there's no relationship at all? Are there guidelines concerning to database table relationships? And also, what are the guidelines in cascading tables? thanks.
