OTServs are open source MMORPGs with a huge community. Mostly all of them have a serious problem: if the server crashes, people can clone items. This is a dirty trick that can be executed because the state of a player is saved to the SQL database when the player logs out. This means the the database is not always in valid state. If 5 different players logged out with the same item, the item would be saved five times on the DB! So a crash would effectively clone the items. The OTServ core is several years old and the main branches still don't provide a solution. As online games, they consist of a world of dynamic data that changes at a very fast pace. There are thousands of online players and millions of registered players. The data is stored in MySQL. There are tables such as `players`, `player_items`, `player_skills`, `player_storage` and so on, some with millions of rows. I believe the problem could be that overhead brought by SQL makes it impossible to save all the data at the same pace it happens - hundreds of updates per player per second. Why OTServs have that problem, what's the impact of the use of SQL databases on the issue and how could it be solved?
