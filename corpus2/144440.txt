I was thinking about issue tracking software like Redmine, Trac or even the one that is in Fossil and something hit me: Is there a reason why Redmine and Trac are not possible to be distributed? Or maybe it's possible and I just don't know how it's possible? If it's not possible, why? By distributed I mean like Facebook or Google or other applications that effectively runs on multiple hardware a the same time but share data.
