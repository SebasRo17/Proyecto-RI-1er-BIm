After updating to version 9, I found the predict interface very helpful except there is a small problem always annoying me: Consider this: I have a list `abc = Range[1, 10];` and I want to take part of it `abc[[2]]`. For the `[[` and `]]`, I like to use the closer version of the bracket (`\[RightDoubleBracket]`) by press key `Esc`+`[`+`[`+`Esc` and `Esc`+`]`+`]`+`Esc`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9y63p.png) In version 9, when I type `abc` I get this drop list of predictions, and the first `Eec` key goes to remove the drop list and the `[[` is not correctly typed: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cZYNW.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S4BDo.png) So it is possible to make the drop list automatically disappear once what I typed matches the exists variable, so that the first `Esc` key is not eaten by the drop list?
