I have some data that I am plotting with `ListContourPlot` and I would like my contours to be closed at the edge (closing around the high value region). A simple example:               ListContourPlot[{{3, 2, 1, 0}, {2, 1, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0}},                      Contours -> {1}, ContourShading -> None, ContourStyle -> Thick]      > ![!\[plot of unclosed > contours\]\(http://i.imgur.com/B8eMa5d.png\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4KLf.png) I know you can add e.g. `BoundaryStyle -> Black`, but it closes the whole region: > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WD0Mu.png) Note that I have tried the answer here, but that method changes the plotting method from plotting a matrix to plotting `{x,y,f(x,y)}` values, which has some undesirable results on my (much more complicated than the above example) data.
