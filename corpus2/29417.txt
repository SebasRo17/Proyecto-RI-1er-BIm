I have some code written here which uses ComponentMeasurements to output some data, specifically the one below:               dnaList = ComponentMeasurements[dnaFragsL, "Length"]     Histogram[dnaList]      The first line of code generates the output               {1 -> 177.7, 2 -> 80.4449, 3 -> 338.173, 4 -> 270.588, 5 -> 379.699,       6 -> 93.3377, 7 -> 69.6693, 8 -> 214.073, 9 -> 370.709, 10 -> 81.386,       11 -> 160.486, 12 -> 90.3487, 13 -> 208.946, 14 -> 138.308,       15 -> 86.0753, 16 -> 65.237, 17 -> 65.2137, 18 -> 106.573,       19 -> 141.393, 20 -> 129.238, 21 -> 79.7561, 22 -> 60.7805,       23 -> 73.7609, 24 -> 86.4439, 25 -> 101.005, 26 -> 120.764,       27 -> 229.084, 28 -> 131.506, 29 -> 98.6205, 30 -> 26.1816,       31 -> 387.531, 32 -> 179.419, 33 -> 62.0383, 34 -> 60.3329}      which does not appear to be an array or list and cannot be fed into the Histogram function. What transform has to be carried out in order for it to generate usefully formatted output? The image dnaFragsL is attached below. ![test image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WPpcz.png)
