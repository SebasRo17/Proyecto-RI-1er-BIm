I am confused with the Integrate Given by _Mathematica_. First let's see a one-dimensional case:                   Integrate[UnitStep[k - Sqrt[kx^2]], {kx, -Infinity, Infinity}, Assumptions -> k > 0]      The result is `2k`. Right answer! You can change `UnitStep` to `HeavisideTheta`, it still gives the same correct answer. However, when changing to three dimension case,`HeavisideTheta` gives the wrong answer. See the following:               Integrate[ HeavisideTheta[k - Sqrt[kx^2 + ky^2 + kz^2]],       {kx,-Infinity,  Infinity}, {ky, -Infinity, Infinity}, {kz, -Infinity, Infinity},       Assumptions -> k > 0]      _Mathematica_ gives the wrong answer `0` and with an error message I don't understand. > Refine::fas: Warning: One or more assumptions evaluated to False. If `Assumptions` is not added, it directly gives `0` without any WARNING! As if it calculated it right! How dangerous if I previously didn't know the answer! @Jens suggested using `UnitStep` instead of `HeavisideStep`. I tried: in _Mathematica_ 7 it fails (giving the wrong answer 0) but in version 8 it gives the right result:                   (4 k^3 \[Pi])/3      Still with the same message: > Refine::fas: Warning: One or more assumptions evaluated to False. ## So what does this message mean? Why do different _Mathematica_ versions give different answers? Is this because of the computing time involved? * * * Above is the main question, here is some subtle question I would like to ask; see this integral:               Assuming[k > 0, Integrate[ UnitStep[k - Sqrt[kx^2 + ky^2 + kz^2]],       {kx, -Infinity, Infinity}, {ky, -Infinity, Infinity}, {kz, -Infinity, Infinity}]]      the results:                   (4 k^3 \[Pi])/3 k>0          0  True      ## It seems _Mathematica_ 'forgets' that I have assumed that `k>0`. Why is that? What does the second line of the result mean?
