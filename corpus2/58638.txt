I've tried to evaluate a sum and get a result in terms of `Zeta` function. And I have results in two forms:               (Zeta^\[Prime]\[Prime])[3/2]      And this:               Zeta''[3/2]      I tried to evaluate it, but the result is interesting:               N[(Zeta^\[Prime]\[Prime])[3/2]]     (* 15.9896 *)          N@(Zeta^\[Prime]\[Prime])[3/2]     (* 15.9896 *)          N[Zeta''[3/2]]     (* 15.9896 *)          N@Zeta''[3/2]     (* (Zeta^\[Prime]\[Prime])[3/2] *)      The question is: why the last one being unevaluated?
