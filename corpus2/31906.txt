The situation is that I have a List like this:               A = {{1, 11}, {1, 12}, {1, 17}, {1, 20}, {1, 52}, {4, 179}, {5, 10}, {5,        55}, {12, 16}, {13, 274}, {15, 206}, {17, 16}, {17, 23}, {17,        24}, {17, 25}, {22, 82}, {26, 131}, {30, 222}, {30, 391}, {40,        24}, {41, 31}, {41, 54}, {41, 78}, {41, 82}, {43, 42}, {44,        67}, {45, 21}, {47, 81}, {49, 192}, {52, 10}, {56, 67}, {56,        76}, {56, 79}, {56, 81}, {56, 89}, {56, 90}, {56, 91}, {56, 92}}      I would like to order the list A by frequencies from first component. I tried figure out this order with this function:                frec = Table[i[[1, 1]]  , {i,            Sort[Tally[A, #1[[1]] ==   #2[[1]]  & ], #1[[2]] > #2[[2]] & ]}]     {56, 1, 41, 17, 30, 5, 52, 49, 47, 45, 44, 43, 40, 26, 22, 15, 13, 12,               4}      It means that 56 appears as first component more than 1, and so on. But I really don't know how to use this order to produce something like this:               A = {{56, 67}, {56, 76}, {56, 79}, {56, 81}, {56, 89}, {56, 90}, {56, 91},         {56, 92},{1, 11}, {1, 12}, {1, 17}, {1, 20}, {1, 52},{41, 31}, {41, 54}, {41, 78}, {41, 82},{17, 16}, {17, 23}, {17, 24}, {17, 25}, ...       In advance, thanks to see the question.
