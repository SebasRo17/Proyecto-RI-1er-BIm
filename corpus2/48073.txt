When I create a DistributionFitTest of a distribution i receive very low P values. Eg. $2.456750213008007 \times 10^{-367}$. When I copy this (by right clicking and copy to LaTeX), and insert it in my LaTeX document, I receive the number as               \text{2.4567502130080068515188263453399491266$\grave{ }$15.778498511135323*${}^{\wedge}$-367}      Where I would prefer to receive a rounded value such as:               \text{2.457} \times 10^{-367}      Or at least receive an output equivalent, so that I don't have round up manually or edit "*" to "\times", or add up "10".
