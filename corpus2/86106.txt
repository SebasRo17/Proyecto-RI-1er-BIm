I have an array of n strings. I want to select all the elements of the array that starts with the given string. Sorry if that is not clear. I'll give an example.               input = "as"     array = ["abas", "aras", "as", "ask", "asi", "aso", "atas" ]     output =            ["as", "ask", "asi", "aso"]      Which algorithm will I need to do this selection. I need the fastest algorithm that will perform this operation since I'm using it for autoComplete in JavaScript. So the search should be faster than the typing speed of the user. **Edit** : Was just thinking about the data I have to pre-process if using a data structure. The data would be dynamic, and I have to perform insert operation that many number of times. I'm fetching data dynamically using AJAX requests. **Edit 2** : The array might contain 1 million entries and the search should be made at two places. One on the server side, to select all elements matching the condition. This can be restricted to 10000 entries, and the other on the client side... search size will be those 10000 entries, and this can be restricted to first 250 entries. Sorry for the late editing of the question.
