I've got a question quite similar to No 18163:Problem with high parameter values in ParametricPlot, but the solution of that problem did not work for me. So I hope you may have another tip. I want to plot an equation similar (just a bit more difficult) then the following, the parameter and data range of concern is also similar: $\omega = 2 c \pi / \lambda$, where $c$ is the speed of light. Now, the other function is a bit more tricky, therefore I want to use `ParametricPlot` and not `Plot`. My problem however is that it does not display the x-axis (or it might be so small I don't see it) when I use the correct value for `c`. It seems to be a problem with the large values, as everything is OK if I set `c = 2` or `c = 10` instead. The code I used is: 1)               ParametricPlot[{(2 π)/λ, (2 π)/λ*1000}, {λ, 300, 1000}]      2)               ParametricPlot[{(2 π)/λ, (2 π])/λ*1000}, {λ, 300, 1000},        PlotRange -> {{0.010, 0.02}, {10^15, 10^16}},        MaxRecursion -> 15,       Evaluated -> True]      I tried to apply a workaround, creating a list to `Map` over the range $\lambda$ = 300 .. 1000 and then using `ListPlot`. This would work; however, it's not so good for my full problem.
