I can't reproduce this simple example from Habrat, 2010 (" _Mathematica_ : a Problem-Centered Approach"). It is supposed to demonstrate the functionality of `FullSimplify`, however I can't make it work in _Mathematica 9_. When I try this:               FullSimplify[ Cot[ (5 Pi)/22 ] + 4 Sin[ (2 Pi)/11 ]]      _Mathematica 9_ returns the input unchanged:               Cot[ (5 Pi)/22 ] + 4 Sin[ (2 Pi)/11 ]      As shown in the book however, I would rather have expected `Sqrt[11]`. On the other trying               FullSimplify[ Cot[ (5 Pi)/22 ] + 4 Sin[ (2 Pi)/11 ] == Sqrt[11] ]      _Mathematica 9_ returns               True      so why not return `Sqrt[11]` in the first place?
