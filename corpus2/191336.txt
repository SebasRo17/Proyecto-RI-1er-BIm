Suppose we're unit testing a class with xUnit-like framework - so a test class is created for class-under-test. Now, how much should be tested by individual test methods? Should there be one-to-one mapping between methods-under-test and test methods:               class TestMath {              testSqrt() {             assertEquals(Math.sqrt(4), 2);                  assertException(Math.sqrt(-2));         }     }      Or is it better to have one test method per "scenario":               class TestMath {              testSqrtOfPositiveNum() {             assertEquals(Math.sqrt(4), 2);         }              testSqrtOfNegativeNum() {             assertException(Math.sqrt(-2));         }     }      Which is better and what are pros and cons of both methods?
