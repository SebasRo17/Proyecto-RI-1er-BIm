I am doing a plot where I have multiple shaded regions, and I want the line that separates the two regions to be dashed with dashes being alternating colors (so the demarcation stands out from both regions). For example, say I am plotting the two regions shown here               Plot[{1, Abs[BesselJ[1, x]]}, {x, 0, 20}, Filling -> Axis]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z26zI.jpg) The only way I could think to add the dashing was using `ColorFunction`, but it doesn't give what I'm looking for:               bgplot = Plot[{1, Abs[BesselJ[1, x]]}, {x, 0, 20},       Filling -> Axis, PlotStyle -> {Automatic, None}];     dashplot = Plot[Abs[BesselJ[1, x]], {x, 0, 20},       PlotStyle -> Thickness[.01],        ColorFunction -> (If[EvenQ[Floor[#]], Black, White]&),       ColorFunctionScaling -> False, PlotPoints -> 500];     Show[bgplot, dashplot]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QgojW.jpg) This is almost what I want, but the dashes are all the same length in the x-coordinate, whereas I'd prefer they be the same total length. Also, I have to have `PlotPoints` set to an unreasonably high value to avoid any gray regions. Any ideas how to do this better?
