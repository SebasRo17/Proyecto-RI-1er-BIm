So I started thinking, what is the best practice for publishing generated documentation (e.g. Doxygen, NaturalDocs, etc.) in terms of infrastructure? I would be generating it through continuous integration:   * Should it be put in a regular web server?, or should I use something like Sharepoint or some other content publishing software?   * Should the documentation be available for each build?, or just stable releases   * Should I put a full copy of each documentation iteration?, or should I put it in version control overwriting itself? (a repository separate to the project code, of course) For some weird reason I find hard to think that I should just put it in a web enabled server, but this is how I see most do it: http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/ However, what happens when your company works on tenths if not hundreds of projects?, most documentation generation tools AFAIK just give you the final HTML output, but it is up to you to manage it. So, what gives?, is there a better practice/solution than just putting it in the "doc server"?
