I have 5 years of experience writing WPF and WinForms applications. I solo wrote the software and thing always turned out well, and the company I work for has happy customers. Plenty of SQL, EF, LINQ, etc along the way. Things look nice to boot. I know zero ASP.NET. Neither my job nor personal projects have let me to work with it. Tomorrow I have an interview for a job that is for an ASP.NET/MVC/WPF/WinForms developer, though I gather from my recruiter that they like to ask about ASP.NET specifically. Now my question is, what exactly are my strengths here? I know I have a good amount of skills, but will they translate well going to ASP.NEt, in that I should act confident that I could pick it up quick on the job since I learned the other technologies? Any other advice? For comparison's sake, while I feel that I have a good handle on and am "pretty good" at WPF programming, it took me a while to get the hang of it coming from WinForms. I feel that if an employer had kept a close eye on me during that time, they wouldn't have been impressed. Any thought? Thanks!
