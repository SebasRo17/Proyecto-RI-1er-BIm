for a list of files, coming from a list like from a file dialog is it better to store the list as a list of strings or should I convert each file to opened Streams stored in a List? For example                       List<string> files = new List<string>();                  List<FileStream> fileStreams = new List<FileStream>();                  foreach (Stream f in fileStreams)             {                 //process stream             }                  **VS**                  foreach (string s in files)             {                 //open filestream                 FileStream fs = new FileStream(s, FileMode.Open);                      //process             }
