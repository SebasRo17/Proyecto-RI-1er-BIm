I was reading this question on SO which discusses some common undefined behavior in C++, and I wondered: does Java also have undefined behaviour? If that is the case, then what are some common causes of undefined behaviour in Java? If not, then which features of Java make it free from such behaviours and why haven't the latest versions of C and C++ been implemented with these properties?
