At the beginning of every iteration our whiteboard is covered with "not started" stories estimated in IDEAL HOURS. On a daily basis we update these estimates to keep track of each task's progress. I think we are doing it wrong. The original estimates are in ideal hours and our daily "re-assessment" in ELAPSED TIME. This seems inconsistent, right?! How would you measure your progress towards the end of the sprint?
