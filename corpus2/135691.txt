This question talks about any and all free public raw data which appeared to have valuable pieces but nothing that really provides what I am looking for. Instead of using a socially defined listing of businesses (foursquare), I would like a business listing data set of registered businesses and associated addresses that could then be searchable based on location (coordinates). The critical need is that the data set should be filterable based on varying criteria (give me all restaurants, coffee shops, etc...). If the data is free that is great but anywhere that sells this type of data would also suffice. Infochimps looked like a possibility but perhaps something a bit more extensive exists. Where can I find a free or for fee data set of registered business that is filterable based on type of business and location?
