I was trying to evaluate               N[LegendreP[5,0.1]]      The cell gives me:               N[LegendreP[5,0.1]]=0.178829      However I wanted more precision digits. I tried to use:               N[LegendreP[5,0.1],20]      But the result is the same. Interestingly, if I try with                N[LegendreP[5,1],20]      The result showed significantly increased digits               1.0000000000000000000      Is there a way that we can evaluate LegendreP more accurately?
