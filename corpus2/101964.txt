I have a job interview coming up at a small, 'family atmosphere' type of place running on php and Oracle 9i. I've prepared as best I could, but I'm struggling to come up with questions for 'them'. So far I got > How do you integrate a new developer into your work flow? Other than that I've got some canned questions courtesy of Google. Thanks in advance and my apologies if this is a duplicate question.
