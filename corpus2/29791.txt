I would like to calculate the following with _Mathematica_ : > Let $X$ be a random variable with probability function $$p(x)= \left\\{ > \begin{matrix} \frac{x}{6} & \text{for }x \in \\{1,2,3\\}\\\ 0 & > \text{Otherwise} \end{matrix}\right. $$ Calculate $P(X \leq 2)$, $E(X)$ and > $var(x)$ My major problem is to create the probability function with the correct distribution since there haven't been any specific distribution informed in the task. So how do I solve this? If it is any help, then the results are respectively:               {0.5, 2.333, 0.5556}
