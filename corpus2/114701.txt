I'm interested in forking a project released under a two-clause BSD license: > Copyright (c) 2010 {copyright holder} All rights reserved. > > Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without > modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: > > (1) Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, > this list of conditions and the disclaimer at the end.

I've never forked a project before, but this project is very similar to something that I need/want. However, I'm not sure how far I'll get, so my plan is to pull the latest from their repository and start working. Maybe, eventually, I'll get it to where I want it, and be able to release it. Is this the right approach? How, exactly, does this impact forking of the project? How do I track who owns what components or sections (what's copyright me, what's copyright the original creators, once I start stomping over their code base)? Can I fork this project? What must I do prior to releasing, and when/if I decide to release the software derived from this BSD-licensed work?
