I can bring images from the web using the Import command like this:               Import["http://blog.wolfram.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/se-30.jpg"]      ![good image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qlxsY.png) Sometimes the web request is more complicated so I must to use URLFetch. For that, this is what I have tried to do:               ImportString[         URLFetch["http://blog.wolfram.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/se-30.jpg"],     "JPG"]      ![unreadable image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jtH3X.png) Do you know how to make the image load correctly? I suspect that this is related to strings encodings, but I have not been able to solve it.
