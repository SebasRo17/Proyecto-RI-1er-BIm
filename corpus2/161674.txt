I just got an initial programming job offer for $75k + benefits. It's an initial offer, so I feel like I should give a counter offer to avoid unnecessarily leaving any money on the table, but I've never negotiated a salary before and I don't have any real reason for requesting more money other than, "I shouldn't just take the initial offer." Questions...   1. If I'm happy with the initial offer, would it be smart to give a counter offer and ask for more money and risk losing the job offer?   2. If so, how should I approach asking for more without any real justification? I should mention that I already have a job (at a very prominent software company), but it pays $16k/year less with no benefits. As such, I don't feel already having a job improves my position any. Thanks so much in advance for your wisdom!
