It's not clear to me what benefits there are of declaring your stack variables as constant in C++, I was hoping somebody might explain the benefits and purpose for this technique. For example:               void func(const std::string& arg)     {        if(someCondition)        {           const std::string foo ("some string plus " + arg);           std::out << foo << std::endl;           someFunction(foo);           // dozens more lines of code...        }        // bla bla bla...     }      Thanks!
