My question is similar to this one, but my goal is to prepend a _single_ 0 the each sublist, not incrementally many 0's. The file I'm working is a CSV containing around 50K sublists of length 35. I've tried to `Riffle` my `Flatten[list,1]` and then `Partition` it into properly sized sublists, but the result isn't pretty - I might have to add an offset parameter. Also, I'm trying to learn how to use pure functions, so any suggestion using them will be of help!
