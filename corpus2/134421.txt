I wont say what "community" because I want a non-biased explanation, but let's say you're building a reusable _module_ and that module requires 3+ dependent modules and removing 1 of them causes a breaking error not only in your app as a whole which uses this module, but the module itself. From my understanding (which must be wrong) a loosely coupled modular system will not break by simply removing one module. The app should still run but without that "feature" / module and the module itself shouldn't causes everything to not run simply because a dependent module doesn't exist. Is this wrong? If so, if modules are still dependent to the point of everything not working whats the difference between tight/loose coupling?
