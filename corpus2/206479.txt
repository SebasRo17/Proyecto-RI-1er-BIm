I have the web application where i am serving file downloads in php. All is working fine and i have the download column in `file field` where i increment it. But i want to have full statictics of downloads like how many downloads on `each day` or in `month` or `time of day` or from `which location` But i am not able o find how to design the mysql tables for that. Do i need to lo every download request in database for that. Any design pattern or example of that in real world
