> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to Plot an Infinite Series   >  Coding mistake? I have _Mathematica_ v9.0 and I am a newbie to _Mathematica_. I am trying to plot a function $f(x)=x$ over the interval $(-\pi,\pi)$. Together on the same plot, I want two partial sums, $S_{4}$ and $S_{8}$. I have tried to plot $S_{4}$ and $f(x)$, but can't seem to get it right. Can anyone show me how to do it? Here is my code:               f[x_] = x     s[n_, x_] := Sum[((-1)^(n + 1)) (2/n) (Sin[nx]), {n, 1, Infinity}]      partialsums = Table[s[n, x], {n, 1, 4}];      Plot[Evaluate[f[x], partialsums], {x, -3, 3}]      Is there anything wrong with my code? Hope someone can shed light on this.
