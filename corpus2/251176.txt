I have an REST API endpoint which the JSON response looks like:               {         "products": [             {"id": 1040, "price": 2.95, ...}             {"id": 4545, "price": 3.95, ...}         ]     }      One of my colleagues suggested that I should add a key for each item in the list. He said it should make it easier to browse the API. He suggested is something like:               {         "products": {             "1040": {"id": 1040, "price": 2.95, ...}             "4545": {"id": 4545, "price": 3.95, ...}         }     }      Making it will not be harmful for my API's performance and I can understand how it should help the ability to browse it. Should I do that? Is there any example of public API that does something similar?
