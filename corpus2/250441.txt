The only language I've ever used is Java. I like it a lot but decided it's time to learn another language :) . I'm interested in learning Python. It seems like a good choice because it's partly similar to Java (e.g. full class based OOP support) and partly very different (e.g. dynamically typed). I was reading some tutorials and am starting to learn the basics. Some of what I've read so far is confusing and I'm starting to think that maybe there are major differences in the OOP implementation of the two languages. I want a clear picture of this: please explain the key differences of the OOP support between the two languages.
