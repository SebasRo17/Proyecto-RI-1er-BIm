I work in a company that runs on a model of using one developer as tech lead (me), with an onshore co-ordinator/developer who co-ordinates the offshore team, and on the offshore team there's an off-shore co-ordinator. It sounds bizarre but it basically works. The rest of the developers are offshore. I happen to be on a project now that has an additional onshore developer. My question is, do you think I can use some agile methodologies here in a loose sense (we're a waterfall company, but maybe I could do scrum, sprints, planning poker, etc)? Also, do you think we could benefit from a scrum master? What if I didn't have the additional onshore developer (so basically I'd be one of two onshore developers then, and neither of us might be on the project full time)? What about me giving up the coding I do and becoming scrum master & tech lead? See my comment below for my duties now.
