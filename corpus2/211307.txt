I have built this CMS that has the option to add entries to the database. Each entry that is created has about 5 to 10 new images showing the product for sale. Each image is about 150Kb in size. I already know that images should always be stored in Git however my problem is that the sales team users that add new entries in the CMS are obviously working on the production server using the master branch. Our normal development is development code in your "dev environment" on a branch, then push those changes to the "staging environment" for QA and lastly if all the tests pass, push those changes to "production/live server". What will be the best way to get those new images that are uploaded on a daily basis into our repository seeing as those images are already on the live server?
