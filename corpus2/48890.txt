When making a nested `BoxWhiskersPlot` with chart labels, the labels are nicely spaced below the bottom frame when using labels for all nested data               data = {{{61.5, 60.5, 59.5}, {65.5, 60.5, 58.5}}, {{60.5, 57, 62}, {66.5, 60.5, 56.5}}}     BoxWhiskerChart[data, ChartLabels -> {{1, 3}, {"Group1", "Group2"}}]      ![Nicely spaced chartlabels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Epply.jpg) However, I decided to put the labeling of the groups into `ChartLegends` and to remove the chart labels for the groups,               BoxWhiskerChart[data, ChartLabels -> {{1, 3}, None}, ChartLegends -> {"Group1", "Group2"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T5UL6.jpg) but this leaves an annoying gap between the frame and the chart labels, the numbers 1 and 3 in my example. How can I remove it? Also, I actually would like to place the legends inside the frame at the lower left corner in order to save space, but `Placed` in the `BoxWhiskersPlot` does not allow it -- how can I work around that? Any help is much appreciated!
