This example comes from the Mathematica documentation for `Plot` under _Basic Examples_. Can someone please explain why these are each plotted as a different color in this case:               Plot[Evaluate[Table[BesselJ[n, x], {n, 4}]], {x, 0, 10}, Filling -> Axis]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r18ux.png) But when `Evaluate[]` is removed, all of them are the same color:               Plot[Table[BesselJ[n, x], {n, 4}], {x, 0, 10}, Filling -> Axis]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FWpFh.png) I know it must have to do with the order of things being evaluated, but I'm really not sure why it is working like this - can someone please point me in the correct direction?
