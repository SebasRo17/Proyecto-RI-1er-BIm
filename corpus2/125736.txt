I haven't read about this anywhere, but here are my thoughts: programming is inherently intellectually hard. I remember reading in Code Complete something that stuck with me: the author pushing and working on something long hours only to spend the rest of the week fixing it. This is something managers don't understand. For example, in the last company I worked in, we were expected to switch between tasks and projects as if we were switching from tightening bolts to painting in an assembly line. Getting into a project or fixing a bug, especially with the terrible code we had to maintain, has a lot of momentum and takes a while to get all the needed information in your head and start getting things done. I was thinking it would be good to concentrate design and coding in the early hours when we tend to stay more alert and do training, administration or meetings in the afternoon. Has anyone thought about this before? any studies?
