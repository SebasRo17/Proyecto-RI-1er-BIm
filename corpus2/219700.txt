I have begun working at a large software company and was assigned to a project that is over a million and a half lines of code. It's part of a program suite that is sold to clients (not an in-house project) and the source code can be purchased if they desire (although given the extra fees associated with it, this seems rare). They've been doing software design for years and their current products are intended to be continued for the foreseeable future. To my surprise, the million and a half lines of code are almost completely lacking in documentation. Moreover, there are some areas of code that are incredibly messy to follow or could use some refactoring to become much easier to understand (for instance, an improvement in the programming language came out 10 or so years ago that would make large portions of code much cleaner, not to mention less prone to bugs). There doesn't seem to be any efforts to rectify this and my offers to do so for the parts I'm working with have met with resistance, for which I've never really gotten a clear answer. Are these practices common in a large business in the software industry? Or is my company unique in its lack of refactoring and documentation? Addendum: Based on some of the comments, I'd like to clarify what I'm looking for. I understand that my company has technical debt and this is bad. I'm not looking to determine whether or not my company is worse off because of this, I am just wanting to know whether or not this lack of documentation and resistance to refactoring is a fact of life within the programming world that I'll have to deal with if I continue working in it.
