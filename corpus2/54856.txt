I'm trying to simplify an expression with sums of `ArcTan`, for which I've written a transformation rule that works for simple sums, so that `ArcTan[a] + ArcTan[b] -> ArcTan[(a+b)/(1-ab)]`. However, it fails for terms of the type `5 ArcTan[a] + ArcTan[b]`. One way to simplify this expression would be to expand the integer into a sum of units, then transform repeatedly until the expression consists of only one `ArcTan`, but I haven't been able so far to find the way. I've tried `Hold`,`Distribute`, `Sum`,`Fold` with `Plus`to no avail.
