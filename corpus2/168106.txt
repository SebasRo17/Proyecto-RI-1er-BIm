I am learning C (still very much a beginner) on Linux using the GCC compiler. I have noticed that some libraries, such as the library used with the `math.h` header, need to be linked in manually when included. I have been linking in the libraries using various flags of the form `-l[library-name]`, such as `-lm` for the above-mentioned math library. However, after switching from the command line and/or `Geany` to `Code::Blocks`, I noticed that `Code::Blocks` uses `g++` to compile the programs instead of the `gcc` that I am used to (even though the project is definitely specified as C). Also, `Code::Blocks` does not require the libraries to be manually linked in when compiling - libraries such as the math library _just work_. I have two questions: Firstly, is it "bad" to compile C programs with the `g++` compiler? So far it seems to work, but after all, C++ is not C and I am quite sure that the `g++` compiler is meant for C++. Secondly, is it the `g++` compiler that is doing the automatic linking of the libraries in `Code::Blocks`?
