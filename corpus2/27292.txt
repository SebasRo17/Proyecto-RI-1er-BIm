Consider this code:               data = Table[Sin[j^2 + i], {i, 0, Pi, Pi/3}, {j, 0, Pi, Pi/3}];     p1 = Graphics[Raster[data], Frame -> True, FrameStyle -> Large,        ImageSize -> 300];     p2 = ListDensityPlot[data, InterpolationOrder -> 0,        ColorFunction -> "GrayTones", Frame -> True, FrameStyle -> Large,        ImageSize -> 300];     Export["~/Downloads/1.pdf", p1, ImageResolution -> 100]     Export["~/Downloads/2.pdf", p2, ImageResolution -> 100]      Why does the font in the first plot appear vectorized while the the font in the second does not? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rlwWj.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cIKAV.png) _Update_ : remove the ImageResolution option will vectorize both plots, but ImageResolution is very helpful in reducing the pdf file size and I can't give up on that.
