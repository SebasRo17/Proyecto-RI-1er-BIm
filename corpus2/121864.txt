> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Data input validation - Where? How much? I'm a new PHP developer and am into Powershell quite a bit but this question is language agnostic. I've been questioning my code quite a bit lately thinking about how many nets I should setup to catch exceptions, verify results, etc. I realize that I could go crazy trying to verify each and every line of code but at the same time I want the code as resilient as possible. I'm not talking about user input but verifying output from methods. Is there some standard or rule of thumb to go by when deciding when and where to do data validation?
