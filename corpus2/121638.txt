I'm taking financial mathematics as an elective, and I'm working with real life finance industry worker type people. It's actually kind of fun. When I pulled out a macbook at one of our meetings, I had four lifelong windows users look at me like I had three heads. Anyway, I'm helping with design and simulation of our trading strategy, and I wrote a little thing using matplotlib to visualize historical stock data. However, these guys don't know how to use git, or install python, or deal with path-related package management things. I need to be able to send my scripts to them to use, and I need to do it with absolutely minimal effort on their part. I was thinking something on the lines of py2exe, but I'd like to hear some advice before I go ahead.
