Whenever you want to return a value from a method, but whatever you return depends on some other value, you typically use branching:               int calculateSomething() {       if (a == b) {         return x;       } else {         return y;       }     }      Another way to write this is:               int calculateSomething() {       if (a == b) {         return x;       }       return y;     }      Is there any reason to avoid one or the other? Both allow adding "else if"-clauses without problems. Both typically generate compiler errors if you add anything at the bottom. Note: I couldn't find any duplicates, although multiple questions exist about whether the accompanying curly braces should be on their own line. So let's not get into that.
