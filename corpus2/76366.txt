What "application" do you write to understand a programming language? I have used a calculator (regular + equation solver). But I think it's too easy. I am planning to learn Haskell and was curious, what is your "go-to application" when you start to learn a new programming language? One of my friend uses XML parser as his go-to application. Any other suggestions which will include comprehensive use of data structures and other important constructs?
