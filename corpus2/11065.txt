Sorry for not being clear about this question earlier. I appreciate the answers I got, but the edits I made should make the question more understandable. I have been working with hex in _Mathematica_ , and for some reason I can't get a list of hex _strings_ to work properly. I have a list of hex strings - for example:               toCharachterHex[inChar_] := Return[IntegerString[ToCharacterCode[inChar], 16]];      When I call the function like this:               hexList = toCharachterHex["ajdv*3"]      _Mathematica_ returns               {"61", "6a", "64", "76", "2a", "33"}      Now, when I type `hexList[[1]]`, _Mathematica_ gives me               {"97", "106", "100", "118", "42", "51"}      Why would _Mathematica_ do this? Shouldn't `hexList[[1]]` give me `61`?
