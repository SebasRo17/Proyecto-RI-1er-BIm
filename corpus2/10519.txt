This may have been asked somewhere else, but I couldn't find an answer by searching. I'm trying to create a correlation table that colors the background behind the numbers as a heatmap. I've been trying to use `ArrayPlot` with `ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap"`, but I'm kind of stuck. Example:               data = {{1, 0., -0.8}, {0., 1, 0.}, {-0.8, 0., 1}};     ArrayPlot[data, ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap", Frame -> None, Mesh -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/962mg.png)
