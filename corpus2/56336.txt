I am trying to use the Social features of Mathematica 10. The Facebook interaction works, but with Twitter I am getting "Cannot import data as JSON". Example:               In[16]:= ServiceExecute["Twitter", "LastTweet", {"ScreenName" ->         "stephen_wolfram"}]          During evaluation of In[16]:= Import::fmterr: Cannot import data as JSON format. >>          Out[16]= ServiceExecute["Twitter", "LastTweet", {"ScreenName" ->         "stephen_wolfram"}]      I have tried `ClearSystemCache[]` but this has no impact. I am getting the valid token from Twitter and it is marked as an allowed App with read access. If I use `SocialMediaData[]` it fails but returns numbers. Example:               In[17]:= SocialMediaData["Twitter", "Followers"] // Short      Generates this: ![output showing numbers](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IplUx.png) Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong, or how to diagnose/solve this? **[Edit]** Further testing. Restarting the client then `ServiceExecute[]` works. However `SocialMediaData[]` doesn't. Restarting the client and running `SocialMediaData[]` first fails but displays some names. Eg. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q5IZz.png) Also I've noticed that ServiceExecute allows you to save your Auth key, but SocialMediaData doesn't.
