I was going through this heavily discussed and highly voted question on SO and stumbled across one comment that got 5 upvotes. So I assume this was a great comment.But it got my head spinning at the same time. Can any one explain this comment? The comment says: > You can't compare big-O values directly without thinking about constant > factors. For small lists (and most lists are small), ArrayList's O(N) is > faster than LinkedList's O(1).
