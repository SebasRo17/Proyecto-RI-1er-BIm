I'm plotting the shortest distance from a point to a line using the following code               Show[Plot[1/2 x + 1/2, {x, -6, 7}],           ListPlot[{{4, -2.5}, {2, 1.5}}, Joined -> True, PlotMarkers -> Automatic]]      As this is the shortest line from the point to the line, the angle between the two lines should be 90 degrees. It doesn't show up like that in _Mathematica_ , however, since the y-axis is incrementing in visually smaller steps than the x-axis. How can I get _Mathematica_ to automatically to use even steps on the two axes?
