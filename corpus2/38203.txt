I am looking for a compact way to specify a pattern to match a rule list with `MatchQ` that allows for enumerating the rules in the rule list in an arbitrary order. E.g. given:               ruleList1 = {"a" -> 10, "b" -> 2.2, "c" -> "str"}     ruleList2 = {"b" -> 2.2, "c" -> "str", "a" -> 10}      the following pattern will match both `ruleList1` and `ruleList2`               MatchQ[ruleList,  {___, "a" -> _, ___, "b" -> _, ___} | {___, "b" -> _, ___, "a" -> _, ___}]      Can this pattern be written in a more compact form (e.g., by using `OptionsPattern[]`)?
