I am new to databases and trying to understand the basic concepts. I have learned how to delete data in a database. But one of my friends told me that you should never delete data in a database. Rather, when its no longer needed, it's better to simply mark it or flag it as 'not in use'. Is that true? If so, how would a big company like IBM handle their data for a hundred or more years?
