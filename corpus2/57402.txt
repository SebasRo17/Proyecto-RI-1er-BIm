At the company I work for we need a CMS. We have to choices, first one, work with an existing CMS ( Drupal, Joomla, whatever ) or develop our own. I know for sure that developing our own is the right approach. We need all the flexibility we can get, and developing our own is the best way to accomplish this. But I need to sell this based on ROI to upper management ( my boss ). Basically in terms of time and money. I can convince upper management that developing our own is the best way to go even without mentioning ROI, but I would also like to present this data to him. So I'm trying to investigate on the ROI of using already existing CMS solutions VS developing our own customized CMS ( based on a open source library or not ). After a search on google I found this: Choose between a commercial, open source, or customized CMS, but the link is from 2003, it has some truth's, but the world changed a lot from 2003. And I can't seem to find anything else about it. I've developed my own CMS ( actually I'm still developing it, it's always a work in progress ), so I know it's not the most easy thing to do, and that it takes time. Can someone give me any tips? On the ROI of one solution VS the other?
