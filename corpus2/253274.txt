We have completed a user story for a sprint. Near the end of the sprint there was a new functional addition requested for the same user story. Here the user story will remain the same. ie As a i want to <> so that <> will remain the same. Only difference is that there is a new value add that is to be done. So should this be taken as a new user story for the next sprint or should this be taken as a backlog? We have met the done definition we had for the user story and this new feature is a new requirement which wont have any change in the user story definition. I am adding an example to make it more clear take a feature say create profile, in that user can update his name,address, phone no, photo etc and its done. now if the customer wants to have facebook link or add country code to phone number, is that change request a new user story
