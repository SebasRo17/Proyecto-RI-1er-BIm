It suddenly struck me today that I have never developed any large application or worked with a team of programmers, and so am missing out a lot - both in terms of technical knowledge and the social-fun part of it. And I would like to rectify that - an idea is to start an open source group by training college students (for no charge) and developing some open source application with them. Please give me some basic advice on the whole process of how to (1) plan and (2) manage projects in a team. What new skill sets would you recommend? (I have read _joel on software_ and _37 Signals_ , and got many insightful tips from them. But I'd like a little more technical knowledge ...) * * * Background (freelancer, past 4+ years) - Computer engineer > graphic / web designer > online marketing > moved on to programming in PHP, Perl, Python > did Oracle DBA OCP training to understand DB's > current self-assigned title - web application developer.
