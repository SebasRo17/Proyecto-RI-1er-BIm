I asked this question quite some time ago: How do you name your private variables in C#? In one of the answers, I was pointed to Microsoft's MSDN page that shows that private variables/fields should be named like this:               private int myInteger;      But a parameter would be:               void SomeMethod(int myInteger)      and a local variable would be like this:               int myInteger;      So when you reference them like this               myInteger = 10;      you have no way of knowing which one you are talking about. I am now starting a new project and one of my co-workers is asking me why we don't do something to differentiate at least some of these. I am wondering the same thing. Why didn't Microsoft's standard keep these different?
