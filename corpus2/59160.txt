I have the following equation               h''[η] + (2 a'/a) h'[η] + (k)^2 h[η] == 0     2 a'/a = 1.3551      with boundary conditions               h[0] == 1, h'[0] == 0      where `k` is some constant factor. I have to plot `h[η]` @ `η = c` versus `k η` @ `η = c`. So far this is what I have done:               sol = DSolve[{h''[η] + (2 a'/a) h'[η] + (k)^2 h[η] == 0, h[0] == 1, h'[0] == 0},                 h[η], η] /. η -> 1.48* 0.0195          Plot[h[0.02886`] /. sol, {k, 0, 1000}]      As a note: I was expected to plot vs `k η` but since _Mathematica_ is refusing to do so I plotted vs `k` only. The result looks like this > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dOBx7.png) However the solution should be damped with 3 oscillations only as shown below:![Expected plotsshown by dotted lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I58MS.png)
