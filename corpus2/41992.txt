The Mathematica documentation (section "Details": https://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/OpenCLLink/ref/OpenCLFunction.html) states that: > On launch, if the number of threads is not specified (as an extra argument > to the ), then the dimension of the element with largest rank and dimension > is chosen. For images, the rank is set to 2. Great - but how do I do that when I call an OpenCL Function? There is so documentation for that.. Thanks
