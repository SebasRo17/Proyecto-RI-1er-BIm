I've made a poorly written, yet fully functioning website, in _(shock, horror, shock)_ PHP. Everything works as expected, I've implemented the necessary security measures: http://php.net/manual/en/security.php and phpsec.org/projects/guide/ It's poorly written in the sense that it's a bunch of functions thrown together that do something...oddly enough I was consistent with the naming conventions. Would you release something you were not happy with, but worked? I would also like to point out that I don't collect much user information (username, email and password) is about it -- but it's not really the security part I'm worried about, it's the spaghetti code I've written.
