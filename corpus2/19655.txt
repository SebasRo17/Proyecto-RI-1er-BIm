I am trying to construct a program that will find the square root of a number, using Newton's method, which is $$x(n+1) = x_n- f(x) / f'(x_n)$$ The number, will be a random number, generated by: `RandomInteger[{1000000, 10000000}]` I am setting the first Newton estimate to be 1, so I can iterate my loop until the difference in the estimate from Newton's method after n iterations to the first estimate of 1, being less than 0.001. Since I am trying to construct this fully, I am not using any `Sqrt[x]` function or $n^.5$ relationship either. My current thoughts: So I have set:               f[x]:=x^2 + k      where               k = RandomInteger[{1000000, 10000000}]      Since I want to know what number I am taking the SQRT of, I am Printing that information out with:               Print["The Square Root of ", k, " is ", ---]      where --- will be my program. Since I need to take an unknown number of iterations, I am thinking of using a `For` loop, as that checks the loop invariant condition until it is `False` then stops. This is the part I am stuck on -- what I can't grasp: how do I make the loop check for a condition that is outside of the loop? Any help or hints would be greatly appreciated.
