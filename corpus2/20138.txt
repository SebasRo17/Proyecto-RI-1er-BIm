The _Mathematica_ manual says: `NIntegrate` symbolically **analyzes its input** to transform oscillatory and other integrands, subdivide piecewise functions, and **select optimal algorithms**.   1. How do I extract the specific value of `Method` (and other related options) being used for a particular case? In other words, if the method is set to `Automatic`, how do I know which method was **actually** used for integration for a given case?   2. Can I achieve better accuracy if I modify the parameters for `NIntegrate`? I mean, does the automatic selection work well for a majority of cases (if an integrand is non-problematic)?
