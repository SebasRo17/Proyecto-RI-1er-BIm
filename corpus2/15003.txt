I understand that JLink loads each time _Mathematica_ launches or each time a kernel starts, and that this can require permission from the firewall, if it is enabled ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jOZpl.png) but OS X provides settings the provide this permission by default, so that I don't have to provide it each time _Mathematica_ starts (a process that seems to cause delays and even crashes _Mathematica_ in some cases). However, even if I give this permission, I still get asked for it again, each time. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AD44l.png) _Mathematica_ is is the only application on my system that does this. Why? Is there some way to configure _Mathematica_ so that it behaves as it should; or is this a bug? What does _Mathematica_ need "incoming network connections" for anyway? Can turn off the need for them in _Mathematica_ somewhere?
