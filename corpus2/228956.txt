I can't google this question, because I can't come up with a good query, so let me describe what I want and maybe someone will be able to suggest a way forward for me. I need to solve the following problem: there is an list of jpg images. There is also one "source" jpg image. I need to find if this image is a cropped image from the list. I do not know what software was used to crop and have no control over what jpeg quality setting is used in the source image. I do realize that if the setting is to low the result can't be unrecognisable, but I still would like somehow be able to check the source image against each of the images in the list and get a "yes" if a match found. Ideally I'd like a .net library for this, but I also could implement it myself if only I knew a proper algorithm (and it's description is not 100 pages long). Since jpeg is lossy format I can't do bit by bit comparison, and even if I could it's not immediately obvious how to find the correct part of image to compare so this does not take too long, since the crop can be of arbitrary size in arbitrary spot of the image. In my case the crop is never resized or rotated, so it kind of makes it simpler, but I'm still not sure where to start.
