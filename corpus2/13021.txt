`RandomInteger[3,3]` produces a vector of length-3 randomly. But it counts index from 1. I need a vector, index of which starts from 0. Because of this, when plotting it, my x-axis starts from 1. Look at the following.               ListPlot[RandomInteger[3, 3]]      So I've searched HELP about this, and I found the option about `AxesOrigin`. I tried out the following.               ListPlot[RandomInteger[3, 3], AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}]      Look at the values of the axis. It's just shifting the axis without adjusting index of the vector. It is starting from 1 still. **How can I count my vectors from the index of 0?**
