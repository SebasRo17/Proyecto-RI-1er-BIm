`EquationTrekker` is great for phase space plots, however I want to plot the results of $$\phi '(t)=-b \sin (\phi (t))+g \sin (\Phi (t)-\phi (t))+1\\\\\Phi '(t)=g y \sin (\phi (t)-\Phi (t))-J (\Phi (t)-\phi (t))$$ I modified this to create this:               Manipulate[      Show[ParametricPlot[        Evaluate[         First[{ϕ[t] , Φ[t]} /.            NDSolve[{ϕ'[t] ==                1 - b Sin[ϕ[t]] +                g Sin[Φ[t] - ϕ[t]], Φ'[t] ==                y g Sin[ϕ[t] - Φ[t]] -                J (Φ[t] - ϕ[t]),              Thread[{ϕ[0] , Φ[0]} ==                point]}, {ϕ, Φ}, {t, 0, T}]]], {t, 0, T},         PlotStyle -> Red, PlotRange -> R]], {{T, 20}, 1, 100}, {{R, 2}, 0,        10}, {{b, 1.79}, -1, 4}, {{g, 0.32}, -1, 4}, {{y, 0.26}, -1,        4}, {{J, 0.51}, -1, 4}, {{point, {1.3, 0.2}}, Locator},       SaveDefinitions -> True]      which lets me click on various portions of the graph and have a look at the time evolution in state space. I'd like to get similar behavior in EquationTrekker, where it shows me the solution of a two-dimensional system in state space. The main thing I need is the "memory" bit, that previously drawn curves stay put instead of getting erased. Is there any way I can get this to work with `EquationTrekker`? If not, is there any way to modify my example so that it "imprints" a line wherever the `Locator` is put? Additionally: A way to `StreamPlot` the gradient in the same graph would be nice.
