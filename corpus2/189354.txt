I am currently tasked with creating a software architecture for compliance with IEC 62304. These regulations are notoriously vague, and do not provide any real substance as to what is required for a "software architecture". The standard states > The manufacturer shall transform the requirements for the medical device > software into a documented architecture that describes the software's > structure and identifies software items. Now I went to an applied computer science school, so the vast majority of my teachings were around how to actually write code and working on projects, so as far as I can remember, we never covered anything involving creating software architecture diagrams. I've already basically written all of the software, but for regulatory submission purposes I need to create this documentation for the project. So in short my question is this: What exactly does a "software architecture" consist of?
