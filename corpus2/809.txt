_Mathematica_ has a lot of undocumented or poorly documented options.   1. How does one go about working out if there is an undocumented option that might solve a particular problem?   2. How does one work out what the universe of possible values the option might take are? (This also applies to options whose existence is documented, but where the range of valid values isn't.) * * * As background, here is a collection of ones I and others have found so far: **Graphics** The `Method` option is an option for `Graphics` and related commands like `BarChart`. It is mentioned in the notes in the documentation and turns up in `Options[Graphics]` but is not listed as an option in the documentation with any examples. There are many sub-options, none of which are explicitly documented.   * `Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True}` removes whitespace that _Mathematica_ adds as a tiny rim to each plot. (pointed out by Sjoerd)   * `Method -> {"GridLinesInFront" -> True}` does what it says (see Brett Champion's answer to this question and this MathGroup thread). `Dynamic` `GridLines` using this option are present in much of the graphical Wolfram|Alpha output (See, e.g. the edited number line code).   * `Method -> {"AxesInFront" -> True}` also does what it says. (see TomD's comment on Brett's answer)   * `Method -> {Refinement -> {ControlValue -> angle}}` sets the angle that decides when two points in a plot are not further subdivided - default is `5\[Degree]`. (see Yaro's answer here and the relevant page in Stan Wagon's book. Also, a `Plot` version comparison by Alexey)   * The option `"MessagesHead"` is used to track the origin of calls to `Plot`, etc., made by dependent plot functions such as `LogPlot`, `LogLinearPlot`, and `DateListLogPlot`. This allows the correct options and messages to be passed to and from the general function. An example of its use can be seen in this question.   * `ImageSizeRaw` option for various plotting and graphics functions is not documented, but turns out to be important for embedding CDFs into web pages.   * `PrivateFontOptions -> {"OperatorSubstitution" -> False}`, as documented here, stops minus signs, parentheses and the like from being in _Mathematica_ 's special fonts rather than the selected text font.   * s0rce discovered that the `ScalingFunctions` option works for line plots (`ListPlot`, `Plot`, etc). Possible values include `"Reverse"`, `"Log"` `"Log10"` â€“ the last of these being itself undocumented.   * Not strictly a graphics function, but often used to create nice-looking ticks, `FindDivisions` has an undocumented `Method` option: for example, `FindDivisions[{-1.8,8.9}, 6, Method -> "ExtendRange"]` gives the encompassing divisions `{-2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}`, as does `Method -> Automatic`; any other setting for `Method` gives the _inner_ divisions: `{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}`.    * You can control the amount a `PieChart` segment pops out of the chart when you click it using `SetOptions[Charting'iSectorChart, {PopoutSpacing -> n}]`, where `n` is numeric. The default is 0.2; for fun, try a negative number. You can suppress this behaviour altogether using `SetOptions[Charting'SectorChart, {Popout -> False}]` (in both these examples, change the quote mark to a backquote). **Panels** As noted in an earlier question, these options pop up in some graphics/panels, but are unrecognised when one uses them explicitly in `Panel`, `Graphics` or related structures:   * `LineColor`   * `FrontFaceColor`   * `BackFaceColor`   * `GraphicsColor` **Legends** There seem to be a lot of undocumented options here:   * `AssembleLegendContainer`   * `BubbleScaleLegend`   * `ColorGradientLegend`   * `ContourLegend`   * `CurveLegend`   * `GridLegend`   * `Legend`   * `LegendContainer`: `SetOptions[Legending`GridLegend, Legending`LegendContainer -> Identity]` removes the border from legends (thanks to Mr.Wizard)   * `LegendHeading`   * `LegendImage`   * `LegendItemLayout`   * `LegendLayout`   * `LegendPane`   * `LegendPosition`   * `LegendReap`   * `Legends`   * `LegendSize`   * `LegendSow` **Equation-solving and minimisation/optimisation**   * `Evaluated -> False` option of `FindRoot` (TomD in comments)  **System options for evaluation** Per acl's answer below, `SystemOptions[]` reveals many hidden options using the following syntax. These can be set using `SetSystemOptions[]`.   * `"PackedArrayOptions" /. SystemOptions[]`   * `"CompileOptions" /. SystemOptions[]` Although this book by Nancy Blachman has been written for Version 2, it is still not a bad starting point: http://www.amazon.com/Mathematica-Quick- Reference-Version-Spiral/dp/0201628805
