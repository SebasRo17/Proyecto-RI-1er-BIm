I'm a novice programmer and often when I'm working on my own projects, I always get the feeling that the design of my code is not the best it could be, and I hate this feeling. I end up spending time looking things up, but then I become overwhelmed easily with many details, such as design patterns to choose from and when to use an abstract class or an interface. Am I supposed to try and learn a little bit of everything at once?
