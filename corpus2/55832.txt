ttt =        Table[(z /. FindRoot[eqn1[x, z, y], {z, z0}]),          {x, 2.5*10^9, 3.5*10^9, 10^8/5},          {y, 0.6 10^-15, 1.4 10^-15, 10^-16},          {z0, 0.100, 0.110, 0.005} ];          MatrixForm[ttttt = Map[Max[#] - Min[#] &, ttt, {2}]];          ListPlot[Transpose[ttttt], Joined -> True, PlotMarkers -> Automatic, PlotRange -> All];      I know what `FindRoot` does, it finds the roots of `z` of `eqn1[x, z, y] == 0`, and `z0` is the initial value where `FindRoot` searches for a root. So the first expression simply finds roots of `z` about 0.1, 0.11, 0.005 while iterating `x` and `y`. I'm puzzled by the second expression, the one involving `Map[Max[#] - Min[#] &, ttt, {2}]`. I think it searches for the maximum and subtracts the minimum? Does it pick from a single root near one value of `z0` or for all three simultaneously?
