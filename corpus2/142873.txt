There are a number of competing best practices for software development. From what I have found, many teams have benefited from **Agile** practices in some cases. However, in some other cases, using the **Unified Process** has been championed by large companies like IBM. The common themes that I find seemed to work well for teams that mainly develop software. I am interested to know what has worked best for people who have worked in shops where there is a team on the other side that produce the hardware that your software is running on. For example, one team puts together a crate with several custom hardware on it; while you need to develop the software that would run on those crates. I can't find a development model (agile, spiral ...) that works best in this case. Any wisdom is this area will be well appreciated.
