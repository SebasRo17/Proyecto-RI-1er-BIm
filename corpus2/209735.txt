I come from using ASP.NET MVC/Web API and now I am starting to use Angular but I am not clear on the proper way to mix them. Once I am using Angular does the MVC sever side concepts still provide any value ? Or should I strictly be using Web API purely to get data for the angular HTTP calls ? Is there maybe a more stripped down starting point I should use if the VS template is adding a lot of stuff I don't need ? I like the idea of a strict divide of server side = pure data and client side = pure HTML processing Any tips you have for a ASP.NET MVC guy transitioning to Angular would be helpful
