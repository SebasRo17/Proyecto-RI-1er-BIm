I have a multi-variate function from $\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$. Choosing any desired initial vector, we can produce the corresponding function value, which is a vector as follows. The main problem lies in the computation of the Jacobian matrix. In the code below:               dim = 10;     X = Table[Subscript[x, i], {i, 1, dim}]     f[x_] := (n = Length[x];         Table[If[i <= n - 1, x[[i]] x[[i + 1]] - 1, x[[1]] x[[n]] - 1], {i,           1, n}]);     f[X]     J[X] = D[f[X], {X}];     J[X]     Y0 = Table[2, {i, 1, dim}];     f[Y0]     J[Y0]      the Jacobian (the differentiation of `f[x]`) is defined (theoretically) correctly, but I cannot plug any data to obtain the numerical values of the Jacobian matrix!? It would be appreciated if anyone take a look and give some suggestions to find `J[Y0]` correctly? Here `Y0` is the initial vector chosen arbitrary.
