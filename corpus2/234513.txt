I am dynamically loading an MPL 2.0 licensed library to use some of its exported functions in a feature. My code does not distribute the library, it simply detects it's presence on the system and uses it if it's available. I also browsed the library's source code to extract the function and certain type definitions. What ramifications does this have on my software? Do I have to distribute the MPL, open-source part of my code that uses the mentioned type definitions, do I have to mention something in my EULA, etc.?
