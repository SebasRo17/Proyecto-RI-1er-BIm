We are currently designing a REST API to access classical customer data. One of the elements in the API are the assets of an user. The assets are added under a given service. The backend API will only add an asset to an user under a given service. So, there's no User--Asset relation, but a User--[Service]--Asset relationship. Our URI's will look like this:               /users/{id}/assets/{id}/services/{id}      Uses of the API will know the asset id and the service id to create a new entry. What we are struggling with is the creation of this relation. One straightforward way would be to post the whole relation to `/users/{id}/assets/`               POST /users/{id}/assets         {asset:${id}, service:{id}, attribute1:"{var}", attribute2:"{var}"}      but then we are not actually creating an asset as the URI might indicate, but an asset-service relation. As an alternative, we are considering POST'ing to the URI addressing the relation, like this:               POST /users/{id}/assets/{id}/service/{id}     {attribute1:"{var}", attribute2:"{var}"}      But in this case, the resource path `/users/{id}/assets/{id}` will not exist before the POST and will be created as a side-effect. Is POST'ing to a resource path that does not exist yet allowed at all? Thanks for your thoughts, Gerard.
