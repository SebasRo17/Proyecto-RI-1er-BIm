I currently need to buy a new monitor (my old one broke and I'm stuck with my laptops screen). What's a good choice for a monitor these days? I've been quite out of the loop. I'm mostly concerned with my eyes of course, and I need something that is good for reading text (programming obviously). With that said I don't really care about gaming and beautiful picture display... just text. Any studies done on this? What's the best monitor for reading text? I would prefer a brand name if possible.
