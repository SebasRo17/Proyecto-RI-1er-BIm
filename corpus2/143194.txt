I am developing a web app and I have currently written the entire website in html/js/css and on the backend I have servlets that host some RESTFUL services. All the presentation logic is done through getting json objects and modifying the view through javascript. The application is essentially a search engine, but it will have user accounts with different roles. I've been researching some frameworks such as Play and Spring. I'm fairly new to web development, so I was wondering what advantages using server side page rendering would provide? Is it: Speed? Easier development and workflow? Access to existing libraries? More? All of the above?
