After learning, coding, and coding even more than ever now, I have noticed a trend in a lot of programming which I do. The trend is that the _majority_ of my functions are `if{}` or `if{} else{}` statements when it comes to performing the functions in my code. I narrowed out the option of it just being the project which I am working on. The project is building a PHP Framework or Application (whichever you want to call it). The vast majority of my code for the `autoloader.php`, `application.php`, and all of the _heavy-lifting_ files are performing their functions of making sure everything loads correctly and builds the environment. After working with very complex functions within my code to do this and that, they are all wrapped within an `if{}` or `if{} else{}` statement. Is this a common trend for the majority of programming? Or am I over reacting to something which I am seeing a lot of? Does the most complex functions in coding always go back to the basics of the legendary `if{}` or `if{} else{}` statement?
