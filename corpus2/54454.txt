I am trying to use `NDSolve` to analyze transients in transmission lines. I started with this simple one:               s = NDSolve[{∂_(t,t) u[t,x] == 2*∂_(x,x) u[t,x], u[0,x] == 1,                    u^((1,0))[0,x] == 0, u[t,0] == Sin[t]},                  u, { t, 0, 40}, { x, -10, 10}];      So: voltage is initially constant (at `t = 0`). One end of the line is shorted. But, this is not approved. _Mathematica_ says: > >     NDSolve::ndnco: The number of constraints (1) (initial conditions) is > not equal to >     the total differential order of the system plus the number of discrete > variables (2). >> >   How could `NDSolve` be used for transmission line transient analysis?
