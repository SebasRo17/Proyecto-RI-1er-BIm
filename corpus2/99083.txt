PHP's deployment model is uber simple: upload and run. This is especially ideal for web applications that are intended to be installed on shared hosting by end users (think: Wordpress). Compare this with the installation of a popular Perl app. I want to stop writing things in PHP, but want to keep the same deployment model. Is it possible to achieve this with Python or Perl in such a way that it'll work with most shared web hosts? In other words, how can I run Python or Perl scripts outside of the cgi-bin directory on most shared hosts, like I can with PHP scripts?
