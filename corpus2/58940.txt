I'm running Mathematica 10.0.0 and encountered a disturbing error in the symbolic integration of a rather simple function               Integrate[(1 - x)*(1 + 2*x)^6/Sqrt[1 - x^2], {x, -1, 1}]/Pi      The correct value for this integral is 15 (and NIntegrate gives that correctly) but Mathematica evaluates it symbolically as 1/π+29/2. I tried Wolfram Alpha, and it also gives the wrong answer. Any idea what is going on? ![incorrect Wolfram Alpha symbolic evaluation of this integral](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ALWWd.png) the correct answer is 15π=47.1239 * * * splitting the integrand into two parts does give the correct answer 15,               Integrate[(1 + 2*x)^6/Sqrt[1 - x^2], {x, -1, 1}]/Pi -       Integrate[x*(1 + 2*x)^6/Sqrt[1 - x^2], {x, -1, 1}]/Pi      somehow Mathematica has difficulty with square root singularities in the integrand?
