Imagine I have a list of Forex data as below:               data= {{"2014 06 30  07:49", {1.36535, 1.36525, 1.36543, 1.36542, 81}},             {"2014 06 30  07:50", {1.36543, 1.3654, 1.36545, 1.36544, 25}},             {"2014 06 30  07:51", {1.36544, 1.36544, 1.36562, 1.36552, 116}}      The list has different sizes in different case. Then using `FinancialIndicator["WildersMovingAverage", i][data]` you can get a list of `WildersMovingAverage` given period `i`. The output of this function is a list. My question is how one may limit the function in order to just compute the value of `WildersMovingAverage` for last data point and not to compute the whole list which is time consuming when the list is huge?
