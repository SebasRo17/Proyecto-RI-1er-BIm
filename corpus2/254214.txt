I know that my question is very broad but a general answer would be nice. **I would like to know which are the main languages used in aeronautic and spatial sector.** I know that the OS which run on embedded systems are **RTOS** (Real time OS) and I think that, this languages must be checked correctly by different methods (formal methods, unit tests) and must permit a **sure verification of whole process of a program**.
