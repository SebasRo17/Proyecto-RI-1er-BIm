I have been very busy these days with giving the `VertexCoordinates` of the cities the geographic coordinates from `CityData["CityName","Coordinates"]` of the cities. Could somebody please help me on writing algorithm?               Graph[{"Uppsala" -> "Marsta", "Marsta" -> "Uppsala",        "UpplandsVasby" -> "Sollentuna", "Sollentuna" -> "UpplandsVasby",        "UpplandsVasby" -> "Marsta", "Marsta" -> "UpplandsVasby",        "Stockholm" -> "Boo", "Boo" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Lidingo", "Lidingo" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Sollentuna", "Sollentuna" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Taby", "Taby" -> "Stockholm"},       VertexLabels -> "Name"]
