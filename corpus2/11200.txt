I have some stuff I would like to manipulate, using two different kinds of control, one at a time, using another variable as a switch. These controls are similar in principle to               Evaluate@(Sequence @@ {{controlA1, 0, 0.8}, {controlA2, 0, 2}})      and               {controlB, {-1, -1}, {1, 1}}      Therefore I tried using the code               Manipulate[           If[ChooseControlMode,       stuffA,       stuffB],           {{ChooseControlMode, False, "Choose control mode: "}, {True -> "A",         False -> "B"}, PopupMenu},           Dynamic@If[ChooseControlMode,      Evaluate@(Sequence @@ {{controlA1, 0, 0.8}, {controlA2, 0, 2}}),        {controlB, {-1, -1}, {1, 1}}]           ]      However, for some reason MMA behaves as if what I meant to be my controls were actually simple text (and also splices the `Sequence` inside `If`, therefore preventing even this simple text from being displayed at the right time). I also tried using something like               ReleaseHold@Dynamic@If[ChooseControlMode,        Hold@(Evaluate@(Sequence @@ {{controlA1, 0, 0.8}, {controlA2, 0,                2}})),        Hold@{controlB, {-1, -1}, {1, 1}}]      In this case instead I run into error > Manipulate::vsform: Manipulate argument `ReleaseHold[...]` does not have the > correct form for a variable specification. How can I get MMA to treat my input as additional controls and thus display them with their standard input (i.e., two `Manipulator`s and a `Slider2D`)?
