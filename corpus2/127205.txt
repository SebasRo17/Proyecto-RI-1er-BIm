I'm looking for software to organize and maintain projects internal documentation, specification, requirements, etc. Currently we store all documentation as lots of MS Word DOC files in a source control repository, which gives us version control, and that's nice. But you can't search this information, create links between them, categorize, collaborate. _Requirements, preferences:_   * Zero install on client side (WEB based).   * Document version control.   * Document annotations.   * Document linking.   * Full search (all documentation).   * MS Word (*.doc) import\export.   * WYSIWYG text editor. _Systems I have discovered and tried so far:_   * MediaWiki   * XWiki   * Confluence
