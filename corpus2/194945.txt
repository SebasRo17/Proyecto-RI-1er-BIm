I am just checking a java script framework . A universal JavaScript framework. To check how its really works i just checkout a demo of this product example site which is just normal todo list . I just start to playing with the `todo` list and i just notice that after click on `add` if i click on `cancel` in that dialog box, Its still add a blank `todo item` . I am sure this is bug . Here my point is not solve this bug or find this bug .My point is that if i have such products and there demo have bugs which can be easily noticed then **Are those bugs going to hurt my product reputation ? and how much ?**
