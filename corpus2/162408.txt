Could older C++ compilers (e.g. VS2008 and gcc3.4) link with external libraries written in C++11? My thought is that the C++11 .lib files are just byte code at this stage, and it shouldn't bother the older compilers how it was generated, as long as it is somehow resolvable and callable. I'm developing a small library whose API should still support C++03 users. So, looking forward, I'm wondering whether it's ok to implement my library using helpful features like `std::unique_ptr` and such, or do I have to just stick with `boost::`?
