I was hired ~1 year ago to write Java code (actually, to re-write a legacy codebase - I suspect the company would be happy no matter what language I was writing it in). Just yesterday I was tasked with fixing bugs in a VB6 program - I have never used Visual Basic before. My question is, is it common for a programmer to be asked to maintain/debug/fix code in a language completely unknown to him on the drop of a hat? I should clarify, I have no problem doing so, I'm simply wondering if this is a common experience for corporate programmers.
