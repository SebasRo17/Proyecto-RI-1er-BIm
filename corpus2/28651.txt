I decided to learn programming. I've been reading SO for few days, and I think I will start with C++, as I read some articles. I am aware of loops, arrays, program logic and objects a little and I need someone to look me over and help me with small questions I get when doing my first projects. So here is the question - where do I find such guy? I don't got any friends who program and all. EDIT: 2 years later, I am still looking for mentor. I did not actively code just started 3 months again. I work on Objective-C and iOS programming and game programming with Cocos2d. If you want to become my mentor, drop me a or comment.
