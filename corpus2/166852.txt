I have a client who wants a tool for him to be able to upload his products, enter orders, and keep track of customer details. There are quite a few highly customised requests, which is why he wants the tool custum made. He does not care much about the interface design - it just has to be usable and provide access to the databade. I've already designed the database. I have no experience of desktop applications and usually write my web apps in PHP with the Yii framework. But hosting this on a server seems like overkill. I also have .net experience from a few years ago. What would be the best options for writing this as a desktop application?
