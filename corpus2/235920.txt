I have been planning to create an new application. So I was designing the application structure.i know this application will be accessed form multiple devices and the app feature will be increased. So following is what I collection   1. Application is big, so need to splitup   2. Need Central Database with API (so all other clients including webapp will use this application)   3. Need Central Authentication System I am using Appengine as PAAS and Datastore as Database Following are various ways I thought I can implement it:   1. **Keep Authentication and API in one application with has common datastore     * problem here is webapp need datastore so frequently , so accessing it from another application will be performance impact, right?**   2. Keep Authentication, API, WebApp as different applications In above two cases following is my problem,   1. datastore cannot be shared, I know about cloud datastore which is currently too complex   2. maintaining data consistent across multiple application is hard (I don't have clear idea in it) Using New Appengine Modules would solve some of the issues (i.e keeping datastore, authentication, webapp in one application with different versions), but the problem here is application will be under heavy load, since is common. Any better solutions or drawbacks in current application design is very much appreciated.
