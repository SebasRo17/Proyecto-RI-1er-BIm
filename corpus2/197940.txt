An asm.js application is very fast (near native C++ speed): http://kripken.github.io/mloc_emscripten_talk/micro4b.png But how is it possible to write one in C++, convert it to LLVM code, then do some trick with emscripten/asm.js ? I haven't found any tutorial about it. And if I write the code in C++, then how to use the js API-s, for example XMLHttpRequest, WebSockets, Canvas or WebGL?
