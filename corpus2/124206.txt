Many of us know that Delphi executables are little bit gigantic, but again it is acceptable as nowadays 1.5 mb is not a big issue in PC. But what about mobile devices? Currently Firemonkey supports iOS and in the near future it is going to Android and so on. Isn't 4 mb of executable size for mobile devices is too much for a simple application? Will Delphi team try to reduce the size of executable in the future OR is it possible to do without loosing most of the features in Firemonkey?
