I worked in Linux environment before and I have to work in windows XP for my current project. In linux, I enjoyed using script files for automating tasks(even smaller ones), and it did save me a lot of time. I see windows command prompt is severely handicapped in terms of power and the number of commands available. I came across Power shell, but I think it is a overkill , because I am not a windows admin or something. Have you been in my situation before? Do you work on windows and automate tasks? Is there any place where I can learn them ?
