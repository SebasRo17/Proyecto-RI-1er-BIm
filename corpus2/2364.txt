I'd like to set Mathematica (8.0.4.0) up so it opens new notebooks with the `"NaturalColor"` stylesheet and with a window size like {800,770}. I tried to change default stylesheet via:               " OptionInspector -> Global Preferences -> Global Options\File Locations\Default Style Definition "      and I get this ugly notebook instead of this one. And when I Change the value of `"WindowSize"` from `"Medium"` to `"{800,770}"` under `"Notebook Options\Window Properties"`, it just does nothing. This is driving me crazy, any ideas ?
