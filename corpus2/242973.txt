I am having a problem learning how proper website structure should be. And by that I mean how to code the pages and how folder structure should be. Currently I am navigating around my website using GET variables in PHP when you want go to another page, so I am always loading the index.php file. And I would load the page I wanted like so:               $page = "error";          if(isset($_GET["page"]) AND file_exists("pages/".$_GET["page"].".php")) {              $page = $_GET["page"];          } elseif(!isset($_GET["page"])) {              $page = "home";          }      And this:               <div id="page">         <?php              include("pages/".$page.".php");         ?>     </div>      The reason I am doing this is because it makes making new pages a lot easier as I don't have to link style sheets and javascript in every file like so:               <head>         <title>             Website Name         </title>              <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>         <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" type="text/css">         <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.png"/>              <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>         <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>          </head>      There is a lot of problems doing it this way as URLs don't look normal ("?page=apanel/app") if I am trying to access a page from inside a folder inside the pages folder to prevent clutter. Obviously this is not the only way to go about it and I can't find the proper way to do it because I'm sure websites don't link style sheets in every file as that would be very bad if you changed a file name or needed to add another file you would have to change it in every file. If anyone could tell me how it is actually done or point me towards a tutorial that would be great. Thanks for your time :)
