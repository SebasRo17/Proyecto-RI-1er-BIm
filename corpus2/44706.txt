I would like to apply `Eigenvalues[]` to a list of matrices as in the following               foo[x_,y_]=x+y;          ({{foo[#1, #2], foo[#1, #1]},      {foo[#1, #1], foo[#1, #2]}}) & @@@ {{1, 2}, {1, 2}}          --> {{{3, 2}, {2, 3}}, {{3, 2}, {2, 3}}}          Eigenvalues @@@ %      However, I get the error-message "Eigenvalues::matsq: Argument 3 at position 1 is not a non-empty square matrix". What is the problem?
