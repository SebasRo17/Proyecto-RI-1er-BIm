The command               ColorData["Atoms", "Panel"]      generates a periodic table. As I don't want to reinvent the wheel, I asked myself how to change the color of each cell in the periodic table, (hydrogen -> pink, iron, gray etc.). I want to do it in the simples way. How can I do that? Since               ElementData[Element, "IconColor"]      is protected I dont have any idea.
