Graphics[{       Line[{{# - 1, -0.5}, {# - 1, 5.5}} & /@ Range[6]],       Line[{{-0.5, # - 1}, {5.5, # - 1}} & /@ Range[6]]       }]      There are two kinds of lines in this simple picture, some lines look sharp and others look blurry. How can I avoid this effect? If I zoom in the graphics by dragging the controlled-corner, the blurry effect still exists with different lines. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uan8e.png)
