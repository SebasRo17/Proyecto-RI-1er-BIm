I am looking for a way to control large amounts of JavaScript code in a ASP.Net MVC web application. I have been looking at Ember.js and whilst it's pretty compelling it takes control of the routing and as such treats the server as little more than a place from which to receive API calls. This isn't really useful for what I need. I wondered if there recommendations for similar projects out there that allow faster, more structured, JavaScript but in traditional server-based web applications?
