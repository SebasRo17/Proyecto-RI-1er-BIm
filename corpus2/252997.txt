I have a series of points with lengths and rotations like this: ![points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xiG62.jpg) I need to create separate chains from points whose lines overlap but Iâ€™m having real trouble doing this efficiently. I have an array of simple Point objects, in no particular order, and I can loop through them and test them with a simple "intersect" function. I need to end up with an array of chains, each with an ordered list of points. (Or another way of representing the chains). At the moment every avenue I explore seems to involve a convoluted hack of arrays, nudges and fudges. Having never studied Computer Science I wonder if there is some sort of data structure or technique that would lend itself well to this sort of thing.
