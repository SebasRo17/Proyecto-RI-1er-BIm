I have this Tic Tac Toe game and I thought of this really cool way to draw out the grid of 9 little boxes. I was thinking of putting buttons in each of those boxes. How should I give each button (9 buttons in total) an `ActionListener` that draws either an **X** or **O**? Should they each have their own, or should I do some sort of code that detects turns in `this`? Could I even do a `JButton Array` and do some `for` loops to put 9 buttons. So many possibilities, but which one is the most **proper**? Code so far:               import javax.swing.*;          import java.awt.event.*;     import java.awt.*;     public class Board extends JPanel implements ActionListener{     public Board(){         Timer timer = new Timer(25,this);         timer.start();     }     @Override     protected void paintComponent(Graphics g){         for(int y = 0; y < 3; y++){             for(int x = 0; x < 3; x++){                     g.drawRect(x*64, y*64, 64, 64);             }         }     }     public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){         repaint();     }     }
