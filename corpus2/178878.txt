As a personal project, I'm creating a single page, asp.net web application using Nancy to provide RESTful services to the single page. Due to the complexity of the single page, particularly the JavaScripts used, I've think creating a dedicated project for the client side of web development and another for service side will organize and simplify the development.               solution       |       +-- web / client side (single html page, js, css)       |    - contains asp.net project, and nancy library        |      to host the modules in application project folder       |       +-- application / service (nancy modules, bootstrap for other layer)       |       .       .       . and other layers (three tier, domain driven, etc)       .      Is this a good way of organizing a complex single page application? Am I over- engineering the web app, incurring too much complexity?
