I have the following, probably very simple question. How can I get $\it{Mathematica}$ to power expand function $\cos(y+i \log(x))$ in powers of $x$? This function obeys a well defined Laurent expansion about $x=0$ and I would like $\it{Mathematica}$ to give $\frac1{x}e^{i y}/2+x e^{-iy}/2$ upon evaluation of               Series[Cos[y + I Log[x]], {x, 0, 1}]      However, the result is               Cos[y + I Log[x]]      i.e. the original expression. I can bet that in some circumstances such expansion worked without any effort from my side. I wonder what is the right way to obtain the expansion of the function $\cos(y+i \log(x))$ in powers of $x$. Any help is appreciated.
