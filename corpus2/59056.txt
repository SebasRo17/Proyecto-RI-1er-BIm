I'm wanting plot the solid of revolution from the area between two functions such as: $1\leq x \leq e$ and $1 \leq y \leq 2 + ln(x)$, doing something like:               f[x_]:=2+Log[x]     g[x_]:=1     RevolutionPlot3D[{{f[x]}, {g[x]}}, {x, 1, E},      RevolutionAxis -> x, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0},      Boxed -> False, Mesh -> {5, 0}, PlotRange -> {{0, 3}, All},      PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.5]]      ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mVCDJ.png) There is a way to fill this empty space between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$?   Thanks in advance.
