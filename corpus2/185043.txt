I have good number of Service and DAO classes which has the same set of 30 line exception code block which gets repeated and it shows up in Code Duplication report. The approach which i can think of is to   * Extract the common exception code block to a common method and call   the method in one shot Re-organize the methods to ensure there is always one entry and exit point to Services or DAOs which will have just one set of exception code. Are there any better ways to approach this scenario?
