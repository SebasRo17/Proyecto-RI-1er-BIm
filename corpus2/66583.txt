I've been interviewing with a software company lately, and in my most recent (and final) interview I learned some more about the project I'd be working on: how it's architected, what needs maintenance, and what their primary concerns are for improving it in the future. The thing is that I've done some independent research that would be perfect for integrating into their system, but I don't yet know how they feel my interview went. Should I prepare for the possibility that I'm not hired by beginning to develop my idea, which is tantamount to a direct competitor to their product? It would be a significant time investment, but has two possible positive outcomes: I make bank on my idea on my own, or they eventually hire me anyway, giving me something to show for myself. The most likely negative outcome is the same as for any failed speculative software project: lost time that could've been spent on less risky ventures. Just curious as to what I should do. I'm a busy guy and it's important I be decisive.
