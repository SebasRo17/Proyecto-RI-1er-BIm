How can I make notebook cell's background become transparent? And can be saved as html with the translucent or transparent effect? One of the use is in HTML files, the background of cell hides the background of the web page's background. I wish there would be some setting in Mathematica and could be changed to HTML with transparent background, if no such direct manipulation, then should post process the HTML source file. Also, it it possible to make an Image as the background of the Notebook? something like the part effect of some slideshow stylesheet?
