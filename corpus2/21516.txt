Say I make a set of three Graphics3D images, here of three different cones, by evaluating:               {Graphics3D[{Cone[{{0, 0, 0}, {2, 3, 4}}, 3]}],       Graphics3D[{Cone[{{1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}}, 4]}],       Graphics3D[{Cone[{{1, 1, 1}, {9, 9, 9}}, 4]}]}      I would like to manually rotate one of the images showing a single cone, and have the other objects follow that rotation, or at least rotate to the final state once I let go of my mouse. Is this possible?
