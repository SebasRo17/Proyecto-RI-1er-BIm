So imagine this scenario: There is only 1 developer, who also is the bottleneck (testers, etc are busy on other contracts). There is a nontrivial backlog of tickets, most of which are blocked for not being reproducible, unintelligible requirements, unsolvable (with current ideas, staff and technologies). Is there any particular benefit to creating a system that parcels out the tickets to the sole developer one or two at a time? The system so far has immediately created slack on account of delays in assigning new tickets after current tickets are worked. When blocked tickets are assigned, they now sit on the developer's desk blocked until they are moved back to unassigned tickets. Are there any benefits to this "artificial low-WIP" system and how could/should it have been implemented?
