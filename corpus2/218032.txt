There's heaps of information out there on hiring someone who's already a programmer. (Or claims to be one.) But what about identifying someone who has the _potential_ to become a programmer, with little or no knowledge? Aside from the obvious things to look for (smart, gets things done), are there any interview questions and/or tests to determine whether one has the potential to become a programmer? Note: I'm not asking how to tell whether **I** can learn programming, but how to tell someone else is right for it. **UPDATE:** To narrow down the question, I'm asking: a. Is it even possible to determine in advance whether one can learn programming?   b. If so, how exactly can this be determined?   c. What are good tests/interview questions to ask in order to assess someone's potential ability? I'm talking about _specific_ question examples, not general guidance.
