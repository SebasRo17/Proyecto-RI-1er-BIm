I have been working on a project for about 6 months and it is finally _done_. Done meaning the bones of the software, all the servers are in place, the beta testing is ready to begin and in the real world. The project No Free Time is ready to get a **real name** _(scary right)_. Domains need to be bought... you get the idea. Where to go now though, when developing a for profit piece of software like a webapp there are a lot of issues and I do not even know square one. There are intellectual property concerns, there are trade marks, there is lawyer stuff. All of those things are expensive and probably don't need to happen at once. Is that the first step, and which of those steps are the most important. How do you get a webapp or piece of software off the ground safely? How do you begin to establish and protect your software/website/intellectual property, what are the cheap first steps, what steps can be postponed, and what must absolutely be completed before your software touches the public?
