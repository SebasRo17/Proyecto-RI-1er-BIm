I'm making a web application that will generate revenue from displaying ads. The system is meant for me to run and not sold/distributed to anyone else. My questions are:   * Can I use GPL licensed jQuery scripts on the website?   * Can I use GPL licensed scripts while generating ad revenue from the page?   * Do I need to provide my sites source to everyone if I use GPL licensed scripts?
