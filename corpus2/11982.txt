I have some code that looks like               Table[         a = 1;         b = {2, 3}         c = i;,         {i, 2}     ]      which gives an error: > Set::write: Tag Times in c {2,3} is Protected. >> In this case, it is quite clear that there is a semicolon missing after `b = {2, 3}`, which is causing this error. However, sometimes I encounter this in large code blocks spanning several lines, which is very difficult to debug. How can I automate this semicolon hunting to make debugging easier?
