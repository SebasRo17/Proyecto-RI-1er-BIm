I am a newbie, studying programming and I came across this question today: How can I make sure that I'm actually learning how to program rather than simply learning the details of a language? A commenter, ChaosPandion, had asked the question **if the programmer thinks in syntax or in a faster mental model**. I, while writing a solution will always think about the number of loops or condition to be used (for example). Am I doing it wrong? If so, how can I correct myself and what should I learn?
