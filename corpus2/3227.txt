A few weeks ago I ran a cluster analysis on some economic data and (unfortunately only) now I found out that some results do not make sense. For instance I analyzed the development of unemployment rates form end-2005 to mid-2011 for 32 countries. One cluster contained among others Germany (Figure 1) and Spain (Figure 2) and another cluster among others Estonia (Figure 3). I couldn't understand why _Mathematica_ would put Germany and Spain together in one cluster, instead of Estonia and Spain. I just calculated the `EuclideanDistance` between Germany and Spain (17.3) as well as Spain and Estonia (9.1). These results underline my doubts on my cluster-analysis- results. ![Germany](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HpQQP.png)![Spain](http://i.stack.imgur.com/niVez.png)![Estonia](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wQiRv.png) Here is the code with which I worked: First I generate a random sample (n=1200) of the original data, to minimize the effect of the input-order in `FindClusters` (Note from Mathematica- Documentation: "The order of elements can have an effect on the clusters found")               data;  (*see below*)     Table[DeleteDuplicates[             Table[RandomSample[DeleteCases[data[[j]], {}]], {i, 1200}]], {j,Length[data]}];      Then I run `FindCluster` for the first time to determine the commonest length of each cluster.               ClustersUnSorted[list_]:=Table[Map[FindClusters,list[[i]]],{i, Length[list]}]      In my next step I say, that if the previous step found less than four clusters, I would like Mathematica instead to set the minimum number of clusters to 4.               ClusterLength[list_]:=Table[If[         Commonest[Map[Length,list[[i]]]][[1]]<4,         4, Commonest[Map[Length, list[[i]]]][[1]]],     {i, Length[list]}]      Then I run `FindClusters` again on the basis of the previously determined number of clusters.               ClustersUnSortedFixLength[list_,Flatten[ClusterLength_]]:=         Table[Map[FindClusters[#,ClusterLength[[i]]] &, list[[i]]], {i, Length[list]}]      The last two steps are there to get rid of duplicates as for each indicator I generated a random sample (see step 1).               ClustersSorted[list_] := Table[Table[         Sort[Map[Sort, list[[j]][[i]]]], {i, Length[list[[j]]]}],      {j, Length[list]}]          CommonestCluster[list_] := Map[Commonest, list]      The last two steps can be easily comprehended by the following example (instead of `RandomSample` I could use `Permutations[{1, 5, 3, 10, 100}]` for a much more reliable result but since `Permutations` is limited to input with length less than 11 it is not applicable to my data.):               Table[RandomSample[{1, 5, 3, 10, 100}], {i, 1200}];     Map[FindClusters, %];     Table[Map[Sort, %[[i]]], {i, Length[%]}];     Map[Sort, %];     Commonest[%]      exemplary data (Note: the time series are not always of the same length.):               Country1GDP = Join[{{"Country1", "GDP"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];     Country2GDP = Join[{{"Country2", "GDP"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];     Country3GDP = Join[{{"Country3", "GDP"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];     Country4GDP = Join[{{"Country4", "GDP"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {5}]];     Country5GDP = Join[{{"Country5", "GDP"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];          Country1Imports =        Join[{{"Country1", "Imports"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];     Country2Imports =        Join[{{"Country2", "Imports"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {5}]];     Country3Imports =        Join[{{"Country3", "Imports"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];     Country4Imports =        Join[{{"Country4", "Imports"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];     Country5Imports =        Join[{{"Country5", "Imports"}}, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {6}]];          CompleteGDP = {Country1GDP, Country2GDP, Country3GDP, Country4GDP,         Country5GDP};     CompleteImports = {Country1Imports, Country2Imports, Country3Imports,         Country4Imports, Country5Imports};          data = {CompleteGDP, CompleteImports};
