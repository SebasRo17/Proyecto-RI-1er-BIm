I've been reading about law of Demeter and I would like to know how to solve this traversing model properties problem that I see a lot on Objective-C. I know that there is a similar question but in this case I'm not calling a method from the last property that do some calculations, instead, I'm just setting values (Ok, I know that getter are methods but my intention here is just to get the value, not to change the state of some object). For example:               self.priceLabel.text = self.media.ad.price.value;      Should I change that for something like:               self.priceLabel.text = [self.media adPriceValue];      and inside the Media.m               - (NSString *)adPriceValue {         return [self.ad priceValue];     }      and inside the Ad.m               - (NSString *)priceValue {         return [self.price value];     }      Is that a good solution? Or Am I creating unnecessary methods?
