I have a log that our web application builds. Each month it contains around 16,000 entries of a string with about the average sentence worth of text. To filter/search through these in our admin panel the script uses `preg_match()` but this seems to be taking ages and timing out on the 30sec limit. I have isolated that it is indeed the `preg_match()` that causes the time out. Is there a more efficient way to search through values in a large array for a users input?
