I have a list where a few distinct numbers occur, e.g.               {41, 41, 41, 1009, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 41, 1009, 41, 41, 41}      I want to extract the information of how many times in a row each number occurs. For the above list,               {{3,7},{1}}      I actually already have something that works, but it seems excessively complicated and amateurish. Any ideas to improve this?               (Take[#, All, {2}] // Flatten) & /@      Sort[       GatherBy[{#[[1]], Length[#]} & /@ Union@Split@INPUTLIST,        First],       First@First[#1] < First@First[#2] &]
