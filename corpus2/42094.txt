I am close to completion of a useful suite of tools for 2D game development (with mobile platforms in mind), for working with sprites and animations. Can anyone advise the best way to sell and promote my product (without investing capital). I am aware that there are lots of websites that can market and sell software to end consumers, but I need to target game developers specifically as middleware is completely meaningless to your average joe. So, aside from using PayPal on my website, are there any marketplaces for game middleware? How can I promote the application outside my website without spamming developer forums?
