Continuing my question in this link, I would like to be able to select just a portion of the following expression:               Cell[TextData[{       "test ",       StyleBox["2+3", "Input"]      }], "Text"]      I wish now to select the part `"2+3"`. I've been thinking to do that with Cases, and have tried the following pattern for selecting the `StyleBox["2+3", "Input"]`:               _StyleBox      but that didn't seem to work. Any help with this? Thanks again for all the help!
