I am wondering how to change the output format in _Mathematica_. For example, I have $x=\binom{3}{1}$ and $y=\binom{2}{5}$, and I want to find what linear combination of $x$ and $y$ produces $\binom{7}{11}$. What do I have to do to make _Mathematica_ display the output $x+2y$ ? I tried using `Solve`, but _Mathematica_ just returns the coefficients. I also tried to use the augmented matrix, but again _Mathematica_ still did not give me the output I want. P.S. I am working with a 16 by 16 matrix with 16 variables, so it's not very convenient to read off the coefficients for each variable.
