I wanted to know if there is a package which allows to compute representations of a group like the definition representation, adjoint and so on (for example the Pauli matrix for $SU(2)$ if I specify that I want the definition representation of $SU(2)$). Which allow also to compute the structure constants of a particular group and, given a set of matrix, to test if these matrix form a representation of a particular group.
