I would like to have a triangulare signal drive a ODE system, using SquareWave[]. Something seems to go wrong though during integration. `Uext'[t]` and `rate SquareWave[rate/(4 umax) t` evaluate to different graphs. What is the problem here? Thanks!                   rate = 0.06;         umax = 0.9;         sol2 = Flatten[         Evaluate[{Uext[t], Uext'[t], rate SquareWave[rate/(4 umax) t]} /.               NDSolve[               {                Uext'[t] == rate SquareWave[rate/(4 umax) t],                Uext[0] == -umax               },               {Uext}, {t, 0, 400}]]];         Show[          Plot[Evaluate[{sol2[[2]], sol2[[3]]}], {t, 0, 400}],          AspectRatio -> 1,          PlotRange -> Automatic,          Frame -> True,          ImageSize -> {500, 500}]
