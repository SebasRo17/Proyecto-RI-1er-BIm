How do I place the x and y values of the points I have found (maxandmindistance) above the point in a plot? Here is my code so far:               Distance[t_] := t*(t - 1)*(t - 1.5)^2*(t - 3)     Velocity[t_] := Simplify[Distance'[t]]     maxandmindistance = Solve[Velocity[t] == 0, t]     Show[Plot[Distance[t], {t, 0, 3}],       Graphics[{Red, PointSize[Large],         Point[{t, Distance[t]} /. maxandmindistance]}]]      This results in a function with dots along it. They are the maximum and minimum values for the function. The problem is that the coordinates (x,y values) are not shown.
