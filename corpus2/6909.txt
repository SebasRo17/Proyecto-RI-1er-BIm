This bit of code sets up a list with the first entry already in it -- `{{1,1}}`               Clear[x, y]     x = 1     y = 1     datalist=List[List[x, y]]      Here is a slider by which I can alter x and y by depressing the mouse.               Slider2D[{x, y}, {{0, 0}, {5, 8}, {1, 2}}]      But when I release the mouse button nothing happens of course, except that `{x,y}` are at some new value inside the slider. Suppose I have moved the slider to location {3,6}. When I release the mouse button, I want {3,6} to be appended to datalist so it now becomes {{1,1},{3,6}} When I am tired of adding data points I want to save datalist I want to make as few changes/additions to the above code as possible. Any ideas?
