I wrote a class to do something, but then realised that it wasn't needed, as I could optimize existing code to get the speed of execution I needed, rather than integrating the new class in with existing code (which would have been more complicated). However, I'm unsure if my current solution will be fast enough when I've written the rest of the program, so I'd like to keep the unused class around somewhere. I don't want to just keep it in the main version of the source code, as it would just be unnecessary clutter, but I think there must be a neater solution than putting it in its own file away from the rest of the project and coming back to it if I later need it. I'm new to using source control, so I'm not sure what to do there. Could I create a side branch with the class, and merge it into the main branch without later?
