I am maintaing several data process shell scripts which are full of if-else statements and for loops . I try to make the scritps tidy and easy to debug. When I read some suggestions about shell code best practice, it seems that is is not a best practice to have many if-else and for loop statements. So what should I do, to write a python or c++ script instead of those logical process?
