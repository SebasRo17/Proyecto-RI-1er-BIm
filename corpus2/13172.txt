I have a strong interest in creating and learning about highly scalable web sites and applications which deal with Big Data. For example, many world class web companies and startups such as Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc deal with massive amounts of data and their software engineers use tools such as Hadoop/MapReduce, Cassandra/memcache, and other algorithms and techniques and tools to make sense of this data. To me this is a very interesting and challenging area and much more invigorating than just creating yet another e-commerce or web portal for a commercial company. Naturally working at a typical software development firm won't get you experience with this level of massively distributed data processing opportunity, and very few if any people have access to cpu clusters to run Hadoop, DryadLinq, etc. I wanted to inquire if there are certain geographic areas in the countries which have companies dealing with such Big Data problems - Silicon Valley would be an obvious one, any others? Also, feel free to mention any non-obvious startups and companies which are dealing with such challenging problems. EDIT: Just read this recent article by Matt Welsh of Harvard on his (sabbatical) at Google and the scale of problems he's working on (he sounds clearly excited): Computing at scale, or, how Google has warped my brain EDIT: Found another new link on getting experience with large scale data at government institutions Tackling Large Scale Data in Government Thanks,
