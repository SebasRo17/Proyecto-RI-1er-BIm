I have a two lists $LHS$ and $RHS$, both of size $n$. I want to solve a system of inequalities of the form: $$LHS[1] \leq RHS[1]$$ $$LHS[2] \leq RHS[2]$$ $$LHS[3] \leq RHS[3]$$ $$\vdots$$ $$LHS[n] \leq RHS[n]$$ We assume that: Each $LHS[i]$ is a linear equation in $m$ variables, say: $\alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_{m}$ and each $RHS[i]$ is a linear equation in $m$ variables, say: $\beta_{1}, \dots, \beta_{m}$. We need to solve for $\alpha_{1}, \dots, \alpha_{m}$, $\beta_{1}, \dots, \beta_{m}$, which are positive integers. Take m=2. To solve a single inequality (for some $i$ between $1$ and $n$) I know that I need to enter: > Reduce[LHS[[i]]<=RHS[[i]],{[\alpha]0,[\alpha]1,[\beta]0,[\beta]1}] (I haven't put the constrains to make the code simpler) But, if I need to solve all the inequalities, **how do I input a list in 'Reduce'** ? Thanks a lot in advance.
