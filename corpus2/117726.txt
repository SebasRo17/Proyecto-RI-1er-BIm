I have a full time job as a senior software developer. It pays well but the work is unsatisfying for many reasons. I often daydream about going freelance but don't want to throw away a stable paycheck without dipping my toe in the freelancing water first. I have recently developed a commercial-grade application in my spare time so have a healthy respect for the kind of lifestyle having two jobs can lead to but the experience has also given me the confidence that I can pull it off, at least for a while. I joined eLance but was quickly disheartened by the number of bids at very low prices by well established studios and teams of programmers with good ratings. How can I compete with other freelancers if I am only willing to work evenings and weekends? I can prepare a solid portfolio which will certainly give me an advantage over 'sweatshops' in third world countries but I still struggle to see why anyone would employ me when they could get their project completed in less time by employing a full-time developer or a dedicated studio. Should I 'fail to mention' that I already have a full time job? This doesn't seem honest though, and I don't want freelance contractors phoning me while I'm at work. I'm willing to work for cheap at first. Contracting and travelling are out of the question. Where can I find part-time programming work from home?
