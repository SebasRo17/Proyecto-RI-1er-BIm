let us assume we have some data in the following form.               Table[data[[1,i,{1,2}]],{i,1,Length[data[[1]]]}]      This would give all $x-y$ pairs of the first file. What I want to do now is to multipliy this table with constant factors but different factors for $x$ and $y$. I found a solution for this with               MapThread[ Composition[Flatten, List], {xlist, #}] & /@ ylist      where `xlist` is                Table[data[[1,i,1]],{i,1,Length[data[[1]]]}]*c1      and `ylist` is                {Flatten[Table[data[[1,i,2]],{i,1,Length[data[[1]]]}]]}*c2      Is there a more comfortable way to do this? Thank you in adavance Sincerely * * * EDIT:                test= {{0.0015856, -1486.76}, {0.00157776, -1483.45}}      I need :                test2= {{1.5856, -148.676}, {1.57776, -148.345}}      So the $x$ values should be multiplied with $1000$ and the $y$ values multiplied with $0.1$ EDIT2: Transpose is exactly what I need, thank you very much
