My question is a _dual_ to this one. I use Workbench 2.0, but I am now interested in developing some Android Apps and Html projects. In order to do that, I need to install Android ADT and Aptana studio plugins into Eclipse. Questions:   * Since Workbench is based on Eclipse I wonder if I can install these plugins into WB.   * Is it possible and/or wiser to simply install a (newer) version of Eclipse in a parallel folder and install the plugins into this Eclipse? Would this interfere somehow with the existing Workbench? I realize this question is not strictly about Mathematica, but I believe it might be of some interest for many Workbench users, as they explore other languages.
