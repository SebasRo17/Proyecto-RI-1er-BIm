I think that it's safe for me to assume that many, if not most, programmers are quite enthusiastic about computers, and even electronics in general. Now, I realize that a programmer should first and foremost keep up with the **programming** world, which is a difficult task in and of itself: with new languages and methodologies making their way into the fray every year, there is never a shortage of interesting things to learn about and try out. Yet, the hardware world is also advancing very quickly, and is also highly interesting, I'd argue. I recall days when I would study the newest chipsets, CPUs, compare the popular (and not so popular) manufacturers, and read up on specs for my favorite graphics cards. However, since that time, I've stopped keeping up with the hardware that is being developed, and have instead focused my studies and attention on, well, programming. I still intend to focus myself on programming, by and large. But, my question is, are there efficient / effective methods or learning resources that would make it easier for a programmer to keep up with the latest hardware, if only in a minimal way?
