I'm using Eclipse and I will talk about it as an example but I am sure that this is the case in any other IDE. Eclipse has the `CTRL`-`Shift`-`F` command which automatically formats your code. Is it a good practice to use this kind of formatting? I'm asking in the context of a big project in which there may be many programmers working on the same files and all these are administrated by a CSV system. Thank you!
