The _Mathematica_ documentation say it is possible to estimate the Matrix condition number in norm 1, 2, Infinity. But the 2-Norm raise a message. This is an extract from reference documentation "tutorial/LinearAlgebraMatrixComputations" where I changed the expression to compute the 2-Norm. ![error](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yrps.png) ### UPDATE As requested, if you want to try by yourself and check the error on your system, simply type:               mat = {{1., 2.}, {3., 4.}};     LinearAlgebra`MatrixConditionNumber[mat, Norm -> 2]
