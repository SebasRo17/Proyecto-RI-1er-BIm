The following Maple code can simplify `abs(sin(x))` into `-sin(x)` given the condition `-3Pi/4 < x < -Pi/2`               simplify(abs(sin(x))) assuming -3*Pi < x, x < -5*Pi/2;      I tried what I thought would be the equivalent _Mathematica_ code:               FullSimplify[Abs[Sin[x]], Assumptions -> -3 Pi/4 < x < -Pi/2]       but _Mathematica_ does not give the answer I expected. Another related example. Starting with `Sqrt[1 + Sin[x]] + Sqrt[1 - Sin[x]]` and the condition `-2Pi < x < -3Pi/2`, I want to get `-2 Cos[x/2]`, Here are some of things I tried:               Sqrt[1 + Sin[x]] + Sqrt[1 - Sin[x]] /. Sqrt[x_] :> Sqrt[TrigFactor[x]]     Refine[%, Assumptions -> -2 Pi < x < -3 Pi/2]     FullSimplify[%, Assumptions -> -2 Pi < x < -3 Pi/2]
