Our company has started development of own systems "in-house". We already got couple of developers, who will be responsible for writing code in Ruby/RoR. We are currently discussing infrastructure, and I would like to ask: should we develop everything on local machines, then put it to test server and later to production, or develop everything on a development/test server, then publish it for testing and later to production? Just an update to the description above: under "local machines" I meant developers' desktops and this test/development server is a machine in our office.
