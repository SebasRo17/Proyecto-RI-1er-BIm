Let $p_n\\#\equiv\prod_{k=1}^{n}p_k$ (primorial):               p[n_] := Times @@ Prime[Range[n]]      then the multiplicative partitions of $p_{1,2,3,4}\\#$ are $$ \\{\\{2\\}\\},$$$$ \\{\\{6\\},\\{2,3\\}\\},$$$$ \\{\\{30\\},\\{2,15\\},\\{3,10\\},\\{5,6\\},\\{2,3,5\\}\\},$$$$ \\{\\{210\\},\\{2,105\\},\\{3,70\\},\\{5,42\\},\\{6,35\\},\\{7,30\\},\\{10,21\\},\\{14,15\\},\\{2,3,35\\},\\{2,5,21\\},\\{2,7,15\\},\\{3,5,14\\},\\{3,7,10\\},\\{5,6,7\\},\\{2,3,5,7\\}\\}$$ computed with               g[lst_, p_] :=      Module[{t, i, j}, Union[Flatten[Table[t = lst[[i]]; t[[j]] = p*t[[j]];     Sort[t], {i, Length[lst]}, {j, Length[lst[[i]]]}], 1],      Table[Sort[Append[lst[[i]], p]], {i, Length[lst]}]]];          z[n_] := Module[{i, j, p, e, lst = {{}}}, {p, e} =      Transpose[FactorInteger[n]];     Do[lst = g[lst, p[[i]]], {i, Length[p]}, {j, e[[i]]}]; lst];          Table[z[p[n]], {n, 1, 4}]      What is the best way to turn this into a symbolic function, so the output of the above becomes $$\\{\\{a\\}\\}$$$$ \\{\\{ab\\}\\},\\{\\{a,b\\}\\}$$$$ \\{\\{abc\\}\\},\\{\\{a,bc\\},\\{b,ac\\},\\{c,ab\\}\\},\\{\\{a,b,c\\}\\}$$$$ \\{\\{abcd\\},\\{a,bcd\\},\\{b,acd\\},\\{c,abd\\},\\{d,abc\\},\\{ab,cd\\},\\{ac,bd\\},\\{ad,bc\\}, \\{a,b,cd\\},\\{a,c,bd\\},\\{a,d,bc\\},\\{b,c,ad\\},\\{b,d,ac\\},\\{c,d,ab\\},\\{a,b,c,d\\}\\}$$ ? The primorial example above is given for combinatorial simplicity. I would ideally like the function to be applicable to any number, e.g.: $72$ ($2^3\cdot 3^2$) would be tackled as $a^3\cdot b^2$. Of course, it is possible to take this approach:               n = 4; ColumnForm[Map[FactorInteger[z[p[n]]][[#]] &, Range[Length[z[p[n]]]]]     /. 2 -> a /. 3 -> b /. 5 -> c /. 7 -> d]      ... etc., but I wondered whether there was a more direct route? _NB - This question is an extension ofthis one._ # Update Have got this far:               n = p[4];     m = ColumnForm[Map[FactorInteger[z[n]][[#]] &, Range[w[n]]]      /. 2 -> a /. 3 -> b /. 5 -> c /. 7 -> d];     ColumnForm[Table[Table[Map[m[[1, k]][[v]][[#]][[1]]^m[[1, k]][[v]][[#]][[2]] &,      Range[Length[m[[1, k]][[v]]]]], {v, 1, Length[m[[1, k]]]}], {k, 1, w[n]}]]      BTW, is there an easier way of doing               /. 2 -> a /. 3 -> b /. 5 -> c /. 7 -> d /. 11 -> e /. 13 -> f /.                          17 -> g /. 19 -> h /.      ...etc.?
