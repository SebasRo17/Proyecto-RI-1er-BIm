I'm fairly new to Mathematica. Suppose I have the following function:               f[x_Integer] := Module[{y, z, r},         y = 5;         z = 10;         r = x + y + z;         r     ];      and I would like to halt the execution after each of the statements `y = 5`, `z = 10` and `r = x + y + z`, and resume only after I press a key. (In other words, I'm looking for something like `Console.ReadLine()` in `C#` or `getline()` in `C++`.) Is there an easy way to do this in Mathematica? Thanks in advance for your help.
