I am in the process of finally rolling Mercurial as our version control system at work. This is a huge deal for everyone as, shockingly, they have never used a VCS. After months of putting the bug in management's ears, they finally saw the light and now realise how much better it is than working with a network of shared folders! In the process of rolling this out, I am thinking of different strategies to manage our stuff and I am leaning towards using Bitbucket as our "central" repository. The projects in Bitbucket will solely be private projects and everyone will push and pull from there. I am open to different suggestions, but has anyone got a similar setup? If so, what caveats have you encountered?
