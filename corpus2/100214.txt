I was just reviewing some code I wrote a while back, and can see that I have a couple of private methods that throw argumentnullexceptions and/or argumentexceptions if there are issues with the methods parameters. I guess my rationale is that helps future proof the application if someone attempts to "misuse" the method in future. However, given it is a private method and the people who are likely to call this method can see the associated comments and code, it is just unnecessary to throw this. It certainly doesn't hurt to have them, although it does add clutter. My feeling is that these exceptions are generally more useful on something like a API that is going to be exposed publically.
