Sometimes (rarely), it seems that creating a function that takes a decent amount of parameters is the best route. However, when I do, I feel like I'm often choosing the ordering of the parameters at random. I usually go by "order of importance", with the most important parameter first. Is there a better way to do this? Is there a "best practice" way of ordering parameters that enhances clarity?
