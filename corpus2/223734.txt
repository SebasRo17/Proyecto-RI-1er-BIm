I found it's really hard to divide the task of developing a website to a team of people. The problem is a website should have consistent looking and be integrated in users' view. The style and page template need to be shared by all parts. Most of the website is access restricted, the access control system is dependent of all modules. Some modules need data from other modules (you can never ask user the same question again). Although these modules may run independently. The test data have to be generated by other ones. With the increase of code, the website becomes harder and harder to test. Although we are maintaining a script to automate the deployment. But if anything goes wrong, a developer cannot solve the problem by himself, for he is not familiar with others' work. What makes things worse is the configuration. Server settings are highly machine dependent. Some functions need to schedule tasks, so there are some crontab configurations. Some modules need other daemons running in the backend. Some applications require URL rewriting. To test the website, we need to configure all dependencies of all modules on all machines. Is there any suggestion about how to test a website?
