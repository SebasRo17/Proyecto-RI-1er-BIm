I'd like to plot the function $f$ in this answer http://math.stackexchange.com/a/788818/66096 > Let $h(x) = \begin{cases} e^{ -\frac{1}{1 - (1-2x)^2}} & \mbox{ for } 0<x < > 1\\ 0 & \mbox{ otherwise} \end{cases}$ Then let $$g(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty > h(n^2(x-n))=\begin{cases}h(n^2(x-n))&\text{if }n\le x<n+1, n\in\mathbb > N\\0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ And let $f(x)=\int_0^xg(t)\,\mathrm dt$. I only know the basics of _Mathematica_ , so I've been trying to plot piecewise functions without success. Here is what I got               h[x_] = Piecewise[{{E^(-(1 - (1 - 2 x)^2)^(-1)), 0 < x < 1}, {0,          x > 1}, {0, x < 0}}]      But how do I deal with $g$ ? I could input partial sums with the series expression, but at the same time, I could save computations by just defining it piecewise.
