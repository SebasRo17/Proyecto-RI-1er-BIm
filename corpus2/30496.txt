I have a ContourPlot in which I have specified the contour-values myself as Contours->{0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}. I would like to get the corresponding contour-values to be shown in the color-bar in the Legend. How do I do this? To get the max and min values, I am using the code in the following post which defines the reportColorRange[...] function: ShowLegend values . Part of my question is answered by another post:   How can I label a ListDensityPlot with a color bar? , but probably this only works for a linear spacing of contours? An example code is below.               Needs["PlotLegends`"]     {plTest, colors, range} = reportColorRange[       ContourPlot[xv^2 + yv^2, {xv, 0, 1}, {yv, 0, 1},          Contours -> {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3}, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]];     LMin = range[[1]];  LMax = range[[2]];     ShowLegend[plTest, {ColorData["Rainbow"][1 - #1] &, 6,        ToString[Round[LMax, 0.01]], ToString[Round[LMin, 0.01]],        LegendPosition -> {0.6, 0}, BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 14}}]       I would like the 5 contour-values to appear in the Legend next to the "ticks" which are blank right now. I have left the max and min values shown right now, but I don't necessarily need them. It's sufficient (and probably better) to show only the contour values. Thanks. PS: This is also related to another post of mine: Mathematica 8: ContourPlot finding out max and min function values Sorry for the multiple posts, but I am still converging on what appearance I want for the plot and legend.
