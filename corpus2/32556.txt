When I request with Reduce, Mathematica returns:               In[13]:= N[Reduce[X^3-26X+1 == 0,X, Reals]]                                          Out[13]= X == -5.11814 || X == 0.0384637 || X == 5.07968      However, when I request with Solve, it returns three complex roots               In[15]:= N[Solve[X^3-26X+1 == 0,X]]                                                                                                              -16     Out[15]= {{X -> 5.07968 + 0. I}, {X -> 0.0384637 + 4.44089 10    I},                                  -16     {X -> -5.11814 - 4.44089 10    I}}      I think the different here is the Reals field. However, I'm confused about the correctness of result. Which one should I follow when I want to solve the equations. Thanks
