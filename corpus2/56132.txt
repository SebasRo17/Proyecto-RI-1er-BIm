I recently upgraded to Mathematica 10, very excited about the multiple undo function of course. However I very quickly noticed that if I specify a setting for `PlotMarkers` in the `ErrorListPlot` function, the error bars disappear. Even just setting `PlotMarkers->Automatic` makes the error bars disappear. This was not a problem in Mathematica 9, but appears to be a new 'feature'. Has anyone else noticed this since upgrading, and are there any possible fixes?
