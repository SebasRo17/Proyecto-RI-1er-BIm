Consider a simple code to form a SparseArray:               Q = 5;     a = Table[i, {i, Q}];     SparseArray[{{j_} /; j > 2 -> a[[j]]}, {Q}]      > Part::pspec: Part specification j is neither a machine-sized integer nor a > list of machine-sized integers. >> What is wrong with the rule? It seems I can not address any matrix element without getting such a warning. Sorry for such a minor question.
