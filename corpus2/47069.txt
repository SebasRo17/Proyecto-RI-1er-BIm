Let's start with what I already found on the internet:               data = {{10, 4, 3, 0, 8, 8, 10, 8, 9, 10},              {2, 1, 2, 15, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 15},             {1, 4, 8, 1, 2, 8, 12, 10, 9, 15}};          ListLinePlot[Accumulate[data], Filling -> {1 -> {Axis, LightRed},          2 -> {{1}, LightOrange}, 3 -> {{2}, LightBlue}}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Orange, Blue}]      This one will produce a stacked graph like the one i want: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/23Wnu.png) but the data I have is not directly usable like in this example because accumulate wouldn't work unless I process data in some way. * * * Let's say the data i have is something like this:               data = {      { {1, 10}, {3, 94.94}, {5, 41.52}, {10, 15.25}, {100, 2.19} },      { {4, 2.35}, {8, 10.64}, {12, 90.28}, {36, 50.74} },      { {2, 11.55}, {10, 15.65}, {20, 41.81} },      { {1, 20.13}, {3, 57.44}, {5, 42.74}, {10, 3.59}, {40, 2.05}, {100, 2.05} },      { {4, 13.74}, {20, 65.49}, {40, 112.62}, {80, 10.42} }};      If plot all together with a `ListLinePlot`, this is what I will get:               ListLinePlot[Table[data[[i]], {i, 1, Length[data] - 1}], Filling -> Axis]      Where each line is the junction of points for each set.. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4D477.png) I would like to obtain a stacked graph exactly with these lines. Could you help me to achieve this result? Best Regards PS: if possible would be cool see both cases where the values outside domains gives 0 contribute or the case were we continue using the same angular coefficient for the borders like in this image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z5S8K.png) With the functions gets anyways = 0 if value < 0 :)
