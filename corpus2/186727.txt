I recently started at a new company, with a handful of programmers. Its a medium sized company, with around 70 employees, but IT only has 9-10, and there are 3 "programmers" beside myself. However, these guys have very limited experience and are doing a lot of stuff really terribly. For example, one of our projects is a PHP website. The majority of the code is stored in a 20,000 line PHP controller, with ~6000 lines of JavaScript embedded in the PHP. I keep making small suggestions here and there but nobody has been listening, everyone says they are too busy to implement my suggestions. The thing is, they shouldn't be that busy, and wouldn't be if things were done right. They spend most of their time fixing things that keep breaking. If each project was built correctly, I could do it all myself. What approach should I take to convince these guys or the manager that things need to change, and that changing things will save a bunch of time? Should I skip trying to convince my coworkers and go straight to the manager, with a business-y proposal on how the company will save a bunch of money if they start doing things correct?
