Is there are any command to expand quaternion multiplication as below STEP by STEP.   Below is equation from my text.   I'm self learner and for some reason I can't wrap my head around quaternion multiplication.   I really need to see step by step workout.   I remember seeing step by step workout in wolframalpha but that's for calculus integration.   Just wondering if the same can be done in mathematica.   $$ \begin{equation} \begin{split} w =& qvq^* \\\ =& (q_0+\vec{q})(0+\vec{v})(q_0-\vec{q}) \\\ =&(2q_0^2-1)\vec{v}+2(\vec{q}\cdot\vec{v})\vec{q} + 2q_0(\vec{q}\times\vec{v}) \end{split} \end{equation} $$
