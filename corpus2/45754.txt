I think I heard on a previous StackOverflow podcast that COBOL was used as the programming language for traffic lights (or something like that), so this got me interested. I did a quick Google search and found this little article: > Today, Cobol is everywhere, yet largely unheard of by millions of people who > interact with it daily when using the ATM, stopping at traffic lights or > buying a product online. > > The statistics on Cobol attest to its huge influence on the business world: > There are over 220 billion lines of Cobol in existence, a figure which > equates to about 80 per cent of the worldâ€™s actively used code. **There over > a million Cobol programmers in the world.** There are 200 times as many > Cobol transactions that take place each day than Google searches. I didn't really trust the source seeing as how it's on some random PHPBB forum. So how accurate are these figures? Are there really **220 billion** lines of COBOL? I assume a few people/companies still use COBOL, _but how many?_
