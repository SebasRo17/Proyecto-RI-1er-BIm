Suppose there are two positions:   1. IT in investment bank: developer for the infrastructure or the platform   2. a famous IT company: embedded developer, linux As far as I understand, since in the investment bank not everyone will have the chance to work for the core trading system, most people just do the same job as they do in a normal IT company.
