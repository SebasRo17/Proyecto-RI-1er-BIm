Is it advisable to create multiple classes within a .cs file or should each .cs file have an individual class? For example:               public class Items     {         public class Animal         {         }              public class Person         {         }              public class Object         {         }     }      Dodging the fact for a minute that this is a poor example of good architecture, is having more than a single class in a .cs file a code smell?
