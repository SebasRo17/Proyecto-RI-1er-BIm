I started an open source project in 2010 and the project is gaining some visibility. We are now 2 active committers and we hope to engage more contributors in the future. We received today the second offer to "partner" with a company. This time is a hosting company that wants us to offer a hosting plan with a automatic installation of the software and receive a affiliate payout for each (the company is well-known). The question is: **Is there a way we can share the revenue within the project contributors?** Our main goal for now is to have more contributors and make better software, not profitability... PS: We are also in the process to assign the project to the Outercurve Foundation.
