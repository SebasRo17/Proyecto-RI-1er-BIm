The code below               BanchoffChmutov[n_] := ContourPlot3D[ ChebyshevT[n,x]+ChebyshevT[n,y]+ChebyshevT[n,z], {x,-1.3,1.3},{y,-1.3,1.3},{z,-1.3,1.3}, Contours->0.02, AspectRatio->Automatic, Boxed->False, Axes->{False,False,False}, BoxRatios->Automatic, PlotRangePadding->None, PlotPoints->100, ViewPoint->{-2,3,3}];     pic = BanchoffChmutov[10]     Export["C:\\Z10.png", pic, ImageResolution->100, ImageSize->1000, Background->None];      runs fine when 10 is replaced by any of 1,...,9, but it produces an error for 10 and up: > No more memory available. Mathematica kernel has shut down. Try quitting > other applications and then retry. I've stopped almost all other applications, but still it doesn't produce an image. How can I tell my Mathematica to increase the amount of memory associated to this computation, and also, to calculate longer if necessary, and not just quit. I have 3.24GM of RAM and 3GHz of CPU.
