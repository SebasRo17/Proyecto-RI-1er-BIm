I'm struggling to phrase this question correctly, hence the poor title. Basically I have a simple Chrome extension that I am developing for work. It is in use at the moment and as I am using it regularly I am constantly thinking of improvements or extra features it could have. My file structure is like this (I'm on a mac) `~/Sites/Chrome_extensions/{my employers name}/CharCounter/` `CharCounter/` contains all the files needed for the Chrome extension. Whenever I am happy with a new version of my extension I pack it in Chrome and the resulting .crx file is called `CharCounter_{version number}.crx` So for example, the most recent is called `CharCounter_1.3.3.crx`. However, the development folder currently always has the same name. If I want to roll back and continue developing a previous version I can't. I have decided to start using git however I'm unsure how to tackle my version control. Should I set up my git repository in `~/Sites/Chrome_extensions/{my employers name}` then when I decide I am making a big enough change to the extension to warrant a new version number I duplicate the CharCounter folder and add `_{new version number}` to it? Thereby having several CharCounter folders each with a different version number appending to them. or should I set it up in `~Sites/Chrome_extensions/{my employers name}/CharCounter/` and never duplicate the CharCounter folder but just make a new commit every time I make a new version? How do you tackle version control? Does using git do away with having to keep multiple versions (current and legacy) of your code in folders called `folder_version_X.Y.Z` or is that still a good idea?
