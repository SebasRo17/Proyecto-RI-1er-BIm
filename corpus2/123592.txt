I am a Java/J2EE/Oracle PL-SQL developer for the past 5 years and have written the SCJP and SCWCD certification exams. But that was long ago. I now plan to get certified, but not sure which track to choose. There is SCBCD, SCEA etc., but I don't find them much useful. Which are the reputed and useful certifications that will help me learn as well as will give my resume a boost (I stress on the former one a bit more than the latter one). I don't mind venturing into new technologies. Thanks for your help.
