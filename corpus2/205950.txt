Recently I have started using a new(to me) paradigm for web services. I use the controller to accept JSON strings sent over POST, process it and return JSON strings. GET, PUT, DELETE and other methods throw HTTP 405. This pattern is proving to be very efficient from the point of view of asynchronous web frameworks (vert.x and play to be particular), as well as from development effort point of view. What I am confused about is that this neither seems to be SOAP nor REST. I don't think it is even JSON-RPC, since I am using my own headers like: Request:               {       'requestId':<generated req Id>,       'token':<previously authenticated token>,       'action':<controller defined action>,       'parameters':[         <array of parameters>       ]          }      Response:               {       'result':'success/fail',       'payload':{          <payload>        }     }      EDIT: There is only one endpoint URL, something like https://my.domain.com/api Can anyone give any ideas about what this paradigm can be classified as?
