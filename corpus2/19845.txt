Over the years I have developed several style based techniques which I use to keep my from make Error `if(const == lvalue)` rather then `if(lvalue == const)` since the first can't fall victim to the classic accidental assignment goof. I recently worked on a project with very unusual style standards and I found that I had much greater difficulty reading code. Has anyone seen any statistics on a particular coding style and its defect levels or have any experience with changing style alone to improve defect rates.
