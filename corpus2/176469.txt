Our company's main application is a desktop program that is used at warehouses and written in C# and Windows Presentation Forms. The next thing we want to be able to do is track when customers open up the application and when it is being used. The reason for this is so we can charge them per month, based on if they are/arn't using the application. My boss is having me research different ways to "license" the product under these requirements. Not having any experience doing this, a few things come to mind. I could create a web application that runs on a server, and every time the desktop application is opened and the user logs in, the application connects to the server and marks a database with the DateTime. Or is there licensing software that I can use to accomplish this? Just looking for tips/advice from people who have experience with this type of stuff.
