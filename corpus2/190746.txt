I find myself writing (hopefully) helpful comments in code (C++) documentation of the type:               The reason we are doing this is...      The reason I use "we" instead of "I" is because I do a lot of academic writing where "we" is often preferred. So here's the question. Is there a good reason to prefer one over the other in documenting code:   1. **Use "We":** The reason we are doing this is...   2. **Use "I":** The reason I am doing this is...   3. **Use my name:** The reason `[my name]` did this is...   4. **Passive voice:** The reason this was done is...   5. **Neither:** Do this because... I choose #1 because I'm used to writing that way, but documentation is not for the writer, it's for the reader, so I'm wondering if adding the developer name is helpful or if that just adds yet another thing that needs to be changed when maintaining the code.
