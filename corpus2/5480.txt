How does mathematica evaluate the following expression to zero:               -a ** (b ** c - c ** b) + b ** (a ** c - c ** a) -       c ** (a ** b - b ** a) + (a ** b - b ** a) **        c - (a ** c - c ** a) ** b + (b ** c - c ** b) ** a      In the reference of the non commutative multiplication `**` is stated that it is assumed to be associative and consequently the expression should be equal to zero. However just applying `Simplify[]` doesn't work for me.
