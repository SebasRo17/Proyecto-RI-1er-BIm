I'm looking to prepare for a job interview and I wanted to go over some good Object Oriented Design (OOD) questions. Here are some of the OOD concepts that should give a good starting point:   1. inheritance    2. multiple inheritance    3. encapsulation    4. abstraction   5. composition    6. polymorphism    7. overriding polymorphism Would you please suggest any other OOD question(s)/topics that should be reviewed?
