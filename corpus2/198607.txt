Basically, I'm trying to understand why layered and tiered are that different, and why they don't translate easily to each other. I understand that layered could be 3 separate class files for UI, BL and DAL. Whereas tiered can be a Project for the UI, which links to a BL project which links to a DAL like entity framework, and then a database. So why are/aren't they easily translatable? Hope that makes sense, Thanks.
