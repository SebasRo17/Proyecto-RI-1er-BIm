I do some volunteer work with a non-profit organization on the side occasionally. My main area of expertise is ASP.NET, C#, and SQL. They currently rely heavily on an Access database for their day to day operations. One of their technology guys has been looking into Sharepoint as a migration point for their Access database, to better support multiple locations. I am, regrettably, mostly unfamiliar with Sharepoint. Though, what I have heard does not seem to promote Sharepoint's use as a database. The base of my question is, what are the challenges of migrating or even making the two systems coexist? And is it even a good idea?
