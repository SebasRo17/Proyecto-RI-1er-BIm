Firstly I am sorry I do not fully understand about licensing. Thus I want to ask here for my curiosity about licensing things. Here is the case. I build a WordPress theme that using underscores.me as its starter theme. It has GPL v2 license. And then I build the theme using Twitter Bootstrap. It has Apache v2 license. I have been searching about both licenses. I found that Apache v2 is only compatible with GPL v3, not GPL v2. What license can put to my code? Apache? GPl? Or I just can not release it because of Apache v2 and GPL 2 are incompatible? Finally, does it matter whether or not I modify the code?
