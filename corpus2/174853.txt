I am in charge of selecting a new software development intern for a company that I work with. I wanted to throw a little 'quiz' at the applicants before moving forth with interviews so as to weed out the group a little bit to find some people that can demonstrate some skill. I put together the following quiz to send to applicants, it focuses only on PHP, but that is because that is what about 95% of the work will be done in. I'm hoping to get some feedback on   A. if it's a good idea to send this to applicants?   B. if it can be improved upon?               # 1. FizzBuzz     # Write a small application that does the following:     #   Counts from 1 to 100     #   For multiples of 3 output "Fizz"     #   For multiples of 5 output "Buzz"     #   For multiples of 3 and 5 output "FizzBuzz"     #   For numbers that are not multiples of 3 nor 5 output the number.          <?php                    ?>          # 2. Arrays     # Create a multi-dimensional array that contains     # keys for 'id', 'lot', 'car_model', 'color', 'price'.     # Insert three sets of data into the array.          <?php                    ?>          # 3. Comparisons     # Without executing the code, tell if the expressions     # below will return true or false.          <?php              if ((strpos("a","abcdefg")) == TRUE) echo "True";         else echo "False";         //True or False?              if ((012 / 4) == 3) echo "True";         else echo "False";         //True or False?              if (strcasecmp("abc","ABC") == 0) echo "True";         else echo "False";         //True or False?          ?>          # 4. Bug Checking     # The code below is flawed. Fix it so that the code     # runs properly without producing any Errors, Warnings     # or Notices, and returns the proper value.          <?php              //Determine how many parts are needed to create a 3D pyramid.         function find_3d_pyramid($rows) {             //Loop through each row.             for ($i = 0; $i < $rows; $i++) {                 $lastRow++;                 //Append the latest row to the running total.                 $total = $total + (pow($lastRow,3));             }             //Return the total.             return $total;         }              $i = 3;         echo "A pyramid consisting of $i rows will have a total of ".find_3d_pyramid($i)." pieces.";          ?>          # 5. Quick Examples     # Create a small example to complete the task     # for each of the following problems.     #   Create an md5 hash of "Hello World";     #   Replace all occurances of "_" with "-" in the string "Welcome_to_the_universe."     #   Get the current date and time, in the following format, YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS AM/PM     #   Find the sum, average, and median of the following set of numbers. 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10.     #   Randomly roll a six-sided die 5 times. Store the 5 rolls into an array.          <?php                    ?>
