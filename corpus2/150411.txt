I am just beginning to learn Functional programming (FP). I come from a OOP world, where everything are objects, and most of them are mutable. I have a hard time wrapping around the concept that functions don't have side effects. If something is not mutable, how are common things objects like Employee or Person represented in FP. Can FP be used to create a full fledged enterprise application?
