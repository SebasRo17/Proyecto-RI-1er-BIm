Clear[f]     f[n_, k_: n] :={n, k}     f[x]      > {x,n} Actually I would like to get: > {x,x} The following is one wrong definition, I'm showing that I need the argument `n` not a global variable `n` but the same to the first argument `n_`.               (*Clear[f]     f[n_,k_: n_]:={n,k}     f[x]*)      If only one argument passed to `f`, then the second argument is the same to the first argument. So, how could I adjust the definition of `f`? Maybe something like `Default`? I think Kuba's answer give one example to do this. But how to define `f` only once to get the same effect? * * * Chris Degnen's answer is one bad news. I've tried this               Clear[f] f[n0_, k0_: 5] := Module[{n = n0, k = k0}, If[k == 5, {n, k = n0},{n, k}]]     f[x]      > {x,x} Good thing is it works well for numerical values.               f[x, 10]      > {x,10} Bad thing is it works badly for `y`               f[x, y]      > If[y==5,{n$37693,k$37693=x},{n$37693,k$37693}]
