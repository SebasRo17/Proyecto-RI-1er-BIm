I would like to explore programming in dynamic languages, and I found that Groovy would be really easy to learn because it is heavily based on Java. won't I miss anything important regarding dynamic languages proggramming if i take Groovy path instead of say Ruby or Python? I don't intend to program in dynamic language too much, it is mostly for learning purposes. thank you for help.
