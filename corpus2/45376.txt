Say I'd like to pick substrings from some string such that these substrings have the pattern `@@@q@@@`, where `@` is used here as a stand-in for a 'wildcard' character (i.e. any character) and `q` is just an example of a specific character that can be specified as desired. The kind of lame solution might be as follows:               substringList = StringTake[testString, # + {-3, 3} & /@ StringPosition[testString, "q"]];      This, of course, runs into trouble when `q` appears near one of the two ends of `testString`. What's the correct way to do this?
