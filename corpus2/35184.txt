I have a calculation               expr111 = cs[giso, xiso, 1, 1, 1]      that gives the result > >     -((k x)/(2 (1 + 1/4 k (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)))) >   I also have two other expressions:               fx = -((k rho^2 x)/(1 + 1/4 k (x^2 + y^2 + z^2))^3)     ff = rho^2/(1 + 1/4 k (x^2 + y^2 + z^2))^2      Pretty obviously `expr111 == fx/(2 ff)`. How do I get _Mathematica_ to make this substitution?
