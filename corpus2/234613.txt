What would be the best design pattern for this problem: I have an Object A. Object A can either be registered or deleted from the database depending on the user request. Data validation is performed before registration or deletion of the object. There are a set of rules to be checked before the object can be registered and another set of rules for deletion. Some of these rules are common for both operations. So far, I think the Chain of Responsibility design pattern fits the most but I'm having trouble implementing it.
