I have to build an application where the requirement is that my clients will send data from their Android device and I have to save that data to a database. I have done the part of coding that inserts data from Android emulator to my XAMPP database on localhost, now I have to implement the real thing. How can I connect the devices where my application will be installed to the XAMPP database I have created so that the data they send can be inserted into it?
