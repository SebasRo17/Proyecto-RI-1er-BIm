I am contemplating paying a software consulting firm to provide my company with some enhancements to a piece of software that is licensed under the Eclipse Public License (EPL). I'm wondering what rights we will have to what they produce, and whether they can tie us to paying them royalties forever.   * What rights we will have to modify and redistribute what they provide us?   * Can they insist on a royalty payment when we distribute it to 3rd parties? Before I start negotiating, I need to understand what we're getting - and ideally get this sort of thing explicitly agreed in the contract. I know I should consult a lawyer.
