I'm wondering if there is a tool that can generate a dependency graph between C language object files and then analyze how to turn that graph into a DAG by modifying code that creates cycles, moving it to other source files. I've drawn a dependency graph by hand and I could probably make one by using makedepend or something similar, but the moving of functions also has to be done by hand. Sorry if that's vague, but that's about the best I can describe it right now.
