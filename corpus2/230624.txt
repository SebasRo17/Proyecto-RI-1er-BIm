I was naughty... Too much "cowboy coding," not enough committing. Now, here I am with an enormous commit. Yes, I should have been committing all along, but it's too late now. What is better?   1. Do one very large commit listing all the things I changed   2. Try to break it into smaller commits that likely won't compile, as files have multiple fixes, changes, additional method names, etc.   3. Try to do partial reversions of files just for appropriate commits, then put the new changes back. Note: as of right now I am the only programmer working on this project; the only person who will look at any of these commit comments is me, at least until we hire more programmers. **By the way:** I am using SVN and Subclipse. I did create a new branch before doing any of these changes. **More information** : I asked a separate question related to how I got into this situation in the first place: How to prepare for rewriting an application's glue
