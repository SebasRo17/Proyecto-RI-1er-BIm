I try to find a way to manipulate a plot I created before. (for full code take the fuction               x[t_]:=Sin[2t]      ) Let's say I have a plot:               plot1 = Plot[x[t], {t, 0, 10},        PlotStyle -> Purple,        ImagePadding -> 55,        Frame -> {True, True, True, False},        FrameStyle -> {Automatic, Purple, Automatic, Automatic},        FrameLabel -> {None, "Signal", None, None},        LabelStyle -> {16},        ImageSize -> 600        ];      And later I want to use the same plot with a point on the line. The complete code would be:               plot1 = Plot[x[t], {t, 0, 10},        PlotStyle -> Purple,        ImagePadding -> 55,        Frame -> {True, True, True, False},        FrameStyle -> {Automatic, Purple, Automatic, Automatic},        FrameLabel -> {None, "Signal", None, None},        LabelStyle -> {16},        ImageSize -> 600,        Epilog -> {Directive[{Purple}],PointSize -> Large,Point[{2,        x[2]}]}        ];      But is there another way? Something like               SetOptions[plot1,Epilog -> {Directive[{Purple}], PointSize -> Large,        Point[{2, x[2]}]}]      And what if I want to use this plot the second time in a Manipulate[] environment?               Manipulate[plot1,{dt,0,10}]      Till now I couldn't find a way to do this.
