![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JFVw5.png) What I want to do is to find a circle which is tanget to the three big ones. I tried the code below:                   findSmallCircle[c1_Circle, c2_Circle, c3_Circle] :=      But how do I get the center point and radius of each circle c1, c2, c3, and if this cannot be done, what else can I try? Excuse me if this is a silly question -- I am new to _Mathematica_
