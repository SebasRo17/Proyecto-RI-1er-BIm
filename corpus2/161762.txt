(Written against GPLv2.) It is always said that GPL does not prohibit selling the software, as long as its source code is provided under the same license (GPL). Now, I do not understand how it is consistent with Section 2b: > You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in > part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be > **licensed as a whole at no charge** to all third parties under the terms of > this License. I don't get it. Does not this clause prohibit selling the software? If not, then what exactly does it trying to say? **EDIT:** Following the answers below, I wish to note that answering a question "everyone says that GPL says A but this part of GPL says B, how is it?" with "everyone says A so GPL must mean A" is not an answer.
