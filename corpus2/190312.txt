Does `readLine()` Java function used with `BufferedReader` cause one disk I/O per call? If yes, is there any way to read specific number of lines, say n, from a text file causing only one disk I/O? Here's the code:               String file;     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader (new FileReader (file));     int n = 10;     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)     {         String line = br.readLine ();         /* Do something */     }
