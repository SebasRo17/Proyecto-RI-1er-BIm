We've introduced a code review process within our organisation and it seems to be working well. However, I would like to be able to measure the effectiveness of the process over time, i.e. are we not finding bugs because the code is clean or are people just not picking up on bugs? Currently, we don't have an effective fully-automated test process. We primarily employ manual testing, so we can't rely on defects found at this stage to ensure that the code review process is working. Has anyone come across this issue before or has any thoughts on what works well in measuring code reviews?
