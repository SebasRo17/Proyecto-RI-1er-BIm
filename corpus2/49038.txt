In a matrix, there are some non-zero elements same as: aA= ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KN0bZ.png) Also, there is a list such as:               list = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, ii, jj, kk};      I want to access to elements of the list which are not in the matrix. (I mean: 'c','d','g','jj') I use Complement to this work:               Complement[aA, list]      But Complement doesn't work.
