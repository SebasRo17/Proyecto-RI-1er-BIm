> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  ListPlot with each point a different color and a legend bar I want to color the points in a list plot using a function of the (x,y) values. I tried this (example with random data):               ListPlot[RandomReal[1, {100, 2}],      PlotStyle -> Thick,      Joined -> False,      ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y}, Hue[(x + y)/2]]      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CUxbH.png) But, apparently, `ColorFunction` requires the data to be joined.               ListPlot[RandomReal[1, {100, 2}],      PlotStyle -> Thick,      Joined -> True,      ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y}, Hue[(x + y)/2]]      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1SVnh.png) That's a big ugly mess that I don't want. How can I get the points colored without joining them, am I missing something simple here?
