For the following initial value problem               BC[b_]:=x[0]==b;     eq[b_]:=NDSolve[{equation==0, BC[b]}, x, {t,0,1000}];     body[t_,b_]:= x[t]/.eq[b];      one could define the derivative of `body` with regard to `t` as               Dbody[t_,b_]:=x'[t]/.eq[b];      However I'm trying to find a way to define this for derivatives of arbitrary order with regard to `t`, and make the definition of `Dbody` redundant. Simple invocations of `'`, `D` and `Derivative` failed; for example:               Derivative[1][body][1,1]      returns               body'[1,1]
