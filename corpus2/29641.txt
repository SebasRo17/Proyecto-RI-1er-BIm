I am trying to convert a bunch of text files into structured XML files. Using string expressions I have extracted data, so I have:               title={"https://www.ometz.ca/event/abiletes-dentrevue-1-678/?langID=1"};`     date={2011,7,14,13,22,22.`};`     content=": text/html; charset=UTF-8 Ometz A community of services for life Employment Job Seekers Job Listings Job Seeker Registration Career Counselling Employers Cocktails & Conversation Candidate Profiles Employers - Submit a Job Posting ProMontreal Entrepreneurs Fund ProMontreal Entrepreneurs Mentors Calendar You & Yours Community Assistance Counselling Services Administered Funds Orthodox Community We";`      So far I have done the following to generate XML objects, for title, date, and content in turn. It is a bit messy but seems to work.               a = ExportString[       XMLElement[        "title", {}, {StringReplace[          ToString[title], {"{" -> "", "}" -> ""}]}], "XML"]          b = ExportString[       XMLElement[        "date", {}, {StringReplace[          ToString[date], {"{" -> "", "}" -> ""}]}], "XML"]          c = ExportString[XMLElement["body", {}, {content}], "XML"];      The output is thus:               <title>https://www.ometz.ca/event/abiletes-dentrevue-1-678/?langID=1</title>     <date>2011, 7, 14, 13, 22, 22.</date>     <body>: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Ometz A community of services for life Employment Job     Seekers Job Listings Job Seeker Registration Career Counselling Employers Cocktails &amp;     Conversation Candidate Profiles Employers - Submit a Job Posting ProMontreal Entrepreneurs     Fund ProMontreal Entrepreneurs Mentors Calendar You &amp; Yours Community Assistance     Counselling Services Administered Funds Orthodox Community We</body>      So far so good, but I need to get it exported to an XML file, say `text.xml`. For some reason I'm hitting a wall in how to get this working, despite reading docs & some supplementary material. How would you do this? (also, any advice on the above code is appreciated)
