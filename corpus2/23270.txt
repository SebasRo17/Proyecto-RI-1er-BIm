I'm a PHP/Python programmer learning Java and C#(.NET). My main OS is windows 7 but I've used Linux and currently dual-booting with Ubuntu. My Linux knowledge however, is pretty limited. I can work with the command line on simple tasks but that's pretty much it. I don't do any shell scripting, don't know very well the most important commands, nor the system in general. My interests are web development, mobile apps and maybe some embedded stuff in the future. Should I get myself familiarized more with Linux ? Even if at the moment I'm not that interested in it? Is it a must for future job positions considering my field of interest? Thank you.
