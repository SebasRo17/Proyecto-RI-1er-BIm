I'd like to know if some of the major programming languages can absolutely not be used to create some very specific types of software. By major programming language I mean the likes of C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Python. By "cannot be developed" I mean cannot be developed or it is unrealistic to do it due to performance, difficulty of implementation, etc. I've always thought that any programming language could be used to solve any problem but lately I've been thinking that some languages are unsuitable for some projects. If you can provide examples of such applications, it would be appreciated. Thanks.
