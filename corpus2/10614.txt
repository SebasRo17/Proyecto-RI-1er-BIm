I see this problem quite often. I like a certain value proposition of an open- source project. I try out the basic tutorials. Great. It works! But if I move on to more complex problems, I spend hours of doing research, debugging, frustrations, etc. What are your strategies to keep motivation in open-source going? What is the reward of open-source after success of basic tutorials? What "success" of open-source did you experience?
