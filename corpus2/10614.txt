I need to find the eigenvalues of a $1500\times1500$ real symmetric matrix given by $A_{i,i+1}= A_{i+1,i}=-1$ and also $A_{1,N=1500}=-1$ (this is because of a periodic boundary condition used) and all other off-diagonal elements are zero. Also the diagonal elements are non zero, unequal real numbers. According to what you said my matrix is sparse and numeric. How do I do this in _Mathematica_?
