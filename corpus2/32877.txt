I have a series of simulation results and I would like to demonstrate how the confidence interval for the mean and standard deviation decrease as the number of results increases. I have done this for the mean using the inbuilt MeanCI function as shown below (I've replaced my simulation results with random data).               Needs["HypothesisTesting`"]     data = Table[RandomReal[{-1, 1}], {i, 1, 100}];     movingData = Table[data[[1 ;; i]], {i, 2, Length[data]}];     meanCI = MeanCI[#, ConfidenceLevel -> .80] & /@ movingData;     ListPlot[Transpose[meanCI]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nrpjo.png) What I would like to do is create a similar chart showing how the standard deviation confidence interval decreases. There isn't a standard function for StandardDeviationCI but is there a way to use the tools inside the HypothesisTesting package to get a similar result?
