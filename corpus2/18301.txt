I am trying to solve the following differential equation-               k = NDSolve[{y'''[x] == -76*Sin[y[x]], y[0] == Pi/4, y'[0] == 0,         y[1.85] == 0}, y, {x, 0, 2}, AccuracyGoal -> 10,        PrecisionGoal -> 30]      I am getting a solution but when I plot a graph, it does not satisfy the boundary conditions. I am getting the following two errors- FindRoot::sszero: The step size in the search has become less than the tolerance prescribed by the PrecisionGoal option, but the function value is still greater than the tolerance prescribed by the AccuracyGoal option. >> **NDSolve::berr: There are significant errors {-0.239832,-0.0591905,-0.0015434} in the boundary value residuals. Returning the best solution found. >>** The funny thing is when I reduce the coefficient of `Sin[y[x]]` it works fine. Can anyone help me with this? Thanks,
