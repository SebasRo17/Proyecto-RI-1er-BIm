I'm trying to solve for `Te[w, Pprobe, t]` in a partial differential equation. What's surprising is that it manages to solve it when I don't put in any initial conditions. But when I put in `Te[w, Pprobe, 0] == 0.3` it doesn't work:               C1 = 10^-10;     C2 = 0.1*C1;     R = 50;     Tb = 0.1;     Geb = 5*10^-15;     Z0 = 50;     L[Te_] := 10^-9 + 10^-9*(Te - 0.1);     Zlcr[Te_, w_] := (1/R + 1/(I*L[Te]*w) + I*C1*w)^-1;     Zload[Te_, w_] := -I*w*C2 + Zlcr[Te, w];     Γ[Te_, w_] := (Zload[Te, w] - Z0)/(Zload[Te, w] + Z0);     y[Te_, w_] := (Abs[Γ[Te, w]])^2;     p[Te_, w_] := Abs[Γ[Te, w]]     Co = 10^-35;     Vol = 10^-21;     Cv = Co/Vol;     Te0 = 0.3;          pde =        Cv*D[Te[w, Pprobe, t], t] ==          -Geb (Te[w, Pprobe, t] - Tb) + (1 - y[Te[w, Pprobe, t], w])*Pprobe          soln =        Te[w, Pprobe, t] /.          First @ DSolve[{pde, Te[w, Pprobe, 0] == 0.3}, Te[w, Pprobe, t], {w, Pprobe, t}]
