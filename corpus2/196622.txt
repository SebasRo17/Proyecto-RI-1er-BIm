How to Read in a list of values store it in a queue and change the order of the inputs? For example, read in `abc123efgh45678` and display `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8` I know I can use queue to read in the values. But how do I assign `a` to go beside `1`, eg. `a1`?               queue <char> q ;          for (int j=0; j < input.size(); j++) {       q.push (input[j]);     }
