Is there any website, like SPOJ and Project Euler, with the test data files available for specific algorithms/data structures? I know it's a fun challenge to solve those problems on your own, but I am looking for test data files where the algorithm/data structure to use are explicitly mentioned. "Implement a linked list and do this and that with the data to confirm!", "Implement a hash tree and do this and that with the data to confirm!" etc.
