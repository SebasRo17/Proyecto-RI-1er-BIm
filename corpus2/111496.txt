JavaScript has obviously become pretty indispensable; however, I'm still new to it, and I've found it's hard to fight the feeling that it seems such a mess and I don't want to deal with it right now. I'm much further in my understanding of other languages than I am with JavaScript, because I can't seem to get a handle on this fear. I get a feeling that, when I'm writing JavaScript, I'm trying to paint a portrait of Weimaraner puppies. It usually helps me to keep a handful of the most important directives in mind that I can ask myself for each move I make. (To my mind, a handful is five or less.) Can you list five (or fewer) questions specific to JavaScript I should ask myself for each move I make, when I'm coding JavaScript? What would they be? Update: to clarify, I'm not asking for five things to keep in mind when learning JavaScript; I'm asking for five questions to always ask myself going forward, that everyone should alsways ask. High-level questions like: "Am I likely to repeat this somewhere else?" or "is this variable/function name specific enough (or too specific)" <== except these example questions are not peculiar to JavaScript. I'm looking for directives that are peculiar to JavaScript.
