Given a list of circles with its coordinates (x and y) that are moving every second in different direction (South-East, South-West, North-East and North- West), and the circle will change direction if it hits the wall sort of like bouncing, so how do we detect if any of them collide or overlap with each other ? I am not sure if we can use some data structures like a `Binary Search Tree` because since all the coordinates vary every seconds, so the tree will have to re-build accordingly. Or can we use Vertical Sweep Line Algorithm each time ? Any ideas on how to do this in a efficient way ?
