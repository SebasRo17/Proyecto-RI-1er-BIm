I want to shade the area between the formula               eqn=(a (Sqrt[a] (-40 + 37 a + 10 a^2 - 3 a^3) + (-1 + a)^2 (32 +        a) ArcTanh[Sqrt[a]]))/(2 (-Sqrt[a] (1 + a) + (-1 + a)^2 ArcTanh[      Sqrt[a]]))      and `-3/2`. To be clearer: `-3/2 < region to be shaded < eqn` I tried with:               Show[{{Plot[{eqn, -3/2}, {a, -2, 1.5}]},        Plot[{eqn, -3/2}, {a, -1.2, 1},         Filling -> {1 -> {-3/2, Automatic}}]}, PlotRange -> {-2, 4}]      but I don't get what I want: it shades also               eqn < region < -3/2      Any ideas? I am sorry but I don't understand how to link a figures, I hope I explained myself... Oh, I am using Mathematica 8.
