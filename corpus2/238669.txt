Given a set of images on a webpage, what's a good way to pick a compelling image that is also representative of the webpage? The use case is displaying an image along with a description of a URL to a page, after a user includes it in a status update. I've found some techniques to find the most interesting part of a single image. Example: http://berk.es/smartcropper/ So maybe I can use this notion of entropy to compare images in a set? I am programming in ruby, so a pure ruby solution is preferable, but am open to others.
