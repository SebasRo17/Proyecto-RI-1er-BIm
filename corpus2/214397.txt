I have a need to be able to provide a web-based service to upload large amounts of data that would come in as chunks as large as 10,000 lines of 950 byte records, which is 9.5 MB. I've gotten advice that I shouldn't use web services (aspx) because MS has deprecated this, and I've also been told that WCF services aren't designed to be used for this purpose either (although this seems odd). FWIW, I've tried both WS and WCF and have run into size issues, and even though some solutions claim to fix this, I've not found any settings in either case that enable me to upload anything larger than 4 MB. The question is, if not WS and also not WCF, what else is there? I am trying to replace a number of different applications that all use FTP to upload data to a mainframe accounting system, and so for this question, FTP is not the answer. Unless the answer is that I need to abandon a service-based solution and stick with FTP.
