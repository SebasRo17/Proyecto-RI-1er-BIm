I'm college grad, soon to be graduating. SO i have started my job search. So my question is for New Grad who is interested in QA (API Level testing in particular). What is level of knowledge in **JAVA** required? I'm not that great in Java but can rate myself 5/10. So do companies expect candidate to have extensive coding knowledge in java or just basic java Again if its just basic java, what concepts should i focus more on ? Thanks
