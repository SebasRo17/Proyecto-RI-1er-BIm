What would be a good MVC/OOP/GRASP/SOLID structure for a search/replace functionality. Methods: search/searchNext/replace/replaceAll. I'm interested only in the PHP arhitecture and how a professional developer would implement this in it's **OWN FRAMEWORK**. What names would you use for the classes? What subfolders would you used in your MODEL folder? How would you connect the MODELS/CONTROLLER? This is just a arhitecture question to understand better the principles of good OOP in practice. My current implementation is very simplistic using a service model:                /controller/SearchReplaceController.php      /models/services/SearchReplaceService.php      The problem with this is I know I'm breaking SRP in the service but I found this somehow acceptable. Also creating a service does not feel like the best solution for this.
