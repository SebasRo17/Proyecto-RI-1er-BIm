Is it possible to somehow use the expression that Mathematica has collected once the `Collect` command has been used? What I mean is, I have an expression like this (this is imaginary example)               (a[x,y]+b[x,y]+c[x,y]^2) z^5+a[x,y]^3 z^4+(b[x,y]+c[x,y]^4) z^3      That I got after I made `Collect[expression,z,Simplify]`. What I'd like to do is to have command that will, for instance, give me the term that goes along `z^5` (the `(a[x,y]+b[x,y]+c[x,y]^2)`)? I didn't find any examples of it, and `Collect` in help has no such examples. EDIT: Can this be done with the help of `Coefficient` command?
