I am developing a multipalyer web Application for Anti-Chess. It would be hosted on Google App Engine. I have a few questions: How do I get two different users who have opened the webapp on their browser to communicate moves with each other. P2P or through the server. If through the server, can I store some moves on it (specifically talking about GAE), to test bots later? How to implement this P2P/Server connection. As a developer I know jack about Networking. But I hav heard of things like Socket programming, HTTP request etc, what can/should I use. And where can I read up on that! If I don't go for GAE, would it cost me too much to get some server space and hosting capabilities? And people tell me that then deploying the application is tougher than on GAE. Is that so. Where can I read up on deploying the web Application on Servers. Where does the code for networking go? I will be using Django with python as the web framework, front-end would be HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Should I make a separate module for the networking methods and then introduce a method calls wherever needed in the game play? Someone suggested me on using Unity software for developing. Is it good, Does it make it simple to do work? Will it cover all the parts of the development, the front end and the back end and the deployment? Note: I am a first timer in web Application, I have coded games before, but always without GUI. And also with no multiplayer over the network capabilities!
