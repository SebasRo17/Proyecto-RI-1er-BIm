I want to draw a solid or partially transparent hemisphere above a partially transparent cuboid object in Graphics3D. However, I do not know how to do this s.t. only half the sphere is drawn. Here's what the object looks like with the full sphere:               SphereOpacity = 0.5;     CuboidOpacity = 0.5;     SphereColor = Blue;     CuboidColor = Orange;     Graphics3D[{SphereColor, Opacity[SphereOpacity], Sphere[{0, 0, 0.5}, 0.5],                  CuboidColor, Opacity[CuboidOpacity], Cuboid[{-5, -5, 0}, {5, 5, 0.5}]},                  Boxed -> False     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3HWhX.png) How might I proceed to "remove" the bottom half the sphere embedded in the cuboid primitive? In general, is there a way to not render/draw parts of a graphics primitive conditioned intersection with another primitive?
