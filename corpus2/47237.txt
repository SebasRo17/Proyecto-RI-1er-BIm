I am trying to make a density plot to show the data that can found here. I tried with GNUplot previously. The result of GNUplot density plot for a rectangular set of data. I am able to do this only for a square (n x n) data set of the type:               x_1, y_1, z_1     ...     x_n, y_n, z_n      where n is the number of lines. The file that I post here is different. It is more similar to the one in the example from `ListLinePlot` page, which shows how to make a density plot for a spherical distribution of numbers. Now the question is: Can I make the density plot of this data set with `listdensityplot` in _Mathematica_? The 2D map of the x-y is like that ![2D map](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RA62g.png) and the ![3D map](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b15Rw.png). As You can see all the points are in particular regions of the plot. So I expect that the density map works only in this part of the space (something simliar to this link Spreading colors in ListDensityPlot)
