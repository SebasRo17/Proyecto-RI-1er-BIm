Over the last couple of months I have been diving into coding standard IfSQ. As a part of this IfSQ standard, a rule is to not use `Magic Numbers`. While I don't have a problem with building this rule into checks as FxCop or StyleCop, I am confused as to what actually IS a Magic Number. According to Wikipedia there are 3 explanations of magic numbers:   1. A constant numerical or text value used to identify a file format or protocol;   2. Distinctive unique values that are unlikely to be mistaken for other meanings (e.g., Globally Unique Identifiers);   3. **Unique values with unexplained meaning or multiple occurrences which could (preferably) be replaced with named constants.** I am focussing on the third meaning. But this is also where I am stuck. Seeing as I am trying to build this in a FxCop rule; the check has to be automated. But what am I supposed flag as magic number? The IfSQ standard explains the following as magic numbers: `Numeric literals (other than 0 or 1) have been embedded directly into the source code. For example "34" or "86400".` But this doesn't sound good to me at all. This would mean I'd have to flag every single occurence of a number other than 0 and 1. Numbers like 24 (hours), 60 (minutes) and 100 (percentage) are, in their correct context, no magic numbers; in my eyes that is. Because this is will be an automated check, looking from things in a contextual way isn't really possible. Based on this I have the following questions:   1. How should I define a magic number?   2. Is it possible to define magic numbers without context?   3. Should I skip certain statements when checking for magic numbers?
