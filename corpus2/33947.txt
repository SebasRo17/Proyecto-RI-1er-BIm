I have this graphed:               ParametricPlot[{2.4*Cos[t] + 1.6*Cos[3 t/2], 2.4*Sin[t] - 1.6 Sin[3 t/2]}, {t, 0, 4*Pi}]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vNGDI.png) It is a star, and the lines cross each other twice in the third quadrant. I need to find the t-values at those points. I have tried a variety of methods but none of them seem to be working. I have approximate $(x,y)$ coordinates for the two points as: `{{-0.3054, -0.9543}, {-1.007, -0.005534}}` ## Any help would be appreciated!
