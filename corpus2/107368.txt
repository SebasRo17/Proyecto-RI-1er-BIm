IronScheme is mentioned on Wikipedia as a successor to a failed project called IronLisp, bringing Lisp to CLR and .NET, the way Clojure does for the JVM. Does anyone have experience with this language? It looks fairly complete (99%) but I'm not sure how to judge whether it's worth my time to fiddle with getting it set up or not. By stable or complete, I mean using it for actual projects rather than just fiddling with tools and Project Euler style problems.
