I know sessions are in PHP, ASP, ASP.NET and probably in many other languages. In most cases session solve a problem which the language itself fails to solve. I am wondering   1. Who created sessions and when were they first introduced?   2. Was it a feature of a particular language first?   3. Is the use of sessions limited to web browsers only? Or are they used in desktop applications as well?
