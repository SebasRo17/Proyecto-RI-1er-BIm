Let's say that you are idling. There is no ongoing project and you are left nothing to do sometimes. Or there are probably some project is running but you can't proceed. So, you have nothing to do and you are bored. In these kind of situations, what are the things that you will normally do to kill the time? What I normally do is:   * Read some books. But it makes me sleepy sometimes, and I got bored easily on some books.   * Browse SE sites and trying to answer some questions. This will probably kill some minutes.   * browse for anything that is interested to read on (things like physics, how things works, biology etc)   * programming puzzles. I'm probably running out of topic or things to do. And it's in an office, so, watching, facebooking, or gaming is not a good idea.
