let say I want my User model to have only one location and my Post model to have many location. How Do I design the model? This is what I have in mind so far. Is this going to work? Do I need to create two different Location model for each User and Post model? `class User(models.Model):` `class Post(models.Model):`               class Location(models.Model):      user = models.ForeignKey(User,unique=true)      post = models.ForeignKey(Post)
