I have a function of two variables $f(r,x,c)$, where $r$ and $x$ are variables and $c$ is a constant that appears in the function. I would like to write it as a product of two functions $f1(r,c) \times f2(x,c)$. If I set `c = 1` and use `FullSimplify`, it automatically gives me the function in the form `f1[r]*f2[x]`. However, if no assumptions about `c` are provided `c`, `FullSimplify` doesn't work. (Based on the Physics problem I am trying to solve there are reasons to believe that I should be able to write down function in the form $f(r,x,c)=f1(r,c) \times f2(x,c)$ ) Is there any command or procedure in _Mathematica_ to separate the functional dependence of a given function with two variables?
