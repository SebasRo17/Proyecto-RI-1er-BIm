I try this numerical summation (in two parts)               a = NSum[(HarmonicNumber[2 m])/m^3, {m, 1, Infinity},            WorkingPrecision -> 100, PrecisionGoal -> 100];     N[Pi^3/24 Log[2]^2 + Log[2] Pi/16 Zeta[3] - Pi^5/960 - Pi/16 a, 100]      and this numerical integration               NIntegrate[x^2 Log[Sin[x]] Log[Cos[x]], {x, 0, Pi/2},        WorkingPrecision -> 100, PrecisionGoal -> 100]      which are supposed to give the same result, and they do, but only to 25 places. Obviously, at least one of the results is off. How can I increase the precision so that these agree past 25 places? If that can't be done, which of these is the more accurate? If I try to evaluate the first quantity symbolically, I get               b = Sum[(HarmonicNumber[2 m])/m^3, {m, 1, Infinity}]      > >     1/144 (π^4 + 72 (EulerGamma + Log[4]) Zeta[3] - 36 Sqrt[π]   >         (HypergeometricPFQRegularized^({0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}, 0))[ >           {1, 1, 1,1, 3/2}, {2, 2, 2, 3/2}, 1]) >   However, `N[b,20]` never returns. The problem seems to be the evaluation of the derivative of `HypergeometricPFQRegularized`.
