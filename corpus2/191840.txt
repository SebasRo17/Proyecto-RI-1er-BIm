I have seen on some sites which say ,for-example, multiple votes/views from same computer will be neglected/penalized etc. For-example liking a facebook page, or youtube video from same computer(different accounts) will not increase its worth(according to my knowledge). How do these sites identify bogus votes? I just need a direction.
