After playing with the new quantity system in Mathematica 9 for a while, I keep stumbling over this issue:               0 * Quantity[1, "Meters"]      is not the same as               1 * Quantity[0, "Meters"]      The first is dimensionless 0, the second is 0 meters, and a dimensionless quantity can't be added to or converted to a length like meters. Take e.g. this simplified example:               startPoint = Quantity[1, "Meters"];     endPoint = Quantity[5, "Meters"];         Manipulate[      UnitConvert[a*endPoint + (1 - a)*startPoint, "Inches"], {a, 0, 1}]      The manipulate converts a point along a line to inches. It works for any setting of `a`, except `0.` and `1.`, where I get `UnitConvert[0. + Quantity[1., "Meters"], "Inches"]` instead of a proper length. Generally speaking, it seems that any expression that contains a dimensionless subexpression that can be 0 might break somewhere in your `Manipulate`, `Table` or `Animate`. This seems extremely fragile to me. Is this a bug? Or am I using `Quantity` wrong? Should I avoid dimensionless expressions completely? Or avoid `Quantity` inside dynamic code?
