I have some processed data, which are basically a collection of ordered pairs in the form:               {{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, ..., {xn, yn}}      Ordered pairs which have either a zero $x$ or $y$ component are not physically meaningful, and should be deleted from the data. I can't for the life of me figure out how to delete these points. I've tried `DeleteCases`, `Position`, `Select`, `Cases`, etc. and none of them work for my application.
