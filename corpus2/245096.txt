Do there exist browser fingerprinting API's that instead of running browser information (e.g. the user agent, installed plugins, screen resolution, system fonts etc.) through a hash function, instead encode the information with a lossless data compression algorithm to produce a string that can later be decompressed to receive the original information? I've been looking for an efficient way to compress all the system fonts, plugins, etc. from a given browser into a small string so that it's easier for me to store them and then read back particular strings when I need to in there original format, but I haven't been able to find anything that even partially does this.
