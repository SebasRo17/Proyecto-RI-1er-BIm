If anyone could suggest a reason why `Label[begin] ... Goto[begin]` would return `Hold[Goto[Begin]]`, and (better) how can I avoid this problem, I'd appreciate it. I suspect this is an outmoded control structure for simple programs, but I like it. I had an earlier version of _Mathematica_ and it was fickle. Sometimes adjusting the spacing cured the problem. The newer version is less forgiving, if it is user error. Edit: a silly example maybe but it gives the error message.               p[1] = .9; i = 1; Label[begin];     i++;     p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1;     Print[i];     If[i < 5, Goto[begin], Goto[end]];     Label[end];      > >     2 >   > > Goto::nolabel: Label begin not found. >> >   >   >     Hold[Goto[begin]] >
