As I understand it, and I may be wrong, but GAE's remote_api allows one application to access another application's datastore. I'll be blunt I don't understand how this works. I have read the article that everyone likes to point to, but I still don't understand how you can link two applications. Can someone explain it to me, perhaps with a small example or just point me to a tutorial that does this?
