How does `Apart` work? The page `tutorial/SomeNotesOnInternalImplementation#7441` says, "`Apart` uses either a version of the Padé technique or the method of undetermined coefficients. I know what the latter is (clear of fractions, collect by powers of the variable, equate coefficients of corresponding powers, solve the resulting linear system). What's the former? (I know what Padé approximation is.)
