If one makes the assumptions $x>0,a>0$, then $\frac{1}{a}\log x^a = \log x$. Thus, in Mathematica, `Simplify[1/a*Log[x^a], {a > 0, x > 0}]` returns `Log[x]`. If the argument of the logarithm becomes more complicated, the assumption one must declare becomes proportionately more complicated. For instance, `Simplify[1/a*Log[(x + Log[x]*Cos[x])^a], {a > 0, x + Log[x]*Cos[x] > 0}]`. Of course, one could also use `Simplify[1/a*Log[(x + Log[x]*Cos[x])^a], {a > 0, x > 1}]`; however, one may not always know the range of the argument of the logarithm. Is there a way to specify that the argument of the logarithm is non-negative without spelling out the entire argument in the assumption? Perhaps, one could simply declare to Mathematica that complex numbers should be ignored?
