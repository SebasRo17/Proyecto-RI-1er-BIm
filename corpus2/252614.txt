I have developed .NET software that uses two libraries:   * Library A has MIT licence and I'm using my own version of it as I edited the source code of this library.   * Library B has Ms-PL licence and I use only the binaries. My application will be distributed freely in binaries and source code(including the source code of library A). Since it is my first time to distribute a public application I want to know few things:   * what Licence I should choose.   * a part from the to-be-chosen licence Eula presented to the user in the installation , what else I should do for the binaries ?   * for the source code, what should I include exactly ?
