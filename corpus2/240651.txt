Whenever we implement a frontend framework in the likes of Backbone, AngularJS etc. there's an integration process involved with the backend technologies like NodeJS, Rails, Yii etc. (like setting up routes, generating views or adding libs etc.) which varies depending upon what you select at the front-end and what you take at the backend, my question is: Why don't we completely de-couple the process so that front-end (HTML, CSS, JS etc.) is completely independent while backend APIs returns us desired data only, just like we do in mobile development.
