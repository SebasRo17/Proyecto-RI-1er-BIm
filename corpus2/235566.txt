Unicode seems that its becoming more and more ubiquitous these days if it's not already, but I have to wonder if there are any domains were Unicode isn't the best implementation choice. Are there any languages or scripts that Unicode will not work well or won't work at all? Are there any technical reasons to use a different system entirely (other than working with legacy systems)? Naturally, I would assume that the answer is to always use Unicode. Am I wrong?
