Suppose I have three coordinates functions of a vector of parameters: x[q],y[q],z[q] where q is at least a three dimensional vector in some domain Q. Is it possible to plot in 3D the space spanned by q? By that I mean all the triplets {x',y',z'} such that there is at least one q in Q such that x[q]=x',y[q]=y',z[q]=z'? Of course I would be happy if this worked with intervals (say Q is the unit cube). And of course I would be happy with the surface of the subset. I need to quickly check that this is a convex subset of R^3. So any other method is welcome.
