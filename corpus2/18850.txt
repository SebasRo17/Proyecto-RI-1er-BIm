I have a list of dates that happen throughout 2013. I wish to construct a graph showing a cumulative total of elements that happen before that date. I have a working algorithm, but it seems too slow and inefficient. Let's generate some random dates:               dates = {2013, #[[1]], #[[2]]} & /@ Transpose@{RandomInteger[{1, 12}, {100}],          RandomInteger[{1, 30}, {100}]};      Define a function that calculates the totals:               datecounts[dates_, effectivedate_, spanindays_] := Module[{range, compares},       range = DateRange[effectivedate, DatePlus[effectivedate, spanindays]];       compares = Partition[(AbsoluteTime[#[[1]]] > AbsoluteTime[#[[2]]]) & /@           Tuples[{range, dates}], Length[dates]];       Transpose@{range, Count[#, True] & /@ compares}]      And graph the results:               DateListPlot[datecounts[dates, {2013, 1, 1}, 365], PlotStyle -> {Thickness[0.003]},        Joined -> True, GridLines -> Automatic, FrameLabel -> {Null, "Total Count"}]      Any help in improving efficiency or better use of functions is greatly appreciated. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4nUka.png)
