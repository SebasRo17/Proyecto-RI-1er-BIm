I just wrote my first SAX-based (Java) XML schema validator, where you pass it a schema URL (pointing to the `.xsd` file), and an XML instance, and it determines whether or not that instance is valid or not. I'm now looking to write several unit tests for the validator (TDD people, I _know_ , I know!) and was wondering what were some common reasons why XML fails validation. There are so many elements and attributes in this schema, I could literally write _thousands_ of test cases. I figured someone here might know of a way to simplify them all down to a manageable set.
