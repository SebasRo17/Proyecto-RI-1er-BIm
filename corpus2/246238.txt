I'm new to web development and I've started working on a project in my company that uses DJANGO. I feel it flexible to start my development straight first from the templates. I think it will be easier if I visualize things first. So my question: Is it okay to start with a template rather than starting with models first? Will I stumble on to any sort of confusions if I go by this method of development?
