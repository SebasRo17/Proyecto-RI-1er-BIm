I tried               Expectation[-q*Log[q], q \[Distributed] BetaDistribution[a, b]]      and got               (a (HarmonicNumber[a] - HarmonicNumber[a + b]))/(a + b)      (I get the same result using integration.) This seems pretty different from the expression in Wikipedia, even after substituting the identity (mentioned at MathWorld that `H[n] = gamma + PolyGamma[0,n+1]`, where `gamma` is Euler's constant and `PolyGamma[0, n+1] = Digamma[n+1]`. Any ideas which identity I'm missing? Kevin P.S. I trust the Wikipedia answer, I have seen this result before, but I want to re-derive it with _Mathematica_ as a sanity check, before I go on to derive other expressions of interest.
