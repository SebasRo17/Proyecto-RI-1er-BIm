I have the following working expression:               In[15]:= Length[Select[IntegerPartitions[10],First[#1]==5&]]     Out[15]= 7      But, instead of using the constant 5 I want to map all values from 1 to 10 into this function. If I nest the pure function inside another it doesn't work:               In[18]:= Map[Length[Select[IntegerPartitions[10],First[#]==#&]]&,Range[10]]     Out[18]= {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}      What is the way to do this?
