As a young developer, I would find it useful to get some advice regarding things to think about in order to develop a high-quality application. In my college courses, most teachers emphasized input validation and some talked about security concerns, but no one covered the importance of certain other things, like logging for example. What are some mistakes that inexperienced developers tend to make which could lead to frustration for more experienced developers?
