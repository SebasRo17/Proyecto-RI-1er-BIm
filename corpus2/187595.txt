I was recently hired by a large multi-national corporation to head up mobile development for their sales operation/support team. In a company of close to 10,000 people I am, at least in the America's, the only mobile developer. They are testing the waters and phase 1 (temp-to-hire) went well enough for them. Now they are considering expanding to other developers for their other sales operations/support teams and I've been tasked with assisting/leading the writing of a standardization guide for iOS programming. I am a big believer in giving people the freedom to work in the manner they most feel comfortable in but at the same time, I have been the creator of and on the receiving ends of big balls of mud applications. Having learned through experience I have several standards that I follow religiously such as commenting, at times almost every line - just short things but enough to let someone else know what is going on and using #pragma mark - DESCRIPTION to block off like minded methods, indentation, naming classes with a prefix to avoid name space conflicts, etc. etc. So I guess what I am looking for is not to tell another programmer how they should iterate through an array but rather some basic standardization so anyone can jump into anyone else's project and find their way around with little learning curve. I'd love to see what other means people use to maintain control over a software development group.
