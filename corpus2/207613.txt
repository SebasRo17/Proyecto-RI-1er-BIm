I am writing some code in Python which checks for the validity of a license key after polling a server. If it is valid then the Python program in turn runs some bash scripts. How to create a combined binary of the python script (to check the license) and the bash script (which performs the task)? Here are what I think could be the solutions but I am really not sure:   1. I use the encode function in python and encode the bash script file once and add combine that file and the license_checker.py file into a single binary. When the binary runs, the python code should decode the file into a temp file, run the script and delete the temp file.   2. Find a mechanism which wraps/embeds the bash code in the python script. I have heard of decorators but I haven't used them and do not know if they would serve the purpose.
