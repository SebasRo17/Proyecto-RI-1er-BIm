I have to sort a set of 100000 integers as a part of a programming Q. The time limit is pretty restrictive, so I have to use the most time-efficient approach possible. My current code -               #include<cstdio>     #include<algorithm>     using namespace std;          int main() {         int n,d[100000],i;         for(i=0;i<n;++i) {                          scanf("%d",&d[i]);         }         sort(d,d+n);         ....     }      Would this approach be more efiicient?               int main() {         int n,d[100000],i;         for(i=0;i<n;++i) {                          scanf("%d",&d[i]);                          sort(d,d+i+1);         }         ....     }      What is the most efficient way to sort a large dataset? Note - Not homework...
