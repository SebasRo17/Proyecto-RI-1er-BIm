I have n variables and a function that has all of them as variables. n-3 of them in terms of the entries of two lists. The possible entries in the lists $\alpha$ and $\beta$ range from {2,...n-2}. Now I want to sum over all possible permutations of these n-3 elements (aka $P_{n-3})$, i.e. $$f=\sum_{\alpha,\beta \in P_{n-3}}A[1,\alpha,n-1,n]S[\beta,\alpha]A[n,\beta,n-1,1]$$ with A and S some other functions. How do I program this into mathematica. I thought about writing f as a pure function. But then how to implement this sum over permutations? Thanks for any advice!
