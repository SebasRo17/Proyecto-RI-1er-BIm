I am trying to make the Return Key move the insertion point to the end of the input field's text. Please see the example below for the problem I am facing. Namely, when the return key is pressed, the input field's text is updated but the insertion point is not moved.               DynamicModule[{thing = "foo"}, nb = EvaluationNotebook[];EventHandler[InputField[Dynamic@thing,String], {"ReturnKeyDown" :> (thing = thing <> "bar";SelectionMove[nb, Next, Word])}]]
