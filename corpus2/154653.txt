As usual, I need to do courses from several different areas of Computer Science for my Master's degree. I'll focus on Algorithms, Theoretical Computer Science (Computability and Complexity, the foundations,...) and Parallel/High Performance computing plus maybe a bit of Programming Languages at the side. To finish in time, I have to do 5-8 courses per semester. Is it reasonable to focus on one topic per semester? E.g., I'll do about 5 courses on Algorithms. My assumption is that if I do all of these in one semester, I'll get a deeper understanding of the topic. Or would it be more beneficial for me to do 1-2 courses form each area per semester?
