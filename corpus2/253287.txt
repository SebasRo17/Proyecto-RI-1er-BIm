Here are some examples of 5x5 Magic Squares found by the Magic Square Generator by Marcel Roos:               Magic squares 5x5     Sum must be: 65          Solution:             1       1  2 13 24 25       3 23 17  6 16      20 21 11  8  5      22  4 14 18  7      19 15 10  9 12          Solution:             2       1  2 13 24 25       3 23 16  8 15      21 19 10  6  9      22  4 14 20  5      18 17 12  7 11          Solution:             3       1  2 13 24 25       3 23 19  4 16      21 15 10 12  7      22  8  9 20  6      18 17 14  5 11           ...      The number of all possible solutions is 275305224. Since calculation of all solutions takes a very long time, I would like have one person with a high speed computer find all solutions (in a long continues span of time) and then share them on the web for other people. What would be an efficient way to store these solutions, using some sort of compression? **(simple logical trick)by attention to the principle that the sum in all rows and columns and diagonal are equal to 65** **we only need to know the value for only 14 cells of 25 cells as shown below , this cause the storage space almost reduce to half 14/25** legend: **+** means stored value and **x** means skipped value !               + + + + x     + + + + x      + + + + x     x + x + x     x x x x x
