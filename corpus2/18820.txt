I am new to _Mathematica_ and reading my way through a few books. Playing around with `Manipulate` and I noticed the following does not work:               y[x_]:=x^n;     plot := Plot[y[x],{x,0,10}, AspectRatio->1];     Manipulate[plot,{n,1,5}]      I expected the above to work as I am using `SetDelayed` in my function definition so not sure if I understand why this doesn't work. However the following does work.               Manipulate[      Module[{y,x,plot},       y[x_]:=x^n;       plot := Plot[y[x],{x,0,10}, AspectRatio->1];       Show[plot]       ],      {n,1,5}     ]
