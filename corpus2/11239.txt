Even though the mathematica front-end is much more robust than it used to be, everyone must have noticed that when a few 3D graphics are involved, the front-end produces very large notebooks which are more difficult to manage. I am aware of the option to rasterise 3D plots using Image                Plot3D[Sin[1/x 1/y],{x,0,1},{y,0,1},PlotPoints -> 200]//Image[#,ImageResolution-> 300]&      which produces a file of 1.2 MB versus one of 11 MB (without the Image). I am looking for a method to identify within a given notebook which graphics outputs use most memory on the front-end (and potentially disc space when the notebook is saved), in order to rasterize these outputs. Ideally I would rather not rasterize all plots as the interactivity is useful. Note that this question differs from my previous question about identifying which outputs use most kernel memory when stored in Out[] variables. **Question**   1. How to identify which cells use most memory on the front-end in a given notebook?   2. Possibly automate the process of rasterising those cells? May be there is a front end setup to tell it to not produce interactive plots?
