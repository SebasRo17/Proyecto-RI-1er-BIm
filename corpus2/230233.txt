I tested two approaches to store session data:   * The classic: 1 key, 1 object (And every key as `static final String` in a class) > "user" --> UserObject > > "preferences" --> List > > ...   * An approach with only 1 object  > "sessionObject" --> SessionObject And my `SessionObject` contains `UserObject` and the list of preferences as attributes. This is a fairly simple example but imagine it with 20+ attributes. The advantage I see in the second approach is that :   * You only have to delete one key to ensure session is empty   * You don't have to create the bothersome set of `final static String` to create the keys   * You'll know what type of object to retrieve (Using key you have to `cast`) Do you see any problem I might went over? Or does anything go against best practices?
