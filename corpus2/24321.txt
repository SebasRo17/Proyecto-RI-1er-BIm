Could someone explain the odd behavior of the `Derivative` function when drawing arguments from lists? We have,               Derivative[1][a + #*(b - c) &]     (* b - c & *)      and analogously,               Derivative[1][{a1, a2} + #*({b1, b2} - {c1, c2}) &]     (* {0, 0} + {b1, b2} - {c1, c2} + ({0, 0} + {0, 0}) #1 & *)      So far so good. However,               lst = {{a1, a2}, {b1, b2}, {c1, c2}};     Derivative[1][lst[[1]] + #*(lst[[2]] - lst[[3]]) &]     (* {lst[[2]] - lst[[3]], lst[[2]] - lst[[3]]} & *)      Why is the output in the last case not,               lst[[2]] - lst[[3]] &      as one would expect based on the previous examples? Why do I get a list of lists as an answer, instead of just a list? (And what should I do to get the expected result?)
