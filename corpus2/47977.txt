I am using Windows (7 if needed). I am trying to learn how to write a batch file that EXECUTES a notebook. This is the batch               @echo off     START "C:\Programmi\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\8.0\MathKernel.exe" test.nb      it opens mathematica, but doesn't executes the notebook. So I tried (in the notebook) to select the cell and:               Cell>Cell properties>Initialization      but still it only opens the notebook. What am I missing? The notebook:               Export["C:\\Users\\MATTIA\\Desktop\\FIT\\Fam_II\\test.jpg",       Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}]]      just plots and saves a `sin` function
