I'm a budding web developer, and I wondered if it was illegal to edit a website for a client to include a link that says 'encourage the owner of this site to pay their web developer' and follows up with a pre-made email encouraging the man to pay me. Here are the conditions:   * I've completed the work for the contract.   * I've asked to be paid, and tried to set up meetings with the owner.   * I've informed the owner of the site that my work will not continue unless I am paid.    * I should have been paid nearly a month ago (12/27) Any thoughts other than small claims? This is my first web-development job!
