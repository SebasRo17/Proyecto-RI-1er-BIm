I have a requirement where some of the training scripts (active x components) needs to be rendered on the client application (IE 8). Till now the server was hosting these scripts using IIS and IE was used render these using HTTP protocol. However in some new customer scenarios I am required to look at the possibility of not having a server hosting this content due to bad network connectivity. The different options I am looking at are   1. Inside the LAN have a local server and use IIS within that to host these training scripts   2. Host the training scripts on each users local drive Option (1) may not be suitable to all customers since it requires an additional server and since my customers are banks they may not be OK with it. Option (2), playing the content from local file system will be considered as security threat and elevating the security privileges on browser in banking environment is a strict no-no. Also pushing updates on the training materials is cumbersome where I might need to push updates to say 30000 teller machines instead of 1 server machine. If i choose to go with option (2) is there any possibility of using any temporary local webserver? Are there any other alternatives to achieve this?
