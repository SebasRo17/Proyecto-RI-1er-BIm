I'm trying to start unit testing (not using any testing frameworks) for my javascripts. Here's one example of it.               var obj = {};          obj.disableBtn = function ($btn, style) {       $btn.attr('disabled','disabled').addClass('disabled').removeClass(style);     };      The use case is as such:               obj.disableBtn($('.submit'), 'btn-blue');      What it does is simply add the `disabled` attribute, add the `disabled` class, and remove the `btn-blue` style. Please advise how would a typical test case look like in this case. I have a little knowledge on testing using `assert()`, but have no idea how to go about it when it involves verifying the result on HTML elements.
