This question came to mind because of this answer to a recent question. Under Style, the _Mathematica_ Documentation Center says the following about named styles. > A few common named styles include: "Button", "Graphics", ..., "Title" Altogether it lists 13 named styles, but the phrase "a few of" implies there are more. Other cell styles such as "SubTitle" and "SubSubSection" come to mind. But strings other than those naming cell styles evidently qualify as named styles. In the referenced answer, Mr.Wizard uses "TI" as a named style for the "Times Italic" font.               Style["The quick brown fox ...", "TI"]      ![TI.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pYZxH.png) By trial and error, I have found these addition named styles:               "TR"   (Times Roman -- plain Times)     "TB"   (Times Bold)     "TBI"  (Times Bold Italic)     "SR"   (Sans serif Roman -- plain sans serif)     "SB"   (Sans serif Bold)     "SO"   (Sans serif Oblique)     "SBO"  (Sans serif Bold Oblique)      I wonder what other named styles exist, other than cell styles, that _Mathematica_ will accept in a `Style` expression. I further wonder what sort of spelunking in _Mathematica_ would turn them up.
