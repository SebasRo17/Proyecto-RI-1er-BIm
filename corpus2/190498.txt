I'm wondering how to set up the organization with Scrum Masters. I would prefer to see real examples of where the scrum masters are located in the organization's hierarchy and how report-to / chain-of-command issues are handled. we are service company. We have one agile project done for agile customer where team manager of developers fulfills the role of delivery responsible. So far we had matrix organization where scrum masters were assigned to the project management team consisting of people working for other projects (not agile), but this was causing that they did not have much contact with agile culture in their PM team and goals were not always aligned with project. How should we structure Scrum Masters within our organization?
