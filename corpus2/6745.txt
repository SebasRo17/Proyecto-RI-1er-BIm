I would like to set up a function which has to return True if at least two arguments of a given List are equal. So if I give `{1,4,6,2}` to the function it has to return `False` (since none of his arguments are equal) and the same would happen if I gave `{{1,2,3},{2,3,4}}`, while if I gave `{1,2,3,1,4}` or `{{1,2,3},{2,0,0},{1,2,3},{2,1,2}}` it has to return `True`. I know this is a very simple problem and i think you can easily tell me a convenient way to achieve that.
