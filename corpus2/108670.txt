I've beeen given a budget for building a desktop PC for app and game development. What components should I consider to be a priority when selecting parts for the computer, and which should I ignore or pay less attention to? Additional Information:   * Budget: $900   * Wish to use by two users at the same time, via two monitors and keyboard/mice
