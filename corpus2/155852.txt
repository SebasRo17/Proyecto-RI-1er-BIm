Over time I could understand two parts of SOLID – the “S” and “O”. “O” – I learned Open Closed Principle with the help of Inheritance and Strategy Pattern. “S” – I learned Single Responsibility principle while learning ORM (the persistence logic is taken away from domain objects). In a similar way, what are the best regions/tasks to learn other parts of SOLID (the “L”, “I” and “D”)?
