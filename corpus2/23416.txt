In _Mathematica_ 8               NDSolve[{x[t] == 1, x[0] == 1}, x[t], {t, 0, 10}]      solves fine and returns               {{x[t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,10.}},<>][t]}}      while _Mathematica_ 9 raises > NDSolve::derivs: No derivatives of dependent variables were found in the > equations. NDSolve is designed to solve differential or differential > algebraic equations. Use NSolve or FindRoot to numerically solve algebraic > equations. >> I get the point, but is there maybe a way to restore the old behavior via `NDSolve`'s options system?
