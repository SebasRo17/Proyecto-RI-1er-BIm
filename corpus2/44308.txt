is there a way with Mathematica to transform transferfunctions (Laplace) into differential equations? Let's say I have the transfer function $\frac{Y(s)}{U(s)}=\text{Kp} \left(\frac{1}{s \text{Tn}}+1\right)$. What I want to get is $\dot{y}(t)\text{Tn}=\text{Kp}(\dot{u}(t)\text{Tn}+u(t))$. On (I think) Nasser's page I found something I adapted:               sys = Kp (1 + 1/(Tn s))     sys = Together[sys]     rhs = Numerator[sys]     lhs = Denominator[sys]     rhs = rhs /. m_. s^n_. -> m Derivative[n][u[t]]     lhs = lhs /. m_. s^n_. -> m Derivative[n][y[t]]          eq = lhs == rhs      But this gives a wrong output for factors with $s^0$:               Input: eq          Output: Tn y[t]'==Kp (1+Tn u[t]')
