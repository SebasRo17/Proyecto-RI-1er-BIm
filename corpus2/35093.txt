This might be a very simple question but I have been struggling with it for a couple of hours, so thought maybe someone here can show me a quick way of solving it. I have a file in rtf format (Triangles.rtf) https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_DoKsn6afPMRTNHUW93NEEwc1U/edit?usp=sharing Now I am trying to load the file by typing `a = Import["PATH_TO_FILE/Triangles.rtf","Table"]` which seems to return a list of lists. So far it seems fine, for example `a[[1]]` returns {3 0 2 1}. `Head[a[[1]]]` returns list and `Head[a[[1,1]]]` returns String. Then I try to convert string into number by `ToExpression[a]` but here we get a list of Null! can anyone please tell me how to convert my imported data into a 2d array (list of list that is) so that I can use the numerics?
