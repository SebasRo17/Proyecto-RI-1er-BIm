First, I'm quite new to Mathematica so sorry in advance if some questions seem to be trivial. I have a CSV-file which looks like this:               "perc","l1","l2","diff"     0.005,116,148,32     0.005,352,30,322     0.005,249,49,200     0.005,23,336,313     0.0051,130,89,41     0.0051,363,46,317     .     .     .      _perc_ is a percentage between 0â€¦1; _l1_ and _l2_ are numbers, _diff_ is the difference between _l1_ and _l2_. Those are the first lines; the full set is ~150.000 lines long; with _perc_ from 0 to 1. I want to plot those data and WolframAlpha (and even GoogleDocs) do a good job here and I get a result like this (actually, this is not entirely correct; _perc_ should be plotted on **X** , _l1_ , _l2_ and _diff_ on **Y** ; I hope you know what I mean. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F3I48.png) ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ju35l.png) This, however, only works if my CSV is less than ~4000 rows. If it's bigger, WA fails and "does not know how to interpret the data"; same for Google Docs. So, I want to redo this in Mathematica, but I don't know how / it doesn't work. First, I import my CSV: `data = Import["data.csv", "Table", "HeaderLines" -> 1]` But then I fail with `ListPlot` because I don't know what options it needs to plot the data correspondingly to WA.
