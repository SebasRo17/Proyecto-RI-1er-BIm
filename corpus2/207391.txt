I would like to know your opinion about my setup right now, how I do things with SVN and if you could find some better solution for me. I'd appreciate it very much if someone could come up with some better solutions for my problems. I would like to do it the best way possible and the most efficiently. My situation is as follows: I'm maintaining a PHP website which is connected to mysql database. I have a subdomain on which I'm testing everything. There are also two databases: first for testing purposes, second for the production server. I have a project in Netbeans and I'm connected to ftp with it so every change I make is directly transferred to the website. Also I'm connected to SVN server and the testing part of the website is in trunk directory. Every time I want to upload the changes to the server I'm commiting my trunk and then I'm copying it to tags. After that I got another project in Netbeans prepared, already connected to the same SVN, but to the last tag copy. After I copy the trunk to tag directory, I switch to the second project and switch to the newest version in tags. Now I have in some another directory every configuration file prepared in proper directory structure - I copy it to my production project. After that I click "Run" in Netbeans and that opens a window which allows me to accept the transfers to the sftp, but this time to the production part of the website. My question is: is it the best way? Aren't there any more intuitive tools or options in SVN, so I don't have to copy the configuration files every time?
