I just started learning Python, and I'd like to get some more context on the language. I realize that, in many cases, Python is a slow language relative to C or C++. Thus, Python is probably not the best choice for applications that need to run as quickly as possible. Outside of this, it seems like Python is a great general purpose language that is easy to read and write. The available libraries give it a huge amount of functionality. Outside of performance critical applications, where is it a bad choice to use Python (and why)?
