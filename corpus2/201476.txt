When should or shouldn't a variable be declared as a custom Interface type? When walking through some code, I required to know what was happening here:               Public Class MyMainProject         ....         Public Sub DoMyWork()             Dim objIMyInterface As IMyInterface             ....             objIMyInterface = GetReturnObject()         End Sub         ....     End Class      According to what I saw, `objIMyInterface` is only being used for one thing. I didn't know how many classes `implement` it, but there's no casting of similar types in this code. `objIMyInterface` is used just like a regular type, not anonymous in the least. Second of all, my research helped a little... `GetReturnObject` happens to return an instance of `IMyInterface`. The return object of `GetReturnObject`, of course, has a call to another method.               Public Function GetReturnObject() As IMyInterface         Dim retObject As IMyInterface         ...                 retObject = AnotherMethod()         ...         Return retObject     End Function      So I try to step into `AnotherMethod`, but it's in a project with no symbols. So after some research, I find the source and go through it. After repeating this process a few times, I eventually get to something like this:               Public Function FinalMethod() As IMyInterface         Dim FinalObject As MyClassType         ...                 FinalObject = GetMyClassType()         ...         Return FinalObject      End Function      Yay! `GetMyClassType` returns `MyClassType`! I go to that Class and of course:               Public Class MyClassType         Implements IMyInterface         ...     End Class      What I end up finding out is that `IMyInterface` is used by nothing else but this class. No biggie, it's all good code by the looks of it. But then I go back to my original project I notice this:               Public Class MyMainProject         ....         Public Sub DoMyWork()             Dim objIMyInterface As IMyInterface             ....             objIMyInterface = GetReturnObject()         End Sub         ....         Public Sub OtherWork()             Dim objMyType As MyClassType             ....         End Sub         ....     End Class      The guy who created this is long gone, but I'd like to know what your thoughts are on which method should be used. Should I declare both as `IMyInterface`? Or both as `MyClassType`? The code works fine either way.
