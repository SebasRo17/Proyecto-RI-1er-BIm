Can anyone point me to an article or an informed discussion about US software patents affecting a non-US company who is selling their products on an American app store/marketplace? My company has several products on both Apple's App Store and Android's Marketplace, all of which are available for sale in the US. We are however based in Europe and have no assets registered in the US. Assuming we had a product worth enough to attract patent trolls, should we be worried? We have not researched any relevant patents we might be infringing because such research would be too expensive for us. Reading articles about US patent law it seems that being able to catch all potential patents is unlikely anyhow. I realise this site is frequented by programmers and not by lawyers, but a good external reference would be much appreciated.
