While programming an object that represent a GUI, the class is a mix of code of following sections:   1. Overrides of super GUI, for behavior customization   2. Implementations of interface contracts, to talk/listen to other GUI objects   3. Local event handling methods   4. Local data crunching methods   5. Code to query/update a remote database and a global object provider Assuming all this is crammed into one class file, how would you split it into separate files or parent-child classes so that you can delegate these to different developers with minimum dependency on each other?
