I want to make a downloads managing system on my website, that when you purchase a download, you can always re-download it again for free. (i have read that Steam does something similar) The problem is, that someone would be able to create a account, purchase something and then give the account password to friends and family, so they can all download copies for free. Is there a way to prevent this? Or is it impossible.
