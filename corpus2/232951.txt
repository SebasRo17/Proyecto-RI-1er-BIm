I need to write a handler for server error during user logout. What is a common practice?               ajax.post({         url: '/auth/logout'     }).done(function (response) {         switch (response.statusCode) {             case 200:             {                 //update UI related to userinformation             }             case 500:             {                 //what should I do here?             }         }     })      Note: The ajax function is reimplementation of $.ajax() with the exception that it always calls done callback (custom promise object is always resolved and never rejected) **UPDATE:** On server I destroy session and delete auto login cookie if it's present. Is it a sensible approach (if server error is received) to delete cookies related to session name and auto login on client using javascript (presuming that I know their names)?
