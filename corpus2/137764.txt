What kind of skills determine a person that is capable of debugging code with ease? Some time ago my friend carried out an interview with a relatively good programmer. The programmer got hired. He could write good code, understood the frameworks and design patterns. The thing he was missing was - debugging skills. He could not debug at all and finding problems with his or someone else's code was huge pain for him. Since then we are thinking about how we can assess or estimate a person's debugging skills. So the first question is: what skills determine if a person can effectively debug software? And the second: how to test those skills during the interview?
