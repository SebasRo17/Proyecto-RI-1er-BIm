I've got a database where I want to store `user` information and `user_meta` information. The reason behind setting it up in this way was because the `user_meta` side may change over time and I would like to do this without disrupting the master `user` table. If possible, I would like some advice on how to best set up this meta data table. I can either set it as below:               +----+---------+----------+--------------------+     | id | user_id | key      | value              |     +----+---------+----------+--------------------+     | 1  | 1       | email    | test@testemail.com |     | 2  | 1       | name     | user name          |     | 3  | 1       | address  | test address       |     ...      Or, I can set it as below:               +----+---------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+     | id | user_id | email              | name               | address      |     +----+---------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+     | 1  | 1       | test@testemail.com | user name          | test address |      Obviously, the top verison is more flexible, but the bottom version is space saving and perhaps more efficient, returning all the data as a single record. Which is the best way to go about this?   Or, am I going about this completely wrong and there's another way I've not thought of?
