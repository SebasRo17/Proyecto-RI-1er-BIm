What I would like to do is generate a chart similar to the TradingChart but to have two lines on it instead of the candlestick. The lines I want to plot will look something like this; ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3YAAl.png) And what I want to do is replace the top plot on this chart; ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zpd8z.png) The idea is to have the two lines on the DateListPlot with the trading volume bar chart below. By question is am I better off setting up a GraphicsColumn with a DateListPlot and a BarChart or can I modify the TradingChart to get it to do what I want? I'd prefer to modify the TradignChart because it's got some nice interactive content which I don't know how to do myself.
