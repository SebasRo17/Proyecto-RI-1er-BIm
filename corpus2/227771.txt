Being a electronics engineer, I was never exposed to any algorithms. Now I am a experienced programmer and want to learn Algorithms. I started with CLRS. But I was overwhelmed by the maths in the book. So which are the minimum maths topics should I know before I start Algorithms? Are there any good tutorials or books on this? I did find one book on maths by Donald Knuth, but i guess its too details and tough for beginners.
