I allways do my calculations in _Mathematica_ and I make my histograms using ROOT language. However I am wondering is it possible to make good looking histogram inside _Mathematica_? A sample of what I mean is the following figure (made by ROOT): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZC406.jpg) Some sample data (not identical to the one used in the above plot) which can be used:               data = {154.081, 468.999, 648.538, 776.386, 899.310, 766.234, 596.229, 527.160, 443.315,              300.393, 216.542, 105.620, 53.7748, 29.0068, 21.4696, 8.92971, 8.63114, 5.70516,              60.5296};      using as the red pluses inside histogram and               montecarlo = {180.836, 492.187, 739.735, 894.031, 915.812, 841.874, 699.237, 556.588,                    426.208, 303.230, 212.114, 133.295, 71.6399, 36.9657, 21.9234, 9.20245,                   6.13829, 5.20975};      using as the best fit to the data. Note that both data sets are final frequency values and not the original data set on which `Histogram` could work.
