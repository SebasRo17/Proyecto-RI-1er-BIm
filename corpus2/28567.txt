I've recently run into a problem with importing TIF stacks in Mathematica: Slow import of multigigabyte TIF image stacks On the advice of Simon Woods and others, I've been looking into the behavior for functions internal to Import, specifically:               Image`ImportExportDump`ImageReadTiledTIFF[]      Image`ImportExportDump`ImageReadTileTIFF[]      However, I can't seem to find the correct argument set to provide to these functions, and thus, I have no way of seeing how they behave. Just the fact that these functions can be found using ?*` _TIFF_ surprised me (note: you need to add a pair of asterisks, *, around "TIFF" because here, they're being treating it as a formatting instruction and not appearing in the post). Is there any way for me to elucidate the array of arguments that needs to be passed to either function?
