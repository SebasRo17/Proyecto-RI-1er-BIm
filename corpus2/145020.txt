Currently at my work place we use FogBugz for managing all our features and bugs for our different web applications. When a new feature is to be added to one of our web applications, a new Case is created. For example "Create CSV Upload Form". I then work on the case recording the amount of time I've spent on it. Once this case is completed, I then resolve it, and it gets assigned back to the case opener (usually the project manager), who then closes the case. If there are any bugs with the feature, my Project Manager then re-opens the case, and assigns it back to me with a bullet point list of bugs. In my opinion I believe these bullet pointed bugs should be opened as individual bug cases, so that they can be tracked easier, and not get cluttered with the original feature case notes. My managers disagree with me stating that it is easier to work out the total time spent on the feature if its all in one case. Furthermore they believe it is less confusing for our clients as they only have 1 case number reference for the feature. However I would stress that the bugs should be dealt with as seperate cases as this is post-completion of the original case. Am I right in stating that bugs should be reopened as a new case? And what are the pros/cons of each way of managing this?
