I work on a lot of projects for fun, so I have the freedom to choose when I want to finish the project and am not constrained by deadlines. Therefore, if I wanted to, I could follow this philosophy: > Whenever you hit a bug, don't debug. Instead, spend time learning about > topics related to the bug from textbooks and work on other projects until > one day you can come back to the bug and solve it instantly thanks to your > piled up knowledge. However, maybe the 'philosophy' is bad because   1. debugging is a skill that should be practiced so that when I need to finish projects by a deadline I will have acquired the skills necessary to debug quickly.   2. staring at lines of code and _struggling_ to understand them when debugging makes you a much better programmer than writing new lines of code does.   3. debugging isn't a waste of time for some reason which I hope you'll tell me.
