In an answer that I posted to another question, I noted that there is likely to become more and more specialization in software development: there being experts or specialists for given type of programming. I'm wondering, what specialties are known to exist in reasonable quantities in the industry now (not academia), that are not technology specific (eg. for this discussion winforms isn't a specialty)? I'm also interested in the industry that such a specialist would have to work in if necessary.
