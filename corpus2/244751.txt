**Is telnet just a simple socket connection?** I usually have a difficult time in the networking area so I use some code from the internet to help me out, but I can't seem to find a library for Telnet in Objective-C. The closest thing I've found is `CocoaAsyncSocket` I was wondering, _Is telnet just plain socket connections?_ _Do I just create a socket to the server and send the commands?_
