Does anyone know why the Lua progamming language has seen such a rise in popularity recently? I am going by the TIOBE ratings. http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/paperinfo/tpci/Lua.html I've used Lua in the past when I worked at a game development shop, but did not think it was used outside of that arena. Now it is the 11th most popular language according to TIOBE http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html Has there been any recent activity or news that might have caused this sudden surge? Thanks! EDIT: I am particularly interested in the extreme increase over the last year as shown in this chart: ![Lua History](http://i.stack.imgur.com/krjpB.png)
