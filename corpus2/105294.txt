Is there a valid reason for the browsers to prefix new CSS features, instead of letting the webmasters use the non-prefixed version? For example, a sample code for the background gradient looks like:               #arbitrary-stops {       /* fallback DIY*/            /* Safari 4-5, Chrome 1-9 */       background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, right top, from(#2F2727), color-stop(0.05, #1a82f7), color-stop(0.5, #2F2727), color-stop(0.95, #1a82f7), to(#2F2727));            /* Safari 5.1+, Chrome 10+ */       background: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, #2F2727, #1a82f7 5%, #2F2727, #1a82f7 95%, #2F2727);            /* Firefox 3.6+ */       background: -moz-linear-gradient(left, #2F2727, #1a82f7 5%, #2F2727, #1a82f7 95%, #2F2727);            /* IE 10 */       background: -ms-linear-gradient(left, #2F2727, #1a82f7 5%, #2F2727, #1a82f7 95%, #2F2727);            /* Opera 11.10+ */       background: -o-linear-gradient(left, #2F2727, #1a82f7 5%, #2F2727, #1a82f7 95%, #2F2727);     }      What's the point in forcing webmasters to copy-paste the same code four times to have the same result? * * * Note: one of the reasons often quoted is that **prefixed styles are intended to be temporary while either the browser does not implement the spec correctly, or the spec is not definitive**. IMO, this reason is a nonsense:   * If the browser engine does not implement the spec correctly, the browser will not be compliant, no matter if it does not implement it in a non-prefixed form or it does not implement it in a prefixed form.   * If the spec is not definitive, it may matter when there were previous implementations with the same name. For example if CSS2 had `linear-gradient`, but CSS3 was intended to extend `linear-gradient` with additional features, it would be clever to temporary prefix the new, draft, implementation by `-css3-<style>` differentiate between the working CSS2 one, and the experimental CSS3 one. In practice, CSS2 doesn't have `linear-gradient` or other CSS3 novelties. I would also understand if **different browsers had different implementation formats** : for example let's say Firefox required, for text shadow, `<weight- of-shadow distance-x distance-y color>`, while Chrome required `<distance-x distance-y weight-of-shadow color>`. But actually, this is not the case; at least all new features of CSS3 I've used so far had the same format.
