I am a programmer by trade so in my English Class ENC 1102, when we were asked to come up with a discourse community in which we could relate the use of writing skills I thought about pseudocode and comments. So the question is as follows: What effect does the utilization of psuedocode and comments have when a software engineer or programmer designs software? I want to know how writing pseudocode and comments have had in your work process. Does it make it better, faster, worse? Share your experiences and opinions please.
