Since the GNU project is celebrating its anniversary, and the initial announcement for GNU is linked to (http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial- announcement.en.html) all over the place, I reread it and I stumbled upon the plan for a lisp-based window system: > and eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp > programs and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen. It is well known that Stallman had a lisp background and has launched lisp- based projects (Emacs, Guile). As I understand, Stallman's preferred desktop environment for the GNU system is nowadays GNUstep (which seems to be a little dormant). When looking at demonstrations of Symbolics Lisp machines, I am really impressed by the powerful approach and I think that Stallman had something like this in mind during the announcement. So I wonder: **What happened to this plan of a Lisp-based window system? Has it been actually pursued once?**
