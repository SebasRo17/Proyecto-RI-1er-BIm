I have a simple question: What is the unit of the frequency axis in the BodePlot? I searched the documentation, but only found this: > The scaling functions can be specified as > ScalingFunctions->{{magfreqscale,magscale}, {phasefreqscale,phasescale}}. > > The frequency scales magfreqscale and phasefreqscale can be "Log10" or > "Linear", which correspond to the base-10 logarithmic scale and linear > scale, respectively. > > The magnitude scale magscale can be "dB" or "Absolute", which correspond to > the decibel >and absolute values of the magnitude, respectively. > > The phase scale phasescale can be "Degree" or "Radian". But it doesn't say me if the frequency axis is in Hz or rad/s or rad/min or what ever ... I'm asking because I have two BodePlots which, I'm rather shure one is in Hz and the other in rad/s.
