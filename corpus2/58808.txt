**Bug introduced in 9.0** * * * The simplest way to ask is to post the code of what I'm doing:               ListPlot[{Table[x, {x, 1, 10, 1}], Table[x + x^2, {x, 1, 10, 1}]},        PlotMarkers -> None, PlotRange -> All,        PlotStyle -> {        {Thickness[.005], Dashing[{.03, .015}], ColorData[1, 1]},           {Thickness[.0075], ColorData[1, 1]}},       Joined -> True     ]      When I did this in _Mathematica_ 8, the first line was dashed and the second line was a thicker, solid line of the same color: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5xU8g.png) Now having upgraded to _Mathematica_ 10 and the second line is also dashed, same as the first: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8dlQT.png) It seems that if I leave out an explicit `Dashing[{x,x}]` command, the curve inherits the last dashing style, rather than go back to the default! How do I get the second curve to be solid? More importantly, what has changed in _Mathematica_ 10 that causes this? Obviously, my real task is more complicated than this, but this will reproduce the behavior.
