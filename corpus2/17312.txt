Is there a way to use `DateListPlot` with `Quantity` values? I retrieved the following time series data from WolframAlpha:               gasPrices = WolframAlpha[     "us gas prices", {{"History:Price:GasPriceData", 1},      "TimeSeriesData"}];      Each data point is composed of a date and a `Quantity`:               {{{1993, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[1.068, ("USDollars")/("Gallons")]},      {{1993, 4, 19, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[1.079, ("USDollars")/("Gallons")]},     ...      {{2012, 12, 31, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[3.369, ("USDollars")/("Gallons")]} }      I can plot the values using `ListPlot`:                ListPlot[gasPrices[[All,2]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uy8vH.png) Strangely however, `DateListPlot` produces an empty plot:                DateListPlot[gasPrices]      ![Empty plot from DateListPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3Kstn.png) To get `DateListPlot` to produce a proper plot I have to do this instead:               DateListPlot[ Transpose[{gasPrices[[All, 1]], gasPrices[[All, 2, 1]]}] ]      ![OK plot from DateListPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EXfGf.png) Am I missing something? I would have thought that `Quantity` values could be taken directly by `DateListPlot`, as they are by `ListPlot`.
