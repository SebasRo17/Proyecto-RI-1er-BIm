_Mathematica_ has very powerful visualization techniques. However, I'm at a loss at how to best make the following chart readable.               BarChart3D[{viewerCount1, viewerCount2, viewerCount3},       ChartLabels -> {Placed[{word1, word2}, None],         Placed[filelist, None]}, ChartLayout -> "Grid",       BarSpacing -> {0.5, 0},       LabelingFunction -> (Tooltip[Row[Flatten[{#3, #1}], " - "]] &)]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/STnJH.png) Each row (i.e. each viewerCount) is the number of times a given word appears across a large corpus of files (so if `viewerCount1` was the count for the word 'coffee,' the first row would show what files are most relevant for that word at a glance). The goal is that very quickly, an archivist could see what files are best without having to parse textual data, etc. The preprocessing of all this data has taken place in _Mathematica_ so I would like to keep visualizations in there too (as opposed to learning Processing or another language). There are 385 files being searched here, so each of those is a long list of numbers. I have terrible handwriting, I'm afraid, but here is what I have been trying to create: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nVdOB.png) What's different in my 'dream' rather than what I have?   * Bars are more distinctive, not as flimsy   * If the value is zero, still see a little flag rectangle that can draw user to tooltip it   * spacing between the different rows, just to visually distinguish them I suspect `BarChart3D` isn't the best command for this, but I've struggled to get other visualization techniques working. Alternatively, perhaps the problem with this visualization lies before the visualization stage itself... **An Appendix for convenience:**               viewerCount1={0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 1, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10,      0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 29, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,      0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,      0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
