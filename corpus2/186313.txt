As I find that UpperCase are really readable for first letter word separation in long complex names, I tend to give some of my Linux files names with some UpperCase. Mostly executables, some directories too. But it's been a few weeks I have remarked that the huge majority off all file names in my linux distrib are lowercase... So I made some googling a moment ago, and I found this article: Linux File Names, that states one should _always_ use lowercase in the unix world, > ...It's best to _always_ use lowercase in Linux unless you can think of a > good reason to use uppercase or mixed case. Most Unix people use lowercase > almost exclusively, but aside from this "cultural" point, there's another > good reason to use lowercase.
