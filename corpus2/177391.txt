I am trying to update my resume, and I would like to count the number of "product releases" that I was directly involved in with a company. It would seem to serve as a performance metric. The problem is that I was working on the backend of a very large distributed system, like along the lines of Hadoop or other huge database. We had regular 6-month major releases and other minor releases. My manager kept saying that we "shipped" these releases, but "shipping" a product to me sounds like releasing single pieces of software, like Microsoft would ship Office 11 or something. Any ideas on "product releases" for backend service engineers, or any other type of performance metric?
