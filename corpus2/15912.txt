I'm running the Wolfram Finance Package version of Mathematica 8, under Windows 7 Professional. Any time I attempt to call `LibraryFunctionLoad`, the Kernel seems to hang; I have to kill it (Evaluation->Quit Kernel->Local) in order for any further input in the notebook to be taken into account. (When I kill it, it leaves an orphaned `java.exe` still running, which I have to kill using the Task Manager.) I originally thought it might be something to do with the way I generated the DLL, but even when giving it the name of an non- existent file, it hangs (rather than giving an error message). I was able to load and execute my program under Linux (with a demo version of Mathematica 8). What is different, and why don't I at least get an error message when the file doesn't exist? Also, I get similar symptoms when I use a `\` as a path separator, rather than a `/`, even for simpler operations like               Join[$LibraryPath, {"C:\Users\jkanze"}]
