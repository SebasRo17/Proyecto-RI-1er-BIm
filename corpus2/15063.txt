Absolute time supposedly reports the "total number of seconds" between two dates, but it does not. For example because of the leap second applied at 2012-06-30T23:59:60Z               AbsoluteTime[{2012, 7, 1}] - AbsoluteTime[{2012, 6, 29}]      should be `172,801`, but it is `172,800`. In fact, _Mathematica_ seems to ignore leap seconds altogether:               DateList[{2012, 6, 30, 23, 59, 60.5}, TimeZone -> 0]      produces `{2012, 7, 1, 5, 0, 0.5}` when it should produce `{2012, 6, 30, 23, 59, 60.5}`. Am I missing something here? How are calculations and functions, such as `AstronomicalData` that depend on accurate time specifications supposed to work? * * * _Update_ : This remains the case in version 9.0.
