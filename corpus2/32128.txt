I am trying to print a notebook that begins with a lengthy piece of code that takes up almost an entire page. Because of my heading, it doesn't quite fit on Page 1, so Mathematica inserts a line break before the cell, leaving a ton of white space on Page 1, as shown below. ![Line break before cell](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lAlaB.jpg) However, if I add a few lines, such that the input cell takes up more than one page, Mathematica is forced to insert a page break somewhere in the cell, so it does this: ![Line break within cell](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b7AVd.jpg) This looks much nicer. I want to tell Mathematica to insert page breaks whenever a cell runs off the bottom of the page, rather than only inserting page breaks within cells when it is absolutely necessary. **My attempt at a solution:** I've tried to modify the Printout stylesheet with               Cell[StyleData[All, "Printout"],       ShowAutoStyles->True, ShowSyntaxStyles->True, Magnification->0.8,      PageBreakWithin->True]      (The second line is for colored syntax printing, irrelevant to my question.) This doesn't seem to change the default behavior. I also tried, as a less-than-elegant solution, manually inserting a page break in the input cell. This is not a satisfactory solution since it splits the cell into two input cells. **EDIT (working solution, but not ideal):** I have at least figured out how to do this on a cell-by-cell basis.   1. Highlight the cell that needs a page break.   2. Press Ctrl+shift+O to open the Option Inspector, and in the dropdown menu for "Show option values", choose Selection.   3. Navigate to Cell Options->Page Breaking and set the PageBreakWithin option to True. Click Apply and close the Option Inspector. By choosing the location of the next page break strategically, I can then achieve the behavior I want. However, I would still be interested in a more general solution (rather than repeating the above steps over and over) if one exists.
