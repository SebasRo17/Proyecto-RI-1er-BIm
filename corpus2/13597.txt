I encounter a problem when saving a `LinearSolveFunction` to disk, where the LinearSolveFunction is obtained with `LinearSolve` for a non-square matrix. If I read the function object from disk, it can no longer be applied to an array. For example:               In[1]:= a = LinearSolve[{{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}}];     In[2]:= a >> "tst.m";     In[3]:= b = << "tst.m";      At this point, `a===b` and the displayed `FullForm` of a and b are equal. However:               In[4]:= a[{0, 0, 0}]     Out[4]= {0, 0}          In[5]:= b[{0, 0, 0}]     Out[5]= LinearSolveFunction[{3,2},{2,False,{{{1,0},{0,1},{1,0}}},{0,Automatic,Automatic},0}][{0,0,0}]      I am using Mathematica 8.0.4 (64bit) on Linux. Is this a bug ? Is there a good workaround ? Of course, I could avoid caching the `LinearSolve` result altogether and save only the matrix to be "inverted".
