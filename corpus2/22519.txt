I have a neurological disorder which causes me to have migraines if I look at a white computer screen. To combat this, I have put the following at the top of all of my Mathematica notebooks:               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],     Background -> RGBColor[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],     FontColor -> RGBColor[1.0, 1.0, 1.0],     FontSize -> 16     ]      This turns the background black and the letters white. However, Mathematica's built-in Syntax highlighting does not change. In order to read the Syntax Highlighing I have to manually go into: In Edit -> Preferences -> Syntax Coloring -> Other:   * Comments -> Megenta   * Strings -> Light Yellow   * Global -> Bright Blue In Edit -> Preferences -> Syntax Coloring -> Local Variables;   * The local variables of Module With -> Bright Green;   * Function arguments and patter names -> Bright Green;   * Variables made special by use in arguments -> Sky Blue; The above commands permanently change the syntax highlighting. If possible, I would like to be able make the above changes in the Mathematica Notebook so that the changes only affect the notebook I am working in. So, my question is... QUESTION: Rather than do the above steps manually, is there a command I can put at the top of the file that will make these changes for me?
