In the official Mathematica version 10.0, I get a very weird behavior when I try to rotate a 3d graphics > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/65Qz6.gif) The moment I click on the graphics to drag it, it seems like it zooms the whole graphics for a fraction of a second. I'm here on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit with Gnome 3.4.2 and an NVidia GeForce GTX 590 with NVidia driver. I have reported this to Wolfram, but do others experience this and is there any known solution to the problem?
