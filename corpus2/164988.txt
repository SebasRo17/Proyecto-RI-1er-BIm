The point of my question is to be able to educate others Well, I've seen a lot of articles and tutorials which often state "Let's mark this up in the most semantic possible way". But a strange thought came to me, **why?** Why would one need (or want) to bother with the specific elements which convey the correct semantic meaning? Specifically, I'm referring to the new HTML5 elements, such as `<time>`, `<output>`, or `<address>`. Especially, if the page "works" (it renders nicely in all browsers). Why would I want to use elements like `<time>` or `<address>`, where nothing at all (or at the worst case, a generic `<span>`) works just as nicely? I'm asking this because I'm seeing a multitude of (very popular) websites (this one included) which does not follow these so-called best practices.
