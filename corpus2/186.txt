Then there's the example in the `Scope>Texture styling` section of the doc page which is supposed to result in: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V73Wc.gif) In my case I get: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2F8j2.png). This is not a general transparency issue as               Plot3D[x^4 + y^4 - 5 x^2*y^2, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3},       PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.8], Mesh -> None]      gives me this: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lK9So.png) I'm using a 1 year old Dell XPS-15 (model L501 X)Running Windows 7-64 with an nVidia GeForce GT 435M graphics card, driver version 8.17.12.6639. I reported this earlier on Mathgroup and got the advice to update my drivers which I did and it sure helped. However this is not the end of the story as the behavior returned soon afterwards. I have updated the driver various times using both nVidia's and Dell's newest version and it always was a short-lived solution. Last time I tested it, I installed the _same_ version of the driver over the existing one and the transparent textures showed up as intended in my notebook even without re- executing the code, only to disappear after MMA's next restart. So, apparently my system is able to handle transparent textures but there is some interaction between MMA and the driver that causes this ability to be switched off. **Update** This issue seems to have been resolved in Mathematica 9. All of the above mentioned problems did not reappear when I tested them in the trial version of V9.
