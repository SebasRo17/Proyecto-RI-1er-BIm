In my pie chart, it's almost there. Can I wrap some words? like putting "Profit versus Objectives" t0 three lines, but still in the right sector.               PieChart[{1/6 - 0.02, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6 - 0.03, 1/6 + 0.03, 1/6 + 0.02},      ChartLabels -> {"Profit versus Objectives", "Profitability Level",      "Payback Period", "Relative Sales", "Relatives Profits",      "Sales versus Objectives"}, ChartStyle -> {White},      PlotLabel -> "Fianacial Performance",      BaseStyle -> {FontWeight -> "Bold", FontSize -> 11,      FontFamily -> "Helvetica"}]      Many thanks!
