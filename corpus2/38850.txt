I am looking for a good approximation to a function containing logarithms, especially at values close to zero. When I used _Mathematica_ 's `Series` command I found something unexpected. _Mathematica_ seems to expand expressions containing a logarithm differently when there is a singularity at the expansion point. For example, the function $(a+\log[x^3+x^7])/(b+x)$ has a singularity at $x=0$. If I use `Series` with an expansion point greater than zero, I get the expected Taylor expansion. However, at the expansion point zero I get $$ \frac{a + 3 \log(x)}{b} + \frac{(-a - 3 \log(x)) x}{b^2} + O(x)^2. $$ It strikes me that the logarithm is retained as a function in $x$. And this result approximates the function much better than that of a simple Taylor series. _Mathematica_ somehow separates the logarithm from the expansion, which I find quite intelligent. I would like to know what technique _Mathematica_ uses and how it is called. I never came across such a thing and would be interested in learning more about it. I understand that `Series` can use several expansions and choses an appropriate one depending on the problem, so maybe this is a special procedure to treat expressions with logarithms. I also found (with some trial and error) that Mathematica's result equals the one I would get if I first did a Taylor expansion of the expression, but treating all logarithms as constants, and then reduced all logarithmic arguments to the lowest power of $x$. Why is this justified?
