I don't understand the following:                 f[a_, b_] := a + b       ls = {1, 2, 3};       MapThread[f, {ls, {10, 20, 30}}]      This yields ( as expected ) {11,22,33} If I change the code to                 f[a_, b_] := a + b       ls = {1, 2, 3};       MapThread[f, {Dynamic[ls], {10, 20, 30}}]      mma returns the following message:                 MapThread::mptd: Object {1,2,3} at position {2, 1} in MapThread[f,{{1,2,3},{10,20,30}}] has only 0 of required 1 dimensions. >>      **Question: Why does this happen? How can it be fixed?**
