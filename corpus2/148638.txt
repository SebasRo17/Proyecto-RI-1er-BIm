A client wants me to build a Wordpress plugin similar to an app on Windows Phones. Although the app that I will build will be different in many ways (such as the UI, logos, graphics and a couple of more functions) but the basic functions will be similar to the app currently available on Windows Phone. I am doing this as a freelance project. I would like to know once I complete the development and send over the files to the client, and in case the original owner of the app on the Windows Platform comes out saying that the Wordpress plugin has a lot of features from their app. Who would be the one in trouble? Can he file a case against me or will it only be my client who will be held responsible as he will own all the rights after I send him the files and he makes a payment. Update : thank you for all your inputs and help. Much appreciated. To clarify on some of the questions raised :   1. Yes, this is a work for hire project.    2. The freelancing contract says that all rights and files including source code have to be transferred to the client after he makes the payment and thereafter he owns all the code and the app.    3. The app to be made is a utility app, but i am not sure how common such kind of an app is and whether i can really relate it to the accounting app example.   4. I am writing my own code, I have no access to the original app source
