The attchd graphics called chromograms represent a set of discrete-state, continuous-time - ie, discrete-event signals, generated with Mathematica 9 on OSX with a Cinema display. • Top 2 rows are independent signals. • Bottom two chromograms (red and green) shows the segments where the top 2 rows agree (green) in their temporal coding, and where they differ (red). So each `Rectangle`'s left and right positions are encoded by 2 timestamps (even-begin and event-end). X axis is the timeline in seconds, and this graphic shows [200,400] window. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RaVfR.png) The problem: note there are 3 red rectangles (bottom row) that have no corresponding "holes" in the complementary green signal. This is an error in Mathematica's graphics rendering because closer inspection reveals the holes to be there. The problem becomes extreme when zooming out to graph a larger time window. In the next figure the same data is shown for the window [0,1800]: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5CvNG.png) In such a stiff-scale graphic, there are many more instances of the above problem - again, closer inspection shows that the red and green event-signals partition the time-axis so red and green `Rectangle`s should never overlap. The problem is unrelated to choice of colors - flipping red and green still shows the upper signal to be problematic. So it seems Rectangles are rendered "too thick" and overlap where they shouldn't. Are there any `Option`s or methods one could use to control this issue? (Potentially generating a complementary set of interval events and actively rendering them in White may work but haven't tested this and would be a hack in any case).
