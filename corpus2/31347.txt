The spherical or circular data arises when we measure data in degree e.g wind direction, clock and compass etc. Then representation of such data we need to plot circular plot, circular histogram and rose diagram. How to plot this data? for example we have data               data={8,9,13,13,14,18,22,27,30,34,38,38,40,44,45,47,48,48,48,48,50,53,56,57,58,58,61,63,     64,64,64,65,65,68,70,73,78,78,78,83,83,88,88,88,90,92,92,93,95,96,98,100,103,106,113,118,138,     153,153,155,204,215,223,226,237,238,243,244,250,251,257,268,285,319,343,350}      These are the 76 directions measured in degree clockwise from north. The specimen of circular plot, circular histogram and rose diagram are given below ![Circular Plot data given above](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7tUxQ.png) Circular Plot (data given above) ![Circular Histogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dBCNK.png) Circular Histogram (not above data) ![Rose Diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/THvea.png) Rose Diagram (not above data) Note: Any appropriate interval is to be taken for circular histogram from the given data.
