I have been looking around for a book on designing and developing custom interfaces for iOS but I don't seem to be able to find any books on this topic and I was wondering if anyone here knew of any books on the design and development of custom iOS interfaces and applications. Also, I am not aware of any other questions asked on this site, so if there is, please do let me know and I'll vote to delete :) Thanks in advance!
