Is there a way to define a `InputField` that displays a list of options as you type? More specifically I'm looking for an `InputField` that specifically autocompletes as you type. The functionality is similar to an `InputField` and `MenuView` element. Examples of such feature would be the textbox here or here. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q9QAi.png) **EDIT:** Ideally the interface should work as much like Google's homepage as possible. Specific Features   1. Menu is **not case sensitive**   2. **Clickable items** in drop down menu   3. Ideally, the menu is **hidden** until user types into textbox   4. Restrict number of items in output. Here is some example code I am working on. It currently only meets criteria #2. **EDIT2:** Here is my next set of code which meets the following criteria: **case insensitive** , has clickable menus, and restricts the number of output. One funny thing, is that the menu isn't clickable all the way across, but only where the text is.
