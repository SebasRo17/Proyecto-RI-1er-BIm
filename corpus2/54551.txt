NIntegrate[x^2, {x, 5, 9},            Method -> {"TrapezoidalRule", "Points" -> 2, "RombergQuadrature" -> False},            MaxRecursion -> 1]      returns the value `190` while the correct trapezoid estimate is `5^2/2+6^2+7^2+8^2+9^2/2 = 202`. The correct trapezoid weights for a width 4 interval are `1/2, 1, 1, 1, 1/2`. I believe that the incorrect weights of `1, 1, 1/2, 1, 1/2` are being used instead. Similar errors are made for `TrapezoidRule` with any even number of points. For example, NIntegrate[x^2, {x, 5, 9}, Method -> {"TrapezoidalRule", "Points" -> 22}] returns warning messages about slow convergence. I reported this to Wolfram several months ago and expected to see a fix in 10.0. However, the same results appear in 10.0. So now what I'm asking is if others can verify that this really is an error in the implementation of NIntegrate or if I'm making some mistake in my analysis.
