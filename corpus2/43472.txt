FindShortestPath finds the shortest path between two vertices in an edge- weighted graph, allowing a choice between the Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford algorithms. In my (limited) understanding, both of these algorithms fall into the breadth-first category. My question is if there are accessible implementations of depth-first shortest path algorithms like A* for edge-weighted graphs in Mathematica. I am aware of the question How to display each step of an A star algorithm?, but before delving into modifying that code so as to work with weighted graphs I wanted to make sure that I don't re-invent the wheel. In fact, I haven't been able to locate an efficient implementation (using fancy data structures etc.) of A* for edge-weighted graphs in _any_ programming language, but that would probably be a question for another site.
