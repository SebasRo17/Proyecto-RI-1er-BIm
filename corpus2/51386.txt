This is an example, I plot a function and find it has a defect when x approximates 400.               Plot[Cos[.3 x] Exp[-0.01 x], {x, 0, 1000}, PlotRange -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/d9OvW.png) Another example, we calculate the orbit of planet motion. As we know, the orbit of planet is ellipse when the total energy is negative. However, if we calculate it in a long time, the result will deviate from ellipse markedly - while _Mathematica_ has no any warning or message here! The code and result showed below:               M = 4; a = 700; (*a is the total time of this simulation*)     s =          NDSolve[{x''[t] == -((GM (x[t] + 1))/((x[t] + 1)^2 + y[t]^2)^1.5),                   y''[t] == -((GM y[t])/((x[t] + 1)^2 + y[t]^2)^1.5), y[0] == 2,                   x[0] == .3, x'[0] == .2, y'[0] == -.1}, {x, y}, {t, 0, a},                   MaxSteps -> 10^8];     ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{x[t], y[t]} /. s], {t, 0, a}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/d2uOL.png) What I wonder is how to make sure _Mathematica_ 's result is exactly correct? When we find something special with _Mathematica_ , how can we know it is a new thing, or just a wrong result of _Mathematica_?
