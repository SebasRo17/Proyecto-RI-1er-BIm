I am solving a PDE using Mathematica and I would like to know how to implement the condition that the two-variable function `y[t,s]` is zero whenever `t=s`. I tried the obvious:               u[t,t]==0      or               u[s,s]==0      but Mathematica gives me the following output:               The arguments should be ordered consistently      To be more specific, I am solving the following PDE:               NDSolve[{p3D[t, s]*D[y[t, s], t, t] - v3D[t, s]*(q^2)*y[t, s] -      r3D[t, s]*D[y[t, s], t] == 0, y[t, 0] == ysol[t], y[1, 1] == 0,      y[0, s] == 0}, y, {t, 0, 1.}, {s, 0, 1}]      Where p3D,v3D,r3D and ysol[t] are known functions. I need to include the condition I mentioned inside the NDSolve. Can I do that?
