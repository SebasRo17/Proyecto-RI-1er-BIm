I want to determine if a function `f[x]` can take negative values. `f` is expensive to compute and `x` may be high-dimensional. I thought to use `FindMinimum` to minimize with respect to `x`. If the minimum is positive I have an answer. But I do not want to proceed with the costly minimization if, en route, an evaluation of `f` produces a negative value. I want to return to the calling program with the information: > `f` can achieve a negative value. How could I do this?
