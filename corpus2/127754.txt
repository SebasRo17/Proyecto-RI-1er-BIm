I'm working on 2 projects `projA` and `projB`, and both projects are maintenance projects. For `projA` there are 3 programmers and for `projB` there are 2 programmers. In each case all are working on separate points. As code documentation is very important, can you tell me which one is the better practice? Examples:                 {Author : lee    -verion 1.7    -date 30 dec  -asked by someGuy  -decription: to antialiase a line}          procedure antiAlias(thisline);       begin          //do the anti aliasing...        end;      or                  {*123}       unit testone;     ..     ..     ..              procedure antiAlias(thisline);       begin          //do the anti aliasing...        end;     ..     ..           end. //end of the unit..          {*123}       {Author : lee    -verion 1.7    -date 30 dec  -asked by someGuy  -decription: to antialiase a line}      the `{*123}` represent the point I have done for the particular unit. So the next point `{*124}` will be at the end of the unit. This is done (very rarely though) as the code looks clean without the commented part and lots of decription at the end.
