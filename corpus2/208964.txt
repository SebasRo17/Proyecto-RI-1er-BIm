I am coming from .NET to PHP. I am playing around with a long file written by someone else (called "cryptographp.inc.php"). It builds and returns an image to the browser. I want to show the image that the file returns on my Cryptocode/index.php page --like this:               <?php     include './cryptographp.inc.php';      ?>      But when I load the page, firefox returns an error saying               "The image http://localhost/Cryptocode cannot be displayed because it     contains errors"      How would I go about debugging an error like this in PHP? I am used to stepping through code in visual studio. What techniques would people use in the PHP world?
