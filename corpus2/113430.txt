I come from languages like Python or Javascript (and others that are less object-oriented) and I am trying to improve my working knowledge of Java, which I know only in a superficial way. Is it considered a bad practice to always prepend `this` to the current instance attributes? It feels more natural to me to write               ...     private String foo;          public void printFoo() {         System.out.println(this.foo);     }     ...      than               ...     private String foo;          public void printFoo() {         System.out.println(foo);     }     ...      as it helps me to distinguish instance attributes from local variables. Of course in a language like Javascript it makes more sense to always use `this`, since one can have more function nesting, hence local variables coming from larger scopes. In Java, as far as I understand, no nesting like this is possible (except for inner classes), so probably it is not a big issue. In any case, I would prefer to use `this`. Would it feel weird and not idiomatic?
