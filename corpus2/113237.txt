Regular expressions are powerful tool in programmer's arsenal, but - there are some cases when they are not a best choice, or even outright harmful. Simple example #1 is **parsing HTML with regexp** \- a known road to numerous bugs. Probably, this also attributes to parsing in general. But, are there other clearly no-go areas for regular expressions ? * * * p.s.: " _The question you're asking appears subjective and is likely to be closed._ " - thus, I want to emphasize, that i am interested in examples where usage of regexps is known to cause problems.
