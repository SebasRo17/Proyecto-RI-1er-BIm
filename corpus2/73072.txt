My Company is developing a web application, similar to GMail or Remember the Milk. We are on the verge of releasing the source code under AGPL. We are just afraid somebody will take the code and set up as a competitor. What can we do to prevent that? We were thinking to keep the code that powers our API closed, as it is the most important asset of the Company. We don't like that very much, so we would like to find alternative routes.
