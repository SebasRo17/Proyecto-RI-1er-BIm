Instead of writing a package and importing it, at the beginning of many of my .nb files I have a string of SetOptions commands which govern things like plot styling. However, when I subsequently make a CDF based on elements using those options, the CDF doesn't incorporate them. Is there an easy way to fix that?               SetOptions[Plot,       AxesStyle -> Directive[25, Thickness[.005]],        PlotStyle -> {Thickness[.005]},       ImageSize -> 550     ];     Manipulate[       Plot[x^e, {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}],       {e, 0, 5}     ]      Thanks!
