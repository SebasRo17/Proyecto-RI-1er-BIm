The site I work on is almost entirely in Javascript, it just goes back (via Ajax) to the server for authentication, database access, things like that. My boss would like me to add blogging, forum, and commenting capabilities. I don't want to implement it from scratch and I certainly don't want to integrate some HTML-generating PHP atrocity. Ideal, I'm looking for a package that does all the backend work and offers ReST interface so I can write a Javascript-based UI that integrates nicely with the existing site. Does such a thing exist?
