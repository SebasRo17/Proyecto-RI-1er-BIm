Using a CDF program running in CDF Player, is it possible to use a system dialog box, or even just an Import statement such as Import["*.CSV"], to import data from a text or comma separated file on a personal computer? I have browsed the forums and Wolfram documentation and it appears that it is not possible, but all the questions were a little bit different in one way or another. My own attempts have failed to produce a dialog box.
