Is it possible to visualize an array whose elements are angles as actual angles on a lattice grid? E.g., say, if the input is:               {{0, π, π}, {0, 0, π/2}, {π/2, 0, 3 π/3}}      then the graphical visualization of this array would be a 3x3 square lattice grid. On each node of the lattice, there will be an arrow (say, inside a circle) which shows the corresponding value from the array. In the above input, this would mean that the arrow at the first lattice-node would be 0, the second would be π, the third would be π, the fourth (i.e., the first node in the second raw of the lattice grid) would be 0, fifth 0, sixth π/2, etc.
