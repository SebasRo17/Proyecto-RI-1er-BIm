I have a file that is a table of values for r, $\theta$ and f(r,$\theta$) with r and $\theta$ being spherical coordinates, $\phi$ being 0 the whole time. The data thus looks like {{0.1,0.01,2},{0.1,0.02,2.1},{0.1,0.03,2.05},...} How do I plot this in a nice way? I do not want r- and $\theta$-axes but rather convert it to an xz-grid, I guess. Is there any neat way to do this? I just had the idea of converting the variables by myself typing this but also have no idea how to do that either. Any help is appreciated! So a little more thinking solved the problem: I read the data, create an empty array of the same size and transform coordinates by hand.               datalist = ReadList["file.dat", Number, RecordLists -> True];     data2 = Array[0, {Length[datalist], 3}];          For[i = 1, i < Length[datalist], i++,       For[j = 1, j <= 3, j++,        If[j == 1, data2[[i, j]] = datalist[[i, 1]]*Sin[datalist[[i, 2]]]];        If[j == 2, data2[[i, j]] = datalist[[i, 1]]*Cos[datalist[[i, 2]]]];        If[j == 3, data2[[i, j]] = datalist[[i, j]]]      ]     ]          ListPlot3D[data2]`      Not sure if this is the most elegant way but it worked. Thanks for the input and next time I will do my best to state the problem more clearly ;)
