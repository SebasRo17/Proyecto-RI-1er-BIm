Ill explain my problem, I am currently using an in-house install of gitorious using git. I would like to begin testing FogBugz and Kiln from Fog Creek which uses mercurial. I would like to for at a least a short while continue development using both solutions. Does anyone know of any long term serious effects of having a git and a mercurial repo in the same directory. Or is there a better way of keeping git and mercurial server in sync. Ive tried it with a test repo and I haven't seen any issues. Thanks for any help.
