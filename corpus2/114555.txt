Is there a language or language feature that can handle "when" cases? That is, whenever some condition becomes true, in any scope or context, that extra code could be specified to execute? Note that this is different from a simple `if`, which must be in a particular scope and explicitly written. This when clause would almost be like an `if` that applied to every case in the execution of the program after it.
