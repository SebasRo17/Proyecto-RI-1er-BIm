I'm new to JavaScript. I've read JavaScript: The Good Parts and half of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. Now I want to follow this advice - find the best sites and look at their code. As suggested by Crockford in Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming I want to find the best sites programmed with only JavaScript not jQuery because I want to look at their code and learn from them.
