We are a small group of 5 people that is about to start a new project. This is the first project where we will go all-in on scrum. We are struggling a bit with how we are going to establish a base for the project (frameworks and the like). Such tasks are not something the user will benifit from directly, so we are having a hard time figuring out how we write user stories for it. So in general, how do you use scrum, when you are starting a project from scratch, with no frameworks and no base library in place?
