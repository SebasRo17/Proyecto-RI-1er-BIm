In my programming career, I have written Java and PHP, Javascript and a little Ruby. I am not a CS major but got into web development from a more broad Internet Professional associates degree, which focused on Design, User Experience, and Development. I started out as Front-end Developer and quickly got great jobs working on complex applications which once I mastered the front-end world, I had the opportunity to become a Software Engineer on the projects because I understood the system and could figure out how to engineer it to do what I want. Obviously I work with most other who have CS degrees and while I may be faster at figuring out how to make the application we are working on do something, they usually understand basic concepts better than I. That being said, there are obviously language docs out there for Java and PHP but what resources are out there that tell you the best practices of writing good optimized code. Reading those docs aren't good enough to be able to write code and then show people like some of you and not get a bunch of "why didn't you do this" or "I can't believe he didn't do that. " There are a lot of blogs out there but you only find an article here and there by a person that focuses on explaining how to write better code. Or maybe I am wrong, I don't even think I am explaining this question all that clear. My main problem is, I can write code get it to work, think that it is written well but I'm not really sure. Besides just getting your code to work how do you know you have written it the preferred way that when others look at it, they say to themselve, this guy knows what he is doing :). If anyone has any specific language resources right now I would prefer PHP ones, since that is what I am working on.
