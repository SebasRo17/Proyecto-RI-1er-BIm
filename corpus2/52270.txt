I have 4 plots/schematics. They are either created with ArrayPlot[], ParametricPlot3D[] or Graphics[]. As I play with calculation resolutions their absolute sizes will change. I would like a neat way to arrange them inside a YouTube sized box (1920 x 1080) using relative positioning so that when/if they change size the final combination still looks more or less how I want. To simplify the question let's say I have:               videoBox = Graphics[{EdgeForm[Thick], White, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {1920,1080}]}];     plot1 = Graphics[{Blue, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {2, 3}]}];     plot2 = Graphics[{Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 2]}];     plot3 = Graphics[{Orange, Disk[{0, 0}, 2]}];     plot4 = Graphics[{Gray, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {2, 1}]}];     GraphicsRow[{videoBox, plot1, plot2, plot3, plot4}]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JDFnN.png) Using relative positioning I would like to combine them to look something like: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WbatV.png) Any suggestions? **Update 1** The answers and suggestions have certainly helped, but I still need more control over the positioning. For example here is the actual image I have created using the suggestions so far: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9fz0B.jpg) Close but no cigar. I would like to move the blue and red dots schematic up so that the bottom lines up with the bottom of the rectangular box plot.
