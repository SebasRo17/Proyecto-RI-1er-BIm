As can be seen from my questions, I am struggling to make Mathematica do something useful. The amount of tutorials on the Wolfram web site is a bit overwhelming, especially that I don't have too much time to read them. However, I am commuting for about 90 minutes per day, and having the Mathematica documentation (even just the one that comes with the software) in Kindle-friendly format (I'd even accept pdf) would be a great thing for me. Can I find a downloadable version of Mma docs (in pdf, or even better, in epub/mobi) anywhere?
