I have the following example for a user story with acceptance criteria. I would like to know if I am allowed to describe how the GUI must be changed to support the new feature. How much detail can acceptance criteria have? This is my example: **User Story:** As forum administrator I will connect persons in groups, so that people can get organized. **Acceptance Criteria:**   1. The creation of a person group happens below a person group pool (person group pool is an object also visually available in the current software system)   2. The creation happens with a context menu of the persongroup pool. Below the pool one can create new groups.   3. A person group contains: person group-ID, description, remark May that be relevant an right acceptance criteria? Because I describe how you can create a new group by opening a context menu.
