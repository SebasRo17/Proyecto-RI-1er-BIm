I have to create an Adapter between two software (mech. simulation, non-cs). Assuming we have a class named `ThatThing`. I have to handle various vendor specific implementations. These versions don't have meaningful names (unlike eclipse helios, indigo etc.). **1\. How should I name a class that should express version number?** I find class like `ThatThing_3_6_Impl`, `ThatThing_3_7_Impl` quite awkward.
