For fun, I like to use `Trace` with option `TraceInternal->True` to see if I figure how some of the commands work internally. I just noticed something strange. In Version 9, I got lots of what seem like error messages that I do not get in Version 8. This example below is using `Plot` (I have not tried many other commands, will do that later). Consider the most basic plot. See the difference in Trace between V8 and V9:                  Trace[Print@Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}], TraceInternal -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qAwyF.png) ofcourse, the command works just fine at the end in V9, and one gets the plot. So these messages do not affect the final result, and hence, from a user point of view, one can argue that they should not matter as long as the final result is the same. They could be some internal trace messages that are left there in final build or such? I am just curious, that is all, if someone might know what they could mean, since they do indicate some sort of an error condition, yet final plot is just fine.
