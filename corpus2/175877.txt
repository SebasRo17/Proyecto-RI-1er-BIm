I'm currently thinking about a project for my masters degree graduation. I start researching for options to make my own video streaming software based on a premade hardware kit having not much knowledge about what I'll exactly need that will match my needs. My search led me to the `DVR` `(Digital Video Recorder)` cards which seems to be the closest to what I need, but still I can't find out a few basic things so I decide to ask for them here. Currently I haven't find a lot of manufacturers that offers such kits so where I can look and have some options to choose from? There are a lot of `DVR` products on the market but they already have a software written for them and even if I buy one they just don't give any documentation or sdk's so buying such is not an option I need a DVR card made exactly for software programers and not end users. Are there a preferred manufacturers that provide such kind of devices with good and developer-friendly documentation? Also - I prefer to do all this with Java, is this an option (I think I will make it with .NET too but really prefer Java as a language of choice)
