I've been developing on multiple platforms for years, including Java, PHP, Flash/Flex, ASP.NET (including MVC), Ruby on Rails, and many others. I've decided (for various reasons) that it's time to pick one technology to learn deep, instead of learning many technologies wide; and I chose .NET. I've decided that one crucial move will be to grab some Microsoft certifications -- if only to show that I'm serious about this as my technology of choice. But **how do I choose which certification to take?** There are several of them, with similar-sounding descriptions. Although I will probably choose between **the windows and web versions of the MCPD.** I'm targeting team lead and project-manager style jobs, if that helps. **Edit:** The reason I want to do certification is because my resume reads as:   * 3 years JEE   * 3 years C++   * 2.5 years Flash/Flex   * 2 years .NET   * 1 year Ruby on Rails   * 1 year PHP When I say I have "ten years of experience" and apply for a job that says "5+ years of experience in .NET," I know I can learn and do the work. But I don't have those five years; I gave them to Flex, C++, and JEE. I think considering my specific situation, a certification is a (small) step in the right direction.
