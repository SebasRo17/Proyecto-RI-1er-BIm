What technologies, techniques and mindsets would be most beneficial to web developers? I'm a relatively new developer with only 3 months working for an actual web development company. Since I've started, I've learned the wonderful world of version control using Git and how useful the command line can be. I've also learned the world of good a decent editor such as Eclipse can do with it's RegEx Search and Find and few other features I actually use. What I'm wondering is what are some other things you've learned over the years that have been been really helpful and might apply to a web developer? I work primarily in PHP and front end languages (HTML/CSS/JS).
