My buddy told me today that some programmers transform a checked exception (e.g. EJBException, SQLException...) to an unchecked (RuntimeException?) My buddy explained a call stack where if you change the bottom of the stack you would have to change every method that calls it if you change the bottom (innermost) method. Can you elaborate and/or examplify with code more in detail or did I misunderstand something? I don't think that I have had that problem since I never wrote `throws`.
