My software development team at work has various communication issues that resulted in management having the perception that the systems they have in place are working well... when they are not. While fixing the lack of communication is also something I dream of doing, I am asking specifically about both technical and social aspects of monitoring the mood of the team on various issues. The team is composed of roughly 4 groups of 5 developers at sites around the world. Each site is primarily working on separate projects that are built on some common embedded hardware and low-level libraries. There is certainly opportunity for more shared higher level libraries but they do not exist as such at present. I envision raising a topic and requesting that each team member anonymously provide feedback on two axes: how much does this affect you and how positively or negatively. This should help figure out which areas we are succeeding at and which are having a significantly negative impact. Hopefully developers could respond in less than 30 seconds. Am I heading in the right direction to figure out what the team should spend more time improving?
