Say I had a function like the following:               f[n_] := Sum[a + Subscript[b, k], {k, 0, n}]      Such that `f[5] == 6 a + Subscript[b, 0] + Subscript[b, 1] + Subscript[b, 2] + Subscript[b, 3] + Subscript[b, 4] + Subscript[b, 5]` How would I go about minimizing `f` with respect to both a and all of the subscripted bs? How would I go about minimizing `f[5]` without manually supplying `{a, Subscript[b, 0], Subscript[b, 1], Subscript[b, 2], Subscript[b, 3], Subscript[b, 4], Subscript[b, 5]}` as the vars param? I'm asking about a specific simplified case here, but hopefully answers will be applicable in the general case and to other functions that take a vars param other than Minimize[]
