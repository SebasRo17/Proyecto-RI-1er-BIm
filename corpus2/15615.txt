This is no _Mathematica_ -language specific question but rather a network problem, so if this is the wrong place to ask, I apologize. I am running _Mathematica_ on Windows 7, the license manager `mathlm` is running in a local network. How can I access _Mathematica_ when being outside the local network. Is there some tool like license checkout for let's say two hours? If this is not possible with _Mathematica_ , is there some way to forward the ports for license manager via `ssh` and are there problems/restrictions with Windows 7? Btw, contacting the server via `ssh` is possible.
