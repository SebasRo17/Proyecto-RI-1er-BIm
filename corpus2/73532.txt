There are lots of great books and resources out there about managing new software developments, but very little that I've seen about managing ongoing maintenance of software systems. I'm not talking about big enhancements, I'm talking about the little 1 or 2 day bug fixes and updates that quickly accumulate once a system goes into production. Any recommended books or other resources on this subject?
