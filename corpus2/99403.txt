I have the following problem: I'm developing a software for data visualization where I get a graph structure and represent it in 3D space. So far, I've been using force-based algorithms to draw graphs and it worked well, until I got requirement that my software should represent very big number of vertices and edges (few millions). It would be very impractical to hold all those in memory, so I'm looking for an algorithm that will enable me to stream small portions of graph as I "walk" through the space. However, the main problem is in showing and dynamically repositioning of vertices, since I don't have already predefined positions, and I must calculate them. Can you point me to some algorithms for incremental drawing and streaming of graph? Thanks in advance!
