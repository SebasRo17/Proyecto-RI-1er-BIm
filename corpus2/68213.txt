**In a typical SDLC** there isn't much mention of the word production or development or the distinction between the two.These seem more of a real time , industrial driven concepts . I have come across these terms in regards describing companies. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BCwJy.jpg) As i understand Production in Software does not necessarily mean product development.Inspired from the question Why do we call it “production”? I came to question the basic distinction between the two i.e **development and production in regards to software**. I used to be under the impression it was just a way of describing the development process in a product development company.   * **Question 1: What is the distinction between the two?**   * **Question 2: How widely are these terms used? and are they properly understood and distinguished ?**
