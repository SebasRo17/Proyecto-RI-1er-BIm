Suppose I have a `DynamicModule` with all sorts of controls to set some parameters for a graphics object.               DynamicModule[{a = 0, b = 0},       Column[{         Slider[Dynamic[a]],         Slider[Dynamic[b]],         Dynamic[Plot[Sin[(a + 1) t + \[Pi] b], {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]}]]       }]     ]      This graph is updated every time one of the dynamic parameters change. Now pretend my graphics is a really slow 3D plot. How can I construct it so that it only renders the graphic when I tell it to? A button? A mouse event?
