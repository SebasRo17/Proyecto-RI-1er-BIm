I'm a python & Qt programmer and my day job is create small GUI programs to ship with hardware devices. However, my job is pretty basic: read/write data to the device through a serial port using pyserial, and display and edit data using PyQt and PyQwt. Because of how basic this job is, I'm not confident there's a lot of job security here. What can I do to improve my skills in this area?
