I have a function               V[a_, h_, tau_] := (Sqrt[3]/2) h (Sqrt[3] a + h/3 tau)^2      now I want to check, whether its first derivative is zero in a given point. Say for the solution               {a -> 8.47344, h -> 1.67718, tau -> 12.9438}      I tried               Dt[V[a, h, t], a, h, tau] /. {a -> 8.47344, h -> 1.67718, tau -> 12.9438}       Is this the proper way to show that? I use `V` in a system of equations, which I am trying to solve with Newton's method.
