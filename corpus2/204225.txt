I have an embedded linux c application that runs with a simple CLI. I am now tasked with creating a GUI that accomplishes the same functionality as the command line program. I am not an accomplished GUI designer and the majority if my experience is in deeply embedded c coding. My initial thought is to use qtcreator to create the GUI, but there are several issues I'm ruminating over.   * Moving forward I want to maintain both the CL program and the GUI program, and preferably even have them be the exact same executable that can be launched in either mode. Unless this is a bad idea?   * My code is in C so far, and qt is natively c++   * I would like a direct correlation where button presses in the GUI call the same functions that I call from the CLI   * How do I best do this cleanly and efficiently? Is there some other thecnology or library that simplifies this? I don't have to use qt if there is something better.
