What apsects of Java are the most diificult to learn when coming from such a background? What common mistakes do people make ? What are the top timesaving and produtivtity increasing tricks ? If you had a room of C/PHP coders who were about to start development using Java what advise would you give ? This is my list of topics so far (in no particular order):   * Use jodatime instead of the standard library , and also less importantly the guava library.   * Arrays are zero indexed   * I'd also highlight the pass-by-value/reference aspects of Java, and the fact that > >     String s1 = new String("test"); >     String s2 = new String("test"); >     if(s1 == s2) // will be false >     if(s1.equals(s2)) // will be true >     * Introduce the concept of design patterns and give a quick overview.   * Introduce Spring (it will be used) and the concept of dependency injection Is there anything obvious I am missing.
