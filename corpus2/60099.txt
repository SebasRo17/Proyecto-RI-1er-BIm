So far, I've been writing projects for my friends and friends of my friends, which required no legal stuff. Now I've moved on to freelance programming on websites like vworker.com and I'm wondering what should I put in the comments on top of the code. I'm not doing big, serious serious projects, just frontends and scrapers/bots for what I gather is personal use. Would my usual `// Written by Igor Marvinsky, 2011` be enough?
