I need help with organizing my arguments for why it's MADNESS to develop against production data. **Backstory:** I started working here six months ago and I noticed we're developing directly against production data. The codebase is local, but the database we're connected to is live data! So i have to be super careful constantly when doing update/store operations, so that I don't break anything. We have an annual software meeting soon and I want to raise my concerns, and come loaded with arguments but I have a really hard time coming up with good solid points to something that's should be obvious as this. It's as if they would ask me to come up with arguments to why I need to breathe. **My Question:** What arguments are there for NOT developing on production database directly?
