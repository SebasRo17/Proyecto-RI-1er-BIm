Hey I an working on the product which is live at multiple portals. The product is developed in GWT, JAVA, Hibernate. **My question is :** Whether there is any alternative of using property file in java. **My Requirement :**   1. For one property key there are multiple values in live portal for each different portal.   2. Each time I change property file, I need to make the war again.   3. The loading of any of the property should not be time-consuming. Any help or suggession would be apprecialble !!!
