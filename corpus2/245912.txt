I have a REST API that looks something like the below where a person can belong to an organisation (but doesn't have to) and a person has many items. The items may also belong to the organisation instead of the person.               /people/:personId     /people/:personId/items     /organisations/:orgId/items     /organisations/:orgId/people/:personId/items      There is a scenario where we want to query the items for multiple people within an organisation, what's the correct URL structure to use? ### Option 1               /organisations/:orgId/people/items?personId=1&personId=2      ### Option 2               /organisations/:orgId/items?personId=1&personId=2      ### Option 3               /items?personId=1&personId=2
