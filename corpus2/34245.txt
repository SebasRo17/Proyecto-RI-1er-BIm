I'm trying to plot an implicit function satisfying a complex transcendental equation. The code is the following:               ContourPlot[(e (-1 + e^2) l (-3 + 2 e^2 - l^2) Cosh[2 Sqrt[1 - e^2]] +        (-1 + e^2) (-1 + l^2) (e l Cos[2] - I (1 + l^2) Sin[2]) + Sqrt[1 - e^2]       (I - I l^4 - 2 e (-2 + e^2) l Sqrt[-e^2 + l^2]) Sinh[2 Sqrt[1 - e^2]]) == 0,        {l, 1, 2}, {e, -2, 2}]      I need a real solution of `e` as a function of `l` and also `e<=Min{1,l}`. I don't know why it's empty in the plot. I don't think it's because the solution is out of the range since I tried `l=1`, and there are several solutions, one of which is `e = 0`. Thus I think there must be something wrong with the plot.
