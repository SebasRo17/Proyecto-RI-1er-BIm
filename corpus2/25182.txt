I am having a rather unusual problem I do not understand with Mathematica where renaming one of the variables of my function causes the function to stop "working". Here is the example of the code doing what it should:               F[t_, a_, b_, l_] = x[t] /. First@     DSolve[{x'[t] == a*x[t]*(1 - (x[t]/b)) - l*x[t], x[0] == 0.4}, x[t], t];      Changing one variable name causes the code to throw out error messages. The non-working code is               F[t_, r_, b_, l_] = x[t] /. First@ DSolve[{x'[t] == r*x[t]*(1 -     (x[t]/b)) - l*x[t], x[0] == 0.4}, x[t], t];
