I started doing Android mobile development (with a partner) sometime ago. I do this in part time. I'm trying to find out how to display this information in my CV, since I believe it is relevant for the development jobs which I'm searching for (not only due to the Java/Android experience that I aquired but also in terms of showing some personality traits). I could place it in the "Professional Experience" section, but I fear that it could "flaky" (i.e. trying to pass a hobby around as real experience). Although it actually is real experience... Any suggestions? Thanks in advance. PS: I'm asking this because I did place it as a normal "job" entry in my CV (it contains a link for the startup's website which contains a description aboutthe product/app, and so on). Last week I had an interview and got questioned on it. Namely, the usage of the "founder" expression seamed to intrigue the HR lady. So I'm wondering if this may raise strange vibes or may look like I'm faking some experience.
