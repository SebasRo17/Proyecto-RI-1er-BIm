I've read books on design, I troll the internet for articles on best practices and software design principles. However, I always seem to struggle to put into practice the kind of suggestions and techniques supplied. My question is. What kind of things do you ask yourself when you are designing an application/class/method location/property location etc that helps ensure you come up with something that is, although not perhaps perfect, is good enough that you are happy with the result. For example, when trying to decide between putting a property on an object how do you decide whether the code that might use that object should be part of the class that contains it or exposed so other classes can use it. i.e. how do you decide who owns and responsible for a certain logic/property. I realise there are things like SOLID that you can apply, but I'm looking for techniques and thought processes people often go though in order to get to the end design that applies these principles. NOTE: I'm not looking at getting links to books or internet articles necessarily as these I look at quite regularly. I'm really after peoples read world practices on how they go about day to day resolving class and application design issues they come across. Thanks alot.
