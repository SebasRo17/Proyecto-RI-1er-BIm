I'm always trying to hone my résumé to the bare-bones essentials -- no fluff. I want to keep as many points as possible to a single line, and to this end I have used the term _WinForms_ in several places. I wanted to check my capitalization against other examples, but this term is not used on the official http://www.windowsclient.net site; it doesn't even appear in the Wikipedia entry. Can I reasonably expect someone looking for a .NET developer to _get_ that? Even if they're looking for web developers? Would you write it as I have (WinForms)?
