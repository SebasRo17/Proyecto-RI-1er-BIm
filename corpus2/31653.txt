I'm trying to get this piece of code to work:               Panel[      DynamicModule[{f = x, g = -x},       xmax = 10;       Column[{        InputField[Dynamic[f], ContinuousAction -> True],         InputField[Dynamic[g]],         Dynamic[ Show[Plot[{f, g}, {x, -xmax, xmax}, AspectRatio -> 1,                                   PlotRange -> {{-xmax, xmax}, {-xmax, xmax}}]                     ]               ]             }]                   ]          ]      This works and updates dynamically the graphs of `f` and `g`. Now, I would like to add the intersections, dynamically, if any (so with a `IF` testing), and I tried different things, without success:               solution = Dynamic[Solve[f == g, {x,y}]      gives me indeed the dynamically updated solution. But I can't use this information to plot points, nor even get `Length[solution]` update dynamically... Any help with this?
