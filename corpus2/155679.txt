Is there any difference between the two topics? I have seen companies asking for _Good Programming knowledge_ some _Good Programming logic_. I have seen this in Job profiles for a developer â€“ for e.g. "good Programming logic", "strong Programming knowledge". I believe that Programming knowledge is related to knowledge about the language in consideration and Programming logic is problem solving logic using programming (in general).   Please correct me if I am wrong. Also what is more important? **Edit:** Do selection of components for application, designing interfaces validating user inputs fall under programming knowledge or Programming logic?   Does programming logic simply imply problem solving, or is there anything else which it should comprise of?
