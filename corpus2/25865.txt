I currently have a large system autonomous differential equations. I've indexed a more managable dummy system of identical form, using `Part` to reference each individual equation, so:               eqns = {c1' == -kf*c1 + kr*c2, c2 == kf*z1 - kr*z2 - kf*c2, c3' == kp*c2}      with _each_ LHS denoted `cn'` where n ranges from 0 to 3 (or the # of equations). Inputting `eqns[[1]]` yields:               c1' == -a kf + b kr      Whereas inputting `FullSimplify @ eqns[[1]]`yields `kf c1 + c1' == kr c2`. Does anyone know a way to specify that the format ought be maintained, ie. **_`Some Input`_** which would isolate c1' in the `FullSimplify` term, or yield `c1' == kr c2 - kf c1` This sounds petty and _is_ in this dummy example, but isn't for larger systems. Thank you in advance. **_Edit:_** I've spent awhile digging around online and in the help to no avail other than _possibly_ changing my notation format, which would render my future use of NDSolve, where I hope to use the shorthand of `eqns`, problematic given Mathematica's understanding of prime notation for derivatives. (Also, another complication in changing the LHS notation of `c1', ..., cn'` is in that each is an implicit (rather than explicit) function of (t) ( _see my attached link in line 1)_ , and so in NDSolve each `cn'` and `cn` must be appended with a `[t]` on the end at some point in the `NDSolve` function.
