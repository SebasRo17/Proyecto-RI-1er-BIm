How come this doesn't work as I intended?               s[{x0_, y0_}, a_, v_] := NDSolveValue[{        x'[t] == vx[t], WhenEvent[x[t] > 0, vx[t] -> -vx[t]],        y'[t] == vy[t] - t, WhenEvent[y[t] < 0, vy[t] -> -vy[t]],        x[0] == x0, vx[0] == v Cos@a,        y[0] == y0, vy[0] == v Sin@a},       {x[t], y[t]}, {t, 0, 10},       DiscreteVariables -> {vx, vy}]      Simulating falling and bouncing of a 2D mass point.               With[{r0 = {-5, 7}},      ParametricPlot[Evaluate@s[r0, -.9, 2],       {t, 0, 10},       PlotRange -> {{-10, 10}, {-10, 10}},       Epilog -> {Point@r0}]]      ![Fall](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WgExY.png) I can't understand why it doesn't bounce on the x-axis first, and what _does_ happen there anyway? Event `x[t]>0` works fine.
