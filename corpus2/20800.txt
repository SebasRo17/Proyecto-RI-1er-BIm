When I query Wolfram | Alpha with "city in orange county, california", it returns the first four results with a note that there are "42 total". I can then hit the "more" button until all 42 are visible. I tried to get the same 42 results as computable data, in Mathematica 9.0.1.0, with this:               WolframAlpha["city in orange county, california", "ComputableData"]      which returns a list of the four items that initially come up when I ran the query on the Wolfram Alpha website:               {"Santa Ana", "Anaheim", "Irvine", "Huntington Beach", "Garden Grove"}      I've been sifting through online documentation and Google but haven't been able to figure out how to get all 42 cities. Any hints?
