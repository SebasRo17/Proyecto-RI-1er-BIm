Leaving the whole _pie_ to only a few of them, amplifying the huge differences between the two status. Pay is a (huge) one, not having to do overtime is another. I leave the question open to hopefully get many great answers on all the different subjects that affects that feeling and decision not to go. **EDIT** : While this question is really global, I'll be interested in any studies, facts, articles, opinions regarding local markets such as US, India and even Australia in which I'm in love with. **EDIT2** : Bounty of 500 points for anyone that will come with recent studies on the subject. If multiple answers, will pick the one with the most upvotes.
