I've a functional test using `Junit` which tests delivery of xml file to an end-point. XML file is sent by client, so I copied it to a test folder, read it from there in my test and do asserts. We have 10-20 such files with different data but same format, my architect wants me to copy all of them into same folder, loop through them in same test, just to make sure that they are delivered successfully. Note, I am not testing any data validations in this test just successful delivery. I am not sure if its a good idea to loop through multiple files in a single test in my case because if one fails rest will not be executed and also not convinced for writing 20 tests doing exactly same thing. Please advice
