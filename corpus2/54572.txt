I am facing a problem in evaluating infinite sums of the following form. As a first thing define the following function               Z[n_] := Product[1/(1 - t^i), {i, 1, n}]          P[list_] := (num = Union[list]; Product[Z[Count[list, num[[i]]]], {i, 1, Length[num]}])      Then consider a sum of the following kind               Sum[P[{i, j}]*t^(-i - j), {i, 0, \[Infinity]}, {j, 0, \[Infinity]}]      Now, Mathematica behaves in a strange way: it considers the P[{i,j}] factor as if i is always different than j. This does not make sense, since for example I am summing over the couples (2,2) and (3,3). I believe the problem relies in the way the infinity is considered, since everything works fine with arbitrary high finite sums. What could I do?
