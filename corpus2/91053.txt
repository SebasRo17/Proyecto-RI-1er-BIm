The company I work for has a legacy application that we are looking at rewriting and enhancing using more modern technology. We are a very small company (5 people) and do not have the resources to hire a full time permanent architect so we are looking to hire an architect as a consultant for a short term (about 6 months) engagement to help us design the software and then we will take care of (or use additional staff augmentation) of developing based on the design. We have compiled a list of general high level requirements as well as some other lists of more specific functional requirements. How feasible is what we are trying to do? What kinds of information should we have prepared so that we can provide enough information to potential candidates for them to determine if they will be able to come up with a design for us that we can take over and develop from? What should we ask for from them to base our hire decision on?
