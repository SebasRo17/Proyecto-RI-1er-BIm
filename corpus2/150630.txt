I read through Kathy Sierra's SCJP study guide and I will read it again more throughly to improve myself as a Java programmer and be able to take the certification either Java 6 or wait for the Java 7 exam (I'm already employed as Java developer so I'm in no hurry to take the exam.) Now I wonder why reflection is not on the exam? The book it seems covers everything that should be on the exam and AFAIK reflection is at least as important as threads if not more used inpractice since many frameworks use reflection. Do you know why reflection is not part of the SCJP? Do you agree that it's at least important to know reflection as threads? Thanks for any answer
