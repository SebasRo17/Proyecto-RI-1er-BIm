Among other things, .NET's Reactive Extensions simplify concurrency management. From what I've heard, .NET 4.5 will simplify concurrency management with things like the `await` keyword. My Question:   * Will .NET 4.5 make the Reactive Extensions obsolete?   * Or is Microsoft expected to pitch the .NET 4.5 additions as an alternative way to approach asynchronous and concurrent programming?
