I am considering using JRuby in a project which would need to talk to some Java. From what I am reading about JRuby I am not noticing that it is missing anything that the standard Ruby has. Is that true? Does JRuby have everything the original Ruby has and also the JVM on top of it? Or is there something missing in JRuby and using it necessitates some benefit trade-off to some degree? Thanks! Alex
