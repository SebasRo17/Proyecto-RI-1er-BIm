My web application is currently written in JSP/Java, using an Oracle DB. I develop on Windows, and I use JDeveloper (Oracle's eclipse clone) and I use JDev's integrated WebLogic Server. I want to go live using a respectable Web hosting company. LAMP devs get all the girls, I'm stuck using WWOJ (Windows Weblogic Oracle Java). I can't find any hosts that use Oracle, and ones that run Tomcat are few and far between (short of a custom box on RackSpace). I'm switching to MySQL this week. I'm running Tomcat on my Windows box now, and using NetBeans. I can compile a .war now. I'm finally up to WTMJ :) Does anyone have experience with getting a Java project hosted? Or something with an Oracle backend? I feel like I'm lost out here.
