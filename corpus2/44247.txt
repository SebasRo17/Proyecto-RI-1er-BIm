The following code displays three solutions to the logistic ODE with an animated points that follow the solutions.. My goal is to project the solutions on to a vertical phase line. I need to be able to create a phase line of exactly length as the x-axis and have the projected solutions move appropriately. As you can see my projections do not lie on a fixed length copy of the x-axis. Additionally, I want to plot fixed points at x=0 and x=1 and be able to set any color I want to the fixed and moving points. The phase line needs to be closer to the tx-plot as well. Finally, I'd like to be able vary the parameter r and the initial value x0 in the solution formula (see Initialization code) Please help relieve my frustration.
