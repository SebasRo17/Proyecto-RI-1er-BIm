A couple of weeks I got my first Java assignment in my first career job and my partner and I are working through the requirements. I'm mostly shadowing him and learning (awesome!) and it's been great to see how he works. One thing that I noticed that I never even thought of was how to build an application from the ground up. I mean I understand the software life cycle and all, but actually implementing in the real world was very much so different that I imagined. As an example, we have a requirement where one object has many objects and I had no clue how to implement that and he was like (with his 20 years experience), "Oh that's just an ArrayList<> of objects within this class. How can I get like that? Is it just an experience thing or are there good reference books on how to WRITE good code? I mean, I understand the basics of programming, but putting together an entire app just baffles me. Can someone please advise me on how to proceed? I hope this makes sense...
