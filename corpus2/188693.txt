I would like to have a menu like this in surfdome. I don't mean the UI but the flexibility of this menu. I will try to explain it. I have some products. I want to match these products with some categories and have multiple type of menus based on these categories. e.g. _(in [] are the categories and in () are the products)_ A menu like               [Men] -> [Shoes] -> [Running] -> (Product1)     [Men] -> [Accessories] -> [Running] -> (Product2)     [Women] -> [Shoes] -> [Running] -> (Product3)     [Women] -> [Accessories] -> [Running] -> (Product4)      or               [Running] -> [Men] ->[Shoes] -> (Product1)     [Running] -> [Women] -> [Shoes] -> (Product3)     [Running] -> [Men] -> [Accessories] -> (Product2)     [Running] -> [Women] -> [Accessories] -> (Product4)      or               [Shoes] -> [Men] ->[Running] -> (Product1)     [Shoes] -> [Women] -> [Running] -> (Product3)     [Accessories] -> [Men] -> [Running] -> (Product2)     [Accessories] -> [Women] -> [Running] -> (Product4)      ... What i think it could be done with a `tag system`, but i would like to ask if anyone know a way to do it?
