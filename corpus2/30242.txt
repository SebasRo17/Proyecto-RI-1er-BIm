I have a problem in solving a type of PDE. The actual problem involves diffusion and adsorption in a trench, but here is a simpler example. I have two independent variables $t$ and $x$. There are two dependent variables $y(t,x)$ and $z(t)$. Note that $z$ is a function of $t$ only. `NDSolve` does not accept the problem with the boundary conditions. Running this code               ClearAll["Global`*"];          pdeset = {D[y[t, x], t] == -D[y[t, x], x] + z[t], D[z[t], t] == y[t, 0]};     bc1 = {y[t, 0] == 5, y[0, x] == Cos[x]};     bc2 = {z[0] == 1};          bcAll = Flatten[{bc1, bc2}, 1];          sol = NDSolve[{pdeset, bcAll}, {y, z}, {t, 0, 1}, {x, 0, 1}]      I get the error message saying > >     NDSolve::ndode: Input is not an ordinary differential equation. >   I am using _Mathematica_ 9.0 on Windows 7 64 bit.
