First off, not my phrase: http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/11/to- code-quickly.php Props to Mr. Markham. BUT, it got me to thinking about a lot of questions I have seen about being able to get things done. The approach advocated (setting a timer for a set period, in this case 50 minutes, but I've seen people talk about breaking procrastination by setting times as short as five minutes on tasks that you just cannot bring yourself to do, and then taking a short break) seems to be common sense, but lots of people advocate getting into the "zone" and staying there as long as possible, maybe many hours, rather than break their groove. I keep trying different approaches and find that each has its own strengths and weaknesses. What kind of technique do you use to be more EFFECTIVE (i.e., getting work done to the quality level demanded by your client / boss / etc. in the time frame allowed) in your software development and not just to spend more time at the keyboard?
