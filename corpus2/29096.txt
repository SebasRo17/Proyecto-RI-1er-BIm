How can I export a histogram without rasterising it? The labels and axes seem unaffected, but the bars themselves are pixelated when I zoom into them in a PDF viewer. For example, if I run               Export["~/test.pdf", Histogram@RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], 1000]];      I get a PDF that looks like this when zoomed in: ![Histogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wz3Q2.png) This is a problem when I try to run it through `pdf2ps` and `ps2pdf` (to work around some font problems when including the PDFs in a LaTeX document), since the whole image gets rasterised, including the text.
