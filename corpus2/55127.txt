Considering this image: ![](http://i.imgur.com/Y87duSz.jpg) Is there a way to colorize each tiles independently? My problem is that               img = Import["http://i.imgur.com/Y87duSz.jpg"];     Colorize@img      gives ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ENWxM.png) where polygons with very light colours are merged. Note that `EdgeDetect[img, 1, .05]` produces: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v4q0C.png) if it can help. * * * **Ideally** , the idea would be to colour the tiles independently (`Colorize` colours them in terms of their "blackness"). That would imply that one detects the polygons and recreate them, which is harder than "only" colouring them in terms of their pre-existing colours. Please note I have absolutely no knowledge in image-processing.
