How could I make a pacman drink beer in Mathematica? This is what I have so far               pacman[xposFun_, angleFun_] := {Yellow,         Disk[{Dynamic@xposFun[Clock[{0, Infinity}]], 0`}, 1`,          Dynamic[{Pi/6 Abs@Sin[2 Pi Clock[]],             angleFun[Clock[{0, Infinity}]]} /. {val_, ang_} :> {val + ang,              2 Pi - val}]]};          burp := Quiet@EmitSound@ListPlay@Upsample[ConstantArray[1, 80], 200]          xpos[t_] := \[Piecewise] {         {5 t, 0 < t < 3},         {15, t >= 3},         {0, True}        };          angle[t_] := \[Piecewise] {        {0, 0 < t < 3},        {Pi/4 (t - 3), 3 < t < 4.8},        {Pi/4 (4.8 - 3), t > 4.8}       }          angleBeer[t_] := \[Piecewise] {        {0, 0 < t < 3.5},        {Pi/4 (t - 3.5), 3.5 < t < 5.3},        {Pi/4 (5.3 - 3.5), t > 5.3}       }          beer[filling_] := {{Opacity[0.2], EdgeForm[Directive[Thick, Gray]],          Polygon[{{0`, 0`}, {1`, 0`}, {1.2, 1.5}, {-0.2, 1.5}}]},        Opacity[0.8], filling, EdgeForm[Directive[White, Thickness[0.01]]],         Scale[{Polygon[{{0`, 0`}, {1`, 0`}, {1.2, 1.3}, {-0.2, 1.3}}],          White,           Polygon[{{-0.2, 1.3}, {1.2, 1.3}, {1.3, 1.6}, {-0.3, 1.6}}]},          0.9],        {Opacity[0.], EdgeForm[Directive[Gray, Thickness[0.01]]],          Disk[{1.1`, 0.7`}, 0.3, {-Pi/2 - 0.2, Pi/2 - 0.2}]}};          Graphics[{pacman[xpos, angle],        Translate[        Rotate[beer[          Dynamic[If[Clock[{0, 5.4}, 5.4, 1] < 5.4, Darker@Yellow,             If[Clock[{0, 7.4, 1}, 7.4, 1] == 7.4, Refresh[burp, None]];             Opacity[0.]]]],          Dynamic@angleBeer[Clock[{0, Infinity}]]], {16, -0.2}]},       PlotRange -> {{0, 20}, {-1.2, 2}}, Background -> Black]           Animator@Dynamic@anything      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xbDcN.gif) Now, this serves as an excuse to ask the real question. This is an issue I've also had with version 8 but that I didn't have a reproducible small code for it. I see the dynamic animation is choppy but it gets fixed while any `Animator` is running on display dynamically updating something, like the `Animator@Dynamic@anything` that the code above displays after the pacman. For testing, you can get the animation to restart, by copying and pasting the cell in the same place. Once the pacman is moving, try starting and stopping the animator to see the difference in choppiness. Furthermore, changing the `DynamicUpdateInterval` in the `SystemOption`s can make this improve but it's always choppier without the animator, as if without it it always missed some frames... Do you see this behaviour too? How could I tell the front end "heyy, an animation is happening even if I'm not using an animator"?
