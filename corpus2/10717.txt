I would like to Import files from an FTP site. The code below works on a test site:               file = Import["ftp://test:test@ftp.secureftp-test.com/pigs.xml"];      But when I try to Import from a commercial site using similar code:               file = Import["ftp://user:pwrd@hosted.datascope.reuters.com/fldr/fname.csv"]      I get "FetchURL::conopen: The connection to URL [address above] cannot be opened. If the URL is correct, you might need to configure your firewall program, or you might need to set a proxy in the Internet connectivity tab of the Preferences dialog (or by calling SetInternetProxy). For HTTPS connections, you might need to inspect the authenticity of the server's SSL certificate and choose to accept it." If I paste the same ftp string into a browser it loads the file I want. What's wrong here? @halirutan-I think I am using the correct user name and password.   @J.M.-I'm using Win7.   @celtschi-I saw a the back slash too at some point. I think I deleted it to get the browser to work; don't remember clearly.   @all-Thanks for all this effort. I'm trying to digest this feedback.   @all-Tried again with various combinations of Element specifications with no success.   Also attempted to get a file list with no success.
