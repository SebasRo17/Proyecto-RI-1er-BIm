Say I have an equation:               eq = ax + by + c == 0      and I want to run `NSolve` on a set of equations of this form, for example:               NSolve[{5x + 7y - 6, 9x - 2y + 3}]      How can I use the single definition of `eq` above to do this, by replacing `a`, `b` and `c` with the required values? It is ok to write it manually in NSolve for a simple example as above, but the real equation I will be doing this with has many more terms, and I will be solving a set of 8 equations! Overall it'd be great if I could take a single equation like `eq` above, and then a list of the values that I want to be used (eg. a list of values for `a`, a list of values for `b` and a list of values for `c`) and then generate a list to pass to `NSolve`. This is probably a fairly simple question, but I'm a beginner with Mathematica (although an experienced programmer in many other languages), so I'm not sure how to approach it. I suspect there may be a built-in function that will do this (or something like it) - is that the case?
