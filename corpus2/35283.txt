Here is my code:               rawdata = http://pastebin.com/fgeZrSCp (* I hope pastebin is OK *)          f[x_] := Interpolation[rawdata, InterpolationOrder->1][(x + 1)*10]       (* just creating a function with the data *)     d = 0.05;     T = 0.8;     wn = 2 Pi/T;     wd = wn*Sqrt[1 - d^2];          sol =        NDSolve[{xx''[t] + 2 d wn*xx'[t] + wn^2 xx[t] == -f[t], xx[0] == 0, xx'[0] == 0}, xx,          {t, 0, 65}, MaxSteps -> 500000];     Plot[Evaluate[xx[t] /. sol], {t, 0, 65}, PlotRange -> All]      ![Plot of the solution](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9y97O.png) My goal is to get the maximum value of `Abs[xx[t]]`. How can I do this in an efficient way? Note that `d` and `T` can change. In this particular example the maximum should be around 0.052. Context: Structural Dynamics, I'm trying to find a "response spectrum".
