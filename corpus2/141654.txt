> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Should I focus on being deep or broad I work full time on an android project and am very comfortable with both java and the android framework. On a good day, I would rate my abilities at an 8, and maybe a 7 on a bad day. I've recently found myself with more free time then I'm used too, so I have been working on a lot of personal projects. I am beginning to wonder what others think about this; is it worth my time to continue experimenting and pushing Android, or would I be better off learning another language? What do you all think about this? What would you do with more free time and energy than you know what to do with?
