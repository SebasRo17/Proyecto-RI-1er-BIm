I generated a long polynomial using the Wolfram command line, with divisions and exponents. But the divisions look like this:               4     -     5      And the exponents are on a different line:                 -6     10      And I need to copy the output to GeoGebra, so I need to have the output format like this:               4/5      And:               10^-6      How can I do this?
