I am at secondary school right now and I'm the only one in my class who is experienced with programming. Because of that, people are constantly distracting me while I'm writing code to ask me to solve a problem. Usually I reply with something like 'I don't know, I never use that' but I don't want to lie to people. Another problem is that I became so well known for this that even students from other classes are asking me questions. I find this damn annoying. Thirdly, if I solve a problem for them they don't learn anything from it. How can I stop people from asking me programming-related questions in a kind way?
