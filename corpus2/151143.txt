I'd like to ask if someone of you knows the exact meaning of JEE. That's because a collegue of mine was asked this question in a job interview, and was "unable to answer properly"... to speak with his interwiewer's words. And when he told me what he said to his interviewer I got really surprised, since it was more or less what I would have answered myself - in a concise form, the first paragraph of this article. > J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) is a Java platform designed for > the mainframe-scale computing typical of large enterprises. Sun Microsystems > (together with industry partners such as IBM) designed J2EE to simplify > application development in a thin client tiered environment. J2EE simplifies > application development and decreases the need for programming and > programmer training by creating standardized, reusable modular components > and by enabling the tier to handle many aspects of programming > automatically. That seems not to be enough, since the interviewer asked for "more precise and less general definition". Is there really a more precise definition for JEE? Or did my colleague just find the fussiest-interviewer-ever? :)
