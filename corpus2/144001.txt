I would know if someone can suggest a good approach to convert a word document that contains forms in a web app, specifically in an application built with WaveMaker.(but I'm curious also with a general approach not strictly dependent on the technology that I have mentioned). For example, if I have a page in a word document, that maps the fields of a user entity, what could be my "programmer approach" to convert it without much use of copy-paste, but with a dynamic methodology ?
