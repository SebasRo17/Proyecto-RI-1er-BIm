How do I replace content inside a Held expression without local values coming through? For example if you run the following code you get `g[2]` instead of `g[x]`(the intended form).               x = 2;     Replace[HoldComplete[g["x"]], {       y_String :> With[{          eval = Symbol[y]},         eval /; True]       }, {0, Infinity}]      The following questions are related   * Constructing a Sandbox   * Replace inside Held Expression **EDIT:** Although rm-rf's trick is clever it partially works. His current code adds an additional defer to the current code.               InputForm@HoldComplete[g["x"]] /.        s_String :> With[{x = ToExpression[s, InputForm, Defer]}, x /; True]      returns `HoldComplete[g[Defer[x]]]` instead of `HoldComplete[g[x]]`. Ultimately you could strip out the `Defer`s which is likely what I will end up doing.
