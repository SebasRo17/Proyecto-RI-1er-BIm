So I've been contracting for 6-7 months now. The problem I have is that I take a contract while looking for work and then don't want to bail on the people working in my contract. Then when the contract is up, I tell myself I'm going to take a contract while looking, etc. I'm concerned that if this trend continues it will not be good for my career. I'm particularly concerned about the fact that the contracts (3 to 6 months) aren't really long enough for me to participate in a full SDLC. Does taking a series of 3-6 month contracts make it more difficult to land a permanent, senior position later? For example, I can't imagine someone hiring a consultant to be a team lead. So if you are going from contract to contract, does it hurt your ability to eventually become a team lead?
