Is the Spark View Engine for ASP.NET dead? I'm considering using it for a new project. I tried to get approved to the Google Groups but nobody would approve me. The last message posted there was in May. I tried emailing the developers but nobody would reply back. I'm not having happy feelings about this using SPARK for a major project of mine at the moment. Is this project now dead especially after the Razor came out?
