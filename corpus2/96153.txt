We have been trying for months to convince my boss to switch to OOP php, but each time, he takes out his previous experience with programming and convinces us other wise. i need to talk like a boss to him, tell me how do i convince him? I need to make him understand the long term benefits and also financial benefits. One arguments he used today was that it was not optimum for performance, like each time you need to make a conection to the database, you need to create a new object each time. Please help me.
