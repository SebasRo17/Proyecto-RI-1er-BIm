At work we have a legacy system written in Visual FoxPRO. Everything in foxpro is a table, even forms, so basically if you open a form file with a text editor you don't learn much. Does anyone know about a tool for source control, that support merging and managing binary files? For now I'm converting what I can convert to text, use a text tool like to merge changes, and replace them manually, to get the team work in one version, then upload the stuff to a TFS server. I know it is not genius... please advise
