I was wandering if there are any frameworks like Google Web Toolkit to create Web Apps? (Apps like Evernote, Spring Pad, Google Docs, etc.). I am fluent in Java but could learn a new language without much problem. So is there any kind of framework that would allow me to write Web Apps without worrying much about UI element design and client-server communication? I have heard of one-- Vaadin. Is it something like what I am looking for? If yes, are there any alternatives? I'm hoping to make a Web App similar to this: Gantter. Mostly the UI and smooth usability.
