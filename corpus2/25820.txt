How can I do vector calculations without telling Mathematica the vector entries? I have very many arbitrary linear combinations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which I want to perform some general calculations on (scalar and vector products) and want to use Mathematica to do this ( _especially for simplifying stuff like very long equations with scalar prodcuts of vector products_ ). So, I don't want to write for all my vectors stuff like `v1={a1,b1,c1} ... vN={aN,bN,cN}` and so on, but just want to say `v1 ... vN` are vectors. How is this possible?
