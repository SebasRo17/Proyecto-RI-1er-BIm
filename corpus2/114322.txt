I have looked at the Force.com videos, I am fascinated by the way it allows one to add custom fields to forms, create new forms, with the validations built in by just marking as the required kind, all on the fly. I am trying to implement the same kind of approach to my Java application.   1. Which of the Java frameworks support this kind of quick development.    2. Do we have a name for this kind of architectural approach? In case I need to provision this feature on the fly, what are the things I need to take care for implementation.  Basically I am not clear what is this kind of approach known as to google and find. Please point me any references. Thanks. _Edit: Here is it @barjak:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkRbzd3vxHU#t=0m18s_
