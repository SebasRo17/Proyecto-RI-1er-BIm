Is it possible to re-integrate a former team member into a software project? We have a product with a looming customer deadline and we don't have enough hours to get it done! We have a former employee who left on excellent terms and wants to come back. They are familiar with the codebase and architecture (which has not changed significantly since they left). Can we use this situation to avoid Brooks Law? It seems like an ideal situation, team member up to speed with processes, tools, etc. What do we need to be careful of? Are there any dragons in the water? Or should we expect smooth sailing?
