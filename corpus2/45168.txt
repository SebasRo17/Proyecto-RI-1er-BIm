I came across this while modifying an old ASP application:               ON ERROR RESUME NEXT          ivalue = CDATE(ivalue)          IF err.number > 0 THEN       ivalue = CDATE(date)     END IF     err.clear      This doesn't look like good practice. What is the purpose of doing it this way, and is there a better way to go about it? For example, I would've just used `ISDATE()`: is there something I'm missing?
