Me and a friend of mine were discussing yesterday about differences between writing a large C++ software and understanding it as a new recruit. Is it possible that since a software gets done one line at a time and this process resembles how we (humans) learn things and build a thing on top of another one, writing a large software is actually easier than reading it and understanding what it does (stepping through the code helps but you need to remember multiple classes/source files together you don't even know what they've been written for, multithreaded code adds malus points)? This sounds weird at first but after we thought a bit it seemed reasonable
