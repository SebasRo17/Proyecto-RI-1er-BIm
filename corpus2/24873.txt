Can someone be so nice to provide some help for this particular situation? I try to plot a graph of a derivative which contains modulus. Without it the graph is drawn correctly: ![correct graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9zbmE.png) But when I wrap the expression in the `Abs` _Mathematica_ outputs an empty graph: ![empty graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oKseC.png) I looked for several answers related to empty graphs, but nothing seems to fit to my case. Thanks in advance.
