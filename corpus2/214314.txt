I'm delving into multi-threaded programming with Java, but I'm finding it hard to test my program for bugs. My computer simply has too many resources and cores, making it hard to see how my program acts under stress. Is there any way to limit the resources available to my program? It seems ridiculous that my only option right now is to open another application and render HD video in order to starve out the application I'm debugging.
