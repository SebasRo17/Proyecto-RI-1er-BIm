I'm using an initialization cell to import a lot of data:               data = Import[myFiles];      and then I use a custom function to display this data with Manipulate:               Manipulate[customFunction[data,variable],{variable,{0,1}}]      I have to keep these two commands in two seperate cells, because importing the data in `customFunction` each time I manipulate `variable` would take a lot of time. The problem is, when I start my notebook, `Manipulate` is evaluated automatically and sends a lot of error messages, because `data` is not defined. I know it might go against what Manipulate is made for, but is there a way to prevent Manipulate from being evaluated until I import my data for the first time?
