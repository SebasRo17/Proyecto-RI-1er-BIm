I am a front-end developer who barely even see a file with `.h` or `.c` extension. I know basic C syntax, I've learned it in Unreality but never was interested in such low level programming because it was simply too much setup for simple things. I am very interested in learning all aspects of Computer Science but I want to believe I do not really have to know a specific language in order to understand most of concepts in Computer Science. Yet when I start reading books and articles about fundamental Computer Science concepts like Data Structures and Algorithm Design it seems that I have to learn C, because all examples and even lessons are in C (and sometimes Java). My question is, is C as a programming language essential for Computer Science or we just happened to have all of our resources in CS written in C? Can one learn Computer Science without learning C?
