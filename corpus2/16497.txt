I often preemptively match delimiters. As a simple example, I'll type `Import[]`, then left arrow, then `"filename"`. The problem is that when I type the `]` in `Import[]`, the `[` highlights in the normal selection color to signify that this pair of brackets matches. During this automatic highlighting, if I type something that involves the shift key (such as something starting with `"`), the `]` is deleted, leaving `Import["`. This behavior is as if the `]` was selected when the `"` was typed, but it was not. To reiterate, the sequence of keys is (quickly typed!) `Import[]` then `Left Arrow` and `Shift`+`'` but the behavior is as if the sequence were `Import[]` and then `Shift`+`Left Arrow` and then `Shift`+`'`. It might be my imagination, but it seems to have gotten worse in _Mathematica_ version 9. Can I disable or shorten the automatic highlighting of matching delimiters? It appears to be the source of the phantom shift keystroke. This is Mathematica version 9 on Mac OS X 10.7.5. * * * Wolfram support suggested unchecking "Enable dynamic highlighting" and this does not fix the problem. I recorded the problem happening twice in a row here. It happens a bit faster than it is being displayed here. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yqt44.gif) I'd settle for just shortening the duration of this highlighting so I'd have to be Superman to reproduce the problem.
