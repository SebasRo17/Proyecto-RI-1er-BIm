I'm a Rails developer doing TDD on a Mac with RSpec, Capybara and Selenium webdriver. Now I have been asked by my company to use this approach for a .NET on Windows environment. What is the best way of doing this? I could just install Ruby and use RSPEC, Capybara and Selenium webdriver for integration testing. But what about unit tests? I also looked at NSpec, but I'm not sure if I can combine that with Capybara or Selenium for integration tests. What would be a good approach here?
