My current work relies on using tags in CVS for an automated build process (ANT currently) to build for respective environments (development, QA, production). From our research, neither Git or Subversion support tagging in the same manner. If we use Subversion or Git, they don't support tags (in the same manner - please correct me?). So how would ANT or Maven know what to pick up for the respective build? ## Example: For a webapp, when viewing our repository say for the web.xml file -- the history would look like:               web.xml  v1     ...     web.xml  v1.2.3  Tag: Prod     web.xml  v1.2.4      web.xml  v1.2.5  Tag: QA     web.xml  v1.2.6     web.xml  v1.2.7  Head      The ANT build scripts are run as CRON jobs, at different times & intervals for different environments. The environment build is based on the repository checkout, based on the tag. Development continues, and eventually the respective tags are moved:               web.xml  v1     ...     web.xml  v1.2.3       web.xml  v1.2.4      web.xml  v1.2.5       web.xml  v1.2.6  Tag: Prod     web.xml  v1.2.7  Tag: QA     web.xml  v1.2.8  Head
