Sorry for the very abstract and uncertain question, but I guess if I could ask it better I would have answered it myself. Here is the thing. I am getting more and more interested in FPGA. However, it is hard to tell where I should start off. What I want to do is to write a simple application that listens to UDP packets and sends TCP/IP packets. So I think something like Xinix VirtexÂ®-7 FPGA will work for me as FPGA. How does that sound? I will also need a PCI card that will host it with Ethernet card on it. Obviously I am not that good in hardware on that level and won't make it myself. Are there any out of the box solutions? Also, I guess there must be a core for working with Ethernet adapter already. Am I right on that? Where should I look? Is there anything with interface close to POSIX sockets? What is the best software kit I will need to achieve that? Thank you!
