The solution to this question on how to get latex code for a text cell (which Mathematica doesn't do correctly) was formulated as a palette but I need it as a keyboard shortcut. How can I add an item to DefaultKeytranslations.tr that executes this solution's code? And in general, how does one construct a key command that executes arbitrary code, not just front-end packets and tokens?
