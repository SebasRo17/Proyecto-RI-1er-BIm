I have solved some equations and exported the final results, which they are several Matrices, as a EXCEL file ( .Xls ). Now, I want to use these EXCEL files as my inputs to solve some other equations. I use `Import[]` to read these EXCEL files. But when I import them, these Matrices appears like this : `{"ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]"}` When I use `Import[exp,"Table"]` or `Import[exp,"List"]` the results are exactly same as previous one. I don't know what the problem is ?! This is part of the code :               AA = Import["C:\\Users\\Com\\Desktop\\EXCEL\\AA.Xls", "List"];          BB = Import["C:\\Users\\Com\\Desktop\\EXCEL\\BB.Xls", "List"];          CC = Import["C:\\Users\\Com\\Desktop\\EXCEL\\CC.Xls", "List"];          ssm = StateSpaceModel[{AA, BB, CC}]       The results : > >     During evaluation of In[8]:= StateSpaceModel::farg: > {{ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]}, >     {ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]},{ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]}} is not a valid > TransferFunctionModel >     or a list of state-space matrices in the form {a, b, ...}. >>` >   >     During evaluation of In[8]:= StateSpaceModel::farg: > {{ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]}, >     {ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]},{ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]}} is not a valid > TransferFunctionModel >     or a list of state-space matrices in the form {a, b, ...}. >> >   >     StateSpaceModel[{{"ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]"}, {"ÐÏ\.11à¡\\[PlusMinus]"}, >     {"ÐÏ\.11à¡\[PlusMinus]"}}]` >
