I admit that I am a junior developer, and so far I've only built simple web applications in ASP.NET MVC. But I've never had to use the inheritance aspect of Object Oriented Programming in my own classes! It is true that in using ASP.NET MVC I inadvertently use inheritance (any controller I create will inherit from the base controller class), but I am referring here to the conscious use of inheritance in my design of a particular web system. Is it because I am a bad programmer? Or could it be that inheritance only comes into play in certain scenarios? Don't get me wrong, I understand what inheritance is and how to code using inheritance if I had to. I just can't seem to find a scenario to use it at. Basically, I am wondering how often it is used in OO programming in general.
