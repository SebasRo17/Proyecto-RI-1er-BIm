Well I have been THE junior developer in a small team for several years. Now, there is a new fresh graduate so I have become the not-so-junior-developer and have been asked to mentor him. But I have no idea what to do since I have always been kind of a "figure- things-out-on-my-own" person and didn't receive much mentoring. So, what do you need to do when mentoring a new graduate?
