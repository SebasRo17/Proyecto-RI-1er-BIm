I am creating a new language, with some nice features like OOP, static typing, imperative, etc. The main reason for making a language was to learn more about compiler construction. My question is, what are the chances for my language to be known? What can I do to make my language used by many? I know there are lot of similar projects, and much better than mine, but I want to make this project a success. The project is almost completed. I think it comes with useful tools such as automatic memory allocation, memory manager, pointers, and few others. I would like to know if my project can have a future or shall I just drop it like many others? Thank you.
