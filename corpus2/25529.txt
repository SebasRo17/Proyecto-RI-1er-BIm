Is it possible to have the cell brackets on the left? I looked through the options and couldn't find anything, but maybe it's some kind of esoteric style setting or something. The reason I'm looking for this is because the content of notebooks is on the left, which means that's where my mouse hangs out most of the time. So I suspect having the cell brackets on the left would be more natural. (I'm aware of the cellgroup openers, my question is about general selecting/manipulating, not just opening/closing).
