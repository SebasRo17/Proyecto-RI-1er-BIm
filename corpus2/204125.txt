What should we do if a item in scrum takes longer then expected? i am asking this because i have been noticing items that developers is struggling to complete as it is much tougher then initially thought. In such situation should we   * remove the item from sprint back to product catalog so that we can meet the sprint timeline?   * move to easier sprint item and leave problematic sprint till the end of timeline   * justify at sprint review why the item cant be completed at current sprint to stakeholders? How can we avoid such situation in future? Is it due to lack of upfront planning or we did not make an effort to break down the sprint item into smaller item?
