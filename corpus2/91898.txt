I will be putting together an application to automate an external web site/application. In some instances I will need to navigate the site as a user would (some links I need to follow cannot be predicted and must be parsed from a response) I am already using Html Agility Pack, and am aware of Tidy if that is needed. **Are there any other technologies I should be aware of?** **Are there any recommended patterns for being able to quickly adjust in the event that the external web app changes?** Iâ€™m envisioning encapsulating the validation of responses as some type of strategy or similar pattern that can be easily separated/plugged in as necessary, but any specific suggestions would be great.
