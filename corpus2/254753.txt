I used to do this:               // If the cat is black     if ( $catColor == 'black' )      {       ...     }     // Otherwise eat a taco     else     {       ...     }      But I've more recently started to move toward this style of conditional statements:               if ( something ) {       ...     } else {       ...     }      But now, where is the best place to put a comment for my else block?               if ( something ) {       ...     // Otherwise...     } else {       ...     }      That just looks weird cause its in the if block. Only other alternative is               if ( something ) {       ...     } else { // Otherwise       ...     }      But that looks/feels weird. What is the best approach to comments with this style of conditional blocks?
