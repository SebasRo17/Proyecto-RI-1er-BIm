I'm working on a _Mathematica_ lab for Calc. 2, and I ran into a problem last night. I was trying to calculate the midpoint approximation of the definite integral of `Cos[x]` from 0 to 2. Here's what I came up with:               Clear[a, b, n, f]           f[x_] = Cos[x]          a := 0; b := 2; n := 578          N[((b - a)/n)*Sum[f[a + (i - (1/2))*((b - a)/n)], {i, 1, n}]]          0.909298      This is fine, but if I try to use `NSum` instead of `N[...Sum[...]]` then this happens:               Clear[a, b, n]          a := 0; b := 2; n := 578          ((b - a)/n)*NSum[f[a + (i - (1/2))*((b - a)/n)], {i, 1, n}]      > During evaluation of In[35]:= SequenceLimit::seqlim: The general form of the > sequence could not be determined, and the result may be incorrect. >> > > During evaluation of In[35]:= SequenceLimit::seqlim: The general form of the > sequence could not be determined, and the result may be incorrect. >> > > 35.538 According to the documentation, `Sum` evaluates the given sum (http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Sum.html), and the `N` function gives the numerical value of the parameter (http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/N.html). Also, `NSum` should give the numerical approximation of the sum. To my understanding, `N[Sum[...]]` Should be the same as `NSum[...]`, or am I missing something? It's not a huge deal as far as typing more, but I'd just like to know why it doesn't work as expected. I've read online that `NSum` apparently tries to work out part of the sum symbolically, but even if it does I don't see how it could be _THAT_ much different from the real answer.
