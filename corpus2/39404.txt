I would like to calculate the uncertainty of the nth Eigenstate of a 1-dim harmonic oscillator. To obtain the result I have to solve the integral $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^* x^2 \psi \:dx$$ with $$\psi(n,x)=\frac{e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} H_n(x)}{\pi^{\frac{1}{4}}\sqrt{2^n n!}}$$, where $H_n(x)$ is the Hermite polynomial (degree n) in the physicist version (as implemented in Mathematica). In Mathematica this equals to the Integral over               (2^-n E^-x^2 x^2 HermiteH[n, x]^2)/(Sqrt[π] n!)      Doing this manually gives $1/2+n$, but i can't get Mathematica to solve this integral without specifying $n$. I used `               Assuptions=n ∈ Integers && n >= 0      Is there anyway to solve similar integrals with Mathematica? Edit: Thanks for you answer, but I should have mentioned, that I'm looking for a way to let Mathematica solve such problems analytical.
