I am writing a user story and have a simple questions. Consider, I am writing it for login module which calls internally a web service to authenticate the user and returns the data. How this can be converted into a user story. Should this be written as: > As a user, > > I would like to login to the system and see the resultset. and leave it or should I write validations/web service call as well as well. As I understand, as a user I am not concerned with web service. So how should I write about this?
