I am finishing my project and in my thesis I am explaining why I used an **MVC** pattern to build my website, and have stated the advantages of designing it this way. However, if I had **not** used MVC and had built my website from scratch with all the functions for data, processing, and display into each page, what would that have been called in terms of architecture? For example, I would have had one PHP file that has all of the code and functions that it needs. Would it have been called "a standard website architecture"?
