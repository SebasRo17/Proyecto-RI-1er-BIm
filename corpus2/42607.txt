When simplifying an expression using `Simplify[expr, assumptions]`, the assumptions has to be explicit. Is it possible to simplify an expression with pattern assumptions? (`TransformationFunctions` can satisfy some of the needs, but it is not always functional as in the following examples.) For example               psimp[Sqrt[a[t]^2], a[m_] > 0]      > a[t]               psimp[f[x] (1 + a) (1 + b) == 0, f[a_] != 0]      > (1 + a) (1 + b) == 0               psimp[(d[t] + b[t] + c[t])^2 + (d[m] + b[m] + c[m])^3 + a[n] + x[n] //        Expand, {d[f_] + b[f_] + c[f_] == a[f], a[n] + x[n] == s}]      > s + a[m]^3 + a[t]^2               psimp[g[x, y]*Derivative[0, 1][f][x, y] + f[x, y]*Derivative[0, 1][g][x, y],       (g_)[x_, y_]*Derivative[0, 1][f_][x_, y_] + (f_)[x_, y_]*Derivative[0, 1][g_][x_, y_] == Defer[D[f[x, y]*g[x, y], y]]]      > D[f[x, y]*g[x, y], y]
