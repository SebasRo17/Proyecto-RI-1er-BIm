My team is considering a department goal of doing Test Driven Development next (fiscal) year. TDD sounds good and my manager is on board. The only problem is measurement. Our company rules require that department goals be measurable. Is there any (sane) way to measure if a team is doing TDD? **Note:** We had a goal for writing unit tests already, **so a code coverage goal will not work.** We write the unit tests but we do it after the fact, not before. Is there a way to measure that TDD is being done? (NOTE: We use Visual Studio 2013 and TFS in case it matters)
