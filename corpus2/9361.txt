One thing I use _Mathematica_ for is building molecular graphs. Until now, I've been content with generating an adjacency matrix from SMILES data, and passing that to `AdjacencyGraph`. That works well for small cyclic graphs, but the method fails my expectations when the molecules are polycyclic. I want all the edges to be of unit length, but none of the `GraphLayout` option values permit that. ![Undesired layout](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h1Gfv.png) **GraphEdit** The `GraphUtilities` package contains an interactive graphing function. It enables one to draw any graph, and outputs the relevant data to reconstructing it. It would be of great help if I could pre-define graphs for `GraphEdit` to use, that could be copied any number of times inside the applet, while retaining their shapes. This screenshot (from _ChemDraw_) illustrates what I'm looking for: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZVOkG.png) Also, directly passing a `Graph` object to `GraphEdit` doesn't work:               GraphEdit[CycleGraph[6]]          (* GraphEdit[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3, 3 \[UndirectedEdge] 4,          4 \[UndirectedEdge] 5, 5 \[UndirectedEdge] 6, 6 \[UndirectedEdge] 1}] *)      Can I add such functionality to `GraphEdit`?
