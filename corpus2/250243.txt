I was asked this question during a technical phone screening recently and didn't do well. The question is included verbatim below. > Generate `{2^i * 5^j | i,j >= 0}` sorted collection. Continuously print the > next smallest value. > > Example: `{ 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10...}` "Next smallest" makes me think a min-heap is involved, but I didn't really know where to go from there and no assistance was provided by the interviewer. Does anyone have advice on how to solve such a problem?
