I am royally confused about the certifications Microsoft has out for SQL server. From what I can gather from reading their site as well as others is there are various levels of tests (like in university) they have level 100 series tests, 200, 300... up to about 400 for the new master of SQL Server level. I wanted to knock a few out since I am doing daily SQL work now I figure I can get on the job practice and learning where I fall short. Where do I start? What test and test details do I need to know to take and pass each exam? what order should I take them in?
