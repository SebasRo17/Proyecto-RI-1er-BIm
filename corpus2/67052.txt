I am going to develop iPhone application for clients, for fixed project cost. After that I will help maintain the application by charging a service/support fee. Questions:   1. What should I put into the contract? Any samples I can use for reference?    2. Do developers normally give their source code to the client? And what should be the price differences for each?    3. How are service/support normally charged? Monthly or by the hour? Any other advice welcome!
