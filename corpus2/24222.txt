I am trying to add a time dependent fraction to a parameter in `NDSolve`, i.e. when `10 < t< 20`, add `s` to `k1`...               Manipulate[ sol = NDSolve[{A'[t] == k1*A[t], A[0] == 10,                                 WhenEvent[ 10 < t < 20, k1 -> (k1 + s)]},                                A, {t, 0, 100}],                 {k1, 0.0, 1.0}, {s, 0.0, 1.0}]      But I cannot get the code to work, and get the following error message. Does anyone have any suggestions, or can find the error in the code? > >     NDSolve::wenset: Warning: the rule FE`k1$$16->FE`k1$$16+FE`s$$16 will > not >     directly set the state because the left-hand side is not a list of state > variables. >> >
