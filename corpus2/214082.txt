Creating a C++ library also means documenting it so that others can use it, and that documentation can vary dramatically in quality. **How should a website for a C++ library be structured so that it is most effective?** I would frame "most effective" as being divided among three specific groups of library stakeholders, which should each be able to find and learn what they need to participate in and use the library:   1. New users need an excellent, easy introduction, download, setup, and documentation that clearly flows from one step to the next.   2. Seasoned users need a solid reference with fast access to the details they need, and clear information about new updates.   3. New contributors need a how to guide covering the steps they must take to get their contributions into the library. I would like to figure out how to make each very happy with what they see and use. This question is a bit of a cross between professional programming and user experience. For specific examples, Boost is one of the best collections of libraries, but the initial installation, reference documentation, and figuring out how to contribute can be somewhat confusing. On the other hand, I have found cppreference.com and the SGI STL documentation to be very clear and useful with explanations, links, and examples. While the examples are merely opinions and others may differ, it does help give context to the question I am asking.
