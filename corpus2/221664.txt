Are there any examples of inheritance in languages where classes call their subclasses' methods rather than their super classes' methods? It should not behave like traditional inheritance like the following.               Parent.method = function () {         // Do things     }     Child.method = function () {         // Do things         super.method()         // Do things     }      It should instead behave like this.               Parent.method = function () {         // Do things         sub.method()         // Do things     }     Child.method = function () {         // Do things     }      Does this pattern have a name?
