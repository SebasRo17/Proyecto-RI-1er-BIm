This could be either for the .NET or Mono compilers. I know that under certain conditions the compiler can inline functions (e.g. small, single call site, etc.) as an optimization. However, if the function is public, then it needs to have an external entry point. In these cases, is duplicated code generated (public entry point which isn't used by the internal code since the internal code uses the inlined version), or does marking it as public prevent the compiler from doing such an optimization?
