I have a website e-mail form. I use a custom CAPTCHA to prevent spam from robots. Despite this, I still get spam. Why? How do robots beat the CAPTCHA? Do they use some kind of advanced OCR or just get the solution from where it is stored? How can I prevent this? Should I change to another type of CAPTCHA? * * * I am sure the e-mails are coming from the form, because it is sent from my email-sender that serves the form messages. Also the letter style is the same.      For the record, I am using PHP + MySQL, but I'm not searching for a solution to this problem. I was interested in the general situation how the robots beat these technologies. I just told this situation as an example, so you can understand better what I'm asking about.
