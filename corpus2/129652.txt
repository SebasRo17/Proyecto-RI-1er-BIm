I wrote a web cam viewer where the javascript source basically sources the image according to an "active" class in a list. I was wondering what are good modern techniques to make images load faster in the background, so a user can get a better experience flicking through images. Obviously it doesn't make sense to download all images, I imagine it needs to be like when one scrolls through a Google map in principle, images are loaded on demand.
