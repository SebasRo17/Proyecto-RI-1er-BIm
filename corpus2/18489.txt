RSolve[{1 == b ((c k[t - 1]^a - k[t])/(c k[t]^a - k[t + 1])) c a k[t]^(a - 1),              k[1] == b, k[3] == a}, k[t], t]      I tried to read the documentation in Help and searched through Google. But I still can't make Mathematica to solve my recurrence function. I am new to Mathematica. Is there any place where I made mistakes? And is there any way that I can solve this function? I'm using Mathematica 8.0.4 for Mac.
