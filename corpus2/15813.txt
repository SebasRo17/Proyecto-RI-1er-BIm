I have a `DataDistribution`               data = KernelMixtureDistribution[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], 10^5]]       that takes a long time to calculate because of database operations. I don't need to constantly recalculate the distribution, so I'd like to store it in a database, and recalculate it at intervals. The documentation for `SQLBinary` refers to `ExportString`, which seems focused on graphics and doesn't have a generic format. Nor does `StringTake` work on a `DataDistribution`. So, how can I store a `DataDistribution` in an SQL database? EDIT: Thank you again Andy Ross! Here's my solution in the end. creating a string version of a data distribution.               inform = kern // InputForm;     ToString[inform]      Then I save it into an SQL database with `SQLInsert`. Next, to extract it back to usable form:               ToExpression[ ToString[sqlkern] , InputForm]
