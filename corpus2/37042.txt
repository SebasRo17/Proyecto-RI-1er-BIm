I'm about to hire a programmer to develop Windows Phone 7 apps. The current app that shall be developed is quite simple.   * The app will download content from a Web-API.    * There are two lists to select content.    * There is a single item content page.    * Users can rate the content and upload photos. The screens will be produced by our artist. I am pretty sure that most of the available programmers haven't touched WP7 development yet. **Now the questions are:**   1. What technology is suitable for this kind of app?   2. What technology requires less research, learning and production time?   3. Do you already have experience of limitations of silverlight compared to C#? (I am also thinking of future projects)   4. My guess is that silverlight programmers are more experienced in UI programming than C# coders. Do you feel the same way?
