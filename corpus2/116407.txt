Hi guys : Are there any established online sites for collaborative coding ? I have a github project with 5 developers, in different areas - we need somewhere that we can all "hangout" at.   * Right now we use group skype, but skype is designed more for family/social communication , and doesn't work on linux.    * IRC is okay, but its a little difficult to use for novices.   * an interface like yammer, twitter, facebook would be ideal, but also, we would want it to be real time (not requiring page reloads etc...)
