For one of my apps, I want to make the source code “open source” so that others might adapt the code to their personal needs or even contribute improvements, but I don’t want anybody else to publish “my app”. Furthermore, I still want to be able to sell the app at some time in the future. Is there a usual license for this, like the GPL or similar? I found similar questions from 2010 which say something about dual licensing, but maybe there is a license fitting my needs?   * A commercial software but open and free for personal/edu. How to license?   * Free for personal use license?   * Open Source but not Free Software (or vice versa)   * Software licensing: open source, no commerical, no derivatives
