There is an annoying problem that I can't figure out why it's happening. I have defined a `usage` for a my function `tensorA`: ![definition](http://i.stack.imgur.com/60ybe.png) Then when I run `?tensorA` I get gibberish: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w11vI.png) But if I run the same code a second time, it works as intended. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Bwk5.png) Is this problem known? Why do I need to run the `?tensorA` twice for it to display properly? What can I do to fix this?
