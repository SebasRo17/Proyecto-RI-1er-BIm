I want to get the answer of my `NDSolve` in the form of table (the value of each `x` and `y`). Let's say that I want to copy this result into the excel or microsoft word and then put it in the appendix or make a chart from it. I tried to use `Reap` and `Sow` function in order to do this.               s = NDSolve[{y'[x] == y[x] Cos[x + y[x]], y[0] == 1}, y, {x, 0, 30}]     Reap[Sow[s,{x,0,30}]      However, instead of giving me a number `(x,y)`, it gives me an interpolation function. Anyone has an idea how to get `x` and `y` from this type of equation?
