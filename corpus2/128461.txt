Even though Ruby on Rails seems to be the most popular with the most job openings, is there a compelling employability reason to learn django for example? Maybe because everybody's learning RoR and there's a shortage of django developers in relation to the demand? Or is php along with a popular php framework the way to go simply because of the sheer volume of php related jobs out there?
