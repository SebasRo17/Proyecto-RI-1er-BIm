There are some issues about how to manage our program designs and programming styles. I was assigned to find a solution to write reusable code - though, the programming team does not follow the rules. I would rather use MVC to perform a well structured programming style. I found out that a blueprint for next works requires a bunch of experts. The thing is that I have to do it all myself. And the worse part is that I have to use a general MVC platform. I need your helps and suggestions for:   1. Is there a way that I can write a document for MVC - to use it in our design in Java?   2. How can I represent it?   3. How much work does it need?   4. How can I connect the Model, the View, and the controller parts together?
