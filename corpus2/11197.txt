Consider the following code:               vsh[{xc_, yc_}, name_, {w_, h_}] := {LightYellow,         Rectangle[{xc - w, yc - h}, {xc + w, yc + h}],         Inset[Style[Text[name], 14, Black, Bold], {xc, yc}]};     options =        Sequence[VertexSize -> 0.1, VertexShapeFunction -> vsh,         GraphLayout -> "CircularEmbedding", ImageSize -> 350,         EdgeStyle -> Blue];          g1 = Graph[{1 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 4, 3 -> 4}, options];     g1      The output will be a simple graph with vertex labels depicted in rectangles (as can be inferred from `vsh`): ![Mathematica output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TqTkf.png) My question is: how can I encapsulate the vertex labels in circles instead? Nothing I've tried seems to be working.
