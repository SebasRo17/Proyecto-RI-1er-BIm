I was recently asked this from my friend after explaining how µTorrent worked, he then went to ask me, "Could this be used for browsing the web?", (not a direct quote) but I found my self thinking about this for a while there after.   * Could someone be credited with making the first Peer-2-Peer browser?    * How could it send the correct data without it being modified?   * Would it be faster than normal browsers? (Referring to the way µTorrent works, I find when I use a torrent it's faster than a web download.)    * Can it save on server loads, prevent DDoS, more?
