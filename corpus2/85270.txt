Reuse of components in development of software program are always exposed through the API's. Most of the products in today's world (such a facebook, google, .Net, JDK, ...) provide API's to reuse their components without being actually coding from the stratch. Also API's provide a huge high-level abstraction to the under lying components. My question is about the usability of these API's. Certainly, in all API's there are Obstacles. Obstacles can be   * skill sets,   * resources,    * Documentation of the API's   * the API itself. What do the programmers think the real obstacle are? List few of your opinions. To Question this here: Being a developer I investigated the obstacles when using 3rd party API's, one such is Highcharts. Though I have strong points why Highchart libraries are great compared to other Javascript visulization libraries (not comparing it with Google visulization API's) I found myself lost with the usability of the charts when going through their API docs at the very beginning. Indeed, their support forum is good to get your questions answered. Developers uisng API's - most of the time - do not (sometimes, need not) understand the design intents of the API, architecural design and the decisions made during the development of the API. Also, what will be your suggestions to make better API that will reach to large set of developers? I'm not entirely sure about the friction of learing new API's. PS: This may not be a constructive answer. But I am sure I am communicating with real developers on this site.
