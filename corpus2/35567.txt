I created a working CDF file on my Mac, and I am trying to embed it into an html page, and although I followed all the steps suggested on the mathematica web embedding page, it is not working (I always get a white page when I try to open my page). This is what I have done so far:   * I exported my _Mathematica_ code as a CDF standalone "AGN-standaloneClear.cdf", checked and it is working with CDF Player   * I opened TextEdit, converted to plain text and wrote:              <html>     <body>     <embed src="AGN-standaloneClear.cdf” width=“1380” height=“6792”>     </body>     </html>      and saved it as test.html into the same folder where the cdf is. When I try to open it with Chrome the page is completely white however, and if I try to reopen the test.html file it is completely white. I never tried to deal with html, so I think I could be doing some very noob errors that are not even explained in the guides I read so far, but however I don't know what to do. -EDIT- Here is the code that generates the white page:               <html>     <head>     </head>     <body>     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/plugin/v2.1/cdfplugin.js"></script>     <script type="text/javascript">     var cdf = new cdfplugin();     cdf.setDefaultContent('<a href="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/"><img  src="prova.png"></a>');     cdf.embed('AGNstandaloneClear.cdf', 1380, 6792);     </script>     </body>     </html>      and here is the one that generates the cropped cdf (http://postimg.org/image/tgqa3bicl/):               <html>     <head>     </head>     <body>     <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/plugin/v2.1/cdfplugin.js"></script>     <script type="text/javascript">     var cdf = new cdfplugin();     cdf.setDefaultContent('<a href="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/"><img  src="prova.png"></a>');     cdf.embed('AGNstandaloneClear.cdf', 435, 325);     </script>     </body>     </html>
