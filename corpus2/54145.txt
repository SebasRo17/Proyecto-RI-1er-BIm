In the Web development world, what exactly do backend/server-side programmers do? I guess I don't really understand the whole concept. I've done the HTML/CSS layouts and website design and a little bit of SQL with PHP (still enhancing my skills, it's more of a side project for me). I've also done a small amount of JavaScript/JQuery. But I don't understand the "backend" work, such as the scripting languages (Rails/Python/etc) and such. What exactly do you "do" with them? Are there any books on the subject? I'm not even sure what it means. Is it kinda like what Web Application Frameworks do? Or not so much?
