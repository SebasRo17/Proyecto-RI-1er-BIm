I'm trying to substitute TableForm with TableView because TableView is more handy with big data . But on my Mathematica 9.0.1 (ubuntu 14.04_64bit) there is a problem with negative numbers:               aa = {{5.10, 1.2}, {-5.10, -1.2}}          aa // TableForm       the last is fine but if I type               aa//TableView      the output of negative nuimbers is wrong (see attached immage) Negative numbers like -5.1 appears like -.51 !!!! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nd0bk.png) ######## UPDATE 04.06.2014 @ 8.21 GMT If you work with strings like that:               aa1 = {{"5.1", "1.2"}, {"-5.1", "-1.2"}}      TableView has no problem, look the picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eTgzO.png)
