I am a recruiter. I want to learn as much as I can about JEE5/JEE6 so when I try and find these types of candidates I can at least talk intelligently with them. What I need to understand is what goes without saying? So for example, if you were a J2EE or had experience with JEE5 or JEE6, could I assume you had spring and hibernate? Could I assume you had Jboss and Jboss admin? I guess it would be helpful if I posted a job description and let you guys tell me what is wrong with it? Candidate must have the following skills:   * Extensive experience with Java/J2EE Development   * Experience with various Development Tools (Eclipse, SVN, etc.)   * Database design and SQL expertise   * Web Services   * JavaServer Faces (JSF)   * Model-View-Controller (MVC)   * Comfortable working in a Unix/Linux environment   * Maven   * JBoss Deployment and Administration   * Swing/AWT   * Scrum/Agile   * TeamForge So if I was a certified J2EE would i have all these skills? Are these skills even grouped right? If you were writing this job description for a J2EE what would you change? I am trying to learn. I am not posting this to find candidates for a job. I am posting this to try and get a handle on what a hiring manager is asking for and be able to tell him, there is no way a J2EE has all these skills or, no problem, all J2EE's have these skills. Am I making sense?
