I want to fit some data to a model. However, if the data involves units in the independent variable, fitting seems not to work. As an example, consider the code               data = Table[{Quantity[t, "d"], Exp[-.1*RandomReal[{.9, 1.1}]*t]}, {t,0, 100}];     nlm = NonlinearModelFit[data, Exp[-a*t], a, t]      The goal is to have parameter estimates with the right units depending on the units appearing in data to minimize the risk of performing incorrect unit conversions manually. Any suggestions?
