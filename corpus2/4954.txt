I have an inequality expression that I would like to express in terms of the relation of the parameters to zero. More simply, I want to have mathematica move all the terms to one side of the inequality so that it is expressed as $x - y \geq 0$. Currently it is expressed as $x \geq y$. The expressions inside $x$ and $y$ are much more complex, of course. Is this possible? It seems I need to provide some assumptions about the relations between variables, but it isn't clear to me how to do this.
