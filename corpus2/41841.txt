I found a nice bug in _Mathematica_ 9.0.1.0. Could anyone check to reproduce it? Create a file `temp.txt` with one line:               Attributes[s$] = {Temporary}      Load it into _Mathematica_ with `<<`. Now calculate:               Sum[x^(-n)*y^n, {n, 0, Infinity}]      _Mathematica_ stops responding and the only option is to quit the kernel. You can't interrupt or abort. Now change `s` to `a` or `b` in the file and repeat the above. It works! Next put the line               Attributes[s$] = {Temporary}      directly into the notebook and calculate the sum. It works! What is so special about temporary variable `s$` loaded from the file? I used a temporary variable `s$` in one of my functions and then saved the function to the file. _Mathematica_ added the above line to the file. Everything stopped working.
