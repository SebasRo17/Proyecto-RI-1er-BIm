I am currently looking for a .NET component that fulfills the following requirements.   * TIFF files      * Extracting single pages as images     * Writing the images to new TIFFs   * Support for colored TIFFs/Images   * Improving the TIFF files (deskew is a must, despeckle etc optional)   * Royalty-free deployment on servers   * Fully architecture independent (only one assembly for x64/x86) I have found that Libtiff.Net is capable of handling the tiff files, but the API is still very complex and it cannot improve the files. For improvements, I am trying out AForge.NET(http://www.aforgenet.com/), but its filters require converting the images to specific pixel formats depending on the operation.
