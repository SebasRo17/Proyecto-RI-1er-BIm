Who should be the participants in retrospective? Will it be only the team members OR should the Product manager, all the stakeholders and dependent teams also participate. I am of the opinion that only the team should meet to discuss in retrospectives, else all team members will not open up. But one of the managers insist that all the stake holders should also be included.
