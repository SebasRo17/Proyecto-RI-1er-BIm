IntelliJ's inability to keep up with SVN updates has become a showstopper for me. My main reason for using IntelliJ is its integration with JIRA and SVN changelists. My preferred workflow is like this:   1. Identify a JIRA issue to work on   2. Start Work on the JIRA issue using the Atlassian plugin   3. The IDE/plugin automatically creates an SVN changelist for this task. It uses the issue number and title as the changelist name   4. Do work on the issue   5. Get pulled away to work on another issue.    6. Stop work on the first issue start on the second   7. A new changelist for the second issue is created How can I replicate this workflow in Eclipse?
