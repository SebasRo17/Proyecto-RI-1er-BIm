I had a question posed to me the other day by another programmer. I remember (a very long time ago) wondering the very same. **Why was a browser-side include tag never considered? Or was it?** Specifically with a tag that instructed the browser to include additional HTML from other sources. e.g. `<include src="http://server/foo/bar.html">`. Many folks will make javascript calls and fill `innerHTML` to accomplish the same, when the same outside a the javascript engine could be accomplished by the browser. It would have been painful to have nested `<HTML>`s `<BODY>`s (i.e.) but we have to consider that aspect anywhere anyway.
