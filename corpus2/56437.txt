I would like to get into computer security in my career. What are the best ways to learn how to program securely? It seems to me that, besides textbooks and taking classes in the subject, perhaps learning how to "hack" would be one of the best ways to learn. My reason for thinking this is the thought that the best way to learn how to prevent someone from doing what you don't want them to is to learn what they're capable of doing. If this is the case, then this poses another question: How would you go about learning to hack in an ethical manner? I definitely don't want to break laws or cause harm in my quest.
