I am still experimenting with datasets. Recently I tried to query the Titanic example to get info on the oldest passengers. Here is what I tried               titanic = ExampleData[{"Dataset", "Titanic"}];     titanic[Select[#age > 65 &]]      ![oldest-1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8iX52.png) That's fine, but I really wanted the data sorted by age. The documentation for datasets mentions that `SortBy` can be used as filtering operator, but gives no further details on it use that I could find. So I was left to experiment on my own. Here is my second attempt.               titanic[Select[#age > 65 &] /* SortBy["age"]]      ![oldest-2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HQYpj.png) The result shows sorting, but the "age" category is only locally sorted within each "class" category. That is not what I wanted. I wanted the sort to treat the "age" category as if it were the major key of the dataset. Does anyone know how to dot that? I did find a work-around but it's weird.               titanic[Select[#age > 65 &], RotateLeft[#, 1] &][SortBy[42]]      ![oldest-3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HhnFA.png) Note that the argument to `SortBy` is complete nonsense, but this last code works as I want. Can anyone explain this result? One last question. Since there is essentially no useful documentation on using `SortBy` in the way I have above, it's hard to dispute any behavior it shows. Nevertheless, I ask if you think I should report the behavior I have observed to Wolfram tech support as a possible bug?
