I am trying to decode a piece of code from a book:               List<Person> people = new List<Person>()     {     new Person {FirstName="Homer",LastName="Simpson",Age=47},     new Person {FirstName="Marge",LastName="Simpson",Age=45}     };      Person is just a simple class they made, with a bunch of fields: Name, Last Name, etc... What I don't understand is, don't we send parameters to a constructor of Person in non-curly brackets? I tried replicating this code, but it doesn't seem to fly, any takers? Thanks for input.
