I was recently reading the Wikipedia article for Resource-Oriented Architectures (ROA) and stumbled across an article that made the assertion that, although REST is a technology that is very-well suited for web applications and web services, that it is nevertheless a standalone technology that can be used in non-web applications. This is the first I've ever heard of such a thing! I thought REST was a SOAP competitor, but that the two were strictly web service solutions. My question: can someone provide an example for how REST is used in something that isn't a web app? Like a Swing client, or a command line tool, or an EJB.
