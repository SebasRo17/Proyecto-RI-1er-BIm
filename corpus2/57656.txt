I want to paint a curve on a sphere while I’m manipulating stereoscopic projection points on the plane with a 2D slider, but I’m having trouble collecting the points needed to create the Line primitives. The example script merely tries to collect some points and draw a line on the same plane. The two lines pertaining to collecting the points and plotting the line are commented out because they produce looping or deep recursion. I’ve tried Append[] and Reap[Sow[]] in a number of rearrangements. Nothing turned up for me in searches, but if you know the right vocabulary for a query, you probably already know the solution. Any ideas?               Clear["Global`*"]     Manipulate[     (*curve = Append[curve, pt];*)          Graphics[{         {Red,PointSize[.02],Point[pt]}         (*Line[curve]*)     },     Axes->True,     AxesLabel->{Style["x",Bold,16],Style["y",Bold,16]},     PlotRange->{{-1,1},{-1,1}},     Background->White,ImageSize->Medium],          {{pt,{0.0,0.0},Style["Move the point on the plane.",Bold,16]},{-1,-1},{1,1}},          Initialization:> (curve ={{0.0,0.0}})     ]
