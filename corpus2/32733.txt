I am working upon a product as core developer which will be launched in USA market in few months if successful. Can this factor improve my chances for getting accepted into a PhD program at a top university (say top 20 in US)? Normally good universities like CMU, Standford, MIT, Cornell are more interested in student's profile like research work, undergraduate school, etc. I am now passed out from very good university it's ranked in top 20 of India only. Neither did I do research work till now. But being one of founding member of company and developing product for same, I want to know if this factor can help and to what extent.
