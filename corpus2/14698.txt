In LaTeX, you can typeset expressions containing unbalanced brackets, by balancing them with an invisible delimiter `\left.` or `\right.`. Some such notations are common in calculus; for example, the two common notations for applying an expression at two points: $$\int_a^b x^2 \mathrm{d} x = \left. \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_a^b \equiv \left. \frac{x^3}{3} \right|_a^b $$ Applying a function at one point: $$\left. \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \right| _{x=0}$$ The alternative notation for an open interval endpoint: $$\left[a,b\right) \equiv \left[a, b\right[$$ But in the Mathematica symbol list, I don't see any invisible brackets. If you simply leave out the delimiter, it results in an unmatched bracket, messing up the formatting if you have multiple such expressions in the same cell. How do you typeset such expressions in Mathematica? (This is in display formulas; it doesn't have to be evaluatable.)
