In the design phase we create UML Sequence diagrams (in OOD). My understanding is that after creating an Use Case diagram if we need to show further information in terms of time sequence of events of that Use Case, we can go for sequence diagrams. My question is, should a sequence diagram represent exact implementation details? If I ask in another way, should all method calls and object interactions in the implementation be shown in the Sequence Diagram? Or else it should present a high level picture of the implementation? Normally in the implementation, things could be implemented with slight differences than specified in design diagrams. So that if a sequence diagram should show exact implementation details, we might have to revise them after the implementation. Another related question would be, who are the audiences of these sequence diagrams other than the author? An answer for this question might answer the original question as well.
