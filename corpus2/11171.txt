I'm writing a Monte Carlo simulation. I'm using a `Do` loop to create the different simulations, iterating over different `SeedRandom[]` parameters in my pseudorandom number generator. I'm trying to formulate it as a function that returns a list of correlations that I can then manipulate. I expect there is a very simple solution, but I have to admit that I'm pretty new to _Mathematica_ so I'm having problems. The _Mathematica_ documentation seems to conveniently dodge this issue whenever it comes up! This might be a little complicated, so I'll explain what my code does first, then I'll describe the problem precisely. _First I make a list with the parameters of each of my random variables (I want them to have different means):_               varparams = Table[i, {i, 0.1, 0.9, 0.1}];      _Then I define my random variables:_               var[i_]:=RandomChoice[{varparams[[i]],1-varparams[[i]]}->{1,0},10]      _(I'm generating [for argument's sake] a set of 10 values for each run of the simulation)._ _Now, I define the function that iterates over different SeedRandom[] values, so as to generate different data sets. I want to calculate a list of correlations:_               corrlist = {};     corrcheck[i_, j_, n_] := Do[       SeedRandom[k];       AppendTo[corrlist, Correlation[var[i], var[j]]];       , {k, n}]      _(`n` is the number of different runs of the simulation)._ Now this sort of works, in the sense that I can run `corrcheck[i,j,n]` and then work with the `corrlist` that is produced, but what I want is for `corrcheck[i,j,n]` **itself** to be a list, so that I can make tables and other manipulations of `corrcheck` for different values of `i` and `j`. I hope this makes sense. To reiterate: I want the function `corrcheck`, which consists of a `Do` loop, to produce a unique list for each set of `i,j,n`, so that I can do things like:               Table[corrcheck[i,j,100],{i,10},{j,10}]      and manipulations thereof. The answer has to be obvious. I just can't see it! Thank you very much in advance.
