I have numerically solved and plotted the solution to the Mathieu equation using NDSolve successfully, as below:               ClearAll["Global`*"]     a = 0.5;     b = 0.1;     w0 = 2.0;     T = 2 Pi/w0;          f[t_] := f[t] = y''[t] + (a + b  Cos[t]) y[t] == 0          s = NDSolve[{f[t], y[0] == 1, y'[0] == 0}, y, {t, 0, 1}]          Plot[Evaluate[y[t] /. s], {t, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> All]      But now I wish the normalize the period so I can plot from `t=0 -> t=1` and get 1 full period. I can do this by hand, but how do I do this inside of the `NDSolve` function?
