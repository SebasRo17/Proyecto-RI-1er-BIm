I'm not sure if I'm using the correct term, but would you program using High- level abstractions like Powerbuilder, or some CMS like MODx or DotNetNuke? I haven't dabbled in any of these yet. The reason I'm asking is that I kind of feel intimidated by the whole notion of using any abstraction over the languages I'm using. I'm thinking that my job might be over-simplified. While it may provide business solutions faster, I'd rather be coding straight from, in my case, .NET. Do/Would you use abstractions like these or prefer them over programming in lower level languages?
