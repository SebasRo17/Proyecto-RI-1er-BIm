In databases you might take about one-to-many. This means there's one thing that maps to zero or more others. In this kind of style I'm looking for words that define min/max amounts of things. So far, I have:                       min     max     one      1       1     many     0    infinite     optional 0       1     ???      1    infinite      Is there a single word that fits '???' to mean more than one?   Do you have better alternatives for 'optional'? I'm wondering if there are any conventional names for those concepts?
