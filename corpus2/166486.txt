This Git branching model recommends branching for all development efforts and merging when complete:   1. Branch   2. Develop   3. Merge when complete I'm wondering how this works in practice, given that performing a merge off this model will simply add a commit to the `develop` with whatever commit message happened to be the last one in line. Do people using this model do an interactive rebase on the feature branch before committing? If not, how do you ensure that the commits make sense on the main branch?
