I need a simple `enum` declaring the Java reference types, as:               public enum ReferenceType {         STRONG, SOFT, WEAK, PHANTOM;     }      Does such `enum` exist somewhere in the Java API or a general utility library such as Guava ? I have not been able to find it in either place, although I found third party projects that declare it (e.g. google-guice: RefrenceType). I just try to avoid polluting my project with silly classes/enums that may exist somewhere else. **UPDATE** I found that Guava in fact used to have this, but they dropped it: http://tinyurl.com/ndaqpet
