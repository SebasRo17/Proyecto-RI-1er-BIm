I am new in _Mathematica_ and am stuck on a simple problem. Please advise: I have the following list:               list = {     {"1", 1000},     {"2", 800},     {"3", 800}     };      I want to select subsets of the first elements `Subsets[list[[All,1]]]` when the `Total` of coresponding second elements is for example $>= 1000$. So in this example the expected result is: > >      {{"1"}, {"1", "2"}, {"1", "3"}, {"2", "3"}, {"1", "2", "3"}} >   I solved it using @Kuba's answer below, and added DeleteDuplicates to make it work better (produce less output) on large datasets:               lst = DeleteDuplicates[     If[     Total[#[[;; , 2]]] >= 1000,          #[[;; , 1]]] & /@ (Rest@ Subsets[list]) /. Null -> Sequence[]     ]      // TableForm
