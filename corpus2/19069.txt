I wrote a function named `Testing`.               BeginPackage["TestPackage`"]     Testing[tabNames_] :=            (               DynamicModule[                             {                                 tabIndex = 0,                                 displayPanel = 0                             },                             (                                 {                                 Column[{                                         (*Setter Bar Part*)                                         (                                             Dynamic[                                                     SetterBar[                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dynamic[tabIndex],                                                               (Table[(i -> tabNames[[i]]), {i, 1, Length[tabNames]}]),                                                               {ImageSize -> {110, 50}}                                                              ]                                                     ]                                         ),                                     (*Setter bar IS Closed here*)                                     (*middle Panel Part*)                                     Dynamic[                                                 Panel[                                                          displayPanel                                                     ]                                                ]                                     }                                 ], Dynamic[tabIndex]}(*Final PAnel IS Closed here*)                             )                     ]       )       EndPackage[]      I saved the above code in `.m` file. `.nb` file code                  functionCalling = Testing[{a, b, c, d}];        notebookList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};        TestPackage`displayPanel =Dynamic[(Part[notebookList, (TestPackage`tabIndex + 1)])];        Dynamic[Part[functionCalling, 2, 1]]      I want to track the `TabIndex` value dynamically,If you click on any `setterButton`. depending upon the `TabIndex`value,I will find the element from the `notebookList` and assign to `displayPanel`. after assignment,the updated `displayPanel` value should be displayed dynamically in notebook. for this purpose,I wrote the above code in a `.nb` file.But that code is not working How can I solve this issue? Please help me?
