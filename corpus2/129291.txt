I'm starting a new project and using SVN (with Tortoise) as my Version Control System. I was wondering if it was possible to also maintain a SQL Server Database using the same system. I'd want to version my tables/functions/views/procs/triggers/etc. but not my data as it's all going to be test data anyway. I'm not really sure how to set this up. I've come across a few options but I would like to know if there were any I was missing, and if there's maybe a guide or something out there to help me get running with it. I've seen and heard of Red Gate, but I'm looking for something free (or at least very low cost). I know I could always write something myself, but I'm not really trying to spend time on that. One thing I did come across was an open source package put together called ScriptDB4Svn. Has anyone used this before? Is it good? Can it do the things I need it to do and is it pretty simple to get setup?
