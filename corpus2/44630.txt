";" is described under Compound Expression as a delimiter, such that only the output of the last item in the compund expression is given. Situation: 1/ Print[] produces output whether followed by ";" or not. [Clearly an override is desirable so this makes sense for compound expressions] 2/ When combining graphics using Show[], appending ";" still suppresses output. Since "Show" is as conceptually active as "Print", is there a principle at work here (are there other instances)? 3/ If in procedural code a syntactically complete line is _not_ terminated with a ";", the following line is indented... which means Show[] in the middle of several lines of code upsets indentation and code legibility **Question** : if one has several graphics that one wishes to display without combining them what is the recommended approach, given that multiple Show[] should be separated by ";" but doing so suppresses output. * * * PS There is an incredibly minor-but-irritating-to-the-beginner "quirk" of commenting: semi-colon before comment at the end of code before a closing "]" is marked as a syntax error - is it really? If so, what is the nature of the _error_ (it might just be redundant)?               Block[{a},       Print[a];(*the ; preceding is magenta, but is it really a syntax error?*)]      One is tempted to say the ";" is superflous because the expression is terminated by "]", in which case why is it not still an error when extra line breaks are inserted?               Block[{a}, Print[a];      (*the ; preceding is not magenta, so why is this not a syntax error?*)      ]
