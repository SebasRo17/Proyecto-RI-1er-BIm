Recently I found a book, _Purely Functional Data Structures_ and all the examples in this book are given in ML with Haskell versions in its appendix. But I only know one programming language with the functional paradigm: F#. And after a bit of research, I found out that F# is (or was) the .NET port of CAML, which is derived from ML. I've heard it mentioned that CAML is just a dialect of ML. Given that, is it possible to translate ML to F# without a lot of knowledge of ML? What are the key differences from the languages? Or is my best bet to just learn ML instead?
