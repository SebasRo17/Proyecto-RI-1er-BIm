I will be generating charts and diagrams and I am looking for some theory on color schemes and algorithm examples. Example questions:   * How to generate complementary or analogous colors?   * How to generate pastel, cold and warm colors?   * How to generate any number of random but distinct colors?   * How to translate all that to the hex triplet (web color)? My implementation will be in AS3 but any examples in pseudocode are welcome.
