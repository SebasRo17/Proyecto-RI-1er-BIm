I've recently discovered the awesomeness of Complex event processing. Just reading the wikipedia page gave me chills on how this technology could be used and evolved into something very powerful. I'm currently a second year computer engineering student, and I was wondering if what I'm doing could ever get me a job involving complex event processing. If not, can one "have" omplex event processing as a hobby or does it require way too much power and resources?
