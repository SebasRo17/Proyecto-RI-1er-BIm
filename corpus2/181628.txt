I am building a tutoring application that multiple students can sign into the same session with a tutor. My question is, for example, if I sent out a command to draw a line, do I need to wait to see that all connected students propagated the command. Now, it relies that requests will be processed in order. But consider this. If I draw one point, drag and draw another point, it will draw a line. But if I don't wait to see if each step propagated to all students' screens successfully, a student might receive an instruction of drag, draw, draw. However, waiting for each connected user's input seems to be a very slow approach. Is there any way I can solve this efficiently? Or is this a problem at all?
