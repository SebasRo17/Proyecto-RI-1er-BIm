My question concerns **deployment scripts** in the process of **continuous delivery**. Continuous delivery recommends that deployment scripts should be versioned into SCM just as normal code.   * What is the best practice to avoid issues such as checking out (e.g. from Git) a script that does not have the right permission or is not executable?   * Also, where in the SCM repository should deployment scripts be located?
