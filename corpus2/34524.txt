I am trying to numerically solve a rather horrible looking singular/nonlinear ode: `A*(y''[x]/y[x])'' +y[x]^2==1` on the interval `[0,1]`, where `A` is a small parameter `(~10^(-4))`. The boundary conditions are :               y[0]=y[1]==1     y'[0]==0     y''[1]==0.       I expand the term in parentheses and use `NDSolve`:               s = NDSolve[{10^(-4)*(y''''[x]/y[x] - 2*y'''[x]*y'[x]/(y[x]*y[x]) - (y''[x]/y[x])*                  (y''[x]/y[x]) + 2*(y''[x]*y'[x]*y'[x])/(y[x]*y[x]*y[x])) + y[x]*y[x] == 1,                   y[0] == 0, y[1] == 0, y'[0] == 0, y''[1] == 0}, y, {x, 0, 1}]      And I get the following errors: > >     Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0.^2 encountered. >> >       ∞::indet: Indeterminate expression 0. ComplexInfinity encountered. >> >       Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0.^2 encountered. >> >       ∞::indet: Indeterminate expression 0.

I was wondering whether there is a way to over come this problem? I know that, in the interior, `y[x] = -1`. Thanks a lot!
