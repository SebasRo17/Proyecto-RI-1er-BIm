I need to allow some of my users to design and upload blank forms, to be downloaded, completed, and uploaded by other users. It would be nice if I could verify the completeness of the uploaded forms, but it is not absolutely necessary. The respondents are motivated to complete the forms, but it would be nice if I could warn them when one is incomplete. If I can't verify the content, I would at least like to verify that the uploaded form is the correct form. I do not intend to implement a form designer. Can anyone recommend a technology that would facilitate this? Currently my code doesn't need to understand the forms at all; I am merely passing the data through as a service for the users.
