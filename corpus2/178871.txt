Say I have a class `Person` that has instance variables `age`, `weight`, and `height`, and another class `Fruit` that has instance variables `sugarContent` and `texture`. The `Person` class has no methods save setters and getters, while the `Fruit` class has both setters and getters **and** logic methods like `calculateSweetness`. Is the `Fruit` class the type of class that is better practice than the `Person` class. What I mean by this is that the `Person` class seems like it doesn't have much purpose; it exists solely to organize data, while the `Fruit` class organizes data and actually contains methods for logic.
