Disregard your usual paradigms for a mere moment here.... I've seen a few sites who have used the following logic:               a=[];     b=a["sort"];     c=(b)();     c["alert"](1); // intended output: Alert displaying "1"...      supposedly to access (I'm guessing here) the primitive of the sort function to gain access to the window object, and then using that to access "alert"... I've tried executing this ages ago, and it worked a charm... But some twelve months or so later, I tried to run it again... and it's failed to execute, and given the following error:               TypeError: can't convert undefined to object      My question is, why wouldn't this logic work? It seems quite sound... Or is it? And yes, I know that I could just do `alert(1)` and be done with it, but I'm trying to get an understanding of alternate ways of coding... I work in IT security and I know certain people have ways of using XSS to find alternative ways to perform generic functions to compromise systems...
