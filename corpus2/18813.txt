I am putting together a proposal for a local store with both a brick-n-mortar and web presence. It's an upscale shop that also happens to be one of my wife's favorites. I am considering offering the option of barter for part of the payment. I have two questions in this regard: What would be a reasonable "exchange rate" for such a transaction? That is, in lieu of $1000 cash money, I should ask for about how much in store credit? **_In your own experience,_** has using barter introduced any complications into the client relationship? Are there particular pitfalls to be concerned about?
