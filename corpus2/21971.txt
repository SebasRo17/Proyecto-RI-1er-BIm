I have the following Mathematica code to approximate Pi as inspired by the Matlab code in George Zhao Ideas                   n = 100000;     count = 0;     For[i = 0, i <= n, i++;       roll = RandomVariate[UniformDistribution[{0, 1}]];       count = count + 4 Sqrt[1 - roll^2];]     {count, n, count/n}      I tried to insert ListPlot in the For loop but failed. My intention is to show how the {count/n} move per iteration. So, the ListPlot will get longer (approaching the Pi value) as the interation moves on. Appreciate any help. thanks.
