I've worked fairly extensively with the MVC framework cakephp, however I'm finding that I would rather have my pages driven by the multiple MVC than by just one MVC. My reason is primarily to maintain an a more DRY principle. In CakePHP MVC: you call a URL which calls a single MVC, which then calls the layout. What I want is: you call a URL, it processes a layout, which then calls multiple MVC's per component/block of html on the page. When you compare JavaScript components, AJAX, and server side HTML rendering, it seems the most consistent method for building pages is through blocks of components or HTML views. That way, the view block could be situated either on the server or the client. This is technically my ONLY disagreement with the MVC model. Outside of this, IMHO MVC rocks! My question is: What other RAD frameworks follow the same principles as MVC but are driven rather by the View side of MVC? I've looked at Django and Ruby on Rails, yet they seems to be more Controller driven. Lift/Scala appears to be somewhat of a good fit, but i'm interested to see what others exist.
