When developing web apps you often build your app on top of some frameworks like Twitter's bootstrap. These frameworks come with `less/sass/stylus`, `javascript`, images and sometimes webfonts. I'm wondering how to embed these frameworks in my app. Most of my apps are build using some grunt tasks that compile my `coffeescript` and `stylus` to `javascript` respectively `css`. Because I'm not shipping third party code (e.g. frameworks) with my app I add them as a dependency. This allows me to install e.g. frameworks using a package manager like `npm` or `volo`. Handling small javascript libraries (which consist only of _one_ file, no assets) is easy. I install them in a vendor dir and update my require.js conf. But if the library has images or `less/sass/stylus/css` files attached I'm always struggling how to handle them:   * Paths to assets in the `css` files or `javascript` files of these libraries are often hardcoded (relative)   * `less/sass/stylus` has to be compiled (which I can do with a grunt task)   * Copy all third party assets into my folder structure?   * Should I include third party assets (`stylesheets`, `javascript`) in my own files and minimize them together?   * If I use `stylus` and the framework uses `sass` I have to install a lot of further dependencies I think I'm not the only one who has these problems so I'm looking for solutions, best practices or some general tips.
