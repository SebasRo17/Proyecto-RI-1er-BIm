I am reading hibernate and I came across statements like "JDBC connections open across multiple requests is not a good thing because it is an expensive resource ". What is meant by expensive resource ? Edit : I am adding what user unknown has added as a comment below . If establishing a database connection is expensive , then why not use the same thing again and again (not caching) , instead of closing it and opening it everytime ?
