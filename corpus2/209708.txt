I have an existing language that I need to port to a new platform. I'll probably attempt this by changing the backend of the existing compiler. It is a significant amount of work to re-write the backend. I can't see a way breaking this down into sensible stories without violating INVEST criteria. I can't see how each story can be Negotiable - they are all required for a working compiler. The stories are all of equal priority and it doesn't matter what order I deliver them. I need to do them all. There are some parts of the software I'm implementing that are lower priority than others and I can see that we can deliver that incrementally. However, there is a significant core that is Must Have. I plan on trying to follow Scrum, but am I just going through the motions? Are there recommended practices for this kind of project?
