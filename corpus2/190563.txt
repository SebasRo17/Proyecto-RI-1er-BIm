I'm going to be writing an application that is pure HTML5 and JS and MVC.net back-end. We have .resx files that are getting compiled to .js files for resources in the html5 application. The application has to work in English and in Chinese which I understand to mean that we need to use UTF-16 everywhere. Does anyone have any experience using UTF-16 for such a task, or any best practices thereof?
