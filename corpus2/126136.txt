I got through the first phone interview at Amazon last week and they asked some basic technical questions during that interview. Today, I had my second phone-interview and I prepared myself well expecting for another technical interview, but it was not technical at all. After we introduced ourselves, he asked questions like:   1. Why do you like to do programming?   2. What do you Not like about programming?    3. What do you expect from a new job?   4. In the last project you worked on, how did you make sure the project was implemented to the client's requirements?   5. Was there was any project, that during the development, you felt like the design was bad, and if so, what did you do to fix the issue?   6. As an engineer how would you keep up with the new technologies? Additionally, when I explained to him about a recent project I worked on, he asked me about why we decided to make a specific design decision and whether it was my decision. I was wondering why he asked me these kind of questions; since English is not my native language, I assume that one of the reasons was to test my knowledge of the language. And most of the answers I gave him were very short and since I felt like he's expecting more, I tried to come up with things to say and ended up just blabbering. Overall I think the interview went really bad because I couldn't clearly convey my points to him. Why was I asked these types of questions, and what kind of answers do interviewers expect?
