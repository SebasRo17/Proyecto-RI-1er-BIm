I currently have some code that checks if squash and tennis scores are valid, both in javascript and PHP. This results in 4 blocks of code existing, 2 languages * 2 sports, which does not scale well should any extra sports come around, or extra languages... How can one describe the valid scores of games via a settings/text file, so that each language can parse them and apply these rules. I'm stumped with the strange tie break situations in tennis should it reach 6-6 in a set, and also infinite play off in the final set should it reach 2 sets all. ie:               tennis = {         "format": [             {                 "name": "sets",                 "min": 3,                 "max": 5,                 "winby": 1             },             {                 "name": "games",                 "min": 6,                 "max": 7,                 "winby": 2             }         ]     }          squash = {         "format": [             {                 "name": "games",                 "min": 3,                 "max": 5,                 "winby": 1             },             {                 "name": "points",                 "min": 15,                 "max": 0,                 "winby": 2             }         ]     }
