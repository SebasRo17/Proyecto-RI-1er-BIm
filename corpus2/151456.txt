With Oracle vs Google trial, it seems that Java is not entirely Open and free (as free software) as I expected. Although there exists completely free/open JVM, it's hard to know what is a copyright infringement with Java, and what is not. So I'd like to know if there is a completely Open and free language with open and free IDE (Eclipse-like) out there, Object Oriented if possible, and able to make window-based applications for the main OSs (Linux, Mac, Windows).
