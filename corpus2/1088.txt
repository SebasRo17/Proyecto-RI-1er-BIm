If I want to count the number of zeros at the (right) end of a large number, like $12345!$, I can use something like:               Length[Last[Split[IntegerDigits[12345!]]]]      But this seems clumsy, since it's potentially doing the full work of `Split[]` to the whole list of digits when all I need is the length of the run of $0$s at the end of the list. Is there a more efficient (and particularly more Mathematica-elegant) way to do this? ( _edit_ : the answer for the example should be 3082)
