Maybe I miss something, but do the so called markup languages have the equivalent concept of `semantics` that you can find in C or C++? Judging from how you parse the language, you don't really have too many options, there isn't too much context, you just parse your tokens and apply them to the source code. I'm tempted to say that not only semantics doesn't exist in this case, but this only happens in markup languages: am I right?
