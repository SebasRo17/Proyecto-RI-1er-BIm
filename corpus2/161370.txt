We currently abuse our version control system and use it... pretty much as an FTP to store big release binaries (4+ GB). We are seeking to move away from this horrendous practice which has and continues to devolve and take more and more of IT's resources while crippling the integration and release processes. A solution for this would be using P2P file sharing to distribute these release images/binaries, mixing file servers and some key user machines as seeds. So my question comes in two parts:   1. Have any of you resorted to setting up BitTorrent in your intranet to distribute release images/binaries?, if not, what do you think about this idea (which was not actually mine BTW, but I think it is great)   2. Is there open source web-based software for handling publishing of BitTorrent trackers?, so that when there is a new release it can be searchable and display its availability with regards to seeds and leeches? (...you know what I'm referring to) Edit: The intranet is global (e.g. USA, China, Germany, Mexico). Regular FTP could work but it is not as cost-effective.
