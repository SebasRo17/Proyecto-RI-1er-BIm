I need to display arbitrary _Expressions_ in `TreeForm,` but the standard vertical layout produces too many horizontally overlapping boxes. Am I doomed to rewriting expressions as graphs and using `TreePlot` and `GraphPlot` and going down this road http://www.wolfram.com/technology/guide/FullyAutomatedGraphLayout/ or is there something I can do in a hurry to make `TreeForm` look better? Docs say               TreeForm takes the same options as TreePlot.       so I pop over to `TreePlot` and see               TreePlot[{1 -> 4, 1 -> 6, 1 -> 8, 2 -> 6, {3 -> 8, "3\[Rule]8"},        4 -> 5, 7 -> 8}, Left]      go back to `TreeForm` and try               TreeForm[a + b^2 + c^3 + d, Left]      but oops:               TreeForm::tlev: Warning: level specification Left is not a non-negative integer or     Infinity; ignored. >>
