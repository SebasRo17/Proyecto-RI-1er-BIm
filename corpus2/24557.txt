I have already asked a related question here why set values in this way doesn't work? But I think I have to write the question which I encountered explicitly?               tmp = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}     label[i_, p_] := i + p     test[p_] := Table[tmp[[label[i, p]]], {i, 1, 2}]      Here I defined a function `test` and the thing I want to is that change the values of list `tmp` via setting values to function `test`. While simply write               test[1]={111,222}      and expecting `tmp` will change to {1,111,222,3,4,5} is not possible. So how to achive this? I have tried many `Hold` things, but failed. Inspired by **andre**. I know that `Set` has attribute `HoldFirst`. So I tried `Evaluate`                Evaluate[test[1]]={111,222}      this won't work! I guess the problem is that I must properly Hold `label[i,p]` and `tmp[[]]` in the table. But I can't work it out. Anyone help?
