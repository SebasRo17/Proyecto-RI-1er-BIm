Whenever a new project starts, it usually makes sense to start by committing straight to master until you've got something "stable", and then you start working in branches. At least, this is how I normally do it. Is there a way to immediately start branches from second commit? Does it make sense to do it this way? Obviously, "Initial Commit" will always be on master, but after that, when will I know it's the right time to start making branches for new features?
