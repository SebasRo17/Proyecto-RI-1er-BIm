My code is: `Do[Print[number[[i ;; (i + 4)]]], {i, number}]`. The variable `number` here is a list consisting of 1000 digits. My aim is to `Print[]` a series of lists as follows: the first list consists of items 1 through 5 from `number`. The second list consists of items 2 through 6 of `number`, and so on. Instead, what I'm getting is this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zu3cT.png) You can see that it does `Print` some lists, but it seems to be shuffling the digits around in some random kind of order, plus completely making up some numbers (e.g. where did the '5' in the first list come from??). Then suddenly it grinds to a halt and displays an error message saying 'Cannot take positions 0 through 4 in {the list}, before throwing up the entire 1000 digit list, and then continuing with further 5-member lists and repeating the pattern. I have no idea what's happened here so I'd be very grateful if somebody could explain to me what's going on - and more importantly, how I can get this code to work as intended. Thanks!
