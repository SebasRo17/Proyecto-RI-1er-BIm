I'd like to illustrate a two-variable function discontinuous at zero. The function is $f(x,y)=xy/(x^2+y^2)$ unless $x=y=0$, in which case $f(0,0)=0$. I thought that I could draw a plot and then mark two sequences of points $(x_n,y_n)$ and, say, $(x^\prime_n,y^\prime_n)$ converging to $(0,0)$ such that $f(x_n,y_n)$ and $f(x^\prime_n,y^\prime_n)$ converge to different limits. I did something like this:               f[x_, y_] := If[x == y == 0, 0, x*y/(x^2 + y^2)]     p := Plot3D[f[x, y], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]     Show[p, ListPointPlot3D[       Thread[{Table[1/n, {n, 5}], Table[1/n, {n, 5}],          Table[f[1/n, 1/n], {n, 5}]}]]]      but the dots are barely visible; I'd like to have them bigger and/or blacker. How to achieve this?
