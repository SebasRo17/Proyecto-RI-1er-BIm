This is my first question. I love Mathematics; I love the logic and the problem solving. At the same time, I enjoy Computer Science and hope to go into Artificial Intelligence research after I get my Bachelors degree, i.e pursue a PhD in Computer Science. Are there any advantages of having a firm grasp of Mathematics to studying Computer Science? Also, would I be at a disadvantage in getting a Bachelors in Mathematics instead of Computer Science when applying for graduate school to study Computer Science, particularly at institutions with high quality research infrastructure, like MIT and Stanford? Also, in reference to the first question, could you please tell me the advantages of a solid grasp of Mathematics, if there are any? Thank you.
