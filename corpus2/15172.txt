I have an exact equation: \begin{equation} a = \sqrt{1 + x^2 - \sqrt{(1 + x^2)^2 - 2 x^2 \cos^2\theta}}\tag{1} \end{equation} and its approximation: \begin{equation} a = \dfrac{x \cos^2\theta}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\tag{2} \end{equation} I'm doing most theoretical calculations using equation $(2)$ and to check the outcomes I'm doing numerical calculations of $(1)$ in Mathematica. For example, finding $\left.\frac{da}{dx}\right|_{x = 0}$ dividing by $\left.\frac{da}{d\theta}\right|_{\theta = 0}$ and integrating: \begin{equation} \int\limits_{0}^{A}\frac{\left.\frac{da}{dx}\right|_{\theta = 0}}{\left.\frac{da}{d\theta}\right|_{\theta = 0}}dx \end{equation} And I want to check that this (or any other) procedure doesn't differ much from the same for precise and approximate function. How can I verify that the use of the approximate formula doesn't make the calculations inaccurate?
