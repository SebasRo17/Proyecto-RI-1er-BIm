I don't have much experience in working in software industry, being self- taught and having participated in open source before deciding to take a job. Now that I work for money, I also have to deal with some unpleasant stuff, which is normal of course. Recently I was assigned to add logging to a large SharePoint project which is written by some programmer who obviously was learning to code on the job. After 2 years of collaboration, the client switched to our company, but the damage was done, and now somehow I need to maintain this code. Not that the code was _too_ hard to read. Despite problems—each project has one class with several copy-pasted methods, enormous `if` nestings, Systems Hungarian, undisposed connections—it's still readable. However, I found myself absolutely unproductive despite working on something as simple as adding logging. Basically, I just need to go through the code step by step and add some trace calls. **However, the idiocy of the code is so annoying that I get tired within 10 minutes of starting**. In the beginning, I used to add `using` constructs, reduce nesting by reversing `if`'s, rename the variables to readable names—but the project is large, and eventually I gave up. I know this is not the task I should be doing, but at least reducing the mess gave me some kind of psychological reward so I could keep going. Now the trick stopped working, and I still have 60% of my work to do. I started having headaches after work, and I no longer get the feeling of satisfaction I used to get—which would usually allow me to code for 10 hours straight and still feel fresh. This is not just one big rant, for I really do have an actual question: > Is there a way to stay productive and not to fight the windmills? Is there some kind of psychological trick to stay focused on the task, instead of thinking _“How stupid is **that**?”_ each time I see another clever trick by the previous programmer? The problem with adding logging is that I actually have to _understand_ what the code does, and doing so hurts my brain in an unpleasant fashion.
