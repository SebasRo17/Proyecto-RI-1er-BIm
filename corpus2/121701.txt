I have 10 developers and 3 Testes team and I want to setup CruiseControle as CI for automated builds, tests and deployment to production server and some repository for SCM ( Source Code Management). I need something that would enable the team lead to create tickets (tasks) for each sprint in SCRUM and issue/bug tracking and task time tracking. I want to use simplest possible solution that just gets the job done with the minimum requirements specified in this SO question. I do not want to use heavy weight or feature rich software ( either free or costly), just the simplest possible setup. Each developer is using Eclipse STS IDE. So it must be something that is integrated into STS (like available as STS plugin, again to keep things as simple as possible). This is for development of Java web application.
