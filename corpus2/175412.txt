I'm learning node.js and am trying out Express. My first app had this code:               var express = require('express')       , routes = require('./routes')       , user = require('./routes/user')       , http = require('http')       , path = require('path');      Reading through the mongoose tutorial gives me this:               var mongoose = require('mongoose')       , db = mongoose.createConnection('localhost', 'test');      On strict mode, JSHint gives me > app.js: line 6, col 32, Bad line breaking before ','. Which shows that I'm not the only one out there who's bugged by this syntax. Is there any reason to declare `var`s this way instead of adding the comma at the end of the line?
