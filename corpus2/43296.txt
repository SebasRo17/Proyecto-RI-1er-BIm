I would like to use Mathematica for a presentation and have a list plotted in front of my audience, one coordinate at a time. How would I go about plotting a list progressively in real-time, ie the coordinates {1,y1} first, then one second after the coordinates {2,y2}, etc... ? Something with Manipulate so that I could switch on and off this option would be nice, but I don't see any function in the documentation that would let me plot lists in real time.
