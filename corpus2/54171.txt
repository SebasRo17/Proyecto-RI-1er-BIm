Well , I have been asked to work in a Java web application that is very very poorly designed . In the name of "making this easy" , they have come up with their own "framework" to make things extremely difficult to understand . I am struggling to figure out the control flow . Do you have any such experience ? What do you do in such situations when the guy who has "designed" it has already left the company ?
