I have written a recursive function and would like to re-write the code using **Module** _AND_ **While** to compare the timings. Here is my recursive function for f[n], where 6 n f[n] = f[n-1] + n! for n>0 and f[0]=7.               Clear[f]       f[0] = 7;       f[n_Integer /; n>0] := f[n-1]/(6 n) + n!        Now I want to write it using **Module** AND **While** , I could write using **Module** ONLY, but I am struggling when I need to combine it using **While** loop.   Here is my code using **Module** only:                fm[n_] := Module[{f}, f[0] = 7; f[i_] := f[i-1]/(6 i) + i!; f[n]]      Then if I want to use **Module** AND **While** , I get into trouble, here is my code:                fm[n_] := Module[{fw}, While[n>=0, fw[0] = 7; fw[i_] := fw[i-1]/(6 i); fw[n] ] ]        The code is not working and I couldn't figure out where does it go wrong. Do I still need to write recursively inside the While loop? And how could I write the correct code?   Any detailed explanations are greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
