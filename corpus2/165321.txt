As Apple won lawsuits against Motorola and Samsung with the so called `overscroll patent`, I am asking myself what the legal consequences of releasing an application with such a feature are? I think if one releases the app in IOS it would be okay, but what happens in Android or Windows? Am I getting sued? What happens if I am writing an app for the browser? Isn't this overscroll patent a design patent? If this is true, all apps that use overscrolling and not written by Apple, would be illegal. Very confusing. Can anyone explain is?
