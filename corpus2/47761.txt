Why does `NSolve` not work for this type of equation?               2.01224 == (0.954875 - 0.0084496 a) Log[         9 (0.954875 - 0.0084496 a)] + (0.0113946 - 0.00295146 a) Log[         9/4 (0.0113946 - 0.00295146 a)]      Here is my full script, where I solve got `a`, it just hangs there:               NSolve[2.01224 == (0.954875 - 0.0084496 a) Log[         9 (0.954875 - 0.0084496 a)] + (0.0113946 - 0.00295146 a) Log[         9/4 (0.0113946 - 0.00295146 a), ], a]
