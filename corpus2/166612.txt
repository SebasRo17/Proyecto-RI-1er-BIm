They both serve the same purpose: Providing a vocabulary for semantic markup. Schema is recognized and standardizedâ€¦ but the microformats standard is by an open community process. Schema exploits microdata in documentation, while microformats go on classes. (Of note: microdata means that an element must be of a single `itemtype`, while microformats allow several classes to apply to the same element. I can markup xFolk+hAtom with classes, but not with microdata.) Is this a black-and-white situation? Google says I can't use both "because it may confuse the parser". What's the consensus on these?
