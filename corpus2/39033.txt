I am new to Mathematica. I am trying to numerically solve for C in the following equation: $\begin{equation} \begin{array}{lcl} -\int_0^\infty (5000000+100000 x+ C)^{-1} \frac{1}{0.20x \sqrt{20 \pi}} exp(-0.5 (\frac{log(x/50)-0.10*10}{0.20\sqrt{10}})^2)dx=\\\ -\int_0^\infty (5000000+100000 x+ 10000 *Max(x-50,0))^{-1} \frac{1}{0.20x \sqrt{20 \pi}} exp(-0.5 (\frac{log(x/50)-0.10*10}{0.20\sqrt{10}})^2)dx \end{array} \end{equation}$ I know a solution is: C=152300. However, when I write the following code:               f[C_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[(-(5000000 + 100000*x +           10000*Max[0, x - 50])^(-1) + (5000000 + 100000*x +          C)^(-1))*1/(x*0.20*(10*2 Pi )^(0.5))* Exp (-0.5*((Log[x/50] - 0.10*10)/(0.20*(10)^(0.5)))^2), {x, 0, Infinity}]                          {FindRoot[f[C] = 0, {C, 150000}]}      I have an error message and cannot find the root. In addition, there are other similar equations I want to solve for which I don't have an initial guess for the solution. Is there a good procedure for finding the root in such cases? Thank you very much for any advice!
