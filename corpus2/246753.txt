I have been using cake php for over a year and generally I like it but I struggle to understand the advantages of the complex naming conventions over something simpler. Cake uses plural here and singular there (controllers vs models and reported controller names) for it's names and uses camel case and underscores too (method names and class variables vs database tables and view variables). As far as I can see picking either plural or singular and either underscores or camel case and using just one of each choice everywhere would still yield all of the advertised benefits but would be simpler to use for the programmer. What are the advantages of cake php naming convention which could not be achieved with the above system? Please demonstrate why a simpler system wouldn't work for any given assertion.
