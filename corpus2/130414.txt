We are planning to organize programming workshops for Java web developers with basic coding but no design experience. The goal of the workshops is to introduce these programmers to clean code. Focus Areas:   * TDD   * Four Rules of Simple Design      * runs all the tests     * contains no duplications     * expresses the intent of the programmers     * minimizes the number of classes and methods Structure:   * 6 full day coached workshops spread over 3 months using pair programming and pair-switching   * Each workshop contains      * four 15 minute presentations/demos     * four 90 minute problem solving exercises     * 4 minute pecha kucha's by every programmer Planned Katas for first workshop:   * prime numbers   * bowling game   * tennis scoring   * Arabic to Roman numerals conversion   * prime factors Do you think this is a good way to structure a programming workshop? Are there any elements that I could introduce to the workshops to make them more interactive and create more interest among developers? Edit 1: Summary of the feedback   * Create an interest in reading books.   * Have real project examples.   * Have contact with the group during off days.
