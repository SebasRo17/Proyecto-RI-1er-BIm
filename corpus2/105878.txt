I am currently starting work on a personal project that me and a friend are very passionate about. We want to work on it together, but we are on very different programming levels: I'm in my last semester of my education have been through 2 internships and I'm currently working as a student, programming, while he just finished his first year of uni and just got the basics down. The question is How can we work on this together? He is just making the switch from Java to C# at school, and the project will be an ASP.NET project in C#. I could wait a semester so he can get more into the language and learn more programming concepts, but I feel that it would be a waste of time, and I might loose momentum. So the question is **what is the best way to work with a person on a different programming level than you?** Pair programming, making a part of the system as an example that he can follow in making another part? How would you do it?
