Consider the following three evaluations involving `Flatten`:               Flatten[f[f[f[x, y], 1, 2], f[x, y]], Infinity, f]      > f[x, y, 1, 2, x, y] (* as expected *)               Flatten[List[f[f[x, y], 1, 2], f[x, y]], Infinity, f]      > {x, y, 1, 2, x, y} (* as expected *)               Flatten[List[List[f[x, y], 1, 2], f[x, y]], Infinity, f]      > {{f[x, y], 1, 2}, x, y} (* expected {{x, y, 1, 2}, x, y} *) I would like to know why my expectation was wrong.
