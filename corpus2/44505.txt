My question here is fairly basic, and I'm sure I'm overlooking something basic. I know about `CountryData` for creating shapes of entire countries, and it works, to an extent; I can plot geographical data on it with the coordinates, but I'd like to have a magnified view of a state alone. The goal is to be able to measure borderlines. Is there built-in functionality for this, or do I have to import a shape file of a state?
