I am running Mathematica 7 on Windows XP Pro. I often use the magnification feature to zoom in on `Plot`s, `ListPlot`s, and `Graphics` that I have created. If I go to the **Window** menu, there is a **Magnification** option, which gives a submenu with the following options:   * 50%   * 100%   * 125%   * 150%   * 200%   * 300% Is it possible to use a magnification of, for example, 110%?
