I am going to give some beginners a presentation about writing first program in Java. This program will be about printing "hello world". I'm not sure how can I explain the concepts such as main method (and public and static keywords and the args argument) and class definition. Any ideas how can I explain that so they understand exactly what they mean? I don't have problem to spend 1-2 presentations just in Hello world program but I want them to understand.
