I learned about local classes on the Oracle Java Tutorial page. Not nested classes. I don't see myself using local classes. It makes the code look messy and you can easily do what local classes do with having a class declared separately. But maybe I'm missing some use cases for it. Are there situations where you would prefer using local classes over other approaches or are local classes just an antiquated feature no one really uses?
