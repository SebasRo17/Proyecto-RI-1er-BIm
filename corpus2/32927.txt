The documentation for the function "JewishNewYear" in the "calendar" package declares that the year argument must be between 1900 and 2100. No explanation is given for this limitation. The function continues to produce seemingly correct dates for years outside of that range. The Jewish calendar is mathematically determined, so there should be no reason for the algorithm to fail outside that range. Moreover, a recreation of the function using CalendarChange produces the same answers as JewishNewYear, for any Gregorian year:               JewishNewYear2[year_] :=  CalendarChange[{First[CalendarChange[{year, 8, 1},      Gregorian, Jewish]] + 1, 7, 1}, Jewish, Gregorian]      Anyone have any idea why the documentation would say that JewishNewYear doesn't work outside of 1900 to 2100?
