I need to update a software framework once it has been deployed. The framework we are creating is made up of .NET 4.0 libraries (in Visual Studio). This common set of code libraries will be available for 2 .NET Windows services, a standalone .NET application, and a .NET MVC 4 website. (The services will run on a single server, and the standalone application will be used by a select few individuals.) We are in the early stages of the project, and the big questions that have come up are:   * What happens when we have to make a change to 1 or more of the framework files?    * How do we deploy patches and/or updates to each part that relies on the framework?   * What considerations can we make early on to make the update/patching process easier later on? This is the first time our small team has tackled a problem like this and we're not sure what the best practices are. **edit** We have 4 software pieces that rely on the framework: 2 services, 1 app, 1 website. Once this all hits production, there are already upgrades and updates planned. The updates will require changes to the framework files and the programs. My question was intended to refer to that later process of redeploying the upgrades. Once we're in production, and we've coded the updates/upgrades to the framework files, the applications, and the website, deploying those updates will need to happen as quickly as possible. What do we need to do to streamline that process?
