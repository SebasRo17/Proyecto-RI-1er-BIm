Following YAML snippet that I'm trying to place in my markdown formatted readme:               ```      libraries:       - name: numpy          version: "1.6.1"        ```      Tried the above with both no and 2 trailing spaces at the end of each line. Both turn out on a single line. Obviously I want them on 3 separate lines in my README.md. How? edit: note tried adding 'yaml' as the optional lang parameter but no dice either.
