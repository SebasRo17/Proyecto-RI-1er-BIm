I have an inequality consisted only of seven parameters as follows: $(1 + g)^{-(m+w)}\big[\big\{a+(1-a)(1 + g)^m\big\}(1 + p q)Q - (1 + g)^w \big\{(1 + g)^m (1 + q)-(1-p)q\big\} Q\big] < 0$ Parameters, $g$, $w$, and $m$, are subject to the following restrictions: $0<g$, $0<w$, $0<m$, $0<Q$ That is, these four parameters are all positive. Now, we can manually verify that this inequality holds under the above parameter restrictions. And I would like to confirm this with Mathematica. My codes for the assumptions:               $Assumptions = 0 < g && 0 < w && 0 < m && 0 < Q      And as for checking if the inequality holds, I used `Refine` and `If` as follows:               Refine[If[(1 + g)^(-m - w) ((a - (-1 + a) (1 + g)^m) (1 + p q) Q - (1 + g)^w ((-1 + p) q + (1 + g)^m (1 + q)) Q)<0, Print[True], Print[False]]]      Since the condition is true, the result I expect is `True`. But what I get is a simple repetition of the `If` bracket:               If[(1 + g)^(-m - w) ((a - (-1 + a) (1 + g)^m) (1 + p q) Q - (1 + g)^w ((-1 + p) q + (1 + g)^m (1 + q)) Q) < 0, Print[Yes], Print[No]]      When I use a little simpler, but similar, type of inequality, it gives me either `True` or `False` depending on the specific form of inequality I use. But it seems Mathematica is not able to figure out whether the above inequality, which is too complex (maybe?), is true or false. Or am I missing something? Can anyone help? Thank you so much.
