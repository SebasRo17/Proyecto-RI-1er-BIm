As far as I have understood(?), the "Extends is evil" idea is in direct opposition to the Open Closed Principle? In here, the concept of OCP is presented as inherently using Extends:   http://www.oodesign.com/open-close-principle.html While in for example this article, the act of extending is considered a capital offense?   http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-08-2003/jw-0801-toolbox.html?page=1 What is the correct way to satisfy both OCP and not using Extends? Consider a simple BulletinBoard class that has Posts, which can be either NewsPosts or GuestbookPosts with different properties, but same methods/behaviour.
