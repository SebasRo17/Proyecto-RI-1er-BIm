NDSolve[ {y'[x]= -y[x], y[0]=1},y, {x,0,2} ] has no problem in typing, even if cannot run due to error of not using ==.                NDSolve[{y'[x] == ^-y[x], y[0] == ^1}, y, {x, 0, 2}]      This ODE works (without any ^) . A _minor_ bother is that the originally set font spontaneously changes to plain text all by itself at location of ^ immediately after == sign,that is not desired. How to stick to original font choice? What is it due to? EDIT: a screenshot of above highlighted line, Font changes from Cambria to plain text with font size change: ![AutoFontChange](http://i.stack.imgur.com/579PK.png)
