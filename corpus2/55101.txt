i'm trying to get familiar with the new Dataset-stuff in Mathematica 10. As it will (hopefully) provide some benefit for me, I have started to convert my app to move from list and list of rules to Associations and Datasets. Starting point for me is an XML object, which is converted to a Dataset now. I was hoping to reduce the programming code by e.g. applying functions to multiple columns at once. This is an example Dataset:               testset = Dataset[{<|"Element" -> "A", "a" -> "529251", "b" -> "520358"|>, <|     "Element" -> "B", "a" -> "51"|>, <|"Element" -> "C",      "a" -> "177"|>, <|"Element" -> "L", "a" -> "125"|>, <|     "Element" -> "S", "a" -> "1343"|>}]      This gives: ![dataset](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QOSPH.png) As the XML sometimes contains integers and reals in scientific form, I'm using               Internal`StringToDouble      to convert the stuff:               fnStr2Real[x_,r_:0]:=If[Head[x]===Missing,r,Internal`StringToDouble[x]]     SetAttributes[fnStr2Real, {Listable}];     testset[fnStr2Real, {"a", "b"}]     (* Trace yields *)     (* Query[fnStr2Real, {"a", "b"}][testset] *)      The issue: there is some kind of rounding in the resulting recordset: ![result](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Wvkh.png) If I apply my function directly to my list or association, everything is fine:               Function[x, fnStr2Real[#[x] & /@ Normal[testset]]] /@ {"a", "b"}     (* {{529251., 51., 177., 125., 1343.}, {520358., 0, 0, 0, 0}} *)      I know that Internal`StringToDouble is an internal function, but I found several posts in this forum using it, and I really like it! Is there an issue with M10, Dataset and Internal`StringToDouble? Are there any other robust string coversion functions availabe which can handle integers, reals and reals in scientific form **inside a dataset**? Thanks!
