It's a rather simple concept, and each vendor seems to have their own "Website" for their config. I am curious to find out a few things. In my linksys router, if I go to 192.168.1.1, it asks for a simple log in, followed by the status page. Here ports/passwords and all that can be completely changed. What's interesting is how the firmware updater works. You can click upload, drop in their new firmware, and it presumably flashes the device. What technologies / frameworks would be ideal for creating my own custom router page? I've seen a custom one (Tomato).
