Using the Repository pattern, is it proper to return an IQueryable of a data set (table), for generic usage? It is very handy in many cases, especially when using external libraries that leverage that interface, for example some plugins that sort/filter and bind to ui elements. However, exposing an IQueryable sometimes seems to leave the design prone to errors. This, coupled with a wrong usage of lazy loading could lead to severe performance hits. On the other hand, having access methods for every single usage seems redundant and also a lot of work (considering unit tests etc).
