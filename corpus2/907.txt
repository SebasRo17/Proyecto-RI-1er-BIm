What are some complete examples of what one would include in a FrontEnd `init.m` that would make use of `FrontEnd`AddMenuCommands` to add commands to the _Mathematica_ system menus (without having to directly edit `MenuSetup.tr`? For example, to do the following:   1. Add an item to the Help menu that brings up the `DocumentationCenter` window for Installed AddOns.   2. Add an item to the `Format > Background Color` sub-menu that would add a new color? Yes, I've already consulted MathGroup threads going back to 2009, and earlier, on modifying the startup menu by editing `MenuSetup.tr` and about evaluating, during a session, an expression to do a `FrontEndExecute`. But those messages don't seem to give a complete example of what I'm asking here.
