With reference to my earlier post: Adding a point to an already existing graphic I would like to add an outer circle to the whole drawing. This outer circle is a fixed one of `radius 40`. Something like this is helpful:               Graphics[Circle[{0, 0}, 40]]      But I do not know exactly where to put it in my code so that it remain a fixed circle in the background. Thanks a lot...
