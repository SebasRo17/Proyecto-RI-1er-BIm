I'm on the list of the tutors in my university _(for PHP, MySql, CSS, etc)_ but someone contacted me asking me to teach them entry level Python. Would I be able to be up quickly enough and be able **to teach it to someone else?** (I've coded in PHP, Java, C#, Javascript, jQuery, tiny bit of C++ and ASP.NET. I'm a Computer Science student. Just finished my third year.)
