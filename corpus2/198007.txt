I recently took over the maintenance of 10-15 SQL Server databases and to my surprise found out that the team does not store the code scripts anywhere. They currently deploy changes to each environment without any paper/code trail. The code for applications that use these databases are all stored in TFS and I need to implement a directory structure for storing the scripts - tables, views, stored procedures - in TFS. On our Oracle side of the house we use a two directory structure:   * ddl   * sql  But I think there could be improvement in storing the scripts on the SQL Server side. I was thinking of using something similar to the way SSMS stores objects:   * tables   * views   * stored procedures/functions Is there a standard structure or best practice that is used to store SQL scripts?
