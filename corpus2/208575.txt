Is there any software which can be used to write functional and non-functional requirements? When writing those, it is essential to:   * Store the document in text format to be able to make diffs and minimize the impact on the version control,   * Apply extensive formatting when creating diagrams would be an overkill,   * Use diagrams, preferably stored in text format as well,   * Cross-link the requirements or the appendixes. Currently, I can only think about three editors which _may_ be used, but which are not truly suitable:   1. **A Markdown editor.** Benefits: text only; easy to add formatting. Disadvantage: not powerful enough: one can add images, but not diagrams; formatting is rather limited; no cross-linking (unless adding much HTML markup).   2. **An HTML editor.** Benefits: text only; ability to add diagrams with HTML 5. Advanced formatting is possible. Disadvantages: markup difficult to change by hand, or if WYSIWYG editor is used, markup is often too verbose and low quality; cross-linking limited to manual only.   3. **A document editor such as OpenOffice or Microsoft Word.** Benefits: ability to apply some advanced formatting; excellent automated cross-linking. Disadvantages: binary format, which means no diff and wasted space in version control. What are my other choices? What is actually used in the industry?
