I am doing my PhD in Clinical Neuropsychology; I had someone helping me analyse images (.jpg pictures) in _Mathematica_ , but it turns out this person made some really bad decisions, and well, now I have to do it myself. But, I have no idea. Basically, what I want is to analyze the JPEG image, get a RGB histogram, and get the values for the mean and standard deviation of this histogram. Using `ImageHistogram [[*image*], Appearance, -> "Separated"]` works fine, but I can't figure out the next step, turning the histogram plot into numbers. How can I do that? Thank you for helping!
