I'm using _Mathematica_ 10.0 under Ubuntu 14.04. When using the function `Manipulate` with option **AutoAction** , I find that the slider doesn't respond to my mouse movement _without clicking_. I need to _drag_ to move it. Similarly, every function that has the option **AutoAction** , such as `LocatorPane`, doesn't respond to my mouse movement as well. But under Windows 8.1, it works well. I refered to this page: Manipulate (Linux version of Mathematica). But my OpenJDK seemed to be up-to-date. What should I do? **Reference:** AutoAction - Wolfram Mathematica Documentation Center P.S. My OpenJDK version: > java version "1.7.0_55"   >  OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.4.7) (7u55-2.4.7-1ubuntu1)   >  OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)
