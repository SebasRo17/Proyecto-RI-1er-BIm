Say I want to build a website that support multiple language and use MongoDB datastore. I wonder what is a good approach to have multiple versions of the body and title of an article, one for each language. Should I keep all versions in the same article document? Like a collection of key-value pairs of language code and text in the body field of the article. This way I'd get no more than 1 request for viewing articles, but I'd also get more data than I might need so the response is larger. Is there a better solution? How and why?
