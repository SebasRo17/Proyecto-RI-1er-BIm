A few years ago I immigrated to another country and early last year I managed to get my master's degree. Back then I was desperately looking for a job and I was fortunate to get offered a job in a small software development company. For the record, back in my home company, I was a well-known developer with a very good track record and I used to work as a senior developer and team leader for a software development company. Now after more than 1 year, for both technical and non-technical reasons I want to leave my current job. I can tolerate some of the technical problems we have but our manager and team leader are constantly disrespecting me and communicate with me in an offensive and belittling manner and for times and times this has made me feel depressed, anxious, stressed, and what not. Now my question is, how should a person in my situation, respond to "why are you leaving your current job?". Obviously I cannot say "because my manager is a psycho who is disrespecting me and offending me all the time and I have had enough". How do you think I should respond to questions like this?
