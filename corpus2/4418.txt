While hacking on some static analysis tool, I realized I could make the task at hand (irrelevant for this question) much easier by saving the source files on-the-fly, while they were being edited. This seemed weird at first, but being a lazy cat I actually did it, and it turns out I find this pretty useful :   * no need to check if all files were saved before running a compiler/interpreter   * forces you to make granular commits much more regularly My editor has been behaving this way for a couple of days, I never had such a clean commit history, and didn't get burned yet. In the days of DVCS when by saving we actually mean commit, do you think that manually saving files is still a relevant practice ?
