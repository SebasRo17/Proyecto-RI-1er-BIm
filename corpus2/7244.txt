First off, I am using Mathematica 8.0 and Mac OS X 10.7.4. Recently, when starting a new Mathematica session, I am confronted with an error beep and message window stating "The file you tried to open was not found or could not be opened." That said, I can simply click OK, and the error box vanishes which seemingly no more problems. This is potentially a problem for me, because I have scripts set up on my computer that instruct Mathematica to open at particular times, then do particular tasks. I also want to add that I am using Dropbox to access Mathematica files in the cloud, but I never open and evaluate any one file in the cloud at the same time. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated.
