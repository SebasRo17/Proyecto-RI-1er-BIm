is there a general method to evaluate the optimality of an optimization algorithm, for example an algorithm solving an otherwise NP-hard or NP- complete problem? The only method I came up so far is comparing the results of the algorithm against already known optimal solutions. If not, are there specific methods for some special problems? **EDIT** To clarify: By optimality I mean how close the result is to an optimal solutions result.
