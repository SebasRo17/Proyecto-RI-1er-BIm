I am designing a public code repository. Users will be allowed to post and edit whatever amount of code they want, from code snippets to **entire multi- file projects**. I have a few major legal concerns about this:   * **Not getting sued/shut down** \- I feel the site would be a much easier target than tracking down an individual user to sue. I have looked around a bit and see links to legal info in the footer of each page is common. What specific things should I do--and what does does a site such as YouTube (which I see copyrighted material on all the time) do--for protection?   * **Citing sources and editing sourced code** \- If a user wants to post code that isn't theirs, what concerns/safeguards should I have? Will a link suffice, and what do I need further to allow the code to be edited (to improve it for example)? What can happen if a user posts copyrighted code without citing it?   * **Large chunks of code** \- What legal differences should I look out for as the amount grows?   * **Not having a mess of licenses for the site** \- I would like to have a single license (like RosettaCode) that keeps things simple for interaction on the site. I want the code to be postable _and editable_. I have looked into StackOverflow's CreativeCommons license a little and it says that > If you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may distribute the > resulting work only under the same or similar license to this one. And on RosettaCode: > All software found on Rosetta Code should be considered potentially > hazardous. Use at your own risk. Be aware that all code on Rosetta Code is > under the GNU Free Documentation License, as are any edits made by > contributors. See Rosetta Code:Copyrights for details. What other licenses are like this?   * **Commercializing the site** \- In what ways can I and can't I make money off of a site that contains code like this? All code will be publicly visible. Initial thoughts are having ads or making money by charging for advanced features.
