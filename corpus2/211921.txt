I am not sure if this is a clear question. I work on a python project that is based on terminal(console), for which I am planning to implement a GUI. I am not major in CS so I really have no idea about how to effectively design a message system such that:   1. in console, it provide nice look info when runtime.   2. in GUI, it is directed to a certain widget, let's say, a text label, or a bottom bar, or a hide-able frame. Do you have any suggestions? Currently, I am using `print` function to provide essential informations on `stdout` during runtime. So a lot of `print ....` are distributed here and there among the code. I am thinking to use macro-like variables such as 'FILE_NOT_EXTIS_MESSAGE' for printing, and define the variables in one file. Is this a standard way that people always do? How about I introduce a logging system? In sum, I am ask for a pattern that people are commonly using for handling of screen output information with high effectiveness and adaptivity.
