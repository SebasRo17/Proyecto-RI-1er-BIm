I am currently publishing a paper on skin detection. However, I need to find the appropriate histogram bin size for each colorspace. I recently came upon a paper that published what it found to be the ideal bin size. The paper can be found at: http://www.inf.pucrs.br/~pinho/CG/Trabalhos/DetectaPele/Artigos/OPTIMUM%20COLOR%20SPACES%20FOR%20SKIN%20DETECTION.pdf. I am specifically talking about Table 1. If I cite the source, would it be okay for me to use data from the table? Note that I cannot contact the author of the paper.
