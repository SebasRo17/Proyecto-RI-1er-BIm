I've got an app which uses MVC, but I'm struggling a little as to how the controller should be architected. For example, the View is only viewing some subset of the model's data at once. However, I'm unsure as to exactly how this should be arranged. Is it normal for the View or Model to directly call functions on the Controller, for example? Through some sort of interface? Or are they totally encapsulated and never know about the Controller or each other? Just as an edit; this is a custom app not written in any web framework, so I'm not looking for framework-specific details here and have the freedom to make my own choice.
