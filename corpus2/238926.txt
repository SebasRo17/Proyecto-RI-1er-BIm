I'm facing the following situation: There are 2 different teams working on the same project using Scrum, and every now and then, bugs related to user stories developed by team "A" are being assigned to team "B". We're used to fixing bugs made by other people when they belong to the same team, but things get a bit more complicated when different teams are involved. Some of the developers don't like working this way and say that the bugs must be fixed by the ones who made them, and this is causing some conflicts between the teams. While reading some of the similar questions I've found some interesting ones (Is fixing bugs made by other people a good approach? and also Parallel teams and scrum/agile), but they are not about the same situation, or at least I don't see them that way. During our discussions here we got 2 possible approaches: Leave the situation as is, or determine that the bugs must be assigned to the team that developed the feature. Do you guys have any suggestions?
