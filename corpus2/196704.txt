I often feel that it would be more convenient if, within an issue tracking system, each issue were attributed to a certain function/method. Then, we can easily list all the issues related to a certain function/method. Many issues can be clearly attributed to a certain function/method. At times, we may want to look at issues sorted by the posted/edited time or by importance, be many other times, we want to look through only the issues related to a certain function/method. Of course, the system can be designed to be able to also display them mixed. And there are some issues that do not belong to a particular function/method, but they can be grouped together in some generic group.   1. Is there such issue tracking system out there?   2. Is there any problem with such system. If so, what are the problems?
