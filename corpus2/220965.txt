Up until now the styles were handled by a single CSS file (for each site). I'm customizing it like this:   * opened the site in Firefox   * opened inspector/style editor   * changed CSS values around until I was happy with how the site looks   * copied the generated CSS code and pasted it in the .css file from the server The design is quite outdated, so I decide to upgrade the application that powers the sites and the designs. But now, my developer tells me I'm doing it wrong. He wants to use "less", "compile and cache to css", create themes and allow me to change only basic stuff like colors and fonts through an administration interface. He says that if I want to customize deeper things I would have to learn CSS and edit the "less" files inside a code editor, not Firefox. Is he crazy or what? I don't understand how is this better than what I'm currently doing?
