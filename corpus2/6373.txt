Gustavo Delfino's answer to an earlier question showed that it is possible to use the third argument to `Placed` to format text in a `BarChart` legend as desired. For example, without this argument, the legend text in the example below would still be small and in Times, even though I have used `SetOptions` to style `BaseStyle` for `BarChart`, `Graphics`, etc.               BarChart[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 0.6], 40],       ChartStyle -> Join[ConstantArray[Green, {39}], {Orange}],       ChartLegends -> Placed[Join[ConstantArray[None, {39}], {"Preliminary estimates"}],         Bottom, Style[#, FontFamily -> "Arial", FontSize -> 14] &]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XuLmE.png) Is there a way to set this globally? I’d like to enforce the font style of legends in a package, the way I have already done for the frame around the legend using Mr.Wizard’s answer to an earlier question of mine on StackOverflow. I would have thought some setting of `BaseStyle` should work but these are the only (undocumented) options that `Legending`GridLegend` takes:               Options[Legending`GridLegend]          {"LegendPlacementFunction" -> Automatic,       LegendAppearance -> Automatic,       Legending`LegendContainer -> Automatic,       Legending`LegendHeading -> None, Legending`LegendImage -> Automatic,       Legending`LegendImage -> Automatic,       Legending`LegendLayout -> Automatic,       Legending`LegendPosition -> Automatic,       Legending`LegendSize -> Automatic}
