I want to fit ODE's coefficients to a model. I tried using `NMinimize`, but it seems it does symbolic instead of numerical calculations.               ode[a_] := Block[{am=a},            sol=NDSolve[{x''[t]==a,x[0]==0,x'[0]==1},x,{t,0,2}];            Abs[x[1]/.sol]]     NMinimize[ode[a],a]      And then, I got the Error Message: > >     NDSolve::ndnum: Encountered non-numerical value for a derivative at t == > 0.`. >   I have also tried `Method->"RandomSearch"` ect. I got:               {Abs[x[1] /.         NDSolve[{(x^\[Prime]\[Prime])[t] == a, x[0] == 0,         Derivative[1][x][0] == 1}, x, {t, 0, 1}]], {a -> -0.829053}}      I receive the error message > >     ReplaceAll::reps: "\!\({NDSolve[{\*SuperscriptBox[\"x\", > \"\[Prime]\[Prime]\", >       MultilineFunction->None][t] == a, x[0] == 0, \*SuperscriptBox[\"x\", > \"\[Prime]\", >       MultilineFunction->None][0] == 1}, x, {t, 0, 1}]}\) is neither a list >       of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used > for replacing." >   It seems to me that it performs symbolic calculations instead of numerical. Is there a way to solve this problem OR is there other ways to fit ODE's coefficients to a model ?
