I got a bunch of `C++` sources files and headers. They may use external libraries such as Boost e.g. I am interested in the process of building binaries for Windows and *nix.   * Makefiles (*nix) and .vcproj (Windows) call compilers with some specifications such as the order of compilation, compilation options and stuff.   * CMakeLists.txt can be used by CMake to build either makefiles or .vcproj and use very helpful commands such as recursive search of files, automatic linkage with known libraries, installers, variables that can be used in source files... Is there any existing tool that would generate a CMakeLists.txt from specified options ? Options could be like : scan this folder and make a library out of it, then scan this other folder and make an executable and automatically link both with Boost as well along with a user friendly installer with generated INSTALL.txt and README.txt. Something very powerful like that.
