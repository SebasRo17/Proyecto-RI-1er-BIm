I'm developing a small android app, which is regional independent. I'm curious, which language should I try to support? At the moment I'm only sure to support the languages I speak fluently. This is German and English. But what about French, Spanish or Japanese...? Are there any statistics out there to help determine which to support? P.S.: Should I use maybe crappy automatic translation, if I don't know a native speaker, or should I forget about it otherwise?
