It's been said in other questions that jvisualvm sampling works as a "lightweight" profiling tool by calculating metrics directly from Java stack frames. Its almost unanimously agreed that such a technique is _faster_ but not as _accurate_ in terms of its "timings". My question: why is this method not as accurate? And, what is it not as accurate as (as opposed to what? Are there more precise profiling techniques?)?
