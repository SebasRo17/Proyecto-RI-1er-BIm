I'm the author of this question from a couple of months ago: Java but no JEE experience I thought about just editing this question, because this a bit of a followup to it - but it's actually a different enough context to ask separately. Answers would cross over and the thread would get messy if I do that. Anyway, basically, in the past couple of months I've done a pretty intensive review of my JEE knowledge. Worked through a book, built apps from scratch, etc. At least in terms of a basic built-out-of-the-box Servlets/JSP CRUD app, I can say that I know how a JEE web application works now, how all the plumbing and configuration hooks up, etc. And I've got a much more comprehensive understanding of the JEE model in general than I had before. Here's my question: I'm hoping to go into JEE (probably web development, but preferably more the data-driven back end side of things) and am wondering if this knowledge is sufficient to start applying for work in the JEE space. I get conflicting reports: Some people say that good general programming skills + strong core Java are all that's needed, and others say that you actually need strong experience in the specific JEE-related frameworks and technologies for the given JEE roles. It's hard to get a good read on what's right - and I don't want to look ignorant for applying for things which I'm clearly not ready for. I have very strong core Java and almost a full decade of commercial programming experience, but really can't claim any of it as strong commercial JEE (only Swing, Applets, and lots and lots of core Java). **Note** : If it helps, I can mention I don't mind taking a job a notch below what can be expected with my overall level of commerical experience - to get into JEE. All this is mainly because the market for Applets and Swing development is pretty much dead at the moment, and I need to expand my Java ecosystem experience.
