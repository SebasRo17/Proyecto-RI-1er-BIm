I have a complex function of a single variable expressed in analytical form, which also depends on a parameter. I would like to have Mathematica show me for which values of the parameter the real part of the second derivative of the function is always positive. Strictly speaking, maybe I have given too much detail here, the real part/derivative stuff is ultimately inessential, what I want Mathematica to do is to tell me for what choices of a parameter a real function is positive everywhere. I hope the question is clear, though.
