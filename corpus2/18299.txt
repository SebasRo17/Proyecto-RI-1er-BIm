I'm running Mathematica 9.0.0 on a Macbook Air with OSX 10.6.8 and I've recently started having issues with the font in the program. All special characters are being replaced with other characters in the INPUT and OUTPUT cells. So for example I would type "[ ]" and in Mathematica it would show as "@ D". Also a "LikeResource|c|58" error appears during each startup. Here are a few other examples of where the font is being switched: Other examples: "[ ]" ----> "@ D" "{ }" ----> "8 ?" "( )" ----> "H L" "{9}" ----> ";9?" This doesn't affect the processing of Mathematica at all but it makes it Very difficult to use and read other peoples notebooks. I've already tried clearing the BaseDirectory and reinstalling the program and even looking through FontBook to ensure none of the fonts are corrupted or duplicated. Can anyone help me out with this issue, thanks for any help you can provide!
