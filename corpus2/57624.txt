I have a text file like as follows.               {     "XXX" -> "A",      "YYY" -> "A",     "ZZZ" -> "B"     }       I'd like to import this so I can send it directly to `Classify[]`. I've tried importing as `CSV` and `Text` but neither work. Example (That doesn't work):               data = Import["sample.txt", "CSV"];     c = Classify[data];      Although I'd settle for a normal CSV if that isn't possible.
