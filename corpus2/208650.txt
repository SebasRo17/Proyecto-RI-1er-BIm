My situation is that I've been programming for about three years and have learned a lot but still have a long long way to go. I have an idea for an app that I believe would take off, but I'm afraid to build it because it involves architecting a back-end with databases and authenticated payment transactions and user accounts and _I've never done any of that._ I'm afraid that if I hacked it together, people would use it and things would go wrong-- security flaws, data loss, somehow I accidentally drop_table and lose everyone's payment history, etc, because I'm not sufficiently experienced with industry practices in terms of data management, versioning, hosting transitions, and plain old coding. But I really want to build this. Has anyone every been in a similar situation, and do you have any advice?
