After a few months pause, I am using Workbench again and I cannot determine where is WB sending (deploying) my built package. WB does not ask for a destination folder, so I guess it must use some preference I set before... only I do not remember it! So, can someone please tell me how to find/set the destination folder for deployed applications? (Searching on my HDDs takes a long time.)
