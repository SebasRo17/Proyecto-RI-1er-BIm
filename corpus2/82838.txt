When I write high-level documentation about what an algorithm does, I use the term "array" to refer to the data structure on which the algorithm operates even though the actual data structure is an `std::vector`. I feel that using the term "vector" in this context does not (to me) best convey the meaning I'm after which is "a sequence of elements with constant-time random access" or perhaps more generally "a dynamic array". Is there a convention or common documentation standard for this distinction of similar terms?
