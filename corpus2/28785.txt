I am having some difficulties with the `ReplaceAll` function. When I write:               {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} /. x_?OddQ -> x^2      I expect: > >     {1,2,9,4,25} >   But if I write:               x = 1;     {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} /. x_?OddQ -> x^2      I have: > >     {1,2,1,4,1} >   How can I avoid this? I mean, even using:               x = 1;     Module[{x},{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} /. x_?OddQ -> x^2]      The output still: > >     {1,2,1,4,1} >   Thanks in advance! Edit: Thanks again! I never quite understood this `RuleDelayed`.
