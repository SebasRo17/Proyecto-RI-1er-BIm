In your opinion, do you think it is a waste of time to make checks that you know there is no possible way of it being there/not being there, or would you just put it there just in case there is a bug or something? For example, below checks to see if a button is visible, then music is playing, but there is no way for that button to be shown without the music playing:               if (buttonVisible)         if ([music playing] == true) //is always true if the button is visible             [music stopPlaying];
