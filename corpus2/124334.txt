I'm currently studying a Master in Computer Science and I am interested in working with Software Agents and C#. I have found so much information regarding theoretical aspects but just a few articles focused on practical programming aspects such as architecture, design or implementation. Could anybody suggest any good source that I could explore? I wouldn't like to "reinvent the wheel" but to contribute with something better to the current state of the art.
