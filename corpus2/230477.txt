What is the best way to name a List in XSD schema?               <xs:element name="CurrentEmployee" type="Employee" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" />      Currently I have a list of Current Employees as specified in my schema above. But when the Java classes are generated , I access the list of employees as               List<Employee> emps =  req.getCurrentEmployee();      which gives a wrong impression that we are retrieving a single employee. If I make my schema as "CurrentEmployees" , Java code would look good but when we look at the XML data , each row will be displayed as `"<CurrentEmployees ...".` So I can't decide between CurrentEmployees vs CurrentEmployee. Any suggestion for getting this naming convention correct?
