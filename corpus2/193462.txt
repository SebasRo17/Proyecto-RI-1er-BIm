I am trying to make my way back to JavaScript (been there last time some 7 years ago) with the help of lovely "Eloquent JavaScript" book. While I admire author's capabilities and approach, I have also began being concerned. I am from C/C++ background and there I learnt it rather hard way that funky constructs often undermine project survival. Experience with the Perl proved different. Being capable of cool tricks seemed a valuable perk. **So, what is the common view upon JavaScript code complexity. Does using it at "full speed" (OOP done own way, higher order functions everywhere etc) help having maintainable projects?** Thanks for your answers
