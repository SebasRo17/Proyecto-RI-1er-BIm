A customer of my employer has recently requested new features for some legacy code, and since the authors of the program are no longer here, I've been assigned to implement the new features. I've been provided with some high-level documents that are mostly from early stages of the project: the project definition, black-box testing procedures, research analysis of the initial phase of the project, and so on - nothing at a technical level. The code makes extensive use of a third party library (Lemur Indri) for indexing and retrieval of indexed materials, but there's no documentation of how we use this library, or why it was chosen. I've spent a lot of time just learning about the library itself and how we use it; I feel like this is wasted time. During a meeting with my supervisor I mentioned that it would have been nice if the developers of our system had written some documentation about the library and how we use it. I told him that it would have saved a lot of time for me, but I couldn't convince him that this type of thing is essential. I think writing such documentation helps future developers to get a grip on the system and perform modification faster. If there should be such document, what would it be called, or should it be included in one of the design documents?
