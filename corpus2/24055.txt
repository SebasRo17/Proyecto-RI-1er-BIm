Running this code:               Histogram[{RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[1/4,0.12],100],      RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[3/4, 0.12], 100]},       Automatic, "Probability", PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}},      Frame -> True, PlotRangeClipping -> True,      FrameLabel -> {Style["x axis", 15], Style["probability", 15]}     ]      Gives me the following plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jYSLN.png) As you can see, the label on the right ("probability") is not printed correctly. The character "y" is missing. What's going on here? I am using Mathematica 9.0.0.0. I ran this on two laptops, one with Windows 7 and the other with Windows 8. **Update** : Judging by the comments, this seems to be a bug. So now the question becomes: **Is there a workaround?** **Update** : This seems to be bug, so I'll tag as such. In the meantime, see the answers for workarounds.
