I'm struggling to find guidance on integrating various applications, usually based on a Domain Model architecture. The applications often expose and consume each others WCF services, but this tends to be done in a rather hap- hazard way. I'm quite certain that the domain should not access another applications services, but where should they be consumed from? UI, Application layer? Data Layer? All I've read about SOA seems to contain theoretical information about what makes a service, but nothing about how to actually implement it in code. And what if I need to return/query on a join between two entities in two systems? Many resources suggest denormalising data into the calling system, and updating using messages, but should messaging and WCF be combined in the same system? I've read Enterprise Application Integration but it still leaves me with many questions. What are good resources/code samples for integrating domain model systems?
