I´m working on a mod update checker for minecraft, but there is a big problem: The modders and online database that I´m using for update checks has no standard software versions e.g.:               Local: rv0-stable-10 Online: rv1-alpha-13     Local: R1.1-83 Online: r1.1-81     Local: 1.7.10-0.2.250 (1.7.10 is indicating the Minecraft version) Online: 0.2.274     Local: 1.1.0c Online: 1.1.0e     Local: 2.2.526 Online: 2.2.526-experimental      Is there an algorithm or something like that, that is able to compare such different versions?
