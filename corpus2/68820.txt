Yesterday i saw in a post a guy said that built in Stack/Queue are 5x slower than a normally coded Stack/queue !   Is it true ?   If true then why Microsoft (C#.NET,VB.NET) or Oracle (JAVA) is giving such ADT ?   Which one you prefer ? Writing your own or using the built in ? [I think most of the people prefer the built in as the code have been tested many times and is very very optimized]
