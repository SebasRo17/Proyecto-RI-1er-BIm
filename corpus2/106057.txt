I am new to HTML and Im working on a self made project and I have to use < table > and < fieldset > tags in my html files. I need to set the width and height properties to the tables like               <td width="100" height="200" > </td> <!-- something like that -->      But Im afraid of these reason because as the Monitor size changes with the computers some have large screens and some have small screens like notebook pc's. The table dimensions looks small for the big screen computers and big to the small screen computers.How do I manage them. How do I fit it to all types of screen sizes. I mean when it goes to the right most part of the screen it jumps to the next line, if I use width property to the < td > tag? and also using Padding like these is a bad idea ?               < span style="padding-left:100"> </span>      It looks exactly what i want on my browser. Does it look same on all types of monitor sizes? or does it vary? Is there any standard way to follow it? I love your answers but answer these original question too, does it matter to the monitor sizes using width and height properties in < td > tag ?
