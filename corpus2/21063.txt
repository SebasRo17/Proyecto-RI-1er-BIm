The following code works, except that the colors aren't showing in the output. Wh? I probably made a trivial mistake, but I'm yet unable to find it.                 Flatten[Table[{x, y, z} =            {RandomReal[{-10, 10}], RandomReal[{-10, 10}], RandomReal[{-10, 10}]};         p = 0.1;         {u, v, w} = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0};         NestList[(u += RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, s]];            v += RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, s]];            w += RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, s]];            # + p {u, v, w}) &, {x, y, z}, 50],         {s, 0.1, 1, 0.05}], 1];     PlotColor = ColorData["SunsetColors"];          Graphics3D[{PointSize[0.1], {PlotColor[Norm[#]], Sphere[#, 0.1]}& /@ RandomWalkCoords},        Boxed -> False, Background -> Black, Lighting -> "Neutral", SphericalRegion -> True]      I'm not very familiar with this way of programming _Mathematica_ (I'm on version 7.0 by the way), but I'm learning! The output should show a bunch of random curves made of small balls (no lines), with a radial color gradient. Maybe there's a simpler way of doing this?
