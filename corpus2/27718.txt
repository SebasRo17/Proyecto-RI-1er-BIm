Here is a pure function with multiple slots:               (#1^2 + #2^2)&[3, 4]      > 25 But how can I map that pure function over lists of values? For example, say I want to map `(#1^2 + #2^2)&` over `x = {1, 2, 4}` and `y = {3, 4, 6}`. I have tried the following expressions, but none of them work:               Map[(#1^2 + #2^2) &, {1, 2, 4}, {3, 4, 6}]     Map[(#1^2 + #2^2) &, {{1, 2, 4}, {3, 4, 6}}]     Map[(#1^2 + #2^2) &, {{1, 3}, {2, 4}, {4, 6}}]      The result I expect is obviously `{10, 20, 52}`. Could some one help me with this?
