Yesterday, a colleague asked me how to configure our VCS to timestamp the local copy of files pulled from the repository with the modification time in the repository. I've always believed that they should be timestamped with the time they were pulled so that if you make a change, build, then back out by overwriting the changed file with the repository's copy, everything that depends on that file will build correctly. I thought about it overnight, but couldn't come up with a good reason to have timestamped with the repository modification time. What would be the advantages of doing it that way? (Bonus question: repository modification time and local modification time are the only timestamping strategies that I'm aware of. Are there others in use by VCS systems?)
