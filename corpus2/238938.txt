When running a site that has a CRM with a logging facility that logs users interactions (someone changing a name, address or user permission etc), is it better to log system interactions (automated tasks and alike) as a fake user set up as a constant either in a "users" object, or as part of the application settings so you can either do `applicationscope.SystemUser` or `UserObject.getSystemUser()`. Having talked in work, some colleagues believe it is an abuse of the User database to have a fake user in there to represent the System and believe it better to alter up the database so tables that are affected by such a change carry a `isSystem` flag that would be set to 1 should the system make changes.
