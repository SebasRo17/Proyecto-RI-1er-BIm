So I was currently in the middle of coding, unfortunately for me, I was in "The Zone" then I thought to myself, are my method/variable names to long? **POP** out of the Zone I go! So I came here to ask, are my method/variable names too long? You be the Judge! Bonus points to anyone who can figure out what I'm writing, although I'm sure a guru will figure it out fast! Anyway, here are some of my method and variable names. Methods : searchBlockedListForBlockedSquares(), isCurrentSquareNextToAtLeastOneBlockedSquare(), searchBlockedListForBlockedSquares() Variables: isNextToBlockedSquares; I Guess there was only one variable that seemed too long.
