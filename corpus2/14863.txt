I would like to combine a 3-dimensional graph of a function with its 2-dimensional contour-plot underneath it in a professional way. But I have no idea how to start. I have a three of these I would like to make, so I don't need a fully automated function that does this. A giant block of code would be just fine. The two plots I would like to have combined are:               potential1 =        Plot3D[-3600. h^2 + 0.02974 h^4 - 5391.90 s^2 + 0.275 h^2 s^2 + 0.125 s^4,          {h, -400, 400}, {s, -300, 300}, PlotRange -> {-1.4*10^8, 2*10^7},          ClippingStyle -> None, MeshFunctions -> {#3 &}, Mesh -> 10,         MeshStyle -> {AbsoluteThickness[1], Blue}, Lighting -> "Neutral",         MeshShading -> {{Opacity[.4], Blue}, {Opacity[.2], Blue}}, Boxed -> False,         Axes -> False]      and               contourPotentialPlot1 =        ContourPlot[-3600. h^2 + 0.02974 h^4 - 5391.90 s^2 + 0.275 h^2 s^2 + 0.125 s^4,         {h, -400, 400}, {s, -300, 300}, PlotRange -> {-1.4*10^8, 2*10^7},        Contours -> 10, ContourStyle -> {{AbsoluteThickness[1], Blue}}, Axes -> False,         PlotPoints -> 30]      These two plots look like: ![The 3-D plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tvjcJ.png) ![The contour plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hc3qA.png) I would also love it if I could get 'grids' on the sides of the box like in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GammaAbsSmallPlot.png
