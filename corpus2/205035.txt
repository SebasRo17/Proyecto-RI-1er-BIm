I deploy an interactive software using Java Web Start. This is a quiet useful deployment technology and I don't want to change. Besides I am about to publish my software under a GNU GPL license. Usually, when a user installs a new software he is asked to read the license terms and accept it. Is there any equivalent process with Java Web Start ? How can I ask my user to accept the license terms before using it ?
