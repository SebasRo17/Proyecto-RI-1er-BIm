There are quite a few questions on Stack Overflow about the Linq to Entity / Linq to SQL Sum extension method, about how it returns null when the result set is empty: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and many more, as well as a blog post discussing the issue here. I feel it is an inconsistency in the Linq implementation. I am assuming at this point that it is not a bug, but is more or less working as designed. I understand that there are workarounds (for example, casting the field to a nullable type, so you can coalesce with `??`), and I also understand that for the underlying SQL, a NULL result is expected for an empty result set. But because the result of the Sum extension for non-nullable types is also non-nullable, **why does the Linq to SQL / Linq to Entity Sum behave this way?**
