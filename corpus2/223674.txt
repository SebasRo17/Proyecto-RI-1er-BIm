I had worked in the past for a small company developing web applications. Back then the ~~current~~ lead developer, who is also one of the bosses, told me that he is incapable of making a `JOIN` inside a `SQL` query. I was amazed how a person who has developed and maintain big ecommerce site is incapable of doing that. Are database normalization and functional dependencies a waste of time? Are they only necessary in big demanding projects?
