I have two sets $A = \\{1 \leq x \leq 5\\}$ and $B = \\{5 \leq x \leq 8\\}$. Now I want to find the `Union` and `Intersection` of $A$ and $B$. I tried `Union[A, B]`, I got `{1 <= x <= 5, 5 <= x <= 8}` and for `Intersection[A, B]`, I got `{}`. The correct answer for $A \cup B$ is `[1, 8]` and $A \cap B$ is `{5}`. How do I tell _Mathematica_ to do that? And if $A = \\{1 < x < 5\\}$ and $B = \\{x > 5\\}$. Now I want to find the `Union` and `Intersection` of $A$ and $B$. How do I tell _Mathematica_ to do that?
