Imagine a simple `Controller` (as in process control) interface. I have some concrete classes, say `PIDController`, that implement it. I also have some decorator classes that extend these classes somehow, say `ITAETuningDecorator`. Now imagine that a `FloodGate` class has a private `Controller` field. I would like, from the outside and at runtime, to attach to the `Controller` in `FloodGate` an `ITAETuningDecorator`. How can I do it? I have no access to the field from the outside and obviously the decorator needs a reference to the original controller to be built.
