For some reason, the `SubTitle` and `SubSubTitle` cell formats do not group automatically on my machine any more, and I cannot figure out how to fix that. To be explicit, here is a picture of the problem: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hXoo8.png) If you notice, only the topmost layer in the hierarchy will automatically group with those below it, until you reach the `Section` level (level-4 on the default stylesheet). This makes using the notebook interface difficult for deeply nested topics, as there are only an effective 4 levels of grouping available to me. How can I fix this?
