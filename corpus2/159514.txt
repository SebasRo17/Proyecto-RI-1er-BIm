I am about to undertake a project for university, and given the project scope I have decided to use XP/agile methodology. I have began with developing a use case diagram; gathering user stories for the first couple features. I am in the process of helping the customer develop the acceptance test and my question is: _can the user stories for each feature be used as a user acceptance test?_
