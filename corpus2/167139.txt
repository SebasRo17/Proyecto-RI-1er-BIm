I am migrating my team from a snarl of poorly managed excel documents, individual checklists, and personal emails to manage our application issues and development tasks to a new JIRA project. My team and I are new to JIRA (and issue tracking software in general). My team is skeptical of the transition at best, so I am also trying not to scare them off by introducing something overly complex at the start. I understand one of JIRA's strengths to be the customized workflows that can be created for a project. I've looked over the JIRA documentation and a number of tutorials, and am comfortable with the how in creating workflows, but I need some contextual What to go along with it.   * _What makes a particular workflow work well?_   * _What does a poorly designed workflow look like?_   * _What are the benefits/drawbacks of a strict workflow with very specific states and transitions to a looser workflow, with fewer, broader defined states and transitions_
