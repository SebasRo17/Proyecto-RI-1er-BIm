I am developing a project, In that I have a receipt page (this is the html page that I want to convert it into pdf) and I've to print it. While printing that page alignments are not coming properly. If I convert it into pdf, then pdf only will take care of that alignments thus my work will become easy and effective. I was restricted to use either JavaScript or js libraries only to complete this task. Could any of you please help me?
