I want to plot the Taylor polynomials of $f(x,y)= Sin(1 + x + y^2)/(4 + x^2 + y^2)$ of degrees 4 and 7 around the point $(0,0)$ over the rectangle $[-\pi,\pi]\times [-\pi,\pi]$ I am currently using               Plot3D[      Series[(Sin(1 + x + y^2))/(4 + x^2 + y^2), {x, 0 , 4}, {y, 0, 7}],       {x,-pi, pi} , {y, -pi,pi}]      Nothing actually happens. I also tried just computing the points and then graphing those, but I have quite a few of these plots to do and it seems like a hassle. Anyone have any ideas?
