I have been coding for a good bit, and I found a project I want to work on -- a python web app using django + mongodb. I know what I want my web app to do. When you are in this circumstance (just starting a brand new project) where do you start? What do you code first? Do you code the views first? Hope this hasn't been asked before (I did a quick look), but I could use some general direction.
