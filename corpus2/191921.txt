I am currently building a website, which until quite recently was purely PHP. However I am now making trying to have the site use more AJAX, to lessen the page reloads. In PHP I had a lovely object orientated user class with methods for updating data, logging out, and so on. When a user logs on this would be stored as a session variable, and then any page that wishes to do anything the user could just grab it from the session and call it's methods. Clearly this use of php objects and the session doesn't really work with ajax. However I don't want to have to scrap storing the user in an object (which neatens things up somewhat), so don't just want to go down the route of defining a ton of js functions that grab the current username, and use the to do mysql queries through ajax. Am I being stupid here, and what route would people recommend I take.
