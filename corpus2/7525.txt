> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How can I remove B -> A from a list if A -> B is in the list? I'm working toward building a graph and use some code to construct my rules which results in a form as follows:               g = {1 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 1, 2 -> 3, 2 -> 4, 3 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 3 -> 1, 4 -> 3, 4 -> 2}      I would like to delete all reverse duplicate entries form the list, i.e. both `1->2` and `2->1` appear in the list. I would like to get rid of one of them and do this for all reverse duplicates in the list `g`.
