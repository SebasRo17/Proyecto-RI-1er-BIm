**How can I add and delete weighted edges in a weighted graph?** Using `Graph` in _Mathematica_ I want to add a weighted edge to a weighted graph. The problem is `EdgeAdd` seems to always return an unweighted graph. For example:               g = Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3}, EdgeWeight -> {5, 11}]     g1 = EdgeDelete[g, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3]     g2 = EdgeAdd[g, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3]      Here, `g1` has its edge weights messed up, so `WeightedAdjacencyMatrix` does not work. It seems the list of edge weights is too long since no element has been deleted. `g2`, on the other hand, is an unweighted graph. I even tried wrapping the added edge in               Property[1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3, EdgeWeight -> 13]      but that only got me an error when supplied to `EdgeAdd`. I can bypass the `EdgeDelete` thing quite easily by afterwards readjusting the `EdgeWeights` list, but I haven't found a way to solve the `EdgeAdd` problem.
