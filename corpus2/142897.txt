I'm composing communication lyrics for client-server and what am I thinking about:   * "authme username passord" (maybe encrytped)   * "accept"   * "get archive of H2O from 03.02.2005 to 20.12.2064"   * transferring binary structure or "error descrtiption" why I always need to do something like   * 0x0FA52FD + CRC   * 0x0D34423 + CRC   * ... I can see some secure reasons but I think it's not the real reason so why I can't use strings in client-server communication?
