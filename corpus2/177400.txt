I am developing a tool that discovers network services enabled on host and writes short summary on them like this:               init,1     └── login,1560 --         └── bash,1629             └── nc,12137 -lup 50505     {         :net => [             [0] "*:50505 IPv4 UDP "         ],         :fds => [             [0] "/root (cwd)",             [1] "/",             [2] "/bin/nc.traditional",             [3] "/xochikit/ld_poison.so (stat: No such file or directory)",             [4] "/dev/tty2",             [5] "*:50505"         ]     }      It proved to be very nice formatted and useful for quick discovery thanks to colors provided by the `awesome_print` gem. However, its output is just a text. One issue is that if I want to share it, I lose colors. I'd also like to fold and unfold parts of objects, quickly jump to specific processes and what not? Adding comments, for example. Thus I want something web-based. What is the best approach to implement features like these? I haven't worked with web interfaces before and I don't have much experience with Ruby. **Update** : Maybe I didn't write my willings clear enough. I think I want something that behaves like Chromium's chrome://chrome/settings/ (or better, of course). Is there maybe an erb template or manual showing how to implement that? I thought this is a thing needed often enough.
