I'm writing a small application that will reset the entire “environment” consisting of various machines and applications. Machine names are added via config file - this is read, the appropriate services are stopped and log files deleted. My problem isn’t how to do this (its already working) a bit more elegantly, but due to my lack of experience, I'm curious of the proper architecture. Right now I feel it’s a mess, large blocks of code, in 5 different classes (delete, processes management, etc) and I would like to make this available for others to enhance. For example, Ive been thinking about breaking up the DeleteLog class into separate classes by machine, adding and interface and programming each of them to the interface (Strategy Pattern?). I've also contemplated using delegates (to which I'm very clueless, but it's always a good time to learn).
