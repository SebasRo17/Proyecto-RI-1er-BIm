I am trying to create a _poc_ for a **_static code analysis_** tool supporting an Object Oriented and a procedural language (C and Java, for example). Even after quite a bit of internet search I am still not sure where to begin.   * Plan to use very few metrics to start with, possibly simple ones.    * Several tools are available but I am looking for a generic approach and not a tool. Few open questions :   * Should the tool work on basic object code or should it work on the raw source code?    * Should I create a domain specific language for defining parsing rules etc.? I am not asking for a complete solution. I am just asking if some one can point me in the right direction.
