I have gotten a tremendous amount of information from the question posted at (Load a Mathematica Package via .Net code), which my application is very similar to. Specifically in that thread, the author uses:               MathKernel k = new MathKernel();  //Establishes a Mathematica kernel       k.Compute("<< XYZ`XYZGraphs`");   //Runs an entire package file        string res = k.Result.ToString(); //Collects the result of the file      I was wondering if there was a similar process for a Notebook file? When I tried referencing a Notebook file in the same manner, the math kernel returns `$Failed` as the result. Other solutions I thought might work but have not had any success with have been using `IKernelLink` and `IMathLink`, or converting the Notebook file to a Package file. I also saw a thread about running from the command line but I am not sure how I would get the results of the Notebook back into .Net using that method. I would greatly appreciated any advice, thanks!
