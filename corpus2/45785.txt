I recently switched from Windows 7 to Mac OS X 10.9.2 for Mathematica development, and have set up Mathematica 9.0.2 and Wolfram Workbench 2 (running under Eclipse Kepler). Most everything works pretty well. However, on Windows, I would often work with notebooks by double-clicking them in Eclipse's "Package Explorer" view, which would open them in an already-running Mathematica front-end if there was one available. This was a pretty convenient. It also doesn't seem to work on the Mac; when I double click a notebook, it launches a whole new front-end. This is less convenient. I can drag the little notebook icons onto the Mathematica icon in the Dock, but double-clicking would be nicer if I can make it work. The obvious trick was to replace the path to the front-end executable with the path to `open`, the Mac OS command-line tool for opening documents in their associated applications. This didn't work even a little bit, with Eclipse complaining that the path to the executable was wrong.
