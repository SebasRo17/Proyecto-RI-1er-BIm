I am working on a desktop application which is in German. And this isn't comfortable for me to see the words and go to Google translate to translate it. So I am looking to make extra effort for myself to try to translate the App into English using Google translate web service. But the Application doesn't use a Spring or AOP in order to make a single point of calling the web service. My question is there a way to create a new project to introduce spring with AOP in order to achieve this. or there is another way to achieve this ?
