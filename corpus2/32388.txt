I defined the following function:               sw[ θ_, ϕ_, h_] =  1/2 Sin[2 (ϕ - θ)] + h Sin[ϕ]      Based upon whether I use Solve or `NSolve`, I get different answers:               Solve[ sw[ π/2, ϕ, -1] == 0 && 0 <= ϕ <= π, ϕ]      I get different answers from:               NSolve[ sw[ π/2, ϕ, -1] == 0 && 0 <= ϕ <= π, ϕ]      The answer using `Solve` is complete and correct. However, with `NSolve` it only gives you a partial answer `ϕ == 0` but not `ϕ == π`. Does anyone have any idea why _Mathematica_ 9 is doing this?   How do I get the same answer from both the methods?
