I am looking for a good CI solution for a haskell project. Ideally something that will work with git. Really basic need (so far) build and run tests after each check in. Some basic reporting would be great too, but it does not need to be anything real fancy. It should also support running javascript tests in a browser. (via Selenium or the like) What have people been using for this?
