Are there any particularly good books for understanding how C++ works "under the hood"? My reasons for asking this are that I am very interested in C++ performance system programming (low latency etc). I have been suggested the following but wasn't sure if there are any others:   * C++ FAQs    * Modern C++ Design    * Effective C++ Basically I dont want books which are going to teach me the C++ syntax, but rather if I create this object, this is what really happens and this is achieved via this part of the operating system bla bla etc. An example of something I recently learnt and would like to learn more similar interesting facts: if you inline C++ code too much, you will increase the program instruction size, the number of OS pages it occupies and this will increase the likelihood of TLB misses for the processor.
