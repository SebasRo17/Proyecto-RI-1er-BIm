I am wondering what phrases that would have the most impact when approaching a business, to inform them why they should test their software. Obviously you have easy ones; reduce costs/risk, improves stability/reliability/usability. But these are just words, how would you wrap them into something concrete that even people living in their own world, could see the potential benefit of software testing. I'm looking for shared experience. And how would you as a developer like to be approached by a software tester? PS: Help! I'm not sure how to ask this question properly!
