I work with C# professionally and I write code like this all the time.               private IEnumerable<Something> GetAlotOfSomething()     {         if (somethingA.IsReady)             yield return somethingA;          if (somethingB.IsReady)             yield return somethingB;          if (somethingC.IsReady)             yield return somethingC;               // ... More complex logic     }          var specialSomethings =          GetAlotOfSomething()         .Where(s => s.IsSpecial);       Then one day I have to write a bit of VB6 or JScript and I end up writing so much boilerplate just to get things done. Anyone thoughts?
