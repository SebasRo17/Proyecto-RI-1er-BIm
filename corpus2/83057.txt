I have come to use LINQ in my every day programming a lot. In fact, I rarely, if ever, use an explicit loop. I have, however, found that I don't use the SQL like syntax anymore. I just use the extension functions. So rather then saying:               from x in y select datatransform where filter       I use:               x.Where(c => filter).Select(c => datatransform)      Which style of LINQ do you prefer and what are others on your team are comfortable with?
