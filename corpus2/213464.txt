I am reading CLR via C# and came across this sentence in the first chapter and I did not understand what exactly it meant. Full line here: > because IL offers no instructions to manipulate registers, it is easy for > people to create new languages and compilers that produce code targeting the > CLR. What does it mean? I ventured a guess that it means IL is a bit low level, but not too low so that it is easy to create languages on top of it.
