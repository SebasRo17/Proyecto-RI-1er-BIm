I have two matrices M1 and M2. Both have same number of columns but different number of rows. I want to make a new matrix M which should have 1st row form M1, second row form M2, third row form M1, fourth row from m2 and so on. For example,               M1 = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};     M2 = {{10, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15}, {16, 17, 18}, {19, 20, 21}, {22, 23, 24}};      and my final matrix should be               M = {{1, 2, 3}, {10, 11, 12}, {4, 5, 6}, {13, 14, 15}, {7, 8, 9}, {16, 17, 18}, {19, 20, 21}, {22, 23, 24}};      Please note length of each matrix is over 1000. Thank you for your help.
