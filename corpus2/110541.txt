A developer on our team litters his code with debug outputs. He passes many parameters into methods that are only used for debugging. Personally I find this clutters up the code. If I need to debug something I prefer to use breakpoints and the watch window instead of reading through all the debug output. I am making major changes to several classes written by this other developer, should I maintain his debug outputs or can I justify removing them? I have only been in this team for a few months and don't want to upset this developer but also I expect he will rarely be updating this part of the system.
