I'm hosting a solution that serves as a web tier on a Ubuntu machine running Apache and Mono. I'm currently developing the project on OSX, using Mono. I understand there is no native support for Linq to SQL in Mono, so I've been going old school and developing stored procedures for my database interaction. I use ADO.NET for connectivity. Development is painstakingly slow. Whenever I make a change to a stored procedure, I must update fields all across my architecture. I've gotten very lazy in terms of being able to easily delete an entity in Linq to SQL and have my objects updated with new fields. It feels like development is taking 10x as long as it would natively in .NET in Windows. Is there a better architecture I could be using for my database connectivity? While the methodology I'm adhering to is straightforward and works fine, it's simply a slow approach.
