Could somebody explain, why `Circle` does not inherit the `PlotStyle` of the plot when used as `PlotMarkers`? Here is an example:               l1 = RandomInteger[100, {20, 2}]     cross = Graphics[{Line[{{-1, 1}, {1, -1}}], Line[{{1, 1}, {-1, -1}}]}];     circle = Graphics[Circle[{0, 0}, 1]];     ListPlot[l1, PlotStyle -> Thick, PlotMarkers -> {cross, .03}]     ListPlot[l1, PlotStyle -> Thick, PlotMarkers -> {circle, .03}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jOTjD.png) This seem to work as expected, but the only difference is that Graphics is given a list of primitives:               circle1 = Graphics[{Circle[{0, 0}, 1]}];     ListPlot[l1, PlotStyle -> Thick, PlotMarkers -> {circle1, .03}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qAgyO.png)
