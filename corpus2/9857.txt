Consider the following Mathematica expression:               Reduce[2^j/(j + 1) <= 10, j, Integers]      which outputs:               j == 0 || j == 1 || j == 2 || j == 3 || j == 4 ||      j == 5 || j == 6 || (j \[Element] Integers && j <= -2)      Therefore, the maximum integer $j$ satisfying $\frac{2^j}{j + 1}$ is 6. I tried to using the `FindMaximum`, as follows:               FindMaximum[{j, 2^j/(j + 1) <= 10 && j \[Element] Integers}, j]      but it gives the following error:               FindMaximum::eqineq: "Constraints in {j\[Element]Integers,2^j/(1+j)<=10} are      not all equality or inequality constraints.      With the exception of integer domain constraints for linear programming,      domain constraints or constraints with Unequal (!=) are not supported."      My general question is: > How to solve inequalities like $\frac{2^j}{j + 1} \le c$ (for some constant > $c$) in Mathematica, over Integers?
