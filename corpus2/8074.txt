`DateList` "aggressively" interprets strings, such as "p72h": `DateList["p72h"]` gives `{1972, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}` Strings like "p72h" represent not DATE type but DURATION type values ("72 hours") in TimeML's TIMEX3 specification. In a perfect world this would not matter since Cases or similar pattern matching can be used to select TIMEX tags based on the type element. Unfortunately, coding is not perfect; some fraction of DURATION tags are misclassified as DATES. I don't see an `Option` to force `DateList` to be more literal (is there?). Since all TIMEX3 DATE values normalized as one of the following three forms, where Y, M, D are individual digit characters corresponding to year, month, day: > "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM" or "YYYY" What's the most succinct StringExpression to match only these cases and reject DURATION strings? I'm guessing it may involve `Alternatives` and `DigitCharacter` but I'm not overly familiar with the subtleties of string expressions. Any help appreciated.
