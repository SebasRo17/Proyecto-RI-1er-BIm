Given a data structure, I want to provide an API method `Size` which returns the number of items. I am vacillating between 2 approaches:   1. Maintain a count and increment/decrement it in response to Add/Delete calls respectively   2. Perform a traversal to calculate the count when `Size` is called. Approach #2 will take O(n) vs O(1) for approach #1. Other than performance, any other benefits of #1 over #2 ?
