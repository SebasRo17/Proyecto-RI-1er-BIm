Given a corner `x` of an undirected Graph `G` I would like to ask for the connected component of `x`, but my first try does not work as desired. Here it is:               edge( a,b ).     edge( b,a ).          edge( b,c ).     edge( c,b ).          edge( c,d ).     edge( d,c ).          connected( X,X ).     connected( X,Y ) :- edge(X,Y).     connected( X,Y ) :- \+ edge(X,Y), edge( X,Z ), connected( Z,Y ).      And here are my queries and the results:               | ?- connected(b,What).          What = b ? ;          What = a ? ;          What = c ? ;          no          | ?- connected(b,b).             true ? ;          true ? ;          true ? ;          no      Why is corner `b` not connected to corner `d`? Why is corner `b` connected to itself three times? I am afraid of other problems I will get with more complex graphs. Are there any?
