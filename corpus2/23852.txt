I've seen others use Bitwise-OR to combine flags before:               #define RUN 0x01     #define JUMP 0x02     #define SHOOT 0x04          const byte madPerson = RUN | JUMP | SHOOT;      That's also the way I do it. But I've also seen some (not as many) combine flags using addition:               #define RUN 0x01     #define JUMP 0x02     #define SHOOT 0x04          const byte madPerson = RUN + JUMP + SHOOT;      Which one is more "readable"? (Which one do you think more people will recognize?) What is the "standard" way to do it? Which one do you prefer?
