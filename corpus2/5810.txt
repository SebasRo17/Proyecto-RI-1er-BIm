I wrote the following code to observe how the solutions to the equation $(e^{i a})^2 = e^{i b}$ varied as $b$ varied between 0 and $2\pi$               Manipulate[NSolve[(E^(I a))^2 == E^(I b), a], {b, 0, 2 \[Pi]}]      However, the following error appears: ![Inverse function error](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iMIKZ.png) How would I use `Reduce` to solve the above equation? I thought reduce was a way to fold up a list with a binary operator.
