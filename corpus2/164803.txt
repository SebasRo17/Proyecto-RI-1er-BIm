I am not sure if this is the best place for the question, but I am not sure where else to ask. ## Background I am a contract developer and have just been asked to provide a general liability policy for my next gig. In 6-7 years this has never been asked of me. ## Question Is this common? If so, can anyone recommend a good underwriter that focuses on what we do as contract software developers? I realize that Google could help me find underwriters but it won't give me unbiased public opinion about which companies actually understand what we do and factor that into the price of the policy.
