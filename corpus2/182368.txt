I've had 7 jobs in 16 years. This is what happens at every job:   * Year 1: New people! New place! New tech!   * Year 2: Productive.   * Year 3: Disinterested. Can I get another job, doing the same thing, but make more money? Now I'm in year 5 of my current job and I'm still disinterested. But, I'm making 99k as a "consultant" and won't be able to make any more money anywhere else, for just programming. Also, I never make friends at my jobs. I don't write code in my spare time. I chose MIS because I knew it would get me a good paying job and I wouldn't have to rely on anyone else for money. I'm surrounded by people who have a passion for developing, which makes it even worse. I have to take anti-depressants and I have a post-it note saying "Gratitude" that I have to look at everyday to remind myself that I have it great. Does anyone else go thru this? Is it normal for programmers?
