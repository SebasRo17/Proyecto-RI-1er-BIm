I have a CMS built in core PHP. Till now, if a new version is released, it is downloaded to client machine in zipped form. And then client has to manually unzip the folder and copy that to required location. Because there is no way to download zip file to required location. I want that CMS should be updated in the background like-WordPress. In other words, I want that new version can replace old version. How can I do this?
