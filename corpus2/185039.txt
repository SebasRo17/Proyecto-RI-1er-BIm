I am new to UI development, but I feel very uncomfortable with how CSS works. My use case is that I wanted to apply some specific styles inside a particular `div` on a page. **CSS attempt:**               div.class1 {         font: normal 12px arial, helvetica, sans-serif;         font-color: #f30;     }     div.class1 div.class2 {         border: 1px solid #f30;     }      **LESS attempt:**               @red: #f30;     @font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;     div.class1 {         font: normal 12px @font-family;         font-color: @red;         div.class2 {             border: 1px solid @red;         }      The CSS version can induce bugs, since it forces you to repeat `#f30` & `div.class2` every time you try to achieve hierarchy and variable re-use. **My questions:**   * Why is that CSS makes things difficult?   * LESS does nothing special - just makes obvious improvements and translates to CSS?   * What is that CSS wants to motivate in users because of which it promotes such a redundant coding style? I strongly believe CSS should be what LESS is. Definitely I am overlooking some obvious advantage of why things are done that way in CSS. I thought it was a legacy problem, but I was surprised when I saw no attempts to solve this with CSS3. Please help me understand how should I approach CSS?
