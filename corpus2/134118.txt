I have no idea what these are actually called, but I see them all the time. The Python implementation is something like: `x += 5` as a shorthand notation for `x = x + 5`. But why is this considered good practice? I've run across it in nearly every book or programming tutorial I've read for Python, C, R so on and so forth. I get that it's convenient, saving 3 keystrokes including spaces. But they always seem to trip me up when I'm reading code, and at least to my mind, make it _less_ readable, not more. Am I missing some clear and obvious reason these are used all over the place?
