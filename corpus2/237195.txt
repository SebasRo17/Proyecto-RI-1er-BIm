As I understand it, most pseudo-random algorithms work by taking one or more truly random `long`s, such as the date, time, MAC-Address, serial-number, etc., passing them through a complex series of calculations, and returning the result. However, this isn't possible in Brainf*ck. The language only has 8 valid syntax characters, but I won't bother you with a full description, which can be found here. The gist is that there aren't any functions to access system time or any other number that I can think of as a seed. I can't think of where to get good seeds to put into functions. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance. _Note: feel free to edit this questions so that it applies to more languages; I just can't put my finger on the right word to use._
