I want to find the sum $$S=f\left(\dfrac{1}{2012} \right) +f\left(\dfrac{2}{2012} \right) +\cdots + f\left(\dfrac{2011}{2012} \right), $$ where $$f(x) = \dfrac{4^x}{4^x + 2}.$$ I tried               f[x_] := 4^x/(4^x + 2)     Sum[f[i/2012], {i, 1, 2011}]      But I can't get the answer. How do I tell _Mathematica_ to do that? I know, $$f(x) + f(1 - x) =1.$$ I used               Simplify[f[x] + f[1 - x]]
