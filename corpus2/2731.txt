I'm trying to animate some curves that wrap around a cylinder. OK so far:               Animate[ParametricPlot3D[{{Cos[α t], Sin[α t],      Sqrt[1 - α^2] t}, {Cos[α t],      Sin[α t], -Sqrt[1 - α^2] t}}, {α, -1, 1},      PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}, {-2 π, 2 π}}], {t, 0,      2 π}, AnimationRunning -> False]      But I'm struggling to incorporate the cylinder itself:               Graphics3D[Cylinder[{{0, 0, -2 π}, {0, 0, 2 π}}, 1]]      You can probably see the problem: the curves run around an invisible cylinder. I'd be much happier if I could see it! I've tried to squeeze the cylinder in in a few different ways (putting it into the `Animate[ParametricPlot3D[...]]` in different places, and using `Epilog`), but no luck. Any suggestions?
