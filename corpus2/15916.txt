What quantity is `ImageDistance` measuring, and what do the numbers mean? I found the `ImageDistance` command in _Mathematica_ 9, but I've been unable to find much explanation about what it's doing. I originally thought it might be calculating the distance between features on images, but I don't think it is any more. I created two images that had some obvious differences:               original = ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Mandrill"}];     shiftedImage =        Sharpen[         ImagePad[original, {{30, -30}, {5, -5}},           Padding -> "Reflected"]];      ![twin mandrills](http://i.stack.imgur.com/okCEM.png) and ran a set of `ImageDistance` operations past them:               flist = {EuclideanDistance, SquaredEuclideanDistance,         NormalizedSquaredEuclideanDistance, ManhattanDistance,         CosineDistance, CorrelationDistance, "MeanEuclideanDistance",         "MeanSquaredEuclideanDistance",         "MeanReciprocalSquaredEuclideanDistance",        {"MeanReciprocalSquaredEuclideanDistance", .3},         "MutualInformationVariation", {"MutualInformationVariation", 32},         "NormalizedMutualInformationVariation",        {"NormalizedMutualInformationVariation", 32},         "DifferenceNormalizedEntropy", {"DifferenceNormalizedEntropy", 32},        "MeanPatternIntensity", {"MeanPatternIntensity", .1, 3},         "GradientCorrelation", "MeanReciprocalGradientDistance",         "EarthMoverDistance", {"EarthMoverDistance", 4}};          results = Sort[        Table[         {f, ImageDistance[original, shiftedImage,            DistanceFunction -> f]}, {f, flist}],        #1[[2]] > #2[[2]] &];          Grid[      Table[       {First[row], PaddedForm[ Last[row], {Automatic, 6}]}, {row,         results}],       Alignment -> {{Left, "."}}]      ![results](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j71GQ.png) Trying different pairs of images hasn't helped, yet. Can anyone enlighten me (in novice-friendly terms)?
