I have a potential employer who desperately wants to produce an app, but for some reason they are refusing to get a $99 company dev account, saying the application process would be too difficult and tedious. And yet they want me to create a single-person account. I think they've been banned from the Apple's app store but how can I verify it? Thanks.
