I want to create a function that will make an $n*n$ matrix which is non- singular that will always retrieve the same matrix (meaning that the matrix will not be random each time). I tried using the table function with different expressions using $i$ and $j$ but they always ended up singular because they had similar rules. So please don't give me a random matrix, the matrix needs to have a pattern that if two people used the function on different computers with the same $n$ value, they would get the same matrix P.S. Keep the matrix in the Real set of numbers (also Integers) and don't make them too high so that its not too big to work with (I want the values to be ideally under 20)
