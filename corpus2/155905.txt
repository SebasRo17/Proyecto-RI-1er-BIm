I am relatively new to iOS development, so after watching a bunch of WWDC videos announcing new awesome features for the iPhone SDK, I still got a few questions regarding their support for older devices. Specifically:   * Do the new compiler features (such as literals support, auto-synthesize, etc) require iOS 6 on the target device, or can the new style code be deployed to iOS 5 devices?   * Auto-layout for iOS, same question. Will it only be supported on iOS 6, or 5 as well? If it's 6 only, what kind of fallback are we expected to implement? Would really appreciate if someone could clarify this for me, as I'm thinking about rewriting my older unfinished project and I would love to use some of that improved SDK functionality.
