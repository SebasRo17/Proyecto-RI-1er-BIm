I have just completed my Bachelors degree in IT field. I have deep interest in coding and really want to be a professional in it. Now, apart from college courses, I have been learning programming(C#) on my own (college level programming is too basic). Now I feel I need a little more time to be close to professional programmer. But some of my seniors say that corporate world programming is too different from bookish programming, hence there is no point in wasting time. (They are not programmers themselves, this may be probably what they heard). Would I benefit by reaching an advance level of C#? or as mediocre level is sufficient to break interviews, higher levels do not matter to firms because they rely on their training purely to teach how things work in corporate world and learning more won't help me much? Please if there are some professional programmers who can help, I promise this is something which about every student interested in programming want to ask at my stage. "How do you actually change from learner to professional in field of programming?" - keep learning until you are perfect or joining a firm is must once basics are covered?
