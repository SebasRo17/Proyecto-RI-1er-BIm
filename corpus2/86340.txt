How important is knowledge of data structures and algorithms for an Operating Systems and Systems Programming course where we will be required to design and implement a kernel of a real-time operating system (done using C and 68K)? How useful will programming experience implementing data structures like linked lists, queues, binary trees etc. in C++ be for this type of course? thanks!
