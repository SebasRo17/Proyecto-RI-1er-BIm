Is there a way to open one notebook in two (or more) different windows? This can be helpful when working with a long notebook and one wants to edit one part of it while looking at a different part. Otherwise, you have to jump back and forth... **Edit:** Per @Guillochon comment, splitting the window where the notebook is open is indeed a nice option. **Edit 2** : Having a secondary "read-only" window can also be a nice compromise.
