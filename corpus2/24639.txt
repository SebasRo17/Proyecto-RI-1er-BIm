I'm trying to calculate the following integral using _Mathematica 9.0.1.0_                a11=Integrate[Abs[Sin[b+x]],{x,0,2*\[Pi]}]      This should be a simple problem; however, it took _Mathematica_ a very long time to obtain the answer, which is **4**. I asked a colleague to do it with _Maple_ , the answer is obtained instantly. I thought may be this has something to do with the fact that _Mathematica_ treats everthing as Complex value, so I rewrote the programm as               a1=Integrate[Abs[Sin[b+x]],{x,0,2*\[Pi]},Assumptions->{Element[{b,x},Reals]}]      Unfortunately, it took _Mathematica_ even more time to run this command. What's more unfortunate is that the obtained answer is **wrong** :               4 Abs[Sin[b]] Cot[b]      Does anybody know what's wrong here?
