I have a `page` Object, which has `Paragraph` and `Image` object Collections And each `paragraph` has only `image_id(s)` that are assigned to a paragraph. All other information about image is stored in `Page->Image` Now from the `paragraph` object I want to access the `image` information where paragraph has only `image_id` and all other information about the image is in `Page->Image` object. What will be the better way to access this info? Should I pass the `page` object in every `paragraph` constructor or something else? I also can't change the class structure, as it is written by someone else.
