I have a very large `SparseArray` called `A`. What is the most efficient way to update say element `{i,j}` with value `x` to the value `f[x]` ? I worry about **memory usage and code speed** if I need to make a very large number of updates. I've seen Leonid's comment here about a similar problem. But there is a lot of info scattered over old SO site and I am looking for function and a syntax something like `f[A_, {i_,j_}, f_]` that will do the job. I think it is a very essential question for recursive by-element updates to `SparseArrays' and would love to see a complete solution here.
