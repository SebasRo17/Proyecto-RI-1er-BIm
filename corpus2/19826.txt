I have a function with two variables:               f[x_,y_]:=f[x,y] = ...      I calculated some values (they are fractions like 435345345/3424242424) and would like to store the values from x=1 to x=5000 with y=0 in a file, so that I can use them later again in a function g[x] I exported them:               Export["file.dat", Table[f[x,0],{x,1,5000}]      And then I import them in another file:               data = Import["file.dat", "List"]      Now I can access the fractions in data by using, for example:               ToExpression[data[[7]]]      Which gives me the fraction that was originally stored in f[7,0] So far so good, but I would again like to have the values stored in some function g, with the properties that (in new file) g[x] = f[x,0] (in old file) for x between 1 and 5000 I am not really sure how the notation for that would be :-( Thank you for your help.
