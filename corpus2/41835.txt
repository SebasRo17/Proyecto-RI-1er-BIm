For this toy problem               Needs["PlotLegends`"]          GraphicsGrid[      Partition[       Table[ListPlot[         Table[{x, f[x]}, {f, {Sin, Cos}}, {x, 0, Pi, Pi/10.}],          PlotRange -> {{0, Pi}, {-1, 1}},          PlotLegend -> {"Sine", "Cosine",}, LegendPosition -> {1.1, -0.4},          PlotMarkers -> Automatic], {k, 1, 6, 1}], 3], Spacings -> 0,       ImageSize -> 700]      I was trying to make a single legend (precisely the legend you see here four times) for the entire `GraphicsGrid` rather than the same legend four times. How do I do so? * * * **Edit:** Same question but now with v9 code that doesn't require loading any package:               GraphicsGrid[      Partition[       Table[ListPlot[{Sqrt[Range[50]], Power[Range[50], (3)^-1]},          PlotLegends ->           PointLegend[Automatic, {"one", "two"}, LegendFunction -> "Frame",            LegendLabel -> "datasets"]], {k, 1, 6}], 3], ImageSize -> 800]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xh3Ww.png)
