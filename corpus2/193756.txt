I am creating an advanced search page where there are about 20 search fields for a user to filter their search. My question deals with the query string, Is it standard web development practice to have say 20 parameters in a querystring? The search results display large tables of data. Is there an alternative that still uses HTTP GET(querystring), if it is not standard? I would like the users to be able to bookmark their searches.
