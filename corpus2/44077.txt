I have a square matrix depending on a parameter "a". When "a" has a numeric value (eg 2.1 * 10 ^ 8) through the inverse function Inverse[] I can invert the matrix. If I write the matrix as a function of "a" do not declare its value when the invert Mathematica tells me that it is singular (suspect singular) then not allow me to Invert it. The determinant of the matrix in symbolic form turns out to be a very small value in the order of 6*10 ^ -25000. Do you think I can get the inverse of this matrix in symbolic form? the matrix is generated by:               K0 = Ct.E0.Transpose[Ct];      where Ct is a matrix indipendent from "a" , while "E" is a diagonal matrix which depends on "a" in the following way : http://i.stack.imgur.com/VXX2A.png The matrix Ct and E are written manually. I attach the file containing the matrix mathematica https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7In1ClJQ-FVZVRuNHMycGotUTg/edit?usp=sharing I was not able to include them here as a code. Thanks in advance
