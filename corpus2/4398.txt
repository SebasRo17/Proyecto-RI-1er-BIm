I have a data set of the type $\{x,y,z\}$ where $(x,y)$ is a point and $z$ is the "value" or magnitude at that point. This gives me a triangular sort of shape since $(x,y,z)$ is not defined along the whole possibility set considering it is real data. Is there any way I can get a gradient using the points I have (using them if possible) and using the interpolation from Mathematica otherwise?
