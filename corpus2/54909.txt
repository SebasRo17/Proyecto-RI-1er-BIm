I'm trying to use `Epilog` in my plots but the position of the `Epilog` isn't making much sense. As a minimal example consider,               LogPlot[Sin[x], {x, 0, \[Pi]}, Epilog -> {Text["x", {\[Pi], 0.2}]}]      I'd have expected this to put an "x" in the center of the graph but instead it shows up in the corner: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z1hTp.jpg) I've also tried `ListLogplot` and other graphics but they all produce similar results. How do I force `Epilog` to use the same positions as the plot? Note: I'm using _Mathematica V10_ on _Linux_.
