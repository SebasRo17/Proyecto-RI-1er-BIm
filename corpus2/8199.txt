I've got this code               Plot[{(V^2/360)/0.4,  ConditionalExpression[(V^2/860)/0.4, V < 12],        ConditionalExpression[(V^2/860)/0.4, V > 12]}, {V, 8, 18},        PlotRange -> {0, 1.5},       PlotStyle -> {{AbsoluteThickness[3]}, {AbsoluteThickness[3],          Dashed}, { AbsoluteThickness[3], ColorData[1, 2]}},       GridLines -> Automatic,       Epilog -> {{Thick, Dashed, Black, Line[{{12, 0}, {12, 2}}]}, {Thick,          Dashed, Black, Line[{{8, 1}, {18, 1}}]}}]       to plot a function in two pieces, each in a different style: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gaezk.png) This works OK for me, though I didn't like it that I had to use `ColorData[1, 2]` to get the second part in the same color. Are there better ways to do this (possibly something with `Piecewise`)?
