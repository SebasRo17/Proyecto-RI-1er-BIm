A prospective employer told me they took a company level decision to do only outsourcing projects. I do not understand why they took such a decision and the guy I talked to did not elaborate. He further said only that "their intention is to build software components". Since they are growing quite fast and reached around 300 employees, shouldn't they be at least open to the possibility of having a project of their own, maybe? All other companies I've had contact with were at least open to have one in the future. I talked to a few of their employees and some are working in parallel on more than 2 outsourced projects (dividing time something like 4 + 4 hours / day). It seemed like a lot of projects with a period of a few months, maybe half a year come and go. Why would a company choose to provide only outsourcing services like that? How does it work to keep hundreds of people on outsourced projects with a seemingly high project turnover rate?
