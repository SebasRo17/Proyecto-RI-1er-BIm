I’ve been working in an eXtreme programming team and doing pair programming for over 7 years in a windows environment. When we first started doing it someone would log in with their windows credentials and therefore all access to domain resources, and more specifically version control, would be accountable to that windows user. Eventually we have evolved to have windows pairing accounts for specific pairing stations (e.g pairA, pairB, PairC etc…). All the devs know the passwords to these accounts. Accountability for commits (check-ins) is achieved by putting the programmers initials in the comment during the commit. Up until now this has worked fine for us, but my company is currently going through a ISO 27001 audit and this was flagged up by the auditor as a risk. I have a number of possible solutions such as creating a pairing account for every pair combination, but I really would like to know whether anyone else has encountered this problem and how they solved it? What solution was acceptable by the auditors?
