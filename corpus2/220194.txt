Software created for some business domains don't require heavy use of algorithm problem solving skills on the job from the programmers working there. For example, a JEE developer might most of the time only need to move data from system to system, doing data transformations, then crunch that data for various reports, designing systems with well defined boundaries etc. As a programmer you are a problem solver and you should know how to solve algorithm problems. But some programmers haven't really been doing that since school if their domain of expertise hasn't required that skill, so the skill isn't up to date. For such domains, does it still make sense to have an interview selection that requires candidates to solve algorithm problems (like math problems, string manipulations, sorting arrays etc) or should the interview be focusing only on the skills needed for the particular domain?
