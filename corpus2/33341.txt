We can have this Graph:               v = {1 \[UndirectedEdge] 9, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 10,      1 \[UndirectedEdge] 8, 10 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,      10 \[UndirectedEdge] 5, 9 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,      9 \[UndirectedEdge] 6, 8 \[UndirectedEdge] 7,      8 \[UndirectedEdge] 4, 7 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,      7 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 6 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,      6 \[UndirectedEdge] 4, 5 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,      5 \[UndirectedEdge] 4};     g = Graph[v, VertexLabels -> Placed["Name", Center],      VertexStyle -> White, VertexSize -> 0.5]      Which looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lQByL.jpg) How can I add other characteristics inside the vertex labels?Such as other numbers in second line of labels?Or more info such as some codes in third line?
