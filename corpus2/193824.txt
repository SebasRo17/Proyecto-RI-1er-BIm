Can someone please explain the best way to solve this problem. Suppose I have three classes   1. `Person`   2. `Venue`   3. `Vehicle` I have a DAO method that needs to return some or all of these attributes from each of the classes after doing a query. Please note, by requirements I am using one DAO for all three classes and no frameworks. Only my own MVC implementation How do I accomplish this? It seems very wrong to make a class `PersonVenueVehicle` and return that as an object to get the instance field, values. I was taught that the database entities must be reflected by classes, if this is case how is it implemented in such a situation?
