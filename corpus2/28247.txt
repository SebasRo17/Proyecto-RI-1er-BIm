Looking at the expansion:               Series[Erfi[x], {x, Infinity, 1}]      I obtain               -I+E^x^2 (1/(Sqrt[\[Pi]] x)+O[1/x]^2)      (note the imaginary argument in front). This looks wrong as I don't think there should be an imaginary number out front; I had thought that this was due to some branch cut about the positive x axis, but this doesn't look like the case. Looking at the output of Mupad (in Matlab), I obtain the correct expansion listed in the response here. Is this a bug?
