I have a class Base that has several children, say A, B, C. For testing purposes I'd like to mock those derived classes by deriving from them. So MockA derives from A, MockB derives from B and so on. The problem is, that MockA, MockB, ... all inherit protected members from Base that have to be set in the same way in each mock class. The code looks like this:               MockA::init()     {         x = 1;     // inherited from Base         y = "abc"; // inherited from Base         z = 0.5;   // inherited from Base     }          MockB::init()     {         x = 1;     // inherited from Base         y = "abc"; // inherited from Base         z = 0.5;   // inherited from Base     }      and so on. So my question is, how can I avoid this cut&paste initialization? Can I achieve it without touching Base, A, B, C, ...?
