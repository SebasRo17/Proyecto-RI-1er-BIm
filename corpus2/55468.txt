Does Mathematica provide any kind of warranty that their calculations are correct? Say I'm running a billion dollar company, and I relied on Mathematica to do calculations, like aerodynamics or car accidents simulations, etc. After releasing my product, I found that Mathematica is buggy and provided me with wrong results, and I lost a few Millions because of that. What kind of warranty will Wolfram provide?
