I have a collection of normal functions and self-calling functions within a javascript file. In my comments i want to say something along the lines of "This script can contain both self-calling and XXX functions", where XXX is the non-self-calling functions. "Static" springs to my mind, but feel that would be incorrect because of the use of static methods in PHP, which is something completely different. Anyone any ideas? Thanks!
