The following code uses Animate to create an animation that displays as {t, "Inactive"} when paused, and {t, "Active"} when running:               Animate[ControlActive[{t, "Active"}, {t, "Inactive"}], {t, 0, 10}]      ![Paused animator not yet refreshed](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKZoY.png) However, ControlActive is strangely slow to refresh when the animation is paused. Try it by evaluating the above and pressing the pause button. It takes around 1 second for {t, "Inactive"} to replace {t, "Active"}. In constrast, ControlActive is very responsive within Manipulate. Try moving the slider here after evaluating this:               Manipulate[ControlActive[{t, "Active"}, {t, "Inactive"}], {t, 0, 10}]      The difference seems to hinge on the Animator control. For example ControlActive becomes slow again when using that control with Manipulate:               Manipulate[ControlActive[{t, "Active"}, {t, "Inactive"}], {t, 0, 10, Animator}]      Any ideas on why ControlActive refreshes more slowly within Animate or how to tweak it?
