As Eclipse uses OSGi to handle modules and bundles, and therefore should be able to hot-deploy them, why does it suggest to restart after installing a plugin "for changes to take effect"? Has Eclipse hit some OSGi limitation, or is its architecture such that even with hot-deploy, it cannot guarantee that deployments went smoothly and hence takes the safest route by offering a restart?
