What would you choose as the default Ant target?   In the context of a small visual tool with a user interface, open source. I was thinking about `jar` because the project's distributable is the jar file. But someone prefers to have `help` as the default target, to show the available targets. Or maybe another target? I doubt anyone would really care, but would be the "least surprise" choice?
