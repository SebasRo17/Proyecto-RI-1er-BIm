**Background** : I'm writing in-house software - it has absolutely no contact with the world outside the company - but I'm using various libraries, which themselves do have some license structure. So for example GPL requires that software that re-uses the a GPL-licensed piece of code, to also be under GPL- license. Does that require my in-house application to have an explicit GPL- license, or is this understood implicitly? Does using AGPL-licensed code, require my code to be available to co-workers who use the in-house system? **Question** : Does my in-house software need to have an explicit license, to be compliant with the licenses of such libraries? In what cases does in-house software need to have its own license?
