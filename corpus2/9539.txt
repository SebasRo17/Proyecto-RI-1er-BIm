Think of the profession 30 years ago. When one single guy was able to code a whole computer game alone! Will offshoring will finally take over? Will languages be so high level than our added value will be reduced to zero? Will it be a profession like lawyer or doctor? Will you still be a programmer? Please extrapolate and predict based on historical and current trends.
