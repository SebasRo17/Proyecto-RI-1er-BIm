As far as I know if you combine `Blue` and `Green` the result is `Cyan` (using additive mixing). I would like to know some basic arithmetic of colors for making a _Mathematica_ game for kids (using colored numbers). **My problem is** what is the result of mixing $2\times Blue + 1\times Cyan$? Or consider a more complicated example: $3\times Red + 2\times Green + 2\times Blue$. Is this color arithmetic the same for subtractive and additive mixing?
