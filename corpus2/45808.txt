Consider the expression               TreeForm[a+b^2+c^3+d]      which displays as ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W3ILi.png) This is a nice Graphics object, as I can prove by typing `//FullForm` after it, like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7dEWy.png) and getting               Graphics[Annotation[       GraphicsComplex[        List[List[1.29777, 1.29777], List[0., 0.648886],         List[0.648886, 0.648886], List[0.324443, 0.], List[0.973329, 0.],         List[1.94      ...          List[Tooltip[           Inset[Framed[Style[Plus, "StandardForm", "Output", Rule[LineColor,       It has framed elements in it, as I can prove by either looking at the text above, or by typing ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wv0iQ.png) But, the `TreeForm` expression itself does not have any framed elements in it. For instance               TreeForm[a+b^2+c^3+d] /. (x_Framed :> Print[x])      produces the original graphic ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W3ILi.png) Somehow, the Notebook is not allowing me to capture and rewrite the expression form of the graphic -- the only way I know to access it is by cutting and pasting the graphical form of the object manually by mouse into the places where I need to manipulate it. This is no good. I need `SecretEvaluator`, such that               SecretEvaluator[TreeForm[a+b^2+c^3+d]] /. (x_Framed :> Print[x])      produces the same output as ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wv0iQ.png)
