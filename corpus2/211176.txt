I've had interviews with 5 separate people over the past two weeks and three of those five have all asked me this question: _Explain what happens between hitting "Google.com" and the page coming up on the screen._ Basically, how the Internet works. I figure after three times that I better be prepared if I ever get this question again. I know _some_ things, but I'm not fully convinced that my answer is good enough. Basically, I mention that the DNS server translates "google.com" into an IP address. I kinda gloss over TCP/IP, then talk about the web server literally serving up requested pages that get sent back to the browser which the browser then interprets and displays. As I said before, I'm not convinced my answer is technical enough. What are the steps that I'm leaving out? For what it's worth, two of those three times have been with the same company and I'm being called back for a third interview with them, so I can't have bombed it _too_ hard.
