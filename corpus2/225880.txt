I am just starting out my programming career and I have a chance to bid on a freelance job. I have looked over the specifications for the app and believe I am capable of meeting the requirements satisfactorily. I have worked on a team developing 2 different apps for the same platform , as well as one app I wrote for a friends business (for pay but it was informal) and all of the stuff I have done for personal use/school so I believe I can estimate fairly accurately how long it will take me. However I have no clue about how these things work in the real world. I have only been finished school for less then a year and I have only had 2 short- term developer contracts. Specifically:   1. Payment: what is usual? Payment on delivery? Payment upfront? Percentage upfront?   2. Sourcecode: I understand that I would need to give them the source code but what about previous librarys which I have made. If I use those in the project would they then belong to the client as well?    3. How detailed should the initial contract be? What if the client changes their mind about details part way through.    4. I'm not really certain how to set a price (I would appreciate suggestions formulas). I assume that there must be some sort of industry standards for this sort of thing I'm just not sure what they are/ where to find them? I would really appreciate any advice on the subject, even if it is just links to other resources. If it matters both myself and the potential client are located in Canada.
