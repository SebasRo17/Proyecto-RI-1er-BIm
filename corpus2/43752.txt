I recently developed a desktop client that automates much of the work involved during online research. I developed this tool in 2-3 hours, and it has reduced an hour's worth of work to about 5 minutes. The softwas has had some visibility, and some higher-ups in the organization are excited about the time and effort it's saving. Now, it s that the company is interested in distributing the software to every salesperson in the company, perhaps wanting to even buy it from me. I've never been in the situation of potentially selling my software to a corporate client. I've only worked on personal projects or developed in-house software for my employer. I have no idea what a fair price is, or even what a fair model for payment is (e.g., is it normal to accept a bulk payment in exchange for delivery of a static software application, or to sign a contract to further develop and maintain that application over a period of time, or what?). I just don't have the experience that would give me a basis for knowing how to approach this situation. How I can get this knowledge so as to make informed choices moving forward?
