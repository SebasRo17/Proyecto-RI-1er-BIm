I'm doing a project that uses svg-edit(JS drawing tool) and the page grows big. By now there are about 20 JS file in a page - plug-ins and so on. One of the editor's files breaks in some kind of 'Uncaught TypeError' but it's compressed and can not understand anything. I used several jquery plug-ins that are important for the usability of the page and it's not possible to remove any of them. There are severe conflicts obviously but I can't rewrite any of the plug-ins. Any smart approach to fix this ? Where I can start ?
