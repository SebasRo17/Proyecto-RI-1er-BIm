my employer is encouraging us and even require us to take MCPD and get certified. They offer online ebook and practice exam from measureup.com but I get bored and tired when I read those self-paced training kit and stray away to do something else. I like the way Zed's "learning python the hard way" teach. Is there some similar book like Zed's? How do you guys study for MCPD?
