I was recently elected president of the student chapter of ACM at my university, and am trying to come up with some ideas for events for the following year. The big one we do every year is practice matches and try outs for the ICPC. I am hoping to host one or two more events this year, and was wondering if anyone has some cool ideas or has some past experiences that worked well. One idea that we have had so far is to do a hackathon but it generally seems difficult to convince the underclassmen that they have the skill to participate in events like this.
