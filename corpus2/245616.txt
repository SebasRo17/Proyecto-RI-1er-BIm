I'm in a little planning phase of my java/swing project. Here is a picture:   ![Panel](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EzVm3.png) It is a main panel containing several sub panels depending on the selected date in the top center. I want to browse those sub panels using the blue arrows (next day and previous day). As you can imagine one sub panel can be in more than one - I would say - "page". My MVC structure looks like this: Each sub panel is represented by one class - let's call it subClassModel - so every model gets one subClassView (one of the fife panels in the picture) as observer. One subClassController will handle the interaction between these two classes and additionally the interaction to the mainController (e.g. create new subClassModel). I hope my questions are not too broad but I'll give it a try:   * First: Is there any pattern for this kind of problem. I haven't found any because I cannot find a proper name.   * How should I handle all SubClassView's and SubClassModel's. I thought of storing them in the SubClassController in a `HashMap<SubClassModel, SubClassView>`. So I have every model and view available even though they are filtered out by the date.   * Should I use `panel.add(SubClassView)` / `panel.remove(SubClassView)` or either removeAll and add all wanted view in a loop?   * Should I store all SubClassViews in the controller anyway? Or is it better to create the SubClassViews on every date change?   * ...       I know that I didn't add code to this question, because there isn't really relevant code. I want to settle this questions before I mould it into code.
