Given a colour image whose light intensity is dim at the edges and bright in the middle, such as **[dim bright dim]** , which computer vision technique would be recommended to correct this imbalance? While I believe Histogram Equalisation could help, I've read that it also introduces an unrealistic look to an image by exaggerating the blue channel. I consider implementing an image processor for this task.
