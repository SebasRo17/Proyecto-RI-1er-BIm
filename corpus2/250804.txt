In a typical spring mvc validator class, while inserting an errorCode value in the Errors object, what difference does it make between using a String (`props.somefield.req`) like so               errors.rejectValue("elementId", "props.somefield.req");      verses a declared static final String ?               private static final String SOMFIELD_REQ = "props.somefield.req"; ...     errors.rejectValue("elementId", SOMFIELD_REQ);      Does it improve the performance even in a slightest way? I have read a few questions on stack overflow (String and final, Does it make sense to define a final String in Java?) but no one got around to answering this questions update question.
