Has anybody done any real research on the probability of UUID collisions, especially with version 4 (random) UUIDs, given that the random number generators we use aren't truly random and that we might have dozens or hundreds of identical machines running the same code generating UUIDs? My co-workers consider testing for UUID collision to be a complete waste of time, but I always put in code to catch a duplicate key exception from the database and try again with a new UUID. But that's not going to solve the problem if the UUID comes from another process and refers to a real object.
