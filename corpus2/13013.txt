I am working with graphs with multiple edges and loops, and I want to eliminate all isomorphic graphs from a long list I've generated. The `FindGraphIsomorphism` function is very nice, but only works for simple graphs. I'm looking to find such a function or its equivalent for multigraphs. For example, ![two multigraphs](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iYDi3.png) Is there possibly a third-party package, or maybe even an external program that would find such graph isomorphisms? Also, is it possible to compare graphics objects in Mathematica, to see whether they are similar? I have tried `SameQ`, but to no avail. ![graphs with self-loops](http://i.stack.imgur.com/36yfX.png) I am assuming this is the result because Mathematica plots the graphs with floating-point values, so it is impossible to have two identical graphs like this. So is there a function that looks at the similarity between two graphics objects? I think something like that might do the trick for me in most cases.
