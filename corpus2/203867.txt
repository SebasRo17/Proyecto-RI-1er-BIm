I want to create my own website that would allow me to acess a database in the server and do inserts and lookups in a user friendly way. I am a seasoned user of linux and C/C++, and also have experience with Python and sqlite3, but i don't have any experience in Web development, so i have no idea where to start. I have researched online and the best i came up with was an Apache/Nginx server together with an fcig or wscgi and Django, so that i would have database and python integration through a Django App. Can someone tell me if this is the way to go or if there is some easier (or better) way to accomplish what i want?
