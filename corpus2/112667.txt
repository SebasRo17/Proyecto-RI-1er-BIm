Imagine a call center web application with a soft phone that automatically detects when a call has started or the caller has hung up. The obvious approach to receiving these messages would be some kind of server push (a.k.a. Comet). It's pretty disastrous if we miss one of those server pushes. **Must this application be written as a single-page JavaScript-heavy app, or is a more traditional multi-page app also a reliable option?** (Or is this what `iframe`s are for?) My biggest worry about using a multi-page app is losing push messages when changing pages. My biggest worry about using a single-page app is complexity.
