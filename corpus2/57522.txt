I have using the Wolfram Mathematica for two years.And I know the Mathematica has the operation `Alt + ]` that can generate `[]`. However,when I use this shortcut,it cannot generate a `[]`. So my question is: 1.How to generate the `[]` rightly? 2.In other IDE like `InteljIDEA`,when I key the symbol `[`,it will generate the ` []` automatically. Is it possible to do that in `MMA front-end`? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pyyc4.png) ## Edit As @xzczd said,the `Alt +)` will generate ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XCBXA.png) In adition,it is not convenient to use the `Alt )` and `Alt +}` because I must key three keyboard `Shift + Alt +]`
