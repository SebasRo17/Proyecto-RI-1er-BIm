I was reading the following computer systems paper: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi12/osdi12-final-75.pdf And I was trying to understand why it claims that it does not need data locality for it be perform well. Basically, in the abstract it says: "...FDS multiplexes an application's large scale I/O across the available throughput and latency budget of every disk in a closer. FDS therefore makes many optimizations around data locality unnecessary." What I was not sure was, why does multiplexing an applications I/O across the servers in the datacenter, make it unnecessary to have to optimize in terms of data locality?
