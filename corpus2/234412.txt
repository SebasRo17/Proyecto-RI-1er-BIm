I just wanted to clear up a question I have. What is the point of having a private static method as opposed to a normal method with private visibility? I would have thought an advantage to having a static method is that it can be called without an instance of a class, but since its private is there even a point to it being static? The only reason I can think of is that it helps conceptually understanding the method on the class level as opposed to object level.
