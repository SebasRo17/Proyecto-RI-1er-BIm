I just finished watching this presentation by Uncle Bob (as well as his "Architecture" section of his "Clean Code" videos), but I'm left wondering: Are there any examples out there of applications that implement this Entity- Boundary-Interactor (or Entity-Boundary-Controller) structure? At one point I downloaded the source code to FitNesse (the acceptance testing project he mentions often as an example of not only high test coverage but good architecture, since they were able to defer the decision to not use a database until the very end), and based on a quick glance of it it appears even this project doesn't seem to fit this pattern. **Are there any nontrivial examples of this architecture out in the wild, or should I not bother even looking into it and chalk it up as "it would be great if you could get there, but nobody really does"?**
