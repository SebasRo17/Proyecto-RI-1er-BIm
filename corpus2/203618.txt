I'm working with a team i just met. I've been using the normal native generic php for coding up until now, and built several webapps with it. But a team member suggests we switch to using a framework for development. I personally prefer going the normal way, using native generic PHP codes, but he Suggests we use a framework. I learnt Code Igniter has problem with loading images, and this is one problem with some frameworks, they have some difficulties you just have to go with, unlike writing native PHP Codes. I have a large archive of PHP Codes, that does the work of what some Framework does, i can use this and implement it in the WebApp. Is it better to go with a Framework or Go Native & Generic PHP. Another thing is that, this is a web app for mobile devices, which me and the team are developing for a company, and there will be need for maintenance in the nearest future, if we are not available for the maintenance. Our codes has to be very simple, not too ambiguous and self explanatory, and with comments too, for the future developer. Which is why i'm thinking we write out our own codes, and make it very Simple in the best possible way.
