I have programmed in Obj C and C, but until now found that I dont fully understand the steps in taking the software from source code to executable, I found this image kind of explaining it (sorry couldn't upload as I'm new but I still not get when the debugger, make, builder come into action, when it goes to asm and when to binary   * are the steps the same for OOP of for procedural?   * how about different languages? python, php, objc, C, same steps? Thanks a lot!
