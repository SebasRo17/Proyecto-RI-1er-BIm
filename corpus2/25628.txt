I'm looking for general information on how to optimize matrix valued functions, I have the following function I'm looking to maximize (or figure out if this is possible at all).               MaximizeFunction[W_, DataCoupled_] :=        Module[{newDataCouple},         (* Elementwise Multiplication on a list of 2 element vectors *)         newDataCouple = Flatten[List[Dot[W, #] & /@ DataCoupled], 1];         (* Take the first and second elements of each of the vectors in the previous list and            perform an independence test on them to obtain the p-value *)         Return[           IndependenceTest[Extract[#, 1] & /@ newDataCouple,Extract[#, 2] & /@ newDataCouple]]];      Input values are of the type:               DataCouple = {{.5, .8}, {.7, .9}, {.6, .9}, ... }      W = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}}      Could I then use `NMaximize` or `Maximize` to optimize this function?
