What is the best practice, when it comes to views' translation in MVC design pattern, in multilingual website:   1. Always have only one view file and translate its particular strings with a framework translation function.   2. Always have as many views as website supports, directly translated, one for each language, and let framework internals load particular language-specific view file for language currently selected by user. Which of these two options should I use (if there isn't any third one) and why?
