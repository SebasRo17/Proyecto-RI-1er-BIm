I'm quite new in _Mathematica_ , and I would like to ask you to consider the next case: I need to plot bar chart with error bars on logarithmic scale. From Wolfram site I took the function which allows to plot error bars on a bar chart with normal (non-log) scaling. Thus, my ugly actual code looks like:               errorBar[type_: "Rectangle"][{{x0_, x1_}, {y0_, y1_}}, value_, meta_] :=        Block[{error},              error = Flatten[meta];             error = If[error === {}, 0, Last[error]];             { ChartElementData[type][{{x0, x1}, {y0, y1}}, value, meta],                {Black, Line[{{{(x0 + x1)/2, y1 - error}, {(x0 + x1)/2, y1 + error}},                                     {{1/4 (3 x0 + x1), y1 + error}, {1/4 (x0 + 3 x1), y1 + error}},                             {{1/4 (3 x0 + x1), y1 - error}, {1/4 (x0 + 3 x1), y1 - error}}}]}             }            ]          figdata = {{4.01 -> 0.76, 1.73 -> 0.14, 3.95 -> 0.35},                 {68.53 -> 16.32, 77.77 -> 11.13, 81.39 -> 27.32}};     xlables = {"r1", "r2"};     leftframename = "Frequency";          BarChart[ figdata, ChartElementFunction -> errorBar["Rectangle"],                ChartStyle -> {White, Gray, Black}, ChartLabels -> {xlables, None},                FrameLabel -> {None, Style[leftframename, 15, FontFamily -> "OpenSans"]},               FrameTicks -> {{{0, 10, 100, 1000}, None}, {None, None}},                Frame -> Left, BarSpacing -> {0, 0.5},                BaseStyle -> {FontWeight -> "Bold", FontSize -> 15},               ScalingFunctions -> "Log"]      And this produce the following graph: ![Graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/haJJT.png) which is not what I really would like to receive. The problems, that I don't know how to solve:   1. How to plot error bars in a proper way on log scale in `BarChart`?   2. How to make `FrameTicks` visible and on the same distance between each other? Could anyone help me to put this together into working decision?
