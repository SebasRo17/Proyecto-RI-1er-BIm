I need an efficient and accurate method to evaluate hypergeometric ratios of the form: $$\frac{_{2}F_{1}(a+1,b;c;x)}{_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;x)}$$ for large positive values of `a,b,c`. However, if you plot:               Plot[Hypergeometric2F1Regularized[601, Rationalize[100.1], 100, x]/       Hypergeometric2F1Regularized[600, Rationalize[100.1], 100, x],        {x, 0, 1}]      you will see that these ratios can be inaccurate in Mathematica. What can I do?
