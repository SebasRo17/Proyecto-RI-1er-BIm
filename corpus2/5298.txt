So, I have this opportunity to specialize in a vendor software package (like SAS, SAP, PeopleSoft, Pega, Lombardi BPM...). You know the deal - they need a coder to learn their package and _"there's all this demand for the skill"_ ; _"big growing companies are using it"_ , etc, etc. And (now, at least), the money's better. I'm worried about whether or not I'll be able to keep my "normal" programming skills current.   I'm worried about what it will look like on a resume if I switch back to "normal" programming in a couple of years.   I'm worried about whether or not it will be fun. What do you think?
