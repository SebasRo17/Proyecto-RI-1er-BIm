My company has been conducting a lot of interviews lately for candidates with various experience levels, ranging from interns to senior candidates. We put our candidates through five 45 minute interview sessions where we try to ask a range of questions. One person always asks the same questions that test logic and communication. The rest typically split time between a whiteboard coding question and a discussion of previous projects, technologies the interviewee has worked with, and what he/she is looking for a job. Generally, we know the range of questions that other people on the loop will ask. Sometimes we switch things up and end up having redundancies. Today, 3 interviewers asked tree-related questions. Other times, we've all honed in on the same project on a resume and have had the interviewee talk about it with everyone. I think a smooth interview process would help us learn more about the candidate while giving the impression to the candidate that we have our act together as a team. **How do you coordinate with others in the interview loop to give a balanced interview?**
