I have the problem as described in the title. Here is the code:               Remove["Global`*"]     L3 = 2 c1 + 4 c2 + Sqrt[24 c1^2 + 16 c1 c2 + 16 c2^2]     L4 = 1/2 (4 c1 + 8 c2 - 2 Sqrt[24 c1^2 + 16 c1 c2 + 16 c2^2])     Solve[{L3 == K3, L4 == K4}, {c1, c2}];     Set @@@ %[[1]];     K3 = 1; K4 = 2;     FullSimplify[{K3, K4}]     FullSimplify[{L3, L4}]      The output is               {1, 2}     {2, 1}      Since the equations that have been solved for are L3==K3, L4==K4, how can it be that when I specify values for K3,K4, I find L3 and L4 interchanged? What is this? There was not even a Warning Message (MMA 8). Any help is greatly appreciated.
