In C and C++, it is very easy to write the following code with a serious error.               char responseChar = getchar();     int confirmExit = 'y' == tolower(responseChar);     if (confirmExit = 1)     {         exit(0);     }      The error is that the if statement should have been:               if (confirmExit == 1)      As coded, it will exit every time, because the assignment of the `confirmExit` variable occurs, then `confirmExit` is used as the result of the expression. Are there good ways to prevent this kind of error?
