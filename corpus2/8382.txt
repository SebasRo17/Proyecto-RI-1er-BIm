### Context I'm writing a function that look something like:               triDiagonalQ[mat_] := MapIndexed[ #1 == 0 || Abs[#2[[1]]-#2[[2]]] <= 1 &, mat, {2}] //          Flatten // And @@ # &      Now, things like `#2[[1]]` and `#2[[2]]` are somewhat hard to read. I'd prefer to do something like:               triDiagonalQ[mat_] := MapIndexed[ #1 == 0 || Abs[i-j] <= 1 &, mat, {2}] //          Flatten // And @@ # & (* with a {i, j} <- #2 somewhere *)      ### Question Is there someway to do something like "destructuring" in _Mathematica_? * * * The following links convey what I mean by "destructuring":   * http://clojure.org/special_forms   * http://java.dzone.com/articles/clojure-destructuring   * http://blog.jayfields.com/2010/07/clojure-destructuring.html (These have nothing to do with _Mathematica_ ; they're posted mainly to demonstrate what is meant by "destructuring")
