I apologize first, because this has been asked, like in Treat all variables as local in a module [duplicate] Variable scope similar to other languages But I don't get how to use them. Some codes in these answers don't work when I just copy-paste blindly (because I really don't understand them.) Are the above methods the standard way to "Treat variables as local by default (No need to specify them, like in Module)" in _Mathematica_? If so, please give me a working example, please. I think there should be a standard way to do this, but I can't find it in the documentation.
