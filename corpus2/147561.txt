I'm surprised to find that it might be possible to use Pascal with the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks. This is an interesting turn of events, as Pascal was the favored language for Mac development for a short while early in the history of Macintosh. It looks like someone has gone to a lot of trouble to make Pascal work with Objective-C frameworks like Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, but I'm not sure I see the point. Is this mainly a refuge for Pascal developers coming from other development environments like Delphi, or are there compelling reasons to use Pascal in place of Objective-C or other languages. I don't mean to ask which language is "better." I'm just wondering if there's a reason beyond language preference that one would choose to use Pascal for MacOS X or iOS development.
