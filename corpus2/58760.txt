**Bug introduced in 10.0.0** * * * m_goldberg demonstrated that in _Mathematica_ 10 `Commonest` does not behave as the documentation indicates that it will. Concisely: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YdXqX.png)               Commonest[{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, 1]  (* should return {1} *)      > >     {3} >   The function did behave as it was supposed to in earlier versions.
