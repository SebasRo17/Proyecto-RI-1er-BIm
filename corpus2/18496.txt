I would like to construct a Matrix using the Table[] command. The issue is that I would like to use more than one expression for it. What I need to obtain is something like this :               {{f[1, 1], g[1, 1], f[1, 2], g[1, 2]}, {f[2, 1], g[2, 1], f[2, 2],g[2, 2]}}      I tried to write a table containing the two expressions f[i,j] and g[i,j] inside the Table[] command but without success... What I obtain instead is something like this :               In[8]:= Table[{f[i, j], g[i, j]}, {i, 2}, {j, 2}]          Out[8]= {{{f[1, 1], g[1, 1]}, {f[1, 2], g[1, 2]}}, {{f[2, 1],         g[2, 1]}, {f[2, 2], g[2, 2]}}}      What would be the correct syntax to construct these type of matrices? Or am I completely wrong trying to use the Table[] command?
