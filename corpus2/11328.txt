In the help for LinearModelFit, the regression line can be added to the scatter plot like this:               Show[ListPlot[data], Plot[lm[x], {x, 0, 5}]]      Is it possible to fill from the points to the regression line? This can illustrate the distance whose sum of squares is being minimized. I tried variations on this:               Filling -> Table[ lm[data[[i]][[2]]],  {i, Length[data]}]]      Here the Table will be a list of predicted values for y at each observation of x, but this results in the error "not a valid filling specification."
