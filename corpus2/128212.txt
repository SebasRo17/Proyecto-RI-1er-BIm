I know the concept of orthogonality, but from a programming language point of view, is there a way to verify/prove it? For instance in C#, one can use `public` or `static` for a method signature. You can use either or both and they wouldn't interfere with each other, so they are orthogonal to each other, right? My question is, how do I go about the rest of features, particularly features that are not related to each other? Do all the features have to coexist/stack together? Is there a programming language that is 100% orthogonal?
