I'm having trouble getting some pretty simple functions using `AstronomicalData` to perform at anywhere near the speed I need them to. For example, I have many places where I need to compute something like               ParametricPlot[      {AstronomicalData[        "Mercury", {"RightAscension",          DatePlus[Date[], d], {$GeoLocation[[1]] , $GeoLocation[[2]]}}], d},      {d, 0, 365}, AspectRatio -> 1/1.6]      but find that it takes far to long for even this simple fragment to run. I want to put several such fragments (e.g. one for each of several astronomical objects) into a single figure, and even to dynamically change the parameters for the figure (such as location and date) inside a `Manipulate`, which would be prohibitively slow given the times I'm seeing with even the simple fragment above. Why is `AstronomicalData` so slow? Is there something I can do to speed it up so I can use it as I hope to?
