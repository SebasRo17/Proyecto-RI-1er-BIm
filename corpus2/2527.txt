Graph or GraphPlot produce square layouts for disconnected graphs:               Graph[Table[i -> Mod[i^3, 100], {i, 1, 100}]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bFqCB.png) IÂ´d like to get a rectangular layout with e.g. aspect ratio 1/2, preferably in combination with the `PackingMethod -> "ClosestPackingCenter"` option. Setting `AspectRatio` does not do what I want, because the graph is only rescaled/distorted and not redrawn on a rectanglular grid with said `AspectRatio.` ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XCfq2.png) Is there a way to achieve something like this (emulated by a gridded copy of the first graph)? ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f194y.png) Addition: Because of the added interactive graph functionality in newer versions, a solution leaving this functionality intact would be preferrable (and probably more compatible with future developments).
