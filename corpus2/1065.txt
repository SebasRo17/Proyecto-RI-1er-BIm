How do I convert a number to a readable string? I would like to implement a function, `inWords[]`,                   inWords[n_]:= ?      which should return a readable English string. A few expected results:               inWords[123456]     " one hundred twenty three thousand four hundred fifty six"          inWords[1000000001]     "one billion one"          inWords[123456789123456789]          "one hundred twenty three quadrillion four hundred fifty six trillion \     seven hundred eighty nine billion one hundred twenty three million \     four hundred fifty six thousand seven hundred eighty nine"      On the other hand, how do I implement a function to do exactly the reverse of this? That is, to read and parse string and convert the string to a number? **Note** The Stack Overflow post _Express a number using words in Mathematica_ tries to answers second part of my question. However, it uses `WolframAlpha` which expects one to be connected to the Internet, and there are restrictions on number of calls made so, a non- WolframAlpha answer would be much nicer.
