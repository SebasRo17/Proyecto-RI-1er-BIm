I'm writing an application and a set of many small plugins—where “many” means dozens and “small” means one or two sources. It's not necessarily going to be possible to divide the plugins into neat, non-overlapping categories. Which would be the best strategy for source control:   * Many repositories, one for each plugin; or   * One repository, with a directory for each plugin? Other suggestions are of course welcome. I'm using Mercurial and hosting on Bitbucket.
