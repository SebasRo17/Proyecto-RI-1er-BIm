I have a unique set `S={1,1,3,3,3}` but from this unique set I can create many combinations like `{1,3,3,3,1}, {3,3,1,3,1}, ...` I want to write a generalized formula to represent this. From the below formula I have already tried to find the total combinations:               5!/(2!*3!)      where 5 is the total number of elements in the set and number of 1's are 2 and number of 3's are 3. But I want to write this formula in a generalized way.
