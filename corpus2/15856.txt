Are there certain activities that provide inspiration at unexpected times? One that I've noticed is when I'm mowing the lawn or shoveling snow - living in Minnesota it seems I'm always doing one or the other. The physical activity gives my brain a chance to wander and ponder either the most pressing problem on my mind or some random thought of the day.
