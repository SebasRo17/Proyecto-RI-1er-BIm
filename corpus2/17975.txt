How to systematically classify Mathematica expressions? I can think of using `Head[]`, `Depth[]`, `Length[]`, and some special pattern based on the problems at hand. What other key words, or functions should I consider? ## Update I mostly want to group symbols by how nested its list are, and what kinds of elements the lists have. For example               {_String, _Symbol}          {{_Integer}, _String}          _String      would be considered _three_ distinct types.
