In one of my interviews I was asked a vague question, I'm still not sure of the answer. We have a client and a server they are placed apart. The network that connects them has high latency, which is dominating the performance. How can we improve the performance. Note that we can't change the network's topology. I was thinking of caching, breaking the request to multiple smaller requests and opening multiple connections with the server. Any ideas? Please note that the question description is vague and I wasn't supplied with more information about the situation. **Clarified question:** How should the client-server communication be designed in order to get the best performance on a network that has big latency?
