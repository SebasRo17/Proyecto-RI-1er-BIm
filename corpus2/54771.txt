Can someone please explain to me the logic of this: In one cell, when writing               eq = D[y[x], x] + a*y[x] - b*Sin[c*x];     sol = DSolve[eq == 0, y[x], x];     TeXForm[sol]     OutputForm[TeXForm[sol]]      I see only the result of `OutputForm`: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7iLnb.png) But in separate cells, then I see both outputs ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ps1kB.png) ps. I was trying to find how to remove the "\" at the end of the `OutputForm` compared to `TeXForm` output, and that is why I am doing the above, to compare the outputs. This happens on both V9 and 10. Should not both output show up, even if in the same cell?
