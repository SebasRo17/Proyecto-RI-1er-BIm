I have the following equation: \begin{equation} (y-1)^{b1} - C~~ y~~ \exp(a x)=0 \end{equation} where $a, b$ are real constants, $C$ may be a complex number. I need to find the real solution of the above equation for each choice of $x$, with $x \in [-100, 100]$.   I tried with $\mathbf{fzero, fsolve}$ in _Matlab_. But it does not work. I also tried to solve with the Newton - Raphson method. The outcome is negative. Is it possible to solve it in any other way. Any help/suggestion/advice, will be very useful. I tried with the below given mathematica code, but it almost give up as I increase the range of $x$. Here is my mathematica code:               k  = 0.5;   (*k is positive*)     b  = 0.01;  (*b is a positive number not greater than 1*)     a1 = bk;     b1 = 1 + b;     a2 = b1 + k;     a  = a1 / a2;     y0 = 0.5;     z  = ConstantArray[0, 11];     For[x = −5; i = 1,         x < 6,         x = x++; i++,      t = Solve[y0 (1 − y)^b1 − y (1 − y0)^b1 Exp[a x] == 0, y];      z[[i]] = y /. t]      I need the real solution, not the real part of the solution. Secondly my constants are dependent on parameters $k, b$ as stated in the code. And $C = \frac{(1-y0)^{b1}}{y0}$. Hope my question make sense in the mathematica category. Any further query / suggestions/ feedback, please let me know. Thank you all who show concern; I require your help.
