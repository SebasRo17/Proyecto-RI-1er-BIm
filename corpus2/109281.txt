I have close to 3 years experience writing web applications in Java using MVC frameworks (like struts). I have never written multithreaded code till now though I have written code for major retail chains. I get a few questions on multithreading during interviews and I answer them usually (mostly simple questions). This left me wondering how important is Multithreading in the current industry scenario ?
