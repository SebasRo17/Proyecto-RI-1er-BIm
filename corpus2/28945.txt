I'm attempting to display an image sequence of 40 images inside of a `Manipulate` that cycles through each frame with a slider. I would like the `Manipulate` to appear in a separate `DialogBox`. I see a significant performance difference if I try to encapsulate this functionality inside its own function. This code displays the dialog nearly instantaneously:               CreateDialog[       Manipulate[         imageSequence[[frame]], {frame, 1, Length[imageSequence], 1}]]      However the code below takes around 10 seconds for the dialog to appear:               showit[imageSequence_] :=        CreateDialog[         Manipulate[           imageSequence[[frame]], {frame, 1, Length[imageSequence], 1}]]          showit[imageSequence]      It does not seem to matter if the function definition is surrounded by `DynamicModule` or not. Any ideas what is going on and what I can do to improve performance while maintaining encapsulation? Thanks!
