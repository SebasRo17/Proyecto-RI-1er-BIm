I have read some information through internet...i found that somehow suffix tree is quite similar to suffix array but somehow they are no the same thing.. Given a string, a suffix tree construction algorithm looks something like this (I copied the algorithm from a website)               FOR i ← 1 to n-1             FOR j ← 1 to i+1                     find the end path for S[j…i]        extend the path, if needed, to S[i+1]       suffix tree able to list down all the subtring obtained from a given string However, does the suffix array also give the same functionality to obtain the list of substrings? Or are suffix arrays just an implementation of suffix trees? Or suffix array just provide some storing function?
