I've just started freelancing and have two projects where I am splitting my week with both companies, one I'm charging hourly and everything is fine, the other one however they have said they will pay me based on a points basis using Pivotal Tracker. For example, there's a fixed rate per point and they work on an estimate that I will complete two points per day, I was just wondering if this is something that is used regularly or if I should try and get them to switch to hourly? My concern is that points are only used for features and if a feature has a bug this isn't taken into consideration so any time spent fixing that bug won't be charged. Correct?
