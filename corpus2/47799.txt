I would like to find the best fit of two variables for a number of approximate equations, such as:               1x+2y+2=7.04     2x+y+4=7.98     1.5x+1.5y-2=2.53     1.8x+3y-1=6.77      That should come up with a result: `x = ~1`, `y = ~2` (exact value for whatever the best fit is). I can't find any inspiration in either   * CurveFittingAndApproximateFunctions or    * StatisticalModelAnalysis .  I don't expect anyone to do it for me, but perhaps someone could push me in a correct direction? Thanks in advance, r.
