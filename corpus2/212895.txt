I'm trying to use MQS to create a Gantt chart of 5 processes (P1-P5) as well as their waiting, response, and turnaround times (and averages of those metrics) within a CPU task schedule. Here's the basic table of arrival times and bursts: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iyZJx.jpg) Here's my actual work version after ticking off the finished processes. The time quantum for each time slice is (2 queues) TQ1=4 and TQ2=3. Note that I'm doing MQS and NOT MLFQ: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7KNh8.jpg) It just doesn't feel like I'm doing MQS right here, I know this gets a little complex but maybe someone can point out where I'm going totally wrong.
