When I try to export graphics as PNG, JPG and other rasterized formats using the right-click and choosing `Save Graphic As...`, if the notebook magnification is changed from 100%, Mathematica fails to export the image and returns the following Error: "The specified setting for the option WindowSize cannot be used." However this does not happen when `Export` function is used to export the graphic. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C5UjW.png) I think this is a bug. I am using _Mathematica_ v9.0.1 installed on Microsoft Windows 7 (64 Bits). **UPDATE** This bug is still present in version 10.0.0.0.
