I know that parallel programming is a big resource in computer graphics, with moder machines, and mayebe a computing model that will be grow up in the near future (is this trend true?). I want to know what is the best way to deal with it. there is some practical general purpose usefulness in studying processor n-dimensional mesh, or bitonic sort in p-ram machines or it's only theory for domain specific hardware used in real particular signal elaborations of scientific simulations? Is this the best way to acquire the know how for how to become acquainted with cuda or opencl? (i'm interested in computer graphics applications) and why functional programming is so important to understand parallel computing? ps: as someone has advice me i have forked this discussion from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4908677/how-to-deal-with-parallel- programming
