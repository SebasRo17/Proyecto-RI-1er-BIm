As many of you know WordPress uses "secret key" like thing for every AJAX request. Making each request unique and also 'somewhat' secure (just a step ahead than nothing). How would I implement the same using PageMethods (webservice methods inside aspx page) in asp.net application. Some things I have already taken care of are authentication and authorization to access the page. I would like to know How to generate the same nonce/secret key whatever in C# for asp.net application? Also doesn't this affect the performance of the application like 100 thousand users use it and each time the method has to go through encryption, random number generation etc..? Is there any way I can check if posted data is what was actually posted. Checking the integrity of posted data? Do you need to follow design patterns to secure application logic? Does one exist to make your application at the least somewhat secure?
