Samuel Culbert thinks that they are evil. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122426318874844933.html I tend to agree - there is nothing worse than for someone creative (let's assume I am) to be judge on a 5-point system and to be stored away in HR department. However, I am not sure how many companies actually followed his advice. Have you ever worked at a place which never required one?
