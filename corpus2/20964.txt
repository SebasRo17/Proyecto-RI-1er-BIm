I keep seeing reference to use of Mathematica as a CAD tool (for instance: http://www.makerbot.com/support/guides/design/). I'd like to use it as such if feasible, but I'm having trouble locating equivalents of the functionality I use in my current design tool, OpenSCAD. I know how to create simple shapes (`Graphics3D[]`, `Cylinder[]`, etc.) and I'm aware that Mathematica can export to STL format. But does Mathematica have equivalents of the following OpenSCAD functions, or is it the wrong tool for the kind of thing I'm trying to do?   * linear_extrude()   * union()   * intersection()   * difference()   * translate()   * rotate()
