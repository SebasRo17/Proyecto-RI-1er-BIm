I was looking through the AvSol Coding Guidelines for C# and I agree with nearly everything but I'm really curious to see what other think of one specific rule. > AV1500 > > Methods should not exceed 7 statements A method that requires more than 7 > statements is doing too much, or has too many responsibilities.

Do most of you follow this rule? Even if there's little to be saved from creating a new method (Your code is still DRY) aside from greatly increasing readability? And is your number still as low as 7? I would tend more toward 10. I'm not saying I violate this rule all over the place--on the contrary, my methods are 95% small and focused but saying you should never violate this rule really blew me away. I really just want to know what everyone thinks of NEVER violating this rule (It's a '1' on the coding standard--meaning NEVER do this). But I think you'd have trouble finding a codebase that doesn't.
