How is the Morse Code representation of a letter determined? "E" = "." "T" = "-" Why is it not alphabetic? As in let "A" = ".", "B" = "-", "C" =".-", etc. I'm trying to develop an algorithm for a traversing Binary Tree filled with these letter. My main aim is to search for a letter, like "A", but I don't know what conditions to use that determines when to branch to the right or left node.
