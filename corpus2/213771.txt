This question relates to software-licensing. Someone familiar with open-source licensing may be able to answer this question. I am facing an issue in trying to interpret/understand some Licenses, due to a language barrier (English is not my first language). My situation is that I am using three products inside a distributable closed-source commercial product. These are:   * Jersey (Common Development and Distribution License)   * Jetty (Dual Apache & Eclipse)   * RXTX (LGPL) The tools above are not modified in my project and are used 'as is' included with Maven. My question is what step/s should I take to be perfectly sure I am not violating any Licence agreements? Should I (for example):   * Put some information inside the README file that I am using this software inside?    * Print something in command line?    * Should I place the full-license texts of those tools in separate files (but this could be misleading to customer, because my product doesn't have any Licence)?    * Could I extract these Licenses text files during the first JAR run?  I am looking for practical information, not necessarily from a lawyers.
