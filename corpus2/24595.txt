I would like to use Compile with functions defined outside Compile. For example if I have the two basic functions F and G               F[x_] := x + 2     G[x_] := x      And I want to compute F[G[x]] in Compile               compiledFunction = Compile[{{x, _Real, 0}}, F[G[x]] ]      The resulting compiled function calls MainEvaluate               FastCompiledFunctionQ[function_CompiledFunction]:=     (         Needs["CompiledFunctionTools`"];         StringFreeQ[CompiledFunctionTools`CompilePrint@function,"MainEvaluate"]     )          compiledFunction // FastCompiledFunctionQ      Returns False, where FastCompiledFunctionQ checks if a compiled function calls MainEvaluate (in order to use normal Mathematica kind of code instead of one compiled using Compile), which is usually slower than compiled code. Is there a way to go around this ? More generally I want to compile almost any numerical Mathematica code that calls user defined functions (which themselves can call other user defined functions) and doesn't use symbolic computations.
