**Note:** Fixed sometime around the 18th of August 2014. Bug present from the release of 10.0.0. until then. * * * I wanted to test how a simple deployed program would appear to a non- mathematica user. I did the following, from within a Mathematica notebook:               obj = CloudDeploy[FormFunction[{"country" -> "Country"}, Show[#country["Flag"], ImageSize -> 600] &, "SVG"], Permissions -> "Public"]      As expected:               Options[obj, Permissions]           {"Owner" -> {"Read", "Write", "Execute"}, "All" -> {"Execute"}}      But when I try to access the link (from another machine), it prompts me for a userid and password for the Cloud platform. I tested this several times on different machines, and the result was always the same. Is this the intended behavior? I thought the idea was that anyone could access a deployed object, without having to sign up for an account (even a free one).
