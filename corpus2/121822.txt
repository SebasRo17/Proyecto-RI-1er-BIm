English in not my native language, therefore it is a little more difficult to pick a good name for a namespace. One example to make you see my problem a bit better: We have a set of classes that have to do with the way a company is organized (we can create organizational charts with it). Currently the namespace is `CFW.CoreSystem.Organizational`. Is this a good name? What is **linguistically** the best way to name a namespace? (`CFW.CoreSystem.Configuration` is better than `CFW.CoreSystem.Configurables`). [Moved it from StackOverflow]
