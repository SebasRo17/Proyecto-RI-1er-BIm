I am trying to numerically solve an equation with NDSolve, where there is a ODE coupled to a PDE, like the following:                   NDSolve[{       Derivative[1, 0][u][t,x] ==         -0.8*u[t, x] - (5.*n[t]*Derivative[0, 1][u][t, x])/(5. + n[t]) + (50.*n[t]^2*Derivative[0, 2][u][t, x])/(5. + n[t])^2,        Derivative[1][n][t] ==         100. - 0.8*n[t] - (0.5*Integrate[u[t, x], {x, 0, 2*Pi}]*n[t])/(5. + n[t]),        u[0, x] == 200.,       n[0] == 50.,       u[t, 0] == u[t, 2*Pi]},      {u, n},      {t, 0., 2.},      {x, 0., 6.28}]      Unfortunately Mathematica tells me `"NDSolve::ndode: Input is not an ordinary differential equation"`. When i change `n[t]` to `n[t,x]` it calculates something, but `n[t,x]` doesn't stay uniform over time, which it should because `n` wasn't a function of `x` in the first place. Would anyone know a way around this?
