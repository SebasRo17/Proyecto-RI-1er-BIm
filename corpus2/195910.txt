We have a suite of applications including a website, a client application and multiple windows services. All these applications work on the same dataset and use an in-memory cache. Of course, this setup fails when one of the applications does something that invalidates the cache. I'm looking for a solution that will allow me to invalidate the cache across the applications. We have some ideas, but I'm sure the collective minds of the internet can give us a better solution. Some details:   * this is a legacy application, which means we would like to keep the changes as non-invasive as possible   * We're hesitant to introduce another moving piece to the solution. So using an external cache is out.
