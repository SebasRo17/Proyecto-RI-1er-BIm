As title says it, i'm looking for a way to store many dictionaries (one per user) of type `Dictionary<DateTime,enum>` in a database (sql server 2012). Each dictionary has 366 items inside and it represents a calendar where each day has a certain "status", and preferably i don't want to store each item as a separate record in the DB. Ideas? **update** : With the suggestion @AndyBursh & @Konrad Morawski made, i've also come up with another optimisation. Rather than by default creating a new calendar (represented as `Dictionary`) for each item the user adds, let them pick a predefined one from a drop down, and if that doesn't work for them, then create a separate calendar. With the ability to reuse a calendar and **not** storing default values, i would have to deal with a lot less data in the long term.
