How to simplify the following trigonometry expression such that the number of used characters is minimal?               (13*Cos[t] - 5*Cos[2*t] - 2*Cos[3*t] - Cos[4*t])/4      The question sounds weird because I ask for the minimal number of used characters, but it is not a typo. The number of used characters must be minimal because the plotter needs short expression. Please ignore the computation performance for this case.
