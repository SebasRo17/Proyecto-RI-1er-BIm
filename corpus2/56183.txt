I work on a team with a dozen men. They're great. I like them and all, but can't help wonder why it's so hard to find other technical women. I know they exist because I've met them at conferences, read their blogs, and see them on campus. My guess is there's something about our team that keeps them away. How can we recruit talented women without resorting to gimmicks? I'm not looking for complete gender parity, but why is it that some teams have a 50/50 gender split and ours is completely lopsided?
