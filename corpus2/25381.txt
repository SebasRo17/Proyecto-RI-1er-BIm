The command               Limit[(Sin[x^2] + Sin[y^2])/ (x - y) /. x -> 0, y -> 0]     (*        0     *)      I think that _Mathematica_ finds the iterated limit instead of the double limit. It should be noted that WolframAlpha produces the correct answer, when asking for > "limit (sin(x^2)+sin(y^2))/(x-y) as x->0 and y->0" ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9zjRo.png)
