If I have 2 tables in my database, let's say for instance 'buyers' and 'sellers' but I collect a common set of data for both for instance telephone number, email address, address etc. Is it better practice to have one common table for 'contact_details' with a reference to the table and row that the contact details are for, or as they are seperate entities are they better off in seperate tables entirely?
