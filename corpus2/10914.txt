I'm trying to import some data in a .txt file which contains numbers and words. I import a list which consists of four rows of measured data acquired with an oscilloscope, but the acquisition program puts units in every measured value. Here's an example:               data={{-1.1000u s,-120.00m V,-1.1000u s,8.0000 V},           {-1.0800u s,-120.00m V,-1.0800u s,8.0000 V},           {-60.000n s,-40.000m V,-60.000n s,8.0000 V},           {-40.000n s,-40.000m V,-40.000n s,8.0000 V},           {-20.000n s,-32.000m V,-20.000n s,8.0000 V},           {0.0000 s,-32.000m V,0.0000 s,8.0000 V}}      I would like to know if there's any way I can turn the above list into something more like this:               newdata={{-1.1000,-0.12000,-1.1000,8.0000},              {-0.060000,-0.040000,-0.060000,8.0000},              {-0.040000,-0.040.000,-0.040000,8.0000},              {-0.020000,-0.032000,-0.020.000,8.0000},              {0.0000,-0.032000,0.0000,8.0000}}      I'll appreciate any ideas. Thanks.
