I stumbled on some strange behaviour when trying out the new function template and documentation features, now purportedly working in v 9.0.1. I defined a function `f` and `f::usage="f[x] does something to x"`. Typing `f` and then `Cmd+Shift+K` pulls up a tab and, as with built-in functions, there is an area marked `Documentation` underneath the completion section. Clicking on that (I always wanted an easy way to extend the built-in documentation; the approach described in this question is rather too much of a meal for me) I was given what looks like a notebook view on a directory (the directory shown is the working directory for my notebook): ![Opening a directory](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6XqgA.png) Feeling foolhardy, I thought I'd try to save it (well, I do have a recent bootable backup, TM snapshots and my files are under git/Dropbox control): ![Undocumented feature\(?\) -> error message](http://i.stack.imgur.com/baoOL.png) I was relieved to find that the file could not be written, as it seems to correspond to a directory, which I don't think you can open via the front end and I hope can't be directly written in that way either? It can be "saved as", default being `Consultancy.txt` So, to my question: bug or (undocumented?) feature? Can I use this to do something useful for documentation of my own functions?
