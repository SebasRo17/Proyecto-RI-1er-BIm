We have developed software that uses MySQL. After some months of usage, some of the database tables had been corrupted and need to be repaired. Because of the corruption,we are not able to create a backup using Navicat, and we can not generate a dump too. The log file has been indicating the following error for more than 2 days:               YYMMDD HH:MM:SS [ERROR] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Can't open file: 'ini.MYI' (errno:145)      What is the cause of this corruption? How can we fix them? How can we prevent the database tables from corruption in the future?
