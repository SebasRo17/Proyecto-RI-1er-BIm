I derived an open-sourced work, Service-Nucleus, based on Netflix's Karyon (Apache License) and Google's AngularJS (MIT License). I want to make sure proper licensing and copyrights are in place, and I am not sure how to honor those projects and move forward legitimately at the same time. I've researched this to some length and it's a soupy mess out there. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I currently provide the Apache License from NetFlix at the root.
