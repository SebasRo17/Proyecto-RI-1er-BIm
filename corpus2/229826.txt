I am passing Menu items to View from ViewModel. My menu definition is a model with properties title, image, hasChildren and isEnabled. But this model is meant for UI unlike business domain models like Person, ContactDetail, Transaction, etc. So, when i see this menu model sitting along with business domain models i felt like polluted. Is there a right place to put these kind of UI specific models? Thanks.
