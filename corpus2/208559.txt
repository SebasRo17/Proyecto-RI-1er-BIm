A customer would like me to build them an intranet web site with mapping information. For example, maps such as the ones on Google Maps. I looked at the Google Maps API, but their "free use" license agreement specifically prohibits use on intranets or web sites that charge a fee to obtain a username/password. [Source: https://developers.google.com/maps/terms#section_9_1_1 ] The other solution is to use Google's Enterprise/Business licensing for their map API, but the lowest base cost for that group of licenses starts at $10,000US **per year** , and the price goes up quickly from there! My question:   * Is there another similar programming API/service (HTTP, Javascript, JSON, ...?) to a different mapping company that works better for small single-person web developers without having to commit $10K/year per web site for a license?
