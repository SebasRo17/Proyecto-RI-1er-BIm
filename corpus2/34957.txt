In normal RegEx `\l` will make the character to the right lowercase. However, it seems like the RegEx in Mathematica does not have this functionality. For example               StringCases["Abba", RegularExpression["(.).*?\\l\\1"]]      will return the following error message               RegularExpression::msg37: "Mathematica does not support \\L, \\l, \\N, \\P, \\p, \\U, \\u, or \\X in RegularExpression[\!\(\"(.).*?\\\\l\\\\1\"\)]."      Is there some workaround that I can use? Note that `(?i)` is not sufficient as I need the character to be lowercase _only_. Thanks
