I've made significant, well written code contributions to an open-source project. Unfortunately, the project as a whole is both unpopular, and, to put things mildly, not particularly flashy. Unlike the poster of this HN message, I'm in the opposite boat - I'm proud of my contributions, but embarrassed by the end product. How would you weigh the quality of your contributions versus the quality of the end product versus the popularity of the end product when deciding if you should include it on your resume/portfolio or not?
