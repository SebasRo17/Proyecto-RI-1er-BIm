I have been trying to style a `TabView` like in the examples on the Wolfram CDF site, where they have custom sizes and backgrounds with images or gradients, but I am struggling to find documentation on how to style `TabViews` Is there a way in _Mathematica_ I can list all the properties of a control like `TabView` or just those controls which can be modified by the user? Edit: Link to an example of styling done by Wolfram
