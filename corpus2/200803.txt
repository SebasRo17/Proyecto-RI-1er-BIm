I would like to monitor the filesystem in python, so that my application gets warned of the new file addition, file removal, or file change. Once the file is detected, the application starts extracting the contained data through various plugins. The problem is that I am dealing with big files, and when the user starts copying a file from outside into the watched directory, it will be detected, but it will appear as corrupted. Checking for file size between invocations is potentially a good strategy, but it ignores the fact that other generators of the file (such as wget) might have long pauses when the file is not changing in size, and yet is not completed. I don't have control of the file format I am downloading either, so I can't check for an end-of-file mark, because it could not be there. Is there a cross platform way (or different, platform specific ways for linux and windows) to solve this problem? Can I check if a file is currently open somehow? How is this problem solved in other software?
