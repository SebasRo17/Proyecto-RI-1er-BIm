When you interrupt the work on some code (be it because you have to work on something else or go on vacation or simply because it is the end of the day), once you close that Visual Studio project, what is your preferred way to remember what you want to do next when you start working on that code again. Do you set a Visual Studio bookmark or do write down something like `// TODO: continue here next time`? Maybe you have a special tag like `// NEXT:`? Do you put a sticky note on your monitor? Do you use a cool tool or Visual Studio plugin I should know? Do you have any personal trick that helps you find the place in your code where you left off the last time you worked on your code?
