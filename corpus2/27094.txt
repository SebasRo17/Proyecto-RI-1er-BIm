I realize that the more you go towards the spectrum of "freelance", there is a need for a portfolio (at least for web development) but I would think that a structured contracted job (like a 3 month duration contract to hire, for example) would be a bit more professional in realizing that a professional programmer spends most of their time writing proprietary applications for companies and thus has no portfolio of these to show off.. The area where I live is not a major tech center so a lot of employers and recruiters here seem a bit less than professional when it comes to tech stuff (but it is a big U.S. city) and I get, fairly often, recruiters asking if I have a portfolio to share, etc.. Sure I have done my own projects but I don't keep them up to date and the work that I do for my current employer is my main focus. Anyways, I guess this is just a generalized question about how to differentiate between "freelance" and "contract" (even though I thought I had been doing so on my resume)
