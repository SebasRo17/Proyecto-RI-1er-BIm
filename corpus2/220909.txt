I have been working with SpringMVC, Hibernate, and some databases in a java web application example. There are a few different ones that do this, but this Spring 3 and hibernate integration tutorial with example has a model class, view (in jsp), and a service and dao classes for the controller. My question is, don't both the service and DAO classes do the same thing? Why would you need them both? EDIT: This was the tutorial I was actually using (not that it matters) http://fruzenshtein.com/spring-mvc-security-mysql-hibernate/
