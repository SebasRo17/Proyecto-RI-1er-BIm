Is it possible to replace C and C++ with Go + cgo and interface frameworks such as Qt or DirectX with Go? Any potential pitfalls I should be aware of? UPDATE: I see that my question was not precise enough. Of course I expected problems with Go concepts that aren't available in C/C++ e.g. goroutines. What I really wanted to know was if you could use Go to replace standard C++ functionality. I hope I can convey my idea: I thought of Go as a "scripting language" to leverage C/C++ libraries with a new language. I'd like to know:   * Can you register Go methods as C/C++ callbacks ?   * Can I supply Go variables as parameters to C/C++ functions ?   * Are their pointers compatible ? Go runs on a native Vm, so I guessed there might be an abstraction layer over the memory that invalidates C/C++ pointers Have you ever used cgo or know about its abilities ?
