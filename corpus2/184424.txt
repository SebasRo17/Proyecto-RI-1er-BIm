When coding performance-critical portions of code (not necessarily large, but code that gets executed a lot), what topics should I be aware of/take into account. I'm already fairly familiar with caching, aliasing, branching, cost of arithmetic operations, loop unrolling (and I guess some others that don't come to mind). What else should I know? (not necessarily looking for details, just concepts I can look up on my own)
