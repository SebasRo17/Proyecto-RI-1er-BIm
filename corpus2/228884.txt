I've recently stepped in to a managing position which of course involves overseeing other people's work, and guiding juniors. There's this guy who won't stop asking questions, and many times it's really basic stuff - which eats a lot of my time and breaks my in-the-zone mode. I tried the easy-going approach of sending him a link with "Let me Google that for you", but he only got excited about the joke, and didn't get the clue. Other times I'm just telling him I'm busy, and that he should go and research it himself. The thing is, when I wasn't in the office he did a decent job on his own, so most of what he's assigned with he can handle. The question is how can I make him filter the issues he comes to me with? I realize that I'm the professional authority he should be addressing when he needs help, I only wish he would do it on non-trivial matters.
