I have an api only application (rails-api) and I'm looking to authorize a user on both email/password or 3rd party services like facebook or twitter etc, so I know I will have to use Oauth at some point. My question is, can I solely use Oauth, or do I have to implement my own authentication (or something like Devise) to do the manual email auth. I don't understand Oauth well enough to know whether I can do manual authentication with my single endpoint, it seems like it only works with 2 endpoints (my server and a 3rd party service). I would much rather not use Devise is not built for an api and adds alot of overhead IMO.
