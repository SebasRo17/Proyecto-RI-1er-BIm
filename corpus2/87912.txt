To give light to the situation: I am currently one of two programmers working in a small startup software company. Part of my job requires me to learn a Web development framework that I am not currently familiar with. I get paid by the hour. So the question is: Is it wholly ethical to spend multiple hours of the day reading through documentation and tutorials and be paid for this time where I am not actively developing for our product? Or should the bulk of this learning be done at home, or otherwise off hours, to allow for more full-on development of our application during the work day?
