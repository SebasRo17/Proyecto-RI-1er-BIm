I'm a Rails newbie, so bear with me. I have a few places, some pages, some partials that use:               <%= link_to "delete", post, method: :delete,                                      data: { confirm: "You sure?" },                                      title: post.content %>      Would it make sense to make this a partial since it is used repeatedly, sometimes in other partials too? Is it o.k. to put partials in partials?
