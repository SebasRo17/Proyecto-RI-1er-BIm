Looking for suggestions on finding code to review, or to be more clear, code on SE sites with excepted working code -- to suggest be posted to CodeReview.SE for optimization. The source of this question was another question I posted on CodeReview.SE.meta Growing Code Review, One Idea... :-) In which I got this reply: * * * > Sure, you can, as long as people are clear what code review is for -- > essentially, functioning, working code that needs to be improved in some > subjective, perhaps even aesthetic, way. > > If the code is in any way broken or does not work, that is not the purpose > of Code Review. > > Jeff Atwood * * * If anyone has suggestions on how to improve this question, just comment.
