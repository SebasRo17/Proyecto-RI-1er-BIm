I've been a bit weary about approaching learning databases. I've dabbled into them before, and "DATA" in itself appeals to me a lot. Maintaining/searching/moving, everything about it in the abstract sense I love. (This isn't a career question, this is a learning question.) But as RDBMS's begin to be easier to maintain, and with tools that "anyone" can use to manage data I feared for the database admin jobs. (Yet I see jobs for SQL everywhere!). I know "No-SQL" was a big deal but it kinda has its niche. But that leaves me here... unsure of really "what" to study. What tools should I have in my tool belt? I'm sure RDBMS's will be around in both use and maintaining legacy code. But what else? Obviously data will always be around, but is this a secure field or a dying one? And what should I be concentrating on?
