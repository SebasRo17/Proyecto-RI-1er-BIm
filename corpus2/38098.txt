Is this a bug, or something going over my head? When using the following code, nothing "special" happens:               ParametricPlot[a {Cos[t], Sin[t]}, {a, 1, 2}, {t, 0, 2 Pi},       Mesh -> None, PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.2]]      it works as expected, one gets this graphic, without any mesh lines: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uY41e.png) When adding `Graphics[]` in front of thatâ€”as I'd like to `Show` such a `ParametricPlot` with some other graphics, I get this:               Show[      Graphics[],      ParametricPlot[a {Cos[t], Sin[t]}, {a, 1, 2}, {t, 0, 2 Pi},        Mesh -> None, PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.2]]      ]      yields: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m2Ggy.png) Why do those mesh-lines come up? Are those actually Mesh-lines, as I used `Mesh -> None`? How can I delete those lines, while still using `Show` and others `Graphics[]`? Thanks for all help!
