I have avoided JavaScript for as long as I could. I simply think that it is a very, very dirty scripting language. I have nothing against curly braces, I work with PHP almost every day, I'm fine with them. I think the biggest issue is that I'm pretty much self taught and started out with PHP. I've worked previously with jQuery, so that dealt pretty much with my JSfobia (as manipulating a few elements on a page did the trick for me, as well as the tons of pre-made plugins out there). Now I just have to take a step further. I've recently done some exploration, and I must say that I like the way that RoR looks like. And well - there is a similar way of writing JS - CoffeeScript. On top of that, there is an project coming up for me ( a week or so ) to develop an iPhone app, now I already know that I'll be storing data on the phone and then displaying it. Nothing too complicated yet, but these are new grounds for me. I will probably be working with PhoneGap to make it an app, since I don't really want to start messing in Objective-C (although I could, but without C/C++ knowledge it may take a lot more time than I'd want it to) So - this brings to my question. Is it okay if I start learning CoffeeScript with just basic understanding of JS, and start trying to use Backbone.js with jQuery/+jQuery Mobile for the project ? Open for any additional suggestions as well.
