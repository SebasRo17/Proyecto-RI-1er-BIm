I am implementing inheritance of something called Contexts. Each Context holds a link to its parent context. If that Context is the root Context, its parent is null. In order to walk up the inheritance tree and get the data from each Context, I want to do this (in pseudocode)               private Hashtable getDataAsMap() {         Hashtable map  =  this.parent != null  ?                                 this.parent.getDataAsMap()  :                                 new Hashtable();              // add my data              return map;          }      Is this recursion? I'm calling the same method, but on a different object. Does that still count? If not, what would you call it?
