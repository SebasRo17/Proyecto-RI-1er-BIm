C# and Java has code attribute and code annotation. I don't know about other languages, but I know the code annotation feature is used to expand language itself. I knew what it is, but I want to know how it developed over time. I want to know its history. How it demanded and how it implemented. Is this possible to implement this in kind of concept on LISP, Smalltalk or C++? And is there a general term to call the concept of annotation?
