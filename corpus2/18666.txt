I've got a bit of a challenge. While I'm not "in charge" I'm certainly lead developer on a project and my team will be scattered to high heaven. I've got someone who works on Fridays only, and probably 2 people who will be 3-4 hours away in another state. (One of the lovely side effects of partnering with multiple universities). Anyway, how can I get them all on the same "team"?? I've read a bunch of Joel Spolsky's stuff, but I can't create the same kind of environment that he uses. This is also the first project I'll be lead on, so it's kindof make-or-break. Specifically I'm looking for managing styles (personality), process models, project management (scrum?), video conferencing tools, and the like. I just don't have any resources for this kind of thing, and I'm afraid I'm going to be stuck doing too much work. Thanks,
