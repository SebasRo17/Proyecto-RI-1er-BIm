Today I was reading that the Microsoft _Surface RT_ is available for pre- order. (For the curious, click here.) I know the version of Widows 8 that runs on x86 processors should be compatible already with Mathematica 8... but what about the version of Windows 8---called Windows 8 RT---designed for ARM processor devices, like Microsoft's Surface device? Also, from what I've read there will also be an Intel version, called the _Surface Pro_ , that will run Windows 8 Pro. (Note I'm not sure if this will be an ARM or x86 Intel processor.) Summarizing my question(s): Will Mathematica run on the _Surface RT_ or the _Surface Pro_? Info about the Surface on Wikipedia here.
