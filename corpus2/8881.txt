I am new here, so let me know if this question is inappropriate. I've been stuck for many hours on this puzzle. I know it should be easy, but for me...? I want to create a Notebook (call it "Index of Related"), located in directory "C:\somewhere\strange" (not necessarily in $Path) which contains a list of notebooks I use at the same time, but quite independently of one another. One application might be a list of all the Mathematica notebooks I use in my microeconomics course. From inside "Index of Related", if I click on a button, I want Mathematica to load some other notebook, just as if I had used File/Open in Mathematica. I can't seem to create buttons to execute simple File/Opens! Every coding I've tried adding to Index of Related" seems to load the other notebooks into or inside Index of Related or generate $Failed. Example X: Example of an application:   * File 1, located in C:\directory1 : Slide show for the talk....   * File 2, located in c:\dogs\small : My text for the talk....   * File 3, located somewhere in $Path : Handouts for the talk....   * File 4: References for the talk....   * Files 5-8, located all over the place: Examples for the talk, created for other projects, so in various other directories.... Now, while creating the talk I first load "Index of Related". I stumble on a reference, so I open Files 2 and 4 and make changes. In a later session, I want to create from this reference a slide, so I open and work in File 2.
