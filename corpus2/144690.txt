I have some trouble getting a good folder structure in my project and i would like to know what other ways i could use to structure my files. I'm currently working in an MVC sturctured folder.               www/       Controllers/       Models/       Views/      Nothing special so far. But i'm also using an ORM system. With it i can easily get an 'object' from my database like:               ORM::load('table');      Now this sort of code should reside in a Model right? So i'd get something like this:               <?php     class userModel     {         public function getAllUsers ( )         {             return ORM::load('table');         }              public function getUserById ( $id )         {             return ORM::load('table', 'userid=?', array($id));         }     }     ?>      Looks good so far in my opinion... But there's one more thing. I can also specify a 'model' when using the ORM system. With this model i can basically set up validation rules. Like so:               ORM::withModel('authModel');      This lets the ORM know that before it adds a new row (or updates an existing one) to the DB, that it should check the following model first for validation rules.               <?php     class authModel //Or maybe authValidation??     {         // Method gets automatically triggered when an update is done with the ORM         public function onUpdate ( $obj )         {             if ( $obj->username == '' )                 throw new \Exception('No username');         }              public function onInsert ( $obj )         {             // Validations here too.         }     }     ?>      Now the problem is, is that i have 2 sorts of models. One where i basically use getters/setters to get and store data to the database (from my controller to my model). And i have another model in which validation rules are set... I don't want to mix both in the same folder. So i must come up with another structure for this. Something like:               www/       Controllers/       Models/         Repositories/         Entities/       Views/      It's just that my model isn't a real 'repository', since it doesn't store any objects in the repo class and doesn't have a commit() method or anything like that. I also can't store the 2nd model (for validations) in the Entities folder, because they're not Entities at all... Any idea how i should structure this..??
