I would like to convert a matrix which has a structure like this:               {{"A", 10, "D", 1},{"B", 3, "A", 2},{"C", 7, "B", 3},{"D", 6, "C", 4}}//MatrixForm//Print;      into one that looks like this:               {{"A", 10, "A", 2},{"B", 3, "B", 3},{"C", 7, "C", 4},{"D", 6, "D", 1}}//MatrixForm//Print;      Is there a way to do this that still works when column 1 is not in alphabetical order.
