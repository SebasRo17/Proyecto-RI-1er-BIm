I have been asked to investigate the possibility of re-engineering an existing ASP.NET AJAX Web Application as under MVC. The project, as it stands ATM, is very heavily relient on Telerik's ASP.NET AJAX controls. I've yet to have to opportunity to interview the person responsible for this request, so I'm unsure of the drivers for this, but I believe that as well as looking for a more structured solution (the original was developed in a very organic way) I believe that one of the goals is to _also_ get a lot of the code running client-side and to use a structured form for the development there also. So, My question is, is there a defined set of considerations for something like this? Or, if people do this kind of thing at all, do they just wing it?
