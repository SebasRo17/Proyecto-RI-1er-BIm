As the title suggest, I'm trying to make an animation of how a bunch of points into 2-D (and possibly 3-D space) evolves by each step of my program. In order to do so I've data which contains the x and y position of every single point of the map at a given "time" t, which is defined by jumping over 20 elements of the list. i.e. t=0 goes from row 1 to row 20, t=1 from row 21 to row 40, etc... here's the file: Full Version: https://www.mediafire.com/?irgddwos6qn5kb1 Light Version: https://www.mediafire.com/?rdx66fsyzejonhx and here's what i've written in order to obtain x and y positions of points at a given time:                   dati = Import["...\\KOHONEN SOM\\output.dat"]         {a, b} = Transpose[dati];         neuro = 20;         x = Array[h, neuro];         y = Array[j, neuro];         Table[x[[k]] = Table[a[[k + i*neuro*4]], {i, 0, 50000}], {k, 1, neuro}];         Table[y[[k]] = Table[b[[k + i*neuro*4]], {i, 0, 50000}], {k, 1, neuro}];         X = Array[l, 50000];         Y = Array[s, 50000];         Table[X[[l]] = Table[x[[j]][[l]], {j, 1, neuro}], {l, 1, 50000}];         Table[Y[[l]] = Table[y[[j]][[l]], {j, 1, neuro}], {l, 1, 50000}];      Note that the i*neuro*4 thing is in order to take a little less of all the data i have I've also been able to make plots of each evolution step, as shown here:                POW = Table[        ListPlot[Transpose[{X[[l]], Y[[l]]}], PlotRange -> All], {l, 1,          50000}];      This allows me to have the single frames of the animation, but yet, I haven't been able to combine them into an animation. Moreover, I was looking for having the points connected by a line in the animation itself, so that, if I'd start increasing the numbers of neuro, it wouldn't be a mess to understand what's going on... Many thanks in advance.
