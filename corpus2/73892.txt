This article about application architecture design mentions "User Process Components" as part of the presentation layer. > **User process components**. Your user process components help synchronize > and orchestrate user interactions. This way the process flow and state > management logic is not hard-coded in the user interface elements > themselves, and the same basic user interaction patterns can be reused by > multiple user interfaces. It looks like this is a standard term, but I have never heard of it so far. Can you provide a more precide definition or examples of UPCs which illustrate the definition above? **EDIT** : what's puzzling me particularly is the phrase _"help synchronize and orchestrate user interactions"_. Can you provide an explanation of what could be meant? Can you give an example of a problem that is solved using UPCs?
