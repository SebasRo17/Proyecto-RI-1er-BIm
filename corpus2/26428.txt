I'm trying to solve a heuristic search in Mathematica 9. I get a list of succesor nodes called open with two nodes and a heuristic value, e.g.,               open={{node1,node2,H1},...,{node2,node1,Hi},...,{noden,noden,Hn}}      I need to select only when the two firts elements are the same (no matter order) but where the heuristic is lower. Following the code that I used for sort the elements by the first item               Sort[open, #1[[1]] < #2[[1]] &]      I try to select cases when the same first and second numbers and the heuristic value where lower:               Select[open, #1[[1]]==#2[[1]] &&  #1[[2]] == #2[[2]] && #1[[3]]< #2[[3]] &]      But, returns `{}`... My list               open = {{1, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 5}, {1, 2, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {4, 3, 2}};      Between `{1, 2, 3}`, `{1, 2, 2}`, and `{2, 1, 5}` then choose `{1, 2, 2}` that has the lower heuristic. And, between `{3, 4, 5}` and `{4, 3, 2}` then `{4, 3, 2}`...               {{1, 2, 2},{4, 3, 2}}      Thanks,
