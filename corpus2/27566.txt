I have six square matrices of the same dimensions in a list, for example:               n = 4; (*Matrix dimension*)     cubedata = Table[ConstantArray[i, {n, n}], {i, 1, 6}] (*Matrices 1 to 6*)      I would like to make a visualization of the cube that is formed when you put said matrices as its faces. This should be the orientation of the faces. ![This should be the orientation of the faces](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6j2A.png) I want to see the numbers and, if possible, the cube colored (like a Rubik's cube). I don't even know where to start. I think I should use `Graphics3D` but I'm not familiar with it, at all. I would greatly appreciate it if you could help me.
