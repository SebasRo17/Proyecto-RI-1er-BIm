Just to report: I try to reproduce the very first example for the `Dataset` from the Documentation Center:                   dataset = Dataset[{        <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> "x", "c" -> {1}|>,        <|"a" -> 2, "b" -> "y", "c" -> {2, 3}|>,        <|"a" -> 3, "b" -> "z", "c" -> {3}|>,        <|"a" -> 4, "b" -> "x", "c" -> {4, 5}|>,        <|"a" -> 5, "b" -> "y", "c" -> {5, 6, 7}|>,        <|"a" -> 6, "b" -> "z", "c" -> {}|>}]      The message error reads: An unknown box name (TypeSystem`TypeMap) was sent as the BoxForm for the expression. Check the format rules for the expression.
