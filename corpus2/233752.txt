After three phone interviews, I got this offer in a large bank as a Java programmer. I have no prior experience in financial institutions (only two years as a regular Java dev), so I'm a little bit scared and concerned about whether my skills are right for this role. The main thing that bothers me is math. During all of those interviews we never touched the topic of mathematics, but I know that this position is related to financial instruments like derivatives. How much math should I expect on the assumption that no trading is involved, but rather, accounting? How can I prepare better for this job? I was searching Google for some Java financial programming tutorials/books but no luck here - maybe you can recommend something? I'm really interested in the stock market but never tried this theoretical approach. Thanks!
