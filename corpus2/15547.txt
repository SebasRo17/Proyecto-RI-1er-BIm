I am trying to produce a better distribution from a dataset that is bounded to be greater than 0. Here is an example distribution from the documentation that mimics the behavior of the actual dataset:               data = RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[2], 10^4];     dist = SmoothKernelDistribution[data];     \[ScriptCapitalD] = TruncatedDistribution[{0, Infinity}, dist];     Plot[Evaluate@PDF[\[ScriptCapitalD], x], {x, -1, 5}, PlotRange -> All,       Filling -> Axis]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/emHon.png) As you can see, the peak of the SmoothKernelDistribution is not at 0, but at some value slightly greater than zero. The more points there are in the dataset, the closer the peak is to zero, as there will be a point in the dataset that is closer and closer to zero with more points. In the real dataset, I don't have the liberty of drawing more points, but I do know that the real dataset is restricted to be > 0. Using the standard histogram, the peak will be 0 given a large enough bin size, which I guess can be achieved in SmoothKernelDistribution by increasing the kernel width, but as far as I can tell SmoothKernelDistribution does not automatically set this width to avoid the above behavior. My question is: How do I generate a SmoothKernelDistribution which mimics the behavior of the underlying distribution?
