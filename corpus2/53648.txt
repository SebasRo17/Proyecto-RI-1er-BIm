If I were to begin managing a team of programmers (which I'm not, I'm just asking out of curiosity) what are some of the office / team policies you have seen that are either particularly conducive or particularly prohibitive to productivity and teamwork? Some of the well known bad ones include regular overtime, micromanagement, not having admin rights, very strict hours, and endless meeting requirements. What else is there to avoid, and what interesting policies have you seen that do wonders for a team?
