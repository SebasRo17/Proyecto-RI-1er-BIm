I want to express the below events in an activity diagram:   * An alternative flow, such as "at step x of basic flow, user clicks cancel instead of ok".   * An alternative entry to the use case, such as "instead of click the bold button, use can press Ctrl-B".   * An error, such as "when user clicks save, the system is unable to save the file to disk." How can I do these? Thank you.
