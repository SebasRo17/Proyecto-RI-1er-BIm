Assume we have the following Tensor objects: \begin{equation} F_{i}{}^{j}\;and\;S_{ij}{}^{k}, \end{equation} where the components of $F$ are known, and we would like to solve for the components of $S$ if they satisfy the following equation \begin{equation} F^{l}{}_{i}S_{jl}{}^{k}-F^{l}{}_{j}S_{il}{}^{k}=0. \end{equation} $l$ is summed over, all the indices run from 1 to 4, and $S$ is symmetric in the lower indices. Can you please help in writing a Mathematica code for this. My attempt: First, suppose we know all the components of $F$, and they are given by \begin{equation} F= \begin{matrix} a & b & c & d\\\ e & f & g & h \\\ i & j & k & l \\\ m & n & o & p \end{matrix} \end{equation} Then I defined the components of $S$ by:               S[i_, j_, k_] := S[i, j, k]      The first term of the equation I defined it as:               SF[i_, j_, k_] := SF[i, j, k] = S[1, i, j].F[k, 1] +                                     V[2, i, j].F[k, 2] +                                      V[3, i, j].F[k, 3] +                                      V[4, i, j].F[k, 4];      As for the second term in the equation, I think it can be found using Transpose               FS[i, j, k] = Transpose[SF, {i, k}]      Then for example:               Solve[SF==FS,{S[i,j,k]},{i,4},{j,4},{k,4}]      is not working. I'm sure there is something wrong in my commands, but I can't figure out what it is. The functions $a$,$b$,$c$,... in the expression of $F$ are some complicated scalar functions of space coordinates.
