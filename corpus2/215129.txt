I have doubts in JVisual VM profiler tool related to performance. I have requirement to implement a JVM Monitoring tool for my enterpise java application. I have gone through some profiling tools in market but all them are having some kind of agent file which we need include in server startup. I have a fear that these client agent will degrade my application performance will more. So I have decided to JVisual VM because this profiler tool comes with JDK itself but before implementing JVisualVM, does anybody faces any issues with JVisualVM profiler tool? As well as, is this safe if I implement in application?
