I am trying to solve a outdated quiz problem.   I am tasked to find the smallest and largest contiguous sequence of repeating numbers in a larger sequence.   e.g.               {1,3,6,17,19,3,6,5,4,2,5,6,17,19,3,6,7,5,78,100,101}      For the sequence above, the smallest (non-zero element sequence) and largest non extensible sub sequence would be `smallest - 3,6` and `largest - 6,17,19,3,6`   Could not get started with an algorithm. Any help to get me started would be much appreciated.
