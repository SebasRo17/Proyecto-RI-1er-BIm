I have the following data representing the normal displacement caused by a normal load applied at the middle cross section of a cylinder: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QZEzP.png) I've made the data available here. I am trying to fit using the function: $$ w=\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{i}\cdot sin(j\theta)+B_{i}\cdot cos(j\theta) $$ where $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ are the unknown amplitudes to be found. I am using `LeastSquares` for this task:               theta = data[[All, 1]];     w = data[[All, 2]];          num = Dimensions[theta][[1]];     n = 5;          m = Table[        Flatten[Table[{Sin[i1*theta[[i2]]], 0}, {i1, 1, n}]] +          Flatten[Table[{0, Cos[i1*theta[[i2]]]}, {i1, 1, n}]], {i2, 1,          num}];     x = LeastSquares[m, w];          f[t_] := Total[Flatten[Table[{Sin[i*t], Cos[i*t]}, {i, 1, n}]].x]     Plot[f[t], {t, -Pi, Pi}, PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {0, 0.030}}]      But it is resulting in an empty graphic: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ULsc8.png) Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?
