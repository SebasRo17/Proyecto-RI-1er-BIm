I work in c++ mostly as a hobby (I'm still in school and therefor don't have a real job). The IDEs generate the makefile for me and so I'm wondering if it's worth learning how to make them myself. By "worth learning" I mean, should I drop everything and learn how to write them before continuing to learn c++? Is learning them going to be really necessary? If so, should I learn about them (general syntax and understanding how they work etc.) or really learn how to write them?
