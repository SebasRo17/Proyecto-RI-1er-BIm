In a new project, a friend had to write tests where the time required to write them was calculated by an Excel macro written by his non-developer manager. In such circumstances, should a developer accept the responsibility to write and run the tests in the calculated time? Are the results of these test trustworthy? For information, my friend refused to be responsible for estimations he didn't made, ask succeed to work on another project, and have been replaced by an inexperienced out-of-the-school yes-guy.
