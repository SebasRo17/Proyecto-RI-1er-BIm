I have an expression that Mathematica decides to return in the general form:               y =  f ( a/f + b/Sqrt[f + 2] + c*f^2/Sqrt[f + 2])      (actually my expression is much longer and the coefficients `a`, `b`, `c` are more complicated). Ultimately I want to set `f` to zero, however if I do it using `y /. f -> 0` Mathematica returns `Indeterminate`. Obviously from the form of the equation this is incorrect, since `y` is well defined in this case. Use of functions such as `Limit`, `Expand` etc are basically out the questions since I'd like to keep the coefficients `a`, `b`, `c` as they are (and they are too complicated to think of inputing them into a `Hold` function. Is there a way that I can force Mathematica to simply multiply through by `f`, so that I can use `Replace`? Thanks a lot in advance for your help.
