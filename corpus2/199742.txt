I'm currently coding an API for a social network with the Slim Framework. My question is: What are the best practices when there are no rows to return in the json structure? Lets say that this call **/v1/get/movies** returns 2 rows from the table movie names:               [         {"name": "Ghostbusters"},         {"name": "Indiana Jones"}     ]      But, then I call **/v1/get/books** and there are no rows in that table. Should I just return an empty structure?               [     ]      ...or would it be better a message and an error code?               [         "errors": {             "message": "no matches found",             "code": 134         }     ]      Which is a better practice? (the API will be used in iOS and Android apps) Thanks!
