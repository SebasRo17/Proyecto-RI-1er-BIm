I'd want to implement a Real-time chat for my Rails app but I can't really host the server which handles the sockets. I've tried Faye but it needs a server. I've also heard of pusher but it's limited to 20 users at a time on the chat and I can't really be sure they won't be more. I've thought of IRC but I think I can't really embed it into a rails app, maybe it needs sockets... How can I implement a real-time chat without owning a server?
