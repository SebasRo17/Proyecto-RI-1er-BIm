I found a very good link about quaternions in _Mathematica_ , but I don't know how to create a quaternion from a rotation matrix. Can anyone help me, please? ### Update I need this: > A rotation may be converted back to a quaternion through the use of the > following algorithm. The process is performed in the following stages, which > are as follows: > > Calculate the trace of the matrix T from the equation:                 T = 4 - 4x^2  - 4y^2  - 4z^2         = 4( 1 - x^2  - y^2  - z^2 )         = mat[0] + mat[5] + mat[10] + 1      > If the trace of the matrix is greater than zero, then perform an "instant" > calculation.                 S = 0.5 / sqrt(T)       W = 0.25 / S       X = ( mat[9] - mat[6] ) * S       Y = ( mat[2] - mat[8] ) * S       Z = ( mat[4] - mat[1] ) * S      > If the trace of the matrix is less than or equal to zero then identify which > major diagonal element has the greatest value. > > Depending on this value, calculate the following: > > Column 0:                   S  = sqrt( 1.0 + mr[0] - mr[5] - mr[10] ) * 2;         Qx = 0.5 / S;         Qy = (mr[1] + mr[4] ) / S;         Qz = (mr[2] + mr[8] ) / S;         Qw = (mr[6] + mr[9] ) / S;      > Column 1:                   S  = sqrt( 1.0 + mr[5] - mr[0] - mr[10] ) * 2;         Qx = (mr[1] + mr[4] ) / S;         Qy = 0.5 / S;         Qz = (mr[6] + mr[9] ) / S;         Qw = (mr[2] + mr[8] ) / S;      > Column 2:                   S  = sqrt( 1.0 + mr[10] - mr[0] - mr[5] ) * 2;         Qx = (mr[2] + mr[8] ) / S;         Qy = (mr[6] + mr[9] ) / S;         Qz = 0.5 / S;         Qw = (mr[1] + mr[4] ) / S;      > The quaternion is then defined as:                  Q = | Qx Qy Qz Qw |
