I have created a grid, and also made a list of control objects(e.g., input fields, buttons, etc.). Then, I lay the list in my grid. There is no problem. However, the final layout takes a lot of time. I timed each operation and realized that the final grid layout is the one that takes up a huge chunk of time. Is there a better way of controlling the execution time of the graphics grid.               mygrid = ConstantArray["", {100, 100}];     mybutton1 = Button["Example", ImageSize -> {40, 50}];      myinput2 = InputField[x];      updatedlist = {};      updatedlist = ReplacePart[mygrid, {1, 2} -> mybutton1];      updatedlist = ReplacePart[updatedlist, {2, 3} -> myinput2];      Panel[GraphicsGrid[updatedlist, ImageSize -> {30, 40}, ContentSelectable -> True]]      ![Screen Layout](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cB2aH.png) The above code takes a lot of time to execute. I used the `Timing` function of _Mathematica_ to figure out which part took the long time to execute and it was the               Panel[GraphicsGrid[updatedlist, ImageSize -> {30, 40}, ContentSelectable -> True]]      part that was the longest. Because of this, my entire application has slowed down. Based on the comments in _Mathematica_ , I tried to use a `Grid` for the `updatedlist` above, but the problem is, how can I set the `ImageSize` of the Grid which is an option for the `GraphicsGrid` and not `Grid`? One could use scaled `ItemSize` and wrap the `Grid` in a `Pane` that has a fixed imagesize eg. `Pane[Grid[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, ItemSize -> Scaled[0.5]], ImageSize -> 200]`. But the problem with `Grid` is that `Scaled` option for `ItemSize` does not work for all times. And another problem is the size of the `Grid` is not a constant value because of the individual `ItemSize`. However my application demands that the `Grid` be a constant. Also, I tried to do something like this:               li=ConstantArray["",{5,20}];     b1=Button["Click",Null,ImageSize->{250,60}];     b2=Button["Click",Null,ImageSize->{400,80}];     b3=Button["Click",Null,ImageSize->{250,90}];     b4=Button["Click",Null,ImageSize->{100,90}];     li=ReplacePart[li,{1,2}->b1];     li=ReplacePart[li,{4,2}->b2];     li=ReplacePart[li,{5,2}->b3];     li=ReplacePart[li,{5,3}->b4];     li[[1,3;;6]]=SpanFromLeft;     li=ReplacePart[li,{4,3}->SpanFromLeft];     li=ReplacePart[li,{4,4}->SpanFromLeft];     li=ReplacePart[li,{4,5}->SpanFromLeft];     li=ReplacePart[li,{4,6}->SpanFromLeft];     Grid[li,Frame->All, ItemSize->Full]      The output was something like this: ![Second](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FX1F5.png) I want to be able to accurately place the control objects without messing the sizes and have perfect predictable appearance on the front end. Anyone knows how to make my code better and the interactive application look better?
