I would like to make a nice 3D graphic of a parabolic bowl, with a cylindrical rim. If I do the following:               Plot3D[x^2 + y^2, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]      I get a paraboloid, but the box is rectangular, so the edges come to points. I want a cylindrical bounding box. The best I've come up with is this:               Plot3D[Piecewise[{{x^2 + y^2, x^2 + y^2 < 1}}], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]      This creates a bowl, but there is also a "floor" to the graphic that I would like to get rid of. I might be able to play games with the coloring, but that seems like a poor hack. Does anyone have any suggestions? More generally, is it possible to create a 3D bounding box of arbitrary shape?
