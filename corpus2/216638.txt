I'm looking for a data structure for working with a set of data which is most efficient to do the following :   1. Check whether an item has been categorized or not. (The categorized and uncategorized set are disjoint sets).   2. Get the category of an item.   3. Get all the items in a particular category.   4. Get all the uncategorized items.   5. Remove a particular item from the data set. I was thinking of having a `Dictionary<String, Set<String>>` to hold all the items in a given category, but that doesn't solve 2.
