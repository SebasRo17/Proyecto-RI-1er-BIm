While writing a Perl statement like `if ( $foo >= X && $foo <= Y )` yet again, I wondered why many programming languages do not support the more comfortable form `if ( X <= $foo <= Y )` and what this is called. I came up with "3-legged comparison" but no results when searching for it. By the way there is also the "element-of-set" form `if ( $foo in X..Y )` which I only consider more readable when provided via a short keyword. Is there a term for `X <= $foo <= Y` comparison? Which languages support it?
