Here is a beginner's question: when creating plots with mathematica, I want the grid lines to be at multiples of a constant value. E.g. in the following plot, the vertical grid lines are at multiple of 2 $\pi$. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vq3Fu.png) This is the corresponding Mathematica code:               Manipulate[      Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, n*2*\[Pi]},        GridLines -> {2*\[Pi]*# & /@ Range[n], None},        GridLinesStyle -> Dashed], {n, 1, 50, 1}]      Since equidistant grid lines are very common, I wonder if there is an easier way than to use such complicated expressions like `2*\[Pi]*# & /@ Range[n]` to generate equidistant grid lines. Does Mathematica provide anything simpler?
