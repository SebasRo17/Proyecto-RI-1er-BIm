I'm two months away from getting my degree in systems engineering, which is to say, I learned how to code and code well using managed languages. The only reason I got into this career was because I wanted to create video games. I know now that with my current skillset, I won't be able to create some of the things I have in my head. Would getting a second degree in pure mathematics would help me with this goal?
