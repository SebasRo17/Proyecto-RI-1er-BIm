I have a situation, when I'm working on a project, but at same time small issues arise which require quick fix. I would like to push just the fixes for these problems to the main repo while keeping the rest locally. Problem is that, as I've already found out, it's not possible to cherry pick changsets when pushing from my repository upwards. So the question is, how to set up my Hg environment to have such a possibility. I want to preserve all the Hg metadata, so sending patches around is not a option. BTW, if the whole thing can be managed directly from MercurialEclipse, that would be a big plus.
