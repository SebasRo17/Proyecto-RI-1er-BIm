I'm about to branch out into taking on some contracts on the side. What would be some good questions to ask of a potential client during a first meeting? I've thought of a few things that seem pretty obvious:   * What is the project?   * What are the deadlines?   * What's the budget?   * What/how do they want me to deliver the completed work?  Is that it, or are there any tricky things to watch out for?
