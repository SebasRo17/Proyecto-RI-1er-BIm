Recently, Wolfram informed me that there's no way to have a Print button in a CDF running within a plugin environment since the plugin does not interact with the operating system. If you have a way to solve that, it would be great! But now more importantly, since there are such significant differences between the 2 environments, including the security sandbox, is there any way to detect programmaticly in which environment the CDF is being displayed, so that one could adjust what is being displayed to the user, and what is not? Thanks in advance for your help!
