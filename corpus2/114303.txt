I believe I have a very good understanding of programming logic fundamentals (passing around variables, nested conditional statements, etc). I am currently going through a book on ASP.NET and am pretty much lost on all the Page Rendering Model, Custom Rendered Controls, Composite Controls, etc. I understand how to use the standard controls no problem. Do I really need to understand all those other things to become a junior developer? Any advice is appreciated!
