I've been writing in Java and C# for a while, but I'm having a hard time identifying places where using a custom annotation would be advantageous. I can see that JUnit uses annotations in test classes to identify the order it should run the methods in the test classes, which obviates the need for a configuration of some sort. What are other examples of problems that annotations solve elegantly?
