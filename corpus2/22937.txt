I would like to replace the expresion $(n1-1)$ to $z1$ in following:               In[1] := 2*n1*p[n1-1,n2]          Out[1] := 2*(z1+1)*p[z1,n2]      I have tried `Replace`, `ReplaceAll`, `/.`, `//.` but nothing seems to be working. Only part inside $p[n1-1, n2]$ is replaced. Can anyone help me with this?
