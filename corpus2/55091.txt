In the front end of _Mathematica_ version 10, a new feature was implemented which dims output cells that no longer correspond to its input cells. So when you type               1 + 1     (* 2 *)      and go into the input and add another `+1`, the `2` is slightly gray to indicate that `1+1+1` is not `2`. `SparseArray` seem to be always grey, as if they are never up-to-date > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yckik.png) The same is true for `InterpolatingFunction` but not for `CompiledFunction`. > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DdgBY.png) Any clues why this is?
