I'm bothering about a naming problem. Given that I got an interface which got named Extension, and there will be lots of implementations, like Radio extension, video extension, music extension, etc. First I have them all named with same suffix, "ext", e.g., RadioExt, VideoExt, etc. Moment later I realized the suffix was redundant since they all realized the same single interface Extension, and I should describe them in more literal manner. So I removed all suffixes. However, there was debate among my colleagues, some argued that suffix was more clear and more readable. Actually, I think it's right at some extent. So I'm confused which naming is better. Any opinions? **UPDATE**   I'm targeting Android and iOS. As what you guys said, language support would be preferable. The fact that obj-c doesn't support namespace is really a pain. Furthermore, looks like prefixes in iOS programming is more official way to solve name collision, I'd have to apply this guide anyway for trying keeping consistent for all my ports.
