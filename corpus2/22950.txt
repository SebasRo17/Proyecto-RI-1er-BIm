The first line gets a single sample path for an M/M/1 queue for time between 0 and 100. No problem, I can plot it, etc.               td = RandomFunction[QueueingProcess[9, 10], {0, 100}, 1];      Next, I want to look at the sample path of the process between time 10 and 50, so I do               subset = td["Part", 1, {10, 50}];      and MMA crashes on me. Ver 9.0.1.0 on windows 7 64 bit. Any suggestions?
