I've got substantial J2EE experience, have worked with Grails, and am comfortable with several languages (Perl, PHP, Smalltalk). I've decided to try a new project using Ruby on Rails. For those who've decided to migrate to a new technology stack, how do you make the transition? Do you learn the details of Ruby first (I've done a few tutorials, and feel like I've got a decent enough grasp of the language to start doing some basic work) or do you do a full Ruby on Rails tutorial, and expand your knowledge from there. I'm leaning towards the latter approach because I feel like I can delve into details of the language as I encounter them. For those who work in Ruby on Rails, how did you learn, and which resources do you recommend?
