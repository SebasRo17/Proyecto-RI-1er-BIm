The data is uploaded to Ideone http://ideone.com/ktIbVk , my code is :               data = ReadList["-10dBm.txt", {Number, Number}];     model = a/((b - f)/c)^2 + d;     result = NonlinearModelFit[data, model, {a, b, c, {d, 0}}, f];     result1 = result["ParameterTable"];     fitplot1 = plot[result[f], {f, 4.124, 4.133}];      the error is :               NonlinearModelFit::cvmit:     Failed to converge to the requested accuracy or precision within 100 iterations      Any ideas?
