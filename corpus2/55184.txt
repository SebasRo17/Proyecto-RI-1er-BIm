Hypocycloids are curves generated by following a fixed point on a smaller circle rolling around the inside of a larger circle. The following code is from the recent book of P. Wellin (with modified `PlotRange` by myself).               HypocycloidPlot[R_, r_, θ_] :=       Module[{Hypocycloid, center},        Hypocycloid[{a_, b_},          t_] := {(a - b) Cos[t] + b Cos[t (a - b)/b], (a - b) Sin[t] -           b Sin[t (a - b)/b]};        center[{a_, b_}, t_] := (a - b) {Cos[t], Sin[t]};        Show[{ParametricPlot[Hypocycloid[{R, r}, t], {t, 0, θ},           Axes -> None, PlotStyle -> Red],          Graphics[{{Blue, Thick, Circle[{0, 0}, R]},            Circle[center[{R, r}, θ]], {Thick,             Line[{center[{R, r}, θ], Hypocycloid[{R, r}, θ]}]}, {Orange,             PointSize[0.02], Point[center[{R, r}, θ]]}, {Red,             PointSize[0.03], Point[Hypocycloid[{R, r}, θ]]}}]},         PlotRange -> 1.5 (R + r), GridLines -> Automatic]]      For instance,               Table[HypocycloidPlot[R, 1,         θ], {R, {3, 7/2, Sqrt[7/2]}}, {θ, {Pi/3, 3 Pi/2, 2 Pi,          3 Pi}}] // TableForm      produces the following ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MrnpI.jpg) (It can be verified that the curve only "closes up" when the ratio R/r is an integer or a rational number.) My first question. If we set `R = 3` and `r = 2`, for example, the inner circle loses the contact with the outer circle. (The author does not pose any restricition to r.) I think the problem arises due to the fixed center of the outer circle               Circle[{0, 0}, R]      Am I correct or am I missing something? And if I am indeed correct, how should the code be modified in order to circumvent the issue? My second question. Suppose that I have the following               Manipulate[      HypocycloidPlot[R, r, θ], {θ, 0.01,        2 π Denominator[(R - r)/r]}, {R, {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5/3, 7/2},        Setter}, {r, Range[5], Setter}]      How can I make videos like the following one? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocycloid **Update** The thread is relating to Plotting an epicycloid There my second answer about animation is answered. So, it remains only the first one.
