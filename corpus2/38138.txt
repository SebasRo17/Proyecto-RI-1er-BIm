I have a file I import and read into a table of $2 \times n$. I can plot this data using the following code:               directory = "c:\nameofdirectory";     SetDirectory[directory];     filenames = FileNames[];     readlist = ToString[filenames[[1]]];     table = OpenRead[readlist];     data = ReadList[table, {Number, Number}];     Close[table];          ListPlot[data, Frame -> True, PlotRange -> {All, All}, Joined -> True,        FrameLabel -> {"Voltage (V)", "Current (A)"}];      but the $y$-axis is order of $10^{-6} A$. I'd prefer to have my $y$-data scaled by $10^{-6}$ then label my axis is `microA` instead of `A`. I've tried using `Ticks` but I don't really understand how that works (it never changes my plot at all when I use it). If there's no easy way to do this, can someone tell me how to directly divide my $y$-values from the input? I can separate the $y$-values from "data" and divide them using               xdat = List[];     ydat = List[];     For[j = 1, j < Length[data] + 1, j++,         AppendTo[xdat, data[[j]][[1]]];         AppendTo[ydat, data[[j]][[2]]];        ];          y=ydat/10^-6;      but I don't know how to place them back into the form as before so that it can be easily plotted with `ListPlot`.
