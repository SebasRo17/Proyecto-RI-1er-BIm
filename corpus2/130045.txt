I'm contemplating my future career. I have the idea that from a rank-and-file-programmer position, I can advance either along a management track or along a programming track. I'm really not interested in management, so I'd like to know what kind of opportunities there are to advance as a programmer. What kind of jobs are the logical next steps in the progression?
