If one plots a filled line plot such as, for example, the one produced by               ListLinePlot[{{{0, 0.6}, {0.5, 0.6}}, {{0.5, 0.3}, {1, 0.3}}},          Filling -> Axis, PlotStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[10],         AspectRatio -> Automatic, PlotRange -> {Automatic, {0, 0.8}},         PlotRangePadding -> None]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bUxRT.png) the ends of the plot's lines have a rather noticeable "overhangs" beyond the fill regions below. How can I make this line be flush with the fill?
