For developers with extensive experience using mocks, **is it okay to mock multiple objects in one class (ie satisfy multiple interfaces) or is this not recommended?** I am wondering because mocks are stubs anyway, from a testing perspective, it doesn't seem to make a big difference if I consolidate mocks. However, I do wonder if there are negative impacts from a maintenance/clarity POV.
