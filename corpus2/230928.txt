Why does the operator `--` not exist for bool whereas it does for operator `++`? I tried in C++, and I do not know if my question apply to another language. I will glad to know also. I know, I can use the operator `++` with a bool. It makes any bool equal to true.               bool b = false;     b++;     // Now b == true.      Why can't we use the operator `--` in an opposite way?               bool b = true;     b--;     // Now b == false;      It is not very useful, but I am curious.
