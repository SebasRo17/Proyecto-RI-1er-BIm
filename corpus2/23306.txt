I am trying to perform a simple arithmetic in complex algebra.                      a := Subscript[a, 1] + I*Subscript[a, 2];            b := Subscript[b, 1] + I*Subscript[b, 2];            r[z_] := a/(b - z) + a\[Conjugate]/(b\[Conjugate] - z);      when I try to evaluate r[0], mathematica gives me the following message                      $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 256 exceeded.      I was expecting something like the following                      2*Re[a/b] = 2 (a_1 * b_1 + a_2 * b_2)/(b_1 ^2 + b_2 ^2)      Could someone please point out where I did mess up?
