I have a web application developed using Spring and Hibernate, which uses a REST API and Javascript to display and update content. The project is nearly completed, but I want to enhance the look and feel. This will include better graphics and some extra behaviour. I want to outsource this task to a freelancer over the Internet. I don't have experience with outsourcing and don't know how to incorporate an outsider to the project. I mean I'd like to avoid other people to access the back-end source if I can. The only code that i want to be changed runs on the client side. Is this doable? I thought I can just give the URL to the designer and require them to use "Augmented Browsing" tools, like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey to work on the UI. Is this something Web designers are accustomed to or willing to do? Or are there any better options to accomplish this? **EDIT** : A basic requirement: There are items on a list which are generated on-the-fly according to JSON data, using handlebars templates. I want these items to be removable, like when the mouse is over these items a button should appear. I also want those items to look better. This will require some Javascript, HTML and CSS integrated into existing code.
