Say I have this code:               Design     {         public function load()         {             $this->loadProduct();             $this->loadService();             ...         }              public function loadProduct()         {             try             {                 $this->product = new Product();                 $this->product->spec = $this->product->loadSpecs($this->a, $this->b, $this->c);             }             catch (\BadFunctionCallException $e)             {                 $this->error = true;                 $this->emsg = $e->getMessage();             }         }     }      Questions:   1. Do I test `loadProduct` function only?   2. Do I test `Product` class only?   3. Do I move `loadProduct`'s code into `load` (thereby removing `loadProduct` function from existence, and test the larger `load` function (as part of `Design` class)? Say I may want to do this as part of clean up/reorganization of legacy code.   4. Something else?
