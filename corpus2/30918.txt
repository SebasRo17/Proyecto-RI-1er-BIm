When I' m testing on this post' s method I found some problems.               Export["test.html", nb = EvaluationNotebook[], "HTML",           "ConversionRules" -> {"Input" -> {"<pre><code>", DisplayForm[#] &, "/code>/pre>"}},         CharacterEncoding -> "CP936", "CSS" -> None]               Export["test.html", nb = EvaluationNotebook[], "HTML",            "ConversionRules" -> {"Input" -> {"<pre><code>", InputForm[#] &, "</code>/pre>"}},            CharacterEncoding -> "CP936", "CSS" -> None]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zgNDj.png) How can I keep the Codes completely the same as that in the Notebook? Are there any easy ways to do that? For example, change the `DisplayFormula[#]&` into something else that I don't know?
