I've been involved in several projects either as tester or developer. In many of projects there were following statuses for defects:   1. WON'T FIX   2. Cancelled Do you use such statuses and how do you differ them? I ask, because most people can't explain the difference. My understanding is: **WON'T FIX** \- developer will not fix the defect, due to it's not a defect;   **Cancelled** \- defect should not be fixed, because of lowest priority
