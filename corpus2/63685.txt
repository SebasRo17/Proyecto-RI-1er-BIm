I'm working on a commercial application that requires .NET 4.0 **Client Profile** , but I need to make a call to `HttpUtility.ParseQueryString`, which is not included in the Client Profile but it is in the normal one. So I just figured out that I can use Reflector to get the whole method and all the other required methods for it to work and add it to my app. This way I won't need to change the requirement from Client Profile to the normal one which is a lot heavier just to call a single method. Would this be illegal? Do I **have** to change the applications target framework just for a single method?
