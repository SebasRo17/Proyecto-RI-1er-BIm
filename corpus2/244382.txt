I'm wondering if there are any general guidelines or best practices regarding when to split data into a metadata format, as oppose to directly embedding it within the data. (Specific example below). My understanding of metadata is that it describes data (without the need to actually look at the data), allowing for data to be quickly search/filtered for easy access. Let's take for example a simple 3D model format. The actual data file is itself a binary file containing vertices and colors. Things like creation date, modified data and author name would be things that describe the binary data, so I would say these belong as metadata (outside of the binary file). But the following questions arise:   * What if the application had no need to search or filter by these fields?    * Would it be acceptable to embed these fields directly into the binary data itself?   * Could they be duplicated in both the binary data and the meta data, or would this be considered bad practice?    * What about more ambiguous fields such as the model name, which could be considered part of the data itself, but also as data describing the binary data?   * How do you decide which data to embed in the actual binary file, as opposed to separating into a more flexible metadata format? Thanks!
