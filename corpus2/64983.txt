I am CS student and have just few months before I graduate. I can write programs, but use pretty many manuals in the process. It's almost 50% writing/50% reading (maybe even more reading). What I want to ask is how much do you need to know a language (technology, method etc.) to say in you CV, that you know it? Thanks in advance. P.S. I feel uneasy to learn just one technology to perfection, because it's limiting my further possibilities.
