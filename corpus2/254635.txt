I am working with VB6 and Microsoft Access 2013 and Windows 8. I am trying to output an access report as a pdf from a VB6 application. I have this code:               Public Sub OpenReport(sReportName As String, frmCallingForm As Form)            Dim objAccess As Access.Application       Dim lResult   As Long              Dim Path As String         Path = Environ$("AppData")                 Set objAccess = New Access.Application            With objAccess         On Error GoTo ErrHndlr         .OpenCurrentDatabase App.Path & "\" & "OrderBackEnd.mdb"         .DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, sReportName, acFormatPDF, Path & "\rpt" & sReportName & ".pdf", False         .Visible = True         On Error GoTo 0         .Quit acQuitSaveNone       End With            Set objAccess = Nothing            lResult = ShellExecute(frmCallingForm.hWnd, "Open", Path & "\rpt" & sReportName & ".pdf", 0&, 0&, 3)          Exit Sub     ErrHndlr:       objAccess.Visible = True       MsgBox Err.Number & ":" & Err.Description          End Sub      The problem is the output gets hung and freezes the system. When I terminate the application I notice the below box in the background of my form. The only way to see the below box is to End Task on the VB6 application. It appears to not be associating the acFormatPDF in OutputTo line. Is there any way to resolve this issue or a workaround? If I manually do this process in Access it works fine. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KJCAL.png)
