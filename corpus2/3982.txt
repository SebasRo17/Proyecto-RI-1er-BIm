I'm trying to adapt the following piece to the part where `PowerF` is a function of `amax`.               Z = Max[Z /. Solve[FullSimplify[PowerF, Z ∈ Reals] == P0, Z]]      Now I have modified my code because I want to also make a plot that depends on the parameter `amax`. However the following does not work:               Z[amax_] := Max[Z[amax] /. Solve[FullSimplify[PowerF[amax], Z ∈ Reals] == P0, Z]]      How to fix this?
