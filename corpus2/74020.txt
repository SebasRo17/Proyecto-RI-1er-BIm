What was the single point of failure encountered when your company decided to replace the current processes with SCRUM? Can you give me some examples of things that have gone really wrong when a company tried to introduce SCRUM? I'd like to hear your anecdotes, something you experienced yourself, the big _fail_ that you saw coming but couldn't prevent. I hear a lot of concern about **missing documentation on decisions** about the implementation details, and about **story sizes** and **detail level** of the stories.
