There are two ways to consider a two-dimensional torus. One way is to take a parallelogram (let's say the square $[0, 1]^2$) and topologically glue the opposite edges. Another way is to look at the surface of a doughnut with one hole. I would like to draw the zero set of a doubly-periodic function as a contour on a torus. Here is how I do it when viewing the torus as a square: ![Contour on torus](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NDBZZ.png) However, I'd really like to see a contour on the surface of a doughnut. How can this be done? (Generally, I'd like to transplant the square $[0, 1]^2$ of any graphic onto the surface of a doughnut.)
