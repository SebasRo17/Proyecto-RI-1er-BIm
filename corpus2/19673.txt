I'm a fairly new convert to Emacs and I really love it as an editor, primarily because I keep finding new and super-useful commands. Are there any other programmer 'must known' commands missing from my list?               M-x replace-string     - Find and replace a given string.     M-x goto-line          - Goto a specific line     M-x column-number-mode - Show the current column number in text bar
