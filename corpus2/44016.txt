I've written an interplanetary trajectory solver/plotter that plots the path taken by a spacecraft on an Earth-Mars mission, but have run into a little trouble when the spacecraft actually reaches Mars. I'm hoping to be able to get the spacecraft into an orbit around Mars upon arrival, but before I can do that I need to find its closest approach in order to apply the correct delta-v at the right time (using the wonders of NDSolve's WhenEvent function). The trajectory plot relies on the output of an interpolating function from NDSolve, and it is this interpolating function that I am trying to work with. So far I know when the closest approach occurs to within a day, and it is between days 254 and 255 of the trip. I have put the Heliocentric x-y positions of Mars and the spacecraft (between days 254 and 255) into separate tables using the following:               MarsPosition = Table[{x[2][t], y[2][t]} /. Soln, {t, 254*86400, 255*86400, 86400/100}]      SpaceCraftPosition = Table[{x[3][t], y[3][t]} /. Soln, {t, 254*86400, 255*86400, 86400/100}]      And have then calculated their relative x-y positions using the following:               dxy = Sqrt[(MarsPosition - SpaceCraftPosition)^2]      But I am now trying to calculate the minimum approach radius (i.e. combining the x-y positions into a magnitude) from the above bits of code. My futile attempt of trying               dr = Min[Sqrt[dxy[1]^2 + dxy[2]^2]]      and other similar attempts have unfortunately ended in failure. Some sample output looks like this:                 dxy = {{{2.00946*10^8, 9.69241*10^7}}, {{2.03432*10^8,             9.83663*10^7}}, {{2.05917*10^8, 9.98081*10^7}},...}      Where, for example, the first entry shows the x and y relative position as `{2.00946*10^8, 9.69241*10^7}` and I'm trying to combine those two components into a radius. Combining the x-y position pairs into a radius using `Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]` for the first 3 position pairs given above I would get                dr = {{2.231*10^8},{2.25965*10^8},{2.2883*10^8},...}      But this was done manually for each entry and is not practical for hundreds of entries. From this list of radius positions, I can then use `Min[]` to find the closes approach point for the spacecraft relative to Mars. As can be seen below, the spacecraft gets very close to Mars (where the inner semi-circle is Earth's orbit, the outer semi-circle is Mars' orbit and the line joining the two is the spacecraft's trajectory):![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cLVN7.png) And if propagated further we can see that it gets close enough for Mars' gravity to affect its trajectory:![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MFvR3.png) So it looks pretty close, but exactly how close it what I'm hoping to find out. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
