I'm creating a project and I'm having difficulty and contrasting opinions on how to do things when it comes down to separating layers. I'm not fully sure what layers should reference each other. I have read in certain blogs/posts that the flow should be   * the view references the business layer   * the business layer references the data layer   * the data layer only knows about it self On the other hand I have also seen the following   * the view references the business layer   * the business layer knows only about itself   * the data layer references the business layer Using the second method I have been using the business layer using IOC but im reluctant to progress without more knowledge. I have read a number of posts but the answers seem many and varied. Any clarification would be great. Thanks
