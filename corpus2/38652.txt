I want to see how a hyperboloid of revolution is generated by its generatrix, _i.e._ by rotating one (say the one passing point $(1,0,0)$ and $(0,1,1)$) of the skew lines around another (say the _z_ axis). My trial:               Manipulate[               Show[                    ParametricPlot3D[{Sqrt[t^2 + (t + 1)^2] Cos@\[Theta],                     Sqrt[t^2 + (t + 1)^2] Sin@\[Theta], 1 + t}, {t, -1, 1}, {\[Theta],                   0, \[Beta]}, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1},                    PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}, {0, 2}}],                     ParametricPlot3D[{1 - t, 1 + t, 1 + t}, {t, -1, 1}]], {\[Beta], 0.1,              2 \[Pi]}]      However, the generatrix $(1 - t, 1 + t, 1 + t)$ doesn't match the hyperboloid. So how can I do it correctly?
