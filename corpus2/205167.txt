When a software project wants to use Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License that denies making derivatives, does it conflict GitHub terms of service clause F.1 that says: > By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow > others to view and fork your repositories. Eg. is forking (allowed by GitHub) the same as making derivatives (denied by CC). A fork has an owner, has its own download links, has separate history from the original repo etc. and any other feature you might expect from a "derivative". I know that using CC for a software project is not the brightest idea but some are still doing this and I wonder if it is even allowed by the GitHub terms. IANAL is OK, I just want to see some opinions about it
