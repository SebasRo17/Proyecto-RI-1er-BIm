Question1: Get the list of pairs of the form {language,number of words in dictionary}. Call this list langlength What I did was this:               langlength =        {{Arabic, Length[DictionaryLookup[{"Arabic", All}]]},         {BrazilianPortuguese, Length[DictionaryLookup[{"BrazilianPortuguese", All}]]},         {Breton, Length[DictionaryLookup[{"Breton", All}]]},......}      And so on. What's a shorter way of doing this? * * * Question2: Look at all the words contained in all the dictionaries. What are the ones of maximum length? I had:               Max[StringLength[lang]]      But that's not working and not sure what's missing. Please help me with either or both questions. * * * I set lang = DictionaryLookup[All]
