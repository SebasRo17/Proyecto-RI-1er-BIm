I'm planning the creation of a webapp with a dedicated mobile web interface and a dedicated desktop/tablet interface. I am considering ASP.NET MVC, but it is clear to me that MVC is for separation of concerns as explained here, anyway in my case i'd like to minimize the code and to support elegantly phones and desktop (may be landscape tablet can be "desktop" too). So is MVC a wise choice in this case or which is the 1st stop for this kind of xdevice web app?
