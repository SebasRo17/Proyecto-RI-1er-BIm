I want to get the following expression from mathematica to latex: \begin{bmatrix} E_{\parallel} \\\ E_{\perp} \end{bmatrix} I have tried to use inbuilt 'symbol' character from the special characters window but get an error: ![error](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aYfwh.png) So I thought maybe I can just type in \parallel and \perp so when I convert it to tex it will be there and work, but I get different errors: ![more erros](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tuzxh.png) Any way to achive what I want? Thanks
