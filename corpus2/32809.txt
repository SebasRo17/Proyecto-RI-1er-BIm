Is it possible to define new graphics directives? For example, suppose I want to be able to use the following code:               Graphics[{ BigPointSize[0.07], SmallPointSize[0.04],                Red, BigPoint[{1,1}], BigPoint[{1,3}], SmallPoint[{3,1}],                Blue, SmallPoint[{2,2}], SmallPoint[{3,2}], BigPoint[{0,0}]             }]      Is there any way to define `BigPointSize`, `SmallPointSize`, `BigPoint`, and `SmallPoint` so that this code will work as intended? Ideally `BigPointSize` and `SmallPointSize` should have all of the functionality of other graphics directives, e.g. scoping inside of lists, and the ability to call the command multiple times within the same list. (Obviously it's possible to draw these points in other ways, but I'm curious whether it's possible to get this _syntax_ to work.) **Edit:** Just to clarify, I would like `BigPointSize` and `SmallPointSize` to work the same way as PointSize and other graphics directives. For example, the code               Graphics[{ BigPointSize[0.1],                { BigPointSize[0.05], BigPoint[{0,0}] },                BigPoint[{1,0}]             }]      should produce one point of size `0.05` and one point of size `0.1`.
