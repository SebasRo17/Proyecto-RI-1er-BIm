I'm working on 300K line C/C++ Windows application that is spread across 23 different Eclipse projects (approximately one third for Qt interface, one third for DLLs and one third for static libraries). I have complained to the project manager that it's cumbersome to work with so many different projects for one single piece of software. For example, if I change one thing at a static library, I will probably have to recompile at least 5 other projects. Am I right to complain or is this how most similar projects are managed? Is there any reference on how it should be done?
