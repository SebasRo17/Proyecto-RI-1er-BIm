I'm trying to draw a `VectorPlot` of a function that admittedly probably is not very well suited for such a plot. But at the moment I just get a white sheet and I would expect something more than that. Some definitions:               G = 6.67 10^-11;     Subscript[m, sun] = 1.988425 10^30;      Subscript[m, 1] = 0.1 Subscript[m, sun]; Subscript[m, 2] = 0.4 Subscript[m, sun];     Subscript[x, 1] = -7 10^5/(Subscript[m, 1]/Subscript[m, 2] + 1);      Subscript[x, 2] = -(Subscript[m, 1]/Subscript[m, 2]) Subscript[x, 1];     ω = {0, 0, Sqrt[G (Subscript[m, 1] + Subscript[m, 2])/Abs[Subscript[x, 1] - Subscript[x, 2]]^3]};      I'm sorry about the amount of subscripts (if there is an easy way to convert them I don't know about it, though `Hold[expr]` will render the subscripts.) Here's the plot:               ϕ[r_] := -(G Subscript[m, 1])/Norm[r - {Subscript[x, 1], 0, 0}] - (G Subscript[m, 2])/Norm[r - {Subscript[x, 2], 0, 0}] - 0.5 (ω\[Cross]r).(ω\[Cross]r)          VectorPlot[Evaluate[-Grad[ϕ[{x, y, 0}], {x, y}]], {x, -10^6, 10^6}, {y, -10^6, 10^6}]      The function has singularities in it so I've considered what's been said in this post and have also been playing with the various options, but haven't been able to get anything other than the blank, white sheet: ![blank](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q30LP.png) In so far that the gradient i orthogonal to level sets, the contour plot can tell us a bit about what kind of arrows we could expect to see. The contour plot: ![contourplot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JwJZ0.png) There is something fishy about the `Grad` which makes me suspect `VetorPlot`, though it does not complain, does not get any values:                   N[Grad[ϕ[{x, y, 0}], {x, y}] /. {x -> 1, y -> 2}]      > `{-193.335 + 2.70673*10^9 Derivative[1][Abs][-139999.] + 4.22919*10^7 > Derivative[1][Abs][560001.], -386.67 + 38818.9 Derivative[1][Abs][2.]}` It leaves a derivative in there.
