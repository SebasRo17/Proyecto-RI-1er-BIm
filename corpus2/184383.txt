Why do I, as a developer, have to go through so much trouble developing PDF download options for my clients when everyone in the world can simply hit Ctrl+P and life is good? The current issue I'm working on is dealing with Google Charts, so I'm not stating that offering PDF downloads in general is relatively difficult. On the contrary, particular cases are more trouble than they seem to be worth. See also: `@media print {}` Update: With a little research, I was able to find a perfectly workable solution. "Just hit Ctrl+P" now sounds like a ridiculous thing to say. Thanks everyone for your input. If you're interested to know what I decided to do, I realized that Google Charts are output as SVG markup and I think I should be able to use TCPDF to render them in a PDF document.
