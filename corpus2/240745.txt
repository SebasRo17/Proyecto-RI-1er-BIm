I'm currently working on a project that the client wants to deliver to different countries. The application is a website. We started out using resource files to change the text the user sees when visiting pages based on their locations. But this isn't enough. In the English version of the site we have a page that states "page x of y". In the Chinese version of the site, it's not enough to do " x y" The syntax for the language doesn't match the placeholders that were created for the English language. The only other option I can think of is to have a completely separate site, serving different content. Are there any other options to solve this issue?
