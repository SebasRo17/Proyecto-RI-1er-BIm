When having a first look at some system, it's often very useful to just play with the parameters and see how it develops. Therefore, I would like to let a certain evaluation run "until I cancel it". Take a nonlinear differential equation for example, say the Duffing oscillator, $\ddot{x} + \delta \dot{x} + \alpha x + \beta x^3 = \gamma \cos (\omega t)$, and try to investigate when the solutions start to become different when you alter the initial condition of the one evaluation by 1/1000. ![Duffing oscillator with a very small bump at t=20.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OIW5Y.png) I'd like to `NDSolve` this system, with the ability to look at the current state while doing so. Note that this was only an example, the answer does not necessarily have to be constrained to `NDSolve`. Another example would be a cellular automaton that one observes until a certain pattern emerges in some region.
