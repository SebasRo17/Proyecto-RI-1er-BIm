I would like to generate sets of replacement rules programatically for predefining some permutations. So a function               MakeRule[cycles_List (* permute cycles *), n_Integer (* rule length *)]`      called as               MakeRule[{{2,3}}, 4]      will generate               {e1_, e2_, e3_, e4_} -> {e1, e3, e2, e4}      For the permutations, I have               Permute[l, Cycles[cycles]]      but I cannot find a way of generating the list of patterns. Something subscripted or indexed would be nice as per the example. I have tried:               1) Pattern[Subscript[e, 1], Blank[]]     2) Pattern[Symbol["e1"], Blank[]]     3) Pattern[e[[1]], Blank[]]      I have a feeling I am missing something obvious. Edit: Apologies for an oversight on my part. The second pattern example works correctly while the first and third do not. Thanks to all who responded.
