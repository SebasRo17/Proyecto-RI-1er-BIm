(I'm specifying this is a desktop application so people wouldn't refer specifically to web implementations of MVC). The title says it all pretty much. In an MVC structure - **can the View _ever_ hold a reference to the Model?** Or should the Controller be used as a 'middleman' for communication between the View and Model - always - and in both directions? If the answer is "no, it can't" - **why?**
