I'm currently trying to find a numerical solution to a differential equation of the form:               D[W[X], {X, 4}] ==(-(1/(delta + G - (G X)/L)^2) + 1/(delta + (G X)/L)^2)      Subject to the boundary conditions:               W[0] == 0, W[L] == 0, W'[0] == 0, W'[L] == 0      NDSolve appears to be choking on a singularity or a stiffness constraint. Any ideas on how I might go about dealing with this? Thanks in advance!
