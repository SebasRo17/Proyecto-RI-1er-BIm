I have the following Mathematica script               #!/global/common/carver/usg/mathematica/8.0/bin/MathematicaScript -script          (* generate high-precision samples of a mixed distribution *)     Print /@ RandomVariate[MixtureDistribution[         {1,2},         {NormalDistribution[1,2/10],          NormalDistribution[3,1/10]}],         10,  WorkingPrecision -> 10]      in the file named test.m. I am running it on the cluster and It works if I run it as math -script test.m. But I'd like to make this script executable. I tried "chmod a+x test.m" but it's not working. I get the error message: command not found after I enter "./test"
