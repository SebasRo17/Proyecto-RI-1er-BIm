Quoted from A Brief Introduction To IL code, CLR, CTS, CLS and JIT In .NET > CLS stands for Common Language Specifications. It is a subset of CTS. CLS is > a set of rules or guidelines which if followed ensures that code written in > one .NET language can be used by another .NET language. For example one rule > is that we cannot have member functions with same name with case difference > only i.e we should not have add() and Add(). This may work in C# because it > is case-sensitive but if try to use that C# code in VB.NET, it is not > possible because VB.NET is not case-sensitive. Based on above text I want to confirm two points here:   1. Does the case-sensitivity of IL is a condition for member functions only, and not for member properties?    2. Is it true that C# wouldn't be inter-operable with VB.NET if it didn't take care of the case sensitivity?
