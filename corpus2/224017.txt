During my short experience with DDD I often find myself in the situation where I wished for some type of lazy loading mechanism to solve some dangerous cases where large nested data sets might be loaded. However after a while I realized that each time, that was the symptom of a poorly designed aggregate root that was taking too much responsibility. Additionally it used to be the case where the aggregates should be fully loaded to perform consistency operations. Getting used to work with Entity ids made things slightly easier. So after a while, I am wondering... is lazy loading a code smell? Is it something just to build non mature models without causing a big problem?
