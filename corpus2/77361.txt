Awhile back I discussed the possibility of moving to a startup that is going to be using Java, more specifically the Play! Framework; well, I'm going to go for it! I have been a .NET guy for a long time now and haven't really been in the Java game except for the occasional Android tinkering or messing around with Scala a little bit. I have looked at the Play! Framework before but only on a cursory level. I think I will be fine with Java as a language, as I've been given great advice before on learning materials. My question, is aside from the very great site for the Play! Framework I haven't found much else out there except a few blogs. Does anyone know of any other good resources for the Play! Framework like books? An Amazon search turned up zero results. I know there is an eBook floating around out there but it seems a little outdated at this point. Anyway, thanks for your input.
