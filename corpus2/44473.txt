I have a program that calls FindDistributionParameters and I get the Mathematica message FindMaximum::eit each time I call the function. The message is FindMaximum::eit: The algorithm does not converge to the tolerance of _4.641588833612792`*^-9_ in _517_ iterations. The best estimated solution, with feasibility residual, KKT residual, or complementary residual of _{8.785431001660695650243387×10-19,7.654089593359381289428268×10-7,3.755486893336661804848494×10-19}_ , is returned.  I want to save the numbers in the messages, so I setup a list to hold the messages as follows: AppendTo[messagelist, {General::eit}]; This saves the following, with none of the numbers in the original message: The algorithm does not converge to the tolerance of `1` in `2` iterations. The best estimated solution, with feasibility residual, KKT residual, or complementary residual of `3`, is returned. How can I access the numbers in the message and save them to a list or something else? Secondarily, is there a way to increase the number of iterations in FindDistributionParameters?
