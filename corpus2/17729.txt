I am programmer who just started working on a startup idea. At the moment I want to bring onboard at least one programmer. This programmer should be a ninja - a 10x engineer. Since early days are probably the most risky for a startup, I want to make sure I approach this problem the best I can. How do I find these people? and How do I convince them to come onboard? I would love to hear from people who started their own companies and what their thoughts are about hiring **Update** : I would like to get the ninja as a co-founder so besides being a ninja (ie. great programmer with computer science background) he/she has to have a healthy appetite for risk (for great programmers this is not a big deal because they can be hired anytime into mainstream jobs if the startup doesn't work)
