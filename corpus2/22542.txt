I want to know in which applications/programming domain are most suitable for Smalltalk. Could anyone please provide me some useful links that could answer my query? Through googling I learned that some companies use it for: logistics and foreign trade application desktop, server and script development data processing and logistics, scripts and presentations but I cant find documents/research papers that can tell me which programming domain Smalltalk-80 (or Smalltalk) is best suited. Some of the programming domains are: - Artificial intelligence reasoning - General purpose applications - Financial time series analysis - Natural language processing - Relational database querying - Application scripting - Internet - Symbolic mathematics - Numerical mathematics - Statistical applications - Text processing - Matrix algorithms I hope you guys can help me. I am doing this for my case study. Thanks in advance.
