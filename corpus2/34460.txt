I would like to ask how to make a 3D plot (maybe using Plot3D) with a logarithmic scale along the y-axis? For example: I have a function, $f(x) = 2(1 + a\,x^4)/x^2$, where $x$ varies from 0 to 20 while $a$ varies from 0 to $10^{-3}$. I am interested in making a 3D plot of $f(x)$ in a low range of $a$ such as from 0 to $10^{-7}$ or 0 to $10^{-5}$. Therefore, I think it might be better to scale the y-axis logarithmically. Any suggestion would be highly appreciated.
