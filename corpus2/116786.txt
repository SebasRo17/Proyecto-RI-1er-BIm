If I was working for a programming language X and want to switch to Y (from Java to C++, or from Java to Objective-c), does this cause my years of experience in the previous languages to be lost (from point of view for companies)? For example, if I was a Senior in X, and want to move to Y, will I start Junior at Y or Senior? I believe that languages are just tools, and the experience is in problem solving and way of thinking, but do companies concern?
