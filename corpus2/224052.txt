I was wondering if there was an SDLC (software development lifecycle) or methodology (Kanban, SCRUM, waterfall, otherwise, etc.) that was particularly well-suited for continuous delivery systems, and why? I'm sure each methodology has pros/cons that make it suited for certain _components_ of CD, but there must be one that incorporates principles/values that make it better geared for CD...
