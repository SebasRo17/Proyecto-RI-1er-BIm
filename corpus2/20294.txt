I have the following equation: $$D=\frac{1}{64} \pi A ^3 B \sin \left(C\right)-\frac{1}{2} \pi A B \sin \left(C\right)$$ which I want to solve for $A$. The equation is cubic in $A$ so this should give me 3 answers and, potentially, imaginary parts to the answers. I know, from the physical meaning of the parameters, that all parameters ($A$,$B$,$C$ and $D$) are positive and real. My question is: how can I use `Solve` on this equation and make sure that there will be no imaginary parts popping up in the solution? I have used the suggestion by Chris and tried:               Solve[d == 1/64 π a^3 b Sin[c] - 1/2 π a b Sin[c], a, Reals]      but I still see that there is a $\imath\sqrt{3}$ term in the answer. Why does this still appear?
