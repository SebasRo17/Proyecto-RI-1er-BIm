`goto` is still a keyword in Java, although it has no use. It was saved as a keyword in the beginning in case it would be decided to add `goto` functionality in the future. My question is: Why would a modern OO programming language even take into account the possibility of including `goto` statements in the language? As I understand `goto` is considered harmful and even primitive. It has no use in modern programming, never seen it in any OO code. Why did the Java creators even consider adding `goto`s to the language?
