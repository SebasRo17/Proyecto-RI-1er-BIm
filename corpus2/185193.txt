I am building a java desktop application where I am attempting to implement MVC. The GUI interface has multiple views (think pop-up windows) from the main view. Each view has its associated model that it receives updates from. I am running into scenarios where **two views** need to access a particular data field from one **model**. This requires that one model "knows about" the another. What are my options to solve this? The data field is a table that is populated in one of the views and is then subsequently accessed in the main splash view. I have tried passing the second model into the first's constructor from the controller, however I feel this is sloppy. Should a model listen to another model (Observer pattern)? Perhaps my question is too subjective....
