I have been with a software services firm for 5 years and have fallen into a "jack of all trades" role, which I am looking to move out of. I've spent about 1 year each in programming (VB/VB.NET), application support, systems analysis, and most recently, software testing, which in my current position is all manual. I've really lost interest in the programming and testing roles; I would prefer a position where I get to work more with _people_ , such as systems analysis. I even got a chance to be a trainer at the same company for a few months, a temporary position which I enjoyed very much. Given that most of my real experience is with software, support, and testing, what knowledge areas and skills should I focus on learning and mastering in order to make myself an attractive candidate for a permanent position as a business/systems analyst?
