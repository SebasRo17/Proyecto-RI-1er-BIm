Given $S \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ I am trying to plot $f(S)$ for given complex valued function $f$ Looking at other answers on this site for similar questions, I came up with this               f = Function[z, 1/Conjugate[z]];          (*Plot limit parameters*)     plimit = 1;     space = 2;     plrange = {{Re[f[-plimit]] - space, Re[f[plimit]] + space},                {Im[f[-plimit]] - space, Im[f[plimit]] + space}}          ParametricPlot[       Evaluate@({Re[f[z]], Im[f[z]]}*Boole[Abs[z] < 1] /. z -> x + I*y),       {x, -plimit, plimit},       {y, -plimit, plimit}, (*Indicates the rectablge from which the points satisfying Boole[..]==1 will be picked.*)       PlotRange -> plrange     ]      The result of this command is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HsgYC.jpg) My question is why are there two different colors in this image? One light and one dark. Is the plot trying to tell me something here? **SYSTEM INFORMATION:** Version 8.0.1.0 Platform Linux x86(32-bit) Ubuntu 11.04
