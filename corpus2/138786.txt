So we're having an internal debate on whether the time restriction that we have in place for our technical test a good thing. I thought I would open it out to the community. So what are your thoughts on this restriction, do people accept it as standard practice or is it an artificial restriction? A little background, for all our positions, we expect candidates to complete a coding exercise and we set a time limit which we think is reasonable to at least layout the design (we don't expect a fully working solution), and it is this time limit which is under debate. The current time limit is 2 hours (which I frankly think is generous.)
