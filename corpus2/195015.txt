I don't have many peers who work as a programmer or at least who are social enough to share some parts of their precious knowledge, so I have little to none to compare with. I tend to learn new things by myself, but each time I started to learn A, it got hooked up with B, which ends up hooked up with X, etc. In the end, I learn almost nothing but that programming for a newbie is painful. The first part of the learning curve seems insanely steep for a beginner like me which at some point seems to be irrelevant. Am I a bad programmer to have experienced this? Or is there a fellow programmer out there who has experienced this and survived, and care enough to share how? Edit : Since it marked as duplicate, I checked the question link given. The only thing that is similar between my question and the given one, is we both is quite alone in our programming field. But what I asked is this, is all programmer going through this steep learning curve? And if they do (which means I am not necessarily a bad programmer), how do they survived through it?
