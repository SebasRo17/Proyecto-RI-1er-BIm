I'm wondering what the title of someone who's main job is to present software/products (basically do presentations) (internally or externally)? I'm not really talking about salespeople, but more on the side of people who go out there and make presentations as a key part of their job, while still having some parts of involvement with the development? A possible title: Product Evangelist. Is it only the program managers and VP's who go out and present to the "higher-ups" or the public?
