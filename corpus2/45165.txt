I want to do this calculation using Mathematica and I do not know how. I want to finf gradient of a vector function I Have this $$ f:R^n\to R $$ $$ \nabla_xf(x)=\nabla_x(x^tBx) $$ I want to get this using mathematica (I want to differentiate vector function) $$ \frac{1}{2}(B+B^t) $$ $B$ is for example a $n\times n$ matrices and $x$ is a $n\times 1$ vector. does anybody know how am I supposed to do this using mathematica?
