I need to solve a system of differential equations as follows:               Clear[t]          system =       { x'[t] ==  2.2758*y[t] - x[t]/200,          y'[t] == - 2*2.2758*E^(-(0.7071^2))*E^(-((1.77*t)^2/13.8^2))*Cos[-0.5*t]*z[t]                  + 2.2758*x[t]  - y[t]/200,          z'[t] == 2*2.2758*E^(-(0.7071^2))*E^(-((1.77*t)^2/13.8^2))*Cos[-0.5*t]*y[t]};     initialvalues = {x[0] ==  0, y[0] ==  0, z[0] ==  -1};          sol = DSolve[ Join[ system, initialvalues], {x, y, z}, t]      Unfortunately, _Mathematica_ is not able to yield a result. Is there a way to do it? Also I have another question. I want to make the values of `x` , `y` and `z` be numbers (numerical values) at `t == 0`. How I can do that ?
