I was recently exposed to the three layer model (DAL,BL,UI). Someone told me I should ALWAYS work with this model. I have a medium project that I'm starting and I have doubts whether I should build it with layers and make myself work with more complex code just to 'code by the book'? Even though I read about this model, I'm still not entirely convinced it's worth it. I understood that it would help if I change the UI, but I really don't see any chances that the UI of this app will ever change. So is it worth the hassle? I would appreciate your opinion - would you advice me to always build projects by this model (even if currently I can't see much of a benefit)? **EDIT:** guys, please don't catch me on the word 'ALWAYS' - the meaning was just that generally this is the proper way I should design my projects by.
