For a typical `if...else` wrapped with exception handling, is something like the following example a recommended practice to avoid code duplication?               try     {         if (GetDataFromServer())         {             return ProcessData();         }         else         {             throw new Exception();         }     catch(Exception ex)     {         return null;     }      instead of...               try     {         if (GetDataFromServer())         {             ProcessData();         }         else         {             return null;         }     }     catch(Exception ex)     {         return null;     }      I know there is a slight performance hit, but I'm wondering if this is considered to be an acceptable practice. I currently do it the second method - especially in cases where I need to handle specific exceptions differently - but I was wondering if the first method is appropriate for simple cases.
