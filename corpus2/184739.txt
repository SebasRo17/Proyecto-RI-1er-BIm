I am currently building an audio streamer and I have a CPP .dll that I use functions of inside the WPF C# GUI. The program needs to deal with sorts of events such as   * Lower/Increase Volume   * Manipulate Equalizer Bands To this point I have used named events to deal with this issue. What would be a better way of handling all those events from the GUI to the .dll? The events system I use (.dll spawns a thread which while-s on a WaitForMultipleObjects), or would it be better/smarter/more-beneficial or just better-practice to use a named pipe instead?
