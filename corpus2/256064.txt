I have searched extensively for a similar Mongo schema design and can't find relevant examples. I have a store (with public info), each store has an account (with private account info).               // store object     {       name: "Departement Store",       email: "contact@store.com",       account: { // private info not returned by API         manager: "Steve",         employees: [...]       }     }      The stores will be searched through a public API. I am limiting the search queries using MongoDB's features to limit the returned data:               db.stores.find({}, {account:0});      **My question** : is it more efficient to keep the private data as a subdocument or in a separate collection? It seems a separate collection with account info is the best choice as I will be picking and choosing from an embedded document.
