I am looking to use a javascript libray licensed under the LGPL license v3. From what I have read so far, I understand that If I do not make any modifications to the library, I can use the library without any restrictions. But if I modify the library, I need to make the modified version available to the end users and also enable them to link the library dynamically. Since I am using javascript, my code is anyways open to the end user. Also the user can dynamically link to library through the debug console. So my question is, do I need to do anything explicitly since javascript is already open to users ? Also, are there any other restrictions that apply which I may have missed out ? Note: I found other answers that describe LGPL with respect to any application. But I am looking for an answer that describes how LGPL applies to javascript specifically.
