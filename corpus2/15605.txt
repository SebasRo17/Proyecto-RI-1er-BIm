When pre-screening candidates for a position prior to the first face-to-face interview, how useful are technical tests in filtering out poor candidates and possibly predicting their ability to succeed in the position? While some of the personality based ones might not say much, is there benefit to sending a technical test (e.g. on Java or C#) prior to a face-to-face interview or even a phone screen? Also, do these tests ever falsely identify a strong candidate as one that is likely a poor fit for the position?
