I'm currently studying computer science at the Institute, and I have some problems with course which is named Algorithms, I've just begun to study it, but I'm already feeling, that I'm going to fail it, my problem is that while understanding different algorithms on graphs I need to keep in my mind a lot of info, and usually I can't do it, I forget some points of the exercise or can't proceed to final result, I'm very desperate about it cause I like programming very much. Did somebody feel the same while studying in the University? P.S. I began to program only two years ago, may it be the problem?
