Is this a bug or I missed something? `NIntegrate` seems to give a different answer for the same integrand when the option `Method -> {Automatic, "SymbolicProcessing" -> 0}` is given.               $Version     (* "10.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) (June 29, 2014)" *)          $Assumptions = w ∈ Reals;     FEx[w_] = (I E^(-25 + 5 I w - w^2/4) Sinh[5 w])/Sqrt[2];     NIntegrate[Conjugate[FEx[w]]*FEx[w], {w, -∞, ∞}]     NIntegrate[Conjugate[FEx[w]]*FEx[w], {w, -∞, ∞},       Method -> {Automatic, "SymbolicProcessing" -> 0}]     (* 0.313329 + 0.
