I have the project for work that requires me to send e-mails to people using our work mail server. The server doesn't require authentication. Part of my project is using a Java-Helper I'm developing on GitHub. I don't know if I completely understand how it all works, but I'm guessing it would be a bad idea to have the server information available on GitHub for the world to see. Is this correct? **After thought:** I'm not going to put it in the Java-Helper because that wouldn't be helpful for anyone but me. but I'm still curious to know the answer to this question :) Thanks!
