I've never used _Mathematica_ before and am trying to numerically solve equation (12) from this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9907218v2. Ideally I'd be able to find the smallest value of $x_{n\nu}$ for $exp(-kr\pi)$ close to 1, and close to 0 for some range of $\nu$ (must be larger than 2) and then plot it. I've tried a few methods I found after googling, but none seem to work. I tried to use this: http://tinyurl.com/oozfv84 by writing:               f= (2*BesselJ[a, x] +            x*(BesselJ[a + 1, x] + BesselJ[a - 1, x]))*(2*            BesselY[a, x*exp[-Pi]] +            x*exp[-Pi]*(BesselY[a + 1, x*exp[-Pi]] +               BesselY[a - 1, x*exp[-Pi]])) - (2*BesselY[a, x] +            x*(BesselY[a + 1, x] + BesselY[a - 1, x]))*(2*            BesselJ[a, x*exp[-Pi]] +            x*exp[-Pi]*(BesselY[a + 1, x*exp[-Pi]] +               BesselY[a - 1, x*exp[-Pi]]));      sol[_a] = NSolve[f ==0 && x>0 && x < 10 && a > 2 && a < 12, x, Reals);      and was told that NSolve can't solve it. I've also tried using               sol[a_] := x /. FindRoot[f, {{x, 0}, {a, 2}}];       which throws up an error: > SetDelayed::write : Tag Plus in _My definition of f here_ [a_, x_] is > Protected.
