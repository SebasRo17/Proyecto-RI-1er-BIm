My application has an icon file which is stored in version control. Now tomorrow I might decide to change the icon. I'm debating between two possible naming conventions for the icon file:   1. Keep the filename fixed, e.g., application.ico   2. Have the filename reflect the nature of the image, e.g., happyface.ico Option 1 doesn't say what the file is. It could give the illusion that two wildly different images are somehow different "versions" of the same thing. With option 2, I'd not only have to add a new file and delete the old one, I'd have to modify the resource file to reflect the new icon filename. On a related but different angle: A website with a header image. Is the filename header.jpg or sunrise-family- smiling.jpg? Should image file names reflect their function in the application or their content? What would be a best practice for this?
