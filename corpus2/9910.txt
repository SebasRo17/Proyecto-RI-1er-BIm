Apple's laptop running Mac OS have a pretty nice feature to make the battery last longer: the dynamically switch between the low-power integrated graphics card and the higher-performance dedicated graphics card depending on app usage. For example, when I have no graphics app running and I launch Mathematica 8.0.4.0, it stays on the integrated graphics card. However, when I run a command that requires 3D output, like `SphericalPlot3D`, it switches to the dedicated graphics card (you don't notice it unless you actually check for it). However, even after I close the notebook with the 3D content, and even if I restart the kernel, Mathematica still continues to grab hold on to the dedicated graphics card, even though it doesn't really need it anymore. (Behind the scences, I imagine it's because it's still retaining an OpenGL context somewhereâ€¦) This annoys me, so even though I don't have high hopes, I've got to ask: does anyone have an idea of how I could make it release its hold on the dedicated graphics card?
