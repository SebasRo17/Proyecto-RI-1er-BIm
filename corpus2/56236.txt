I have the code shown at the bottom of this question which generates a 3D plot. There are locations where the two surfaces you see form cones and touch at infinitesimally small points. These points always occur at z=1 and I have to use many PlotPoints to resolve this touching. I will be generating thousands of these plots (to form a movie) so need to plot each one as quickly as possible. I would imagine a lot of time would be saved if I used a large number of points only in the regions of interest. Is there a way I can use a large PlotPoints density in a rectangular box that spans the x and y domain but has a small height and is vertically centred around z=1 where I know these points occur (but I don't know their x or y)? ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Az35Q.jpg)               (*The lattice vectors*)     a1 = {Sqrt[3], 0};     a2 = {Sqrt[3]/2, 3/2};          (*Omega/w_0*)     Omega = 0.01;          wp[qx_, qy_, r_] := Module[{},       q = {qx, qy};            (*Nearest neighbour vectors*)       {d1, d2, d3} = # - r & /@ {{0, -1}, {Sqrt[3]/2, 1/2}, {-Sqrt[3]/2, 1/2}};            (*The c_j's*)       {theta, phi} = {0, 0};       {c1, c2, c3} = (1 - 3 Sin[theta]^2 Cos[ArcTan[#[[1]], #[[2]]] - phi + Pi/2]^2)/           Norm[#]^3 & /@ {d1, d2, d3};            modfq =         Sqrt[c1^2 + c2^2 + c3^2 + 2 c1 c2 Cos[q.(d1 - d2)] +           2 c1 c3 Cos[q.(d1 - d3)] +  2 c2 c3 Cos[q.(d2 - d3)]];       {Sqrt[1 + 2 Omega modfq], Sqrt[1 - 2 Omega modfq]}       ]          r = {0, 0};          Timing[      With[{plotopts = {Mesh -> None, PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.7],           Ticks -> {{-Pi, 0, Pi}, {-Pi, 0, Pi}, Automatic},           PlotPoints -> 100, ViewPoint -> {1.43, -2.84, 1.13},           ViewVertical -> {0., 0., 1.}}},       plot1 =         Plot3D[wp[qx, qy, r][[1]], {qx, -Pi, Pi}, {qy, -Pi, Pi}, plotopts];       plot2 =         Plot3D[wp[qx, qy, r][[2]], {qx, -Pi, Pi}, {qy, -Pi, Pi}, plotopts];       ]      ]     plot =       Show[plot1, plot2, PlotRange -> {0.96, 1.04},        Ticks -> {{-Pi, 0, Pi}, {-Pi, 0, Pi}}, LabelStyle -> Medium,        BoxRatios -> {2, 2, 3}, BoxStyle -> Opacity[0.4]]      Note: This question could be a duplicate of here, but from what I gathered it was about feeding it a list of points rather than a region? I could be wrong.
