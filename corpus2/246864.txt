I am working on Android with the query() method of the ContentResolver class and it accepts 6 parameters, `(uri,projection,selection,selectionArgs,sortOrder,cancellationSignal)` for selection and projection parameters. I am little bit confused with the selection and projection part of query. In below example, what is selection and project part in the query?               select * from Person     where name='zeus';
