I've never worked with sessions in a database before, and I'm a little unclear on how they work. I have a user class already designed which stores user information: username, password, email etc. I also have a session class which uses the user ID to store a session cookie in the user's browser so that when they return to the application, a method is invoked to check if:               isset($_SESSION['id']){ $this->userId=$_SESSION['id']}      then take the user to the admin page. I've been reading that using the database is a more secure method of handling sessions, but I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this concept. So say I wanted to store the session info in the database, and have access to that info so that if the user clicked on a link to their profile page, for example, I could use the session info to get their user info. How could I achieve this? Does it even make sense to use this approach?
