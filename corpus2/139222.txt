We're deciding on how to store translations of some descriptions of database items. We could go the traditional way and keep a translations table (and a language table and an object_translation linking table) OR we thought it might be better to just have a Description column that contains JSON like the following:               {          "EN": "This is the translation in English",          "EE" : "See on kirjeldus eesti keeles"     }      Are there any serious downsides as to why we shouldn't use this? (I haven't seen it being used anywhere else)
