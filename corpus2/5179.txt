I have a tab separated value file with 10 million rows each of which has three tab separated values. The first value is a string, the second an integer, and the third another string. How to read efficiently (in terms of timing and memory footprint) the $n^{th}$ to $(n+100)^{th}$ rows of the file into Mathematica as               {         {_String, _Integer, _String},         ...     }      ?
