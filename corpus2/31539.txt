I know that GeneratingFunction can be used to compute the generating function $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n$ of a sequence $(a_n)_n$ via               GeneratingFunction[a[n],n,x]      I also know that polynomial (in $n$) coefficients of the general term $a_n$ of the sequence result in an expression involving derivatives of the generating function, e.g.               GeneratingFunction[n a[n],n,x]     (* x (GeneratingFunction^(0,0,1))[a[n],n,x] *)      This does not seem to happen with rational (in $n$) coefficients, which would lead to indefinite integrals of the generating function. For example I would expect the input               GeneratingFunction[a[n]/(n + 1), n, x]      to result in               (*1/x Integrate[GeneratingFunction[a[n],n,y],{y,0,x}]*)      or               (*1/x GeneratingFunction^(0,0,-1))[a[n],n,x]*)      but this does not seem to be the case. **I thus have the following question:** Is it possible to get Mathematica to compute the generating function of a linear combination of lagged values of $a_n$ with rational (in $n$) coefficients in terms of derivatives and integrals of the generating function of the sequence $(a_n)_n$?
