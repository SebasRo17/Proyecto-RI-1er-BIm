In one of the _Mathematica_ (v9) slide templates, they have an example cell that looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nHoMb.jpg) Where there is a "SideCaption" that appears to be the _Mathematica_ -equivalent of a text box to the right of the image. I can't for the life of me figure out how this is replicate this other than copying the cell and pasting elsewhere. I did find this code looking at the notebook file however:               Cell["SideCaption How do I get this?", "SideCaption"]      Is this something I can generate programmatically, or something that needs to be copied when used elsewhere? I could see this format being used in more places than presentations.
