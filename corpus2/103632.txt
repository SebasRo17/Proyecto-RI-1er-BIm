So I'm working in a modding project and they gave me the installing part as to do. We plan to publish it between **30 Aug. - 01 Sept.** **My question is;** is it logical to use **Dropbox** to download files in the **web installer**? I saw Dropbox's public folder has **10 GB download bandwith** limit daily, after reaching that; they lock the account. I can insert a quota function and can use more than one Dropbox accounts. But it seems (not sure but) it's illegal or opposite to company's politics. I don't know is the same bandwith limit applies to downloading directly from the **root folder.** Also total size of the packages reaches **1 GB**. This why I'm afraid of the bandwith limit. And, if you **don't recommend** using Dropbox, what would you advise? I think a simple web automator with **Mediafire** is a good choice but resuming download will **not be** possible. Also I have a **Fileserve Premium Account** (a friend of mine gave as a gift) but most probably it will be banned after using different IP's at the same time. One more thing I'm writing it in **C#**. Thanks...
