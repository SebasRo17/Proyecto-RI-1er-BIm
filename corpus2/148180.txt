I would like to ask something about project management. I got a project that has some requirements, it can be done from scratch with the use of a big framework. Maybe some tools are necessary for some of the functions. But using a framework seems very cool, it seems that reduces the amount of work, but need to study a framework first. But study a frameworks seems very big for the team. So, what do you think? Just get the thing done from scratch or study a framework and get started like 'Standing on the shoulders of giants'?
