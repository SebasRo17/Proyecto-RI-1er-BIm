RegionPlot3D[ Sqrt[x^2 + y^2] <= z && x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <= 2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -2, 2}, Mesh -> None, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}, PlotRange -> All, PlotPoints -> 120, PlotStyle -> Directive[Yellow, Specularity[White, 20], Opacity[0.8]]]      It gives me the result (Hemisphere on top on a cone ) I want but because I have never taken high level of math courses I do not have any explanation why I use `Sqrt[x^2 + y^2] <= z` as the equation for the cone. I will appreciate your kindness Thanks
