With the announcement of Ceylon, and after observing the slides describing its intent and feature list, I reckoned this language to be a Scala competitor. Furthermore, as a Scala programmer, I can see several points (as depicted in here) that state that Scala goes further in providing a quantum leap over Java, that is interoperable nevertheless. However, this language may be a symptom of failed comprehension over Scala features and/or lack of knowledge of the language itself, which may not be only their fault. Many great ideas have failed due to bad/insufficient marketing. Beta was, in some aspects, better than VHS but it lost its marketshare because of marketing. So my question is: Are we doing enough to explain/disseminate/evolve Scala? How can Scala professionals/enthusiasts propel the language forward in terms of acknowledge from their colleagues (i.e. Marketing)? How can we make natural selection work and prevent it from failing? Are sponsorships the way to go? Should there be already prepared presentations (e.g. like jrebel has on its page) to ease propagation?
