I have written a small mathematica code to input a ".csv" file and output the data in a specific format, in a ".txt" file. I would like to give this program as an executable to my friend as she doesn't have mathematica installed. I've seen how one creates ".exe" from mathematica. However the process doesn't seem to work for me. Can anyone kindly help. Here is the mathematica code:               content=Drop[Transpose[Import["~/Downloads/19162.csv"]],2];          sorted=GatherBy[DeleteCases[DeleteCases[Flatten[content],""],"="],StringTake[#,StringPosition[#,"="][[1]][[1]]]&];          tab=OutputForm[TableForm[sorted]];          Export["~/Downloads/19162.txt",tab]      I would like the executable to input a file (in ".csv") format and output the text file in the "~/Downloads/" folder (of course the choice of the folder isn't important here).
