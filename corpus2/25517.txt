I have a weighted adjacency matrix as follows:               myAdjacencyMatrix = {{0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 3, 4},       {1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 16, 5, 3, 0, 6, 1},       {2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0},       {5, 3, 3, 0, 5, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1},       {1, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 2, 6, 10, 2, 4},       {0, 11, 3, 0, 1, 0, 8, 3, 1, 3, 3},       {2, 4, 1, 7, 6, 7, 0, 6, 0, 8, 2},       {1, 2, 1, 3, 8, 4, 4, 0, 4, 3, 0},       {0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 1, 3, 4, 0, 6, 4},       {0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 6, 0, 4},       {0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0}}      I want to draw a graph with 11 nodes and the edges weighted as described above. If this is impossible, then I will settle for making a graph with the non-weighted adjacency matrix. If you could just give me the simple code as I am new to mathematica and am working on a tight schedule.
