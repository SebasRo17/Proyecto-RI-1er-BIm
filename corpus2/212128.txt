This question on SO talks about correcting what the OP thought is _feature envy_ code. Another example where I saw this nifty phrase being quoted is in a recently given answer here in programmers.SE. Although I did drop in a comment to that answer asking for the information I thought it would of general help to programmers following Q&A to understand what is meant by the term _feature- envy_.
