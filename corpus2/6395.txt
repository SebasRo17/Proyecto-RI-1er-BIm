What tools and techniques do you use for exploring and learning an unknown code base? I am thinking of tools like `grep`, `ctags`, unit-tests, functional test, class-diagram generators, call graphs, code metrics like `sloccount`, and so on. I'd be interested in your experiences, the helpers you used or wrote yourself and the size of the code base with which you worked. I realize that becoming acquainted with a code base is a process that happens over time, and familiarity can mean anything from "I'm able to summarize the code" to "I can refactor and shrink it to 30% of the size". But how to even begin?
