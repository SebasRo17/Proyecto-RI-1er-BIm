After working Scrum(ish) in a previous workplace, I am trying to implement it in my new place of work for a brand new project (I am no scrum expert). We have some pre-requisites to code before we can begin working on the stories (which are being groomed in the mean time). Things like database design, api design, etc. We plan to use two week iterations and it's just not clear to me how the first one (or two) can provide something useful to the customer and "potentially shippable" if we first have to "lay down some groundwork" ? Any ideas on how to treat this? \-----edit / rephrase----- How do we incorporate initial non client-visible preliminary work (e.g., database design, api, etc) into the Scrum process?
