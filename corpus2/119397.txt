I've developed a website using PHP but I implemented it on Windows OS and hosted it on Windows server. I just searched the PHP job market to know the on-going technology requirement and to keep my knowledge up-to-date accordingly with the job market. I see more are asking for LAMP stack. I understand the sort of skills required for a developer in PHP and MySQL. But coming to the Linux and Apache what kind of the skills exactly companies expect from a developer? On what should I be focusing in case of Linux, Apache whilst developing my website using these LAMP stack? I am going to develop a new website and want it to be using LAMP. But I want to know what difference it makes? Why LAMP stack got more demand in the job market compared to WAMP ? Edit: Sorry I thought my question is creating confusion ... so I put my question in different words as What and all the areas of a Linux a PHP developer should know about? (Like just commands of it or something advanced) Note: I am Linux newbie
