I am trying to examine the results of and NDSolve solution for a BVP, and the output is not at all "pretty". Here's the code:               *d = .0005;        (* diffusion coefficient (L^2/t *)     v = .0010;         (* velocity (L/s) *)     r = 3.;            (* depth of lower boundary condition *)     xmax = r/1.;       (* maximum plotted value of x *)     NDSolve[       {          D[c[t, x], t] == d*D[c[t, x], x, x] - v*D[c[t, x], x],          c[0, x] == UnitStep[x - .002] - UnitStep[x - .15],          Derivative[0, 1][c][t, 0] == c[t, 0]*v/d,            c[t, r] == 0       },       c,       {t, 0, 50},       {x, 0, r}];     q = Evaluate[c[t, x] /. % ];     Table[{x, q}, {t, 50, 50}, {x, 0, r/2, .05}]     ContourPlot[q, {t, 0, 50}, {x, 0, xmax/5},       ColorFunction -> Hue,       Contours -> 20,       AspectRatio -> .75,        PlotPoints -> 25,       Axes -> True,       AxesLabel -> {"time", "distance"},        PlotLabel -> "Concentration"]     Plot3D[q, {t, 0, 50}, {x, 0, xmax}, PlotRange -> All]      There are two things I'd like to be able to change in the output:   1. The output by the `Table` command is one long line that wraps until it's done. I'd like to see two columns, one for `x` and one for `q`. The value of `q` should be `t = 50`, and `x` should be the sequence `{x, 0, r/2, .05}`.   2. I have been unsuccessful getting the `ContourPlot` to print out a legend showing which colour represents what values of the dependent variable `q[t,x]`. Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
