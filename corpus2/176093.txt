I'm having some trouble finding a proper solution to the following architecture problem. In **our setting (sketched below)** we have 2 data sources, where data source A is the primary source for items of type Foo. A secondary data source exists which can be used to retrieve additional information on a Foo; however this information does not always exist. Furthermore, data source A can be used to retrieve items of type Bar. However, each Bar refers to a Foo. The difficulty here is that each Bar should refer to a Foo which, if available, also contains the information as augmented by data source B. My question is: how to remove the tight coupling between SubsystemA.1 and DataSourceB? ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xi4aA.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xi4aA.png)
