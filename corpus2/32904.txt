I've produced some plots that have fractional tick labels on the horizontal axis and they look fine.               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi},       Ticks -> {Range[0, 2 Pi, Pi/6], {-1, 0, 1}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O8OI5.png) However, when I export the plot with               Export["Graph2.jpg",drag graph picture here, ImageResolution->300]       the fraction alignment goes off. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OtFaW.jpg) Is there a way to keep the fraction alignment the same in a `jpg`?
