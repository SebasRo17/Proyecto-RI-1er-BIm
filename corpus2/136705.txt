I am not sure how to phrase this, but in asp.net there is the notion of a "web application" that is fundamentally just a DLL that the web server loads. It has the ability to dynamically discover and load user controls at runtime (e.g. a customized button), using something called MEF (which can discover dlls and load them). What I have not been able to find anything about is if it asp.net is capable of loading other asp.net web applications. E.g. web application A, looks for any dlls in a folder and dynamically loads them one by one (and maybe loads their index.html pages in a iframe). Can this be done in asp.net or other web frameworks?
