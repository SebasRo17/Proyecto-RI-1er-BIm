There are times when just one bug that keeps eating away your time like hell ... for example this one. I generally end up wasting hours and realize I've gone terribly behind my schedule and not completed other tasks. With n number of tabs open in the browser, I end up posting the question in stackoverflow as a last resort. What are some time management techniques that lets you stop, rewind and get back in action when faced with a road block?
