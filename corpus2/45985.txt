I spend almost two week to figure out how mma could use a remote kernel. The following is my results:   1. The basic environment is: mma9.0.1 on win8 as my host (local machine); mma9.0.1 on Deiban 7 as a remote one (`d1`), its host name is assumed to be `aaa.bbb.com`.   2. It seems all the methods provided on the net are not working for me.    3. I can connect to the remote one from another debian system, assume it's name `d2`:      * First, I generate a ssh-key on `d2`: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` and press `Enter` for default location.     * Second, I copy the key to `d1` : `ssh-copy-id username@aaa.bbb.com`, where `username` is the username of `d1`. It asks me to input my password for my account on `d1`.     * Now I can login `d1` from `d1` with: `ssh username@aaa.bbb.com` without password     * It should be noted that, all the above steps can be skipped, in which case I am required to input my password for `username` on `d1` every time.     * Now I am ready to launch mma on `d1`: `ssh username@aaa.bbb.com math`, which will feedback a _Mathematica_ shell as `In[1]:=`, and run a test: `1 + 1` and `Enter`. I see `Out[1]= 2`, so it is clear that the connection from `d2` to `d1` works. (I can quit _Mathematica_ from `d1` by `Quit` or `Exit`)   4. Then the problem is that I want to connect `d1` from my win8. As I mentioned all the solutions seem not to work, such as:     * Official doc, after I input the right password, it alerts me with something like `the remote machine refused, error code 113`     * Official debug doc, all the steps seems right, but the results can be return back, It still runing after ten min.     * How do you use ssh-keys instead of a password to run a remote-kernel over ssh?, it seems that I need to install putty in order to use `ssh` instead of `java`. The problem seems that the shell command is not correct, since it is even can't connect to `d1`. I try to find `mathssh.jar` in win8, it seems it is not exists?     * Use putty's `plink` I successfully install putty, and try the link's suggestion:                           plink -ssh -batch -l `username` `1` "math -mathlink -linkmode Connect `4` -linkname '`2`' -subkernel -noinit  >& /dev/null &" to lauch a parallel kernel, the results says that: > SubKernels `Protected` kernelFlush::time: Operation LinkWrite timed out > after 15. seconds. KernelObject::rdead: Subkernel connected through > remote[aaa.bbb.com] appears dead.   5. I try to fix the missing `mathssh` problem by How to configure parallel remote kernels in Mathematica?, it works 100%.   6. Finally, my problem is to find out how to use the remote kernel as default, rather than as the `Local` kernel. Any ideas?
