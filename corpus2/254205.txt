Okay, I know first-class functions are cool, closures even better, etc. But is there any language with first-class methods? In my mind, I see a first-class method as an "object" that has both a function pointer and a pointer to a specific instance of the class/object, but the implementation doesn't matter. I just want to know if there is _any_ language that uses them. And as a bonus, how were they implemented?
