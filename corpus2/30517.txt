Hi (I am an absolute newbie), I need to send Mathematica data to the program OriginLab to plot and change the graphs. Does anyone know if it is possible to send data from Mathematica 9 via Mathematica link to OriginLab? I have tried, but it was only possible to send data from OriginLab to the Kernel and use the programming power of Mathematica 9 to receive the results back in OriginLab.
