Most of times I get to know about the new features too late. It is okay at least I know about them does not matter from where I know But I feel it is too late to know about those features. I am working on LAMP platform and I want to keep myself up to date with the new things, anything happening new with LAMP. Can you please let me know what resources should I use? What groups should I follow? From where I can get the latest updates about any activity, event and feature about LAMP?
