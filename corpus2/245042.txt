I was reading this blog post and liked the idea of using the DTO class for an entity and using it as a property in the corresponding business object class like so:               public class Person : BALBase     {             public PersonDTO Data { get; set; }      This also can eliminate the need for a mapping tool like AutoMapper (mapping between POCO and DTO). I am thinking of using this concept in my app. My app is layered using straight assemblies with no web services/REST/WCF calls. What can be the disadvantages of using this concept?
