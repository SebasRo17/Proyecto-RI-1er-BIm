I have to give a presentation next week to my supervisor and my teacher about the activities I have performed during my internship. I've never been good at presentations and become nervous really quick. When I get nervous I start to talk really fast and skip valuable information I should've told. I feel like I need to master giving presentations if I want to become a serious software engineer later on. Do software engineers give presentations on a regular basis? How can I prepare myself for a presenation? Would I get less nervous if I gave more presentations? Any hints & or tips are greatly appreciated.
