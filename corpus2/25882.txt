I'm relatively inexperienced with mathematica, so I apologize if this is a trivial question. I want to take a double sum over a function $f(i,j)$ of two indices, of the form $$ \sum_{i = -\infty}^\infty \sum_{j = 0\atop j\not = i}^m f(i,j). $$ That is, in the inner sum I want to sum over only those indices $j$ in my range of summation that satisfy the assumption $j \not = i$. How can I input such a sum to Mathematica?
