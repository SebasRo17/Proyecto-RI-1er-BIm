I am trying to solve following system of three differential equations               r = {       -cab'[t] == k*cab[t] - kb*ca[t]*cb[t],       ca'[t] == k*cab[t] - kb*ca[t]*cb[t],       cb'[t] == k*cab[t] - kb*ca[t]*cb[t],       cab[0] == 0.071176,       ca[0] == 0.003697,       cb[0] == 0.002845     };      and fit them to the following experimental data               cab = {0.071176, 0.05493, 0.04287, 0.03391, 0.02767, 0.02355,             0.02096,0.01825, 0.017029, 0.016582, 0.01421, 0.01432, 0.01431};     ca = {0.003697, 0.021051, 0.033007, 0.04154, 0.047609,0.052086, 0.05529,            0.057088, 0.05842, 0.05966, 0.06114, 0.06079,0.06153};     cb = {0.002845, 0.01949, 0.03078, 0.03714, 0.04476, 0.04939, 0.05214,            0.05327, 0.05526, 0.05573, 0.05859, 0.05774, 0.05868};     t = {0, 3600, 7200, 10800, 14400, 18000, 21600, 25200, 28800, 32400,82800, 86400, 90000};      I want to get the best `k` and `kb` values. Could you help me since I am novice in _Mathematica_. I would like a step-by-step tutorial on hoe to do it.
