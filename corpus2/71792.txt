I am part of an organization that is formalizing their software development processes/capabilities/etc. While the organization is not traditionally a software organization, they want to do this right and provide the developers who work in the organization (which includes me) a solid set of tools in which to work from. In particular, we are looking at standing up: source control, bug tracking software, documentation tools (for the developers - not for end-users), and, in general, project management software (continuous integration, project tracking, code review, software push). Some of the high-level requirements are:   * Free is better. While we will consider purchasing tools, there is so much support in the FOSS community for development tools, I want to look there first.   * Integration across systems. (For example, the bug tracking software should be able to link back to the source control.)   * Easy to Import To and Export From. I do not want lock-in.   * (Relatively) Easy to learn. At this point, here is what I am looking at so far as my recommendations:   1. Source Control - Mercurial or Git \- I am personally leaning more towards Mercurial based on my research and the fact that Mercurial appears to be easier to setup in our environment.   2. Bug Tracking - I'm at a loss here. I have used Bugzilla in the past, but, it makes me cringe when I use it.   3. Documentation - MediaWiki, Screwturn Wiki, Atlassian (of course, this costs money so that is not ideal) I am looking for other suggestions of productivity tools/development tools that you have used. Please remember that we are a small organization, so I don't want to go over the top, but I do want to give developers good tools to use.
