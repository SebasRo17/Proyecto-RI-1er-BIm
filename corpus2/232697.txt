I assume that when a user registers at a site, the password and username are stored inside of a database. I've read that the password is often encrypted using a salt. So, is it safe to encrypt the passwords with a salt and to save it in the same schema with the username? Secondly, how does authentication work? Companies like Google have giant databases of username/password pairs. How does validation work so quickly, and how is it implemented?
