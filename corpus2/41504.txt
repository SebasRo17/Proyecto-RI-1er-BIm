`NIntegrate` can do a number of different types of symbolic preprocessing on the integrand before starting the numerical calculations, including changes of variables. Is there a way to find out what sort of symbolic preprocessing is being done and what is the precise integrand `NIntegrate` is actually evaluating? For example, is it possible to find out if it does any changes of variables, and if yes, exactly what changes it does? * * * Motivation: I'm trying to understand what goes wrong here: Why do I get a different value when I change the order of integration? The question describes a simple oscillatory numerical integral in 2D. `NIntegrate` gives different results depending on the order of integration variables, and no warnings. One result is wrong. Looking at the points sampled by `NIntegrate` it's clear that Mathematica does a different change of variables depending on the order of integration variables.
