As I have been learning to program, be it in my intern-ship or school, I have often come across situations where an extra piece of software is needed (from fairly basic to quite complex) and I am almost always told that I shouldn't waste my time developing a solution and use something someone else has already done. Does it make sense to do this or should I take the time to research and develop my own? At the moment I'm doing my final project which I have 15 weeks to complete, but the tutor and my classmates tell me not to bother. I can't help but think I am letting opportunities pass me by.
