I want to create simple language learning applications to help friends in learning languages. A simple Java console application would do the trick, but the Windows console does not seem to handle Unicode (and I need my software to work with all kinds of special letters at once). Googling it, I get the idea there might be ways to actually make Unicode work in the Windows console, but it seems a bit overly complex, plus that it requires some effort from anyone running the program. I want to write programs that anyone without computer experience can run easily. I wanted to try doing this in Python instead, as the IDLE console at least seemed to work with Unicode. But it has its own set of problems (I can't enter certain letters, like the Ã©, without writing it elsewhere and pasting it in) Now I'm considering building this as a web application or Swing application, to actually be able to make my program work with Unicode. But I feel I'm maybe overlooking something. Is there no easy way to make a Unicode console application that'd work on Windows?
