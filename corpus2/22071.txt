_Mathematica_ fails to put the following into an obvious simplest form:                  numerator = C2p D2 (C1y N1x - C1x N1y - C1y N2x + N1y N2x + C1x N2y - N1x N2y) +      C1p D1 (-(C2y N1x) + C2x N1y + C2y N2x - N1y N2x - C2x N2y + N1x N2y)          numerator = Simplify[numerator]        produces               C2p D2 (-(C1x N1y) + C1y (N1x - N2x) + N1y N2x + C1x N2y - N1x N2y) +      C1p D1 (C2x N1y - N1y N2x + C2y (-N1x + N2x) - C2x N2y + N1x N2y)        which has obvious simplification failures If I change the name of a variable it succeeds.               numerator = ReplaceAll[numerator,{N2y -> aN2y}]     numerator = Simplify[numerator]          C2p D2 (aN2y (C1x - N1x) + C1y (N1x - N2x) + N1y (-C1x + N2x)) +      C1p D1 (aN2y (-C2x + N1x) + N1y (C2x - N2x) + C2y (-N1x + N2x))          numerator = ReplaceAll[numerator,{aN2y -> N2y}]              C2p D2 (C1y (N1x - N2x) + N1y (-C1x + N2x) + (C1x - N1x) N2y) +      C1p D1 (N1y (C2x - N2x) + C2y (-N1x + N2x) + (-C2x + N1x) N2y)      Once one knows that success depends on the variable names, possibly an alphabetic sort order in the sum somewhere, one knows what to do in order to simplify, but I am concerned about much bigger expressions where you don't know that you need to trick it. Is there any way to get _Mathematica_ to get past this variable name dependence? `FullSimplify` does not help here.
