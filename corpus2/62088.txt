Next week a coworker and I are being sent to a local coding conference. This morning our manager sent us an email pretty much telling us we need to take our laptops and hinted at doing a google document so he can see us take notes in real time. This really rubbed me the wrong way and both of us emailed him back. These emails I have posted below. I'm wondering if you guys have encountered these types of expectations from your bosses. I've been a professional programmer for over 10 years and have never had this type of micro management about being sent to a conference. Just wondering if "coworker" and I are not seeing things clearly or if our boss is being a little weird about this. * * * From: Boss Sent: Friday, March 25, 2011 11:51 AM To: Coworker; Me Subject: Re: DevConnections next week Really guys? Whatever works for you, I guess. But I'm expecting that you have detailed enough notes to adequately share sessions you attend, including any URLs for supporting information, etc. This is not a "would be nice" but a professional expectation for attendance at these type of events. \--Boss On 3/25/11 10:08 AM, "Coworker" wrote: > The hotel where the conference is being held is huge.
