I'm trying to do some evaluation on notes (specifically the pitches) imported from a MIDI file. I've imported a list containing tracks of sound notes with `Import["path/to/midi.mid", "SoundNotes"]` and a track's sound notes look like the following:               { SoundNote["G4", {0., 0.5}, "Piano", SoundVolume -> 0.501961],        SoundNote["C5", {0.5, 1.}, "Piano", SoundVolume -> 0.501961],        SoundNote["D5", {1., 1.5}, "Piano", SoundVolume -> 0.501961],       ...     }      I'm attempting to get the pitch out of each SoundNote, treating each SoundNote as a list and grabbing the first value with `aNote[[1]]`. However, this returns a note string such as "C5". Is there a way to get a numeric representation of the pitch, in either MIDI scale (Middle C = 60) or Mathematica's scale (Middle C = 0)? I haven't seen any way to pull information from a SoundNote in the docs, unless I'm missing something.
