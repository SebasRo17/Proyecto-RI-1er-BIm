I would like to draw diagonal tick marks around a plot, and simultaneously rotate the tick labels as well. I've mocked up what this would look like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xc2Dz.png) Is there an easy way to do this in Mathematica? I believe this is beyond the capabilities of the CustomTicks package. **Edit:** I would like this to be general enough to work for arbitrary plot ranges, and perhaps it would be easiest to generate the plot first with the normal tick marks, and then apply a replacement to the final graphics object?
