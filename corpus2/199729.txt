Recently, we worked with a graphic designer (arranged by the client) to provide the skin for a Django+Bootstrap application we had built. The designer provided a series of static images of the new layout, along with a document describing some technical attributes (font sizes, colours, a few dimensions etc). It turned out to be incredibly time consuming to implement this. Although the whole site was basically a front page, an index page, and half a dozen detail pages, I spent at least 5 days just implementing the CSS and HTML changes. So I'll go out on a limb and call this _The Wrong Way_. My basic approach was:   1. Compare the static image and current rendering, and notice a difference.   2. Guess what change would be need in the CSS/HTML   3. Make that change   4. Go to step 1. Some of the particular issues were me not understanding that the design included a change from 8 columns to 12, some images provided in the wrong format (.png's can render differently on different browser/platform combinations), hassles trying to undo Bootstrap's styling, the usual CSS wrestling to achieve pixel perfect rendering etc. And occasionally I had to reorganise the HTML templates to get a certain behaviour. What's the right way?
