I would like to make a program which gives me what is the greater natural number "n" less than an arbitrary given natural number "k" which satisfy: for each prime divisor "p" of n, p^2-1 divides n. I have solved the problem theoretically and now I need to implement the algorithm. In order to do that I need to calculate the prime factorization of a number "q", for each prime factor p of q calculate p^2-1 and check if p^2-1 divides n. If the conditions holds, then I want to print the number q and exit the program. Else, continue with the program and do the same for q-1. I have read the documentation and I can calculate the prime factorization of q but then I don't know how to get the elements of the list that I need. I explain it with an example:               FactorInteger[2434500]          {{2, 2}, {3, 2}, {5, 3}, {541, 1}}      And now I don't know how to get 2, 3, 5, 541 Thanks and excuse me for my poor English I hope you understand what I am asking for.
