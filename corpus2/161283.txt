I often see projects (in Java projects and teams using Eclipse) that prefix function parameters with `p`. For example               public void filter (Result pResult) ...      I personally don't see any benefit in this, but would like to know what the reasoning is. The best explanation I've heard yet is that it is to distinguish the name of identical named fields.I have my issues with that explanation but I can understand the point.
