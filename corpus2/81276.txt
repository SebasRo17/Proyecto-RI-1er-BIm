I usually read a lot about programming related stuff. When the topic I read is not related to my work directly ,(say reading about some Algorithms which I don't use in everyday work), I forget them. One way to reinforce what has been learnt is to write blogs. I am a beginner in writing blogs. When I started writing, I figured out that it is very tough. Even simply reproducing the content takes about two hours. Writing a well thought about blog often takes a whole day or sometimes a weekend. Is this normal? Any tips to write technical tutorials/technical blogs?
