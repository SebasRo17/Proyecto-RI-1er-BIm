I have been working with a problem which involves solving the continuous time Lyapunov equation $$A R + R A^\top = G$$ for the symmetric positive definite matrix $R$. Here $A$ is real, invertible and sparse and $G$ is diagonal but singular. I am solving this equation for various matrices $A$ using `LyapunovSolve`. However, in some situations I get the error message _"LyapunovSolve::nuniq: The matrix equation has no unique solution"_ I can always transform this into an equation for each entry using `CoefficientArrays` and then solve with `LeastSquares`. This however, I have found to be incredibly slower than `LyapunovSolve`. Notwithstanding, it does yield a solution whose error (measured via the norm $\|A R + R A^\top - G\|$) is quite satisfactory. My question is the following: is it possible to obtain with `LyapunovSolve` a solution which, albeit not unique, is the best possible solution (in the least square sense)? Below is an example matrix for reference (hopefully, copying it into a notebook should work) Thank you in advance.               G = DiagonalMatrix[SparseArray[{11 -> 2., 20 -> 1.}, {20}]]          A = SparseArray[{{1, 11} -> -1., {2, 12} -> -1., {3, 13} -> -1.,                     {4, 14} -> -1., {5, 15} -> -1., {6, 16} -> -1.,                     {7, 17} -> -1., {8, 18} -> -1., {9, 19} -> -1.,                     {10, 20} -> -1., {11, 1} -> 10.5, {11, 2} -> -1.,                     {11, 3} -> -1., {11, 4} -> -1., {11, 5} -> -1.,                     {11, 6} -> -1., {11, 7} -> -1., {11, 8} -> -1.,                     {11, 9} -> -1., {11, 11} -> 1., {12, 1} -> -1.,                     {12, 2} -> 7., {12, 3} -> -1., {12, 4} -> -1.,                     {12, 5} -> -1., {12, 6} -> -1., {12, 8} -> -1.,                     {12, 10} -> -1., {13, 1} -> -1., {13, 2} -> -1.,                     {13, 3} -> 8., {13, 4} -> -1., {13, 5} -> -1.,                     {13, 6} -> -1., {13, 7} -> -1., {13, 9} -> -1.,                     {13, 10} -> -1., {14, 1} -> -1., {14, 2} -> -1.,                     {14, 3} -> -1., {14, 4} -> 6., {14, 5} -> -1.,                     {14, 7} -> -1., {14, 9} -> -1., {15, 1} -> -1.,                     {15, 2} -> -1., {15, 3} -> -1., {15, 4} -> -1.,                     {15, 5} -> 6., {15, 6} -> -1., {15, 8} -> -1.,                     {16, 1} -> -1., {16, 2} -> -1., {16, 3} -> -1.,                     {16, 5} -> -1., {16, 6} -> 7., {16, 7} -> -1.,                     {16, 8} -> -1., {16, 9} -> -1., {17, 1} -> -1.,                     {17, 3} -> -1., {17, 4} -> -1., {17, 6} -> -1.,                     {17, 7} -> 5., {17, 10} -> -1., {18, 1} -> -1.,                     {18, 2} -> -1., {18, 5} -> -1., {18, 6} -> -1.,                     {18, 8} -> 4., {19, 1} -> -1., {19, 3} -> -1.,                     {19, 4} -> -1., {19, 6} -> -1., {19, 9} -> 5.,                     {19, 10} -> -1., {20, 2} -> -1., {20, 3} -> -1.,                     {20, 7} -> -1., {20, 9} -> -1., {20, 10} -> 5.5,                     {20, 20} -> 1.}, {20, 20}]
