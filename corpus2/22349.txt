In the company where I work, we are starting to plan to be compliant to the software development life cycle. We already have, wiki, vcs system, bug tracking system, and a continuous integration system. The next step we want to have is to start to manage, in a structured way, software requirements. We dont want to use a wiki or shared documentation because we have many input (developer, manager, commercial, security analyst and other) and we dont want to handle proliferation of .doc around the network share. We are trying to search and we hope we can find and use a FOSS software to manage all this things. We have about 30 people, and don't have a budget for commercial software. We need a free solution for requirements management. What we want is software that can manage: Required features:   * Software requirements divided in a structured configurable way   * Versioning of the requirements (history, diff, etc, like source code)   * Interdependency of requirements (child of, parent of, related to)   * Rule Based Access Control for data handling   * Multi user, multi project   * File upload (for graph, document related to or so on)   * Report and extraction features Optional Features:   * Web Based   * Test case   * Time based management (timeline, excepted data, result data)   * Person allocation and so on   * Business related stuff   * Hardware allocation handling I have already play with testlink and now i'm playing with RTH, the next one i try is redmine.
