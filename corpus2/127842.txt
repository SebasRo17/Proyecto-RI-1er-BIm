I'm building an open source SMSC from scratch; it's almost finished, The SRI and the forwardSM operations are working, but I still have few things to do for the receiving part. I've built the SS7 stack already, but I'm using DB for saving the TCAP transactions IDs to be updated later to get/generate responses. My approach is this: I created memory table (heap table), saved the TCAP TID in the database, then compared the received TCAP TID with the TIDs saved in the database and then decide whether to end the TCAP session or continue. What is the best way to implement it? I'm thinking of doubly linked list that holds the TCAP TID. Am I going towards the right direction, or should I use another technique other than database or D-linked list? Should I leave it as it is, and let the database do the job for saving the TIDs? Please note that I'm using SCTP implementation available on Linux (lsctp) as a transport protocol, the language I'm using is C and the DB is MYSQL.
