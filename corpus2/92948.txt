The above is from Microsofts website New in CPT3 This sounds like the perfect SQL database for small one-user desktop applications. I'm trying to find out what I need to include in an install. I want to use this as an embedded database but I don't know if I need to install any Microsoft components or make sure that any other Microsoft compenents have previously been installed. Does anyone know what Microsoft components need to be installed in order for this new LocalDB to run? Is there an installer out there that will automatically detect the presence of the necessary componets an install them? ### Moderator Help Needed: How do I migrate this question to http://dba.stackexchange.com?
