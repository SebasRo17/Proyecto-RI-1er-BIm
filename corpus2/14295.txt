When the Mathematica application loses focus, palette windows disappear (normal notebooks and dialogs (`CreateDialog`) stay). This is usually convenient because the small palette windows would clutter the screen. I would like to use a palette as a drag-and-drop target. For this I need to keep it visible even when another application is focused. Which notebook property needs to be changed to prevent one particular palette from disappearing when Mathematica loses focus? (Why I want to keep this drop target as a palette: it's easy to open from the Palettes menu and it has a small frame.) **Note:** Per the comments below, this does not seem to happen on all systems. **Update:** It seems that this is an OS-wide behaviour for this window type, at least on OS X. The answers suggest changing the window type (`WindowFrame` option). * * * Here are two screenshots to demonstrate. The only difference is switching the focus to the browser. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIvDZ.png) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KF60z.png)
