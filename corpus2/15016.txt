I initially have ran a large, say 1000 (to be changed later) number of monte carlo simulations (mcRun), and I want to see when the average data result starts to converge to a reasonable value. So I basically first ran 1000 simulations, and took average data based on 0 to first 10%(100), then average data based on 0 to 20%(200) and so on. So just to show the data: For[n = 0, n < 10, n++, Print [data[n]]] {622.917} {583.165} {564.45} {570.583} {584.956} {583.185} {579.662} {572.974} {570.253} {558.536} So how to plot this data where Y is data[0] to data[9] and X is 0.1 mcRun, 0.2mcRun...1 mcRun. Or possibly 3D animate later using Manipulate? as I will have more sensitivity analysis to be done later.
