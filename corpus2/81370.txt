You are in the process of looking for candidates for a software development position, all the resumes are reviewed, and you made a couple of interview invites. Now, the folks show up in the conference room onsite, and you begin the back-and-forth talking about past experience, reviewing the resume, the personal development interests, etc. In your experiences of hiring, what were the responses (and questions) that you wished you had processed better initially that may have stopped you from hiring a poor candidate? I am looking for some _red flags_ to watch out for, and hoping to be discerning enough to not fall into any of this: Is there a correlation between buzz words and ability?
