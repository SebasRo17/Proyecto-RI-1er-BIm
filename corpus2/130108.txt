I'm thinking of scientific applications that are mostly processor-bound and heavy on heap usage (at least several gigabytes). Any other time of the year I would happily go with C++, but in this case I wonder if the fragmentation natural to the C++ memory manager can be a serious issue versus the advantage of Java's compacting collectors. Can anybody point to real-world examples related to this?
