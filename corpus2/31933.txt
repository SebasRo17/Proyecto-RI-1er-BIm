I'm trying to get random expressions displaying. For that, I'm starting with addition, multiplication, substraction and division. When trying out this code                HoldForm[c e d] /. c -> RandomInteger[{1, 15}] /.       d -> RandomInteger[{1, 15}] /.       e -> RandomChoice[{"-", "+", "/", "*"}]      , I sometimes get indeed expressions as "11 "+" 6" as expected, but I also get                14 "-"      or                "-" 9.      Why is that? Perhaps anyone has another idea for making randomised arithmetic expressions? Thanks, once again!
