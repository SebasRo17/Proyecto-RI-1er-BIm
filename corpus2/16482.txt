Is there a way to use a logarithmic scale in the colour legend of a `ListContourPlot`? The contours can be logged by taking the `Log10` of the data, but this doesn't transfer to the legend. As an example, with the code:               test = Flatten[Table[{i, j, Log10[RandomReal[{0, 1*^10}]]}, {j, 1, 100}, {i, 1, 100}], 1];          ListContourPlot[test, InterpolationOrder -> 0, PlotLegends -> Automatic,          Contours -> 20, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", ColorFunctionScaling -> True,          PlotRange -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wv8Rt.png) I get equally spaced contours for values <7, 8, 9 and 10. Could I plot these data with equally spaced contours corresponding to values 0.1, 1 and 10? * * * Another example, where you'd expect to see logarithmic data:               test = Flatten[Table[{i, j, Log10@Exp[-(i + j)^2]}, {j, 1, 10}, {i, 1, 10}], 1];     ListContourPlot[test, InterpolationOrder -> 0,       PlotLegends -> Automatic, Contours -> 20, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",       ColorFunctionScaling -> True, PlotRange -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uUmAm.png)
