I have a problem: I suck at tracking time-on-task for specific feature/defects/etc while coding them. I tend to jump between tasks a fair bit (partly due to the inherit juggling required by professional software development, partly due to my personal tendancy to focus on the code itself and not the business process around code). My personal preference is for a hard-copy system. Even with gabillions of pixels of real-estate on-screen I find it terribly distracting to keep a tracking window convienient; either I forget about it or it gets in my ways. So, looking for suggestions on time-tracking. My only requirement is a simple system to track start/stop times per task. I've considered going as far as buying a time-clock and giving each ticket a dedicated time-card. When I start working on it, punch-in; when done working, punch-out.
