I searched the forum, but I couldn't find the answers why it should be avoided, only why it's not a silver bullet. So I don't think this question is a duplicate. Is there a **VALID** reason why I should unlearn Systems Hungarian I'm used to? So far I see the following benefits in using it:   * Consistent variable naming   * You see type without searching (intellisense is dead/indexing half of the time, so it's still a valid reason)   * Semantics can still be packed into second part of the name And following downsides:   * It annoys some people (no idea why)   * If type is changed, the type might not match the naming of the variable (I don't think it's valid reason, types are changed rarely, and you have "rename all") So why:               vector<string> vecCityNames;     wstring strCity = L"abc";     //more code here     vecCityNames.push_back(strCity);      is worse than:               vector<string> cityNames;     wstring city = L"abc";     //more code here     cityNames.push_back(city);//Are we pushing back int on a queue? Float on a stack? Something else?
