I'm afraid the following is rather localized questions, but I don't know how to simplify and generalize it. I have the following two points (in the real plane):               p = {Sqrt[b y1^2 + 4 ϵ], y1}     q = {(3 b y1^2 + 12 ϵ + Sqrt[5] y1 Sqrt[b (b y1^2 + 4 ϵ)])/(2 Sqrt[b y1^2 + 4 ϵ]),           (3 b y1 + Sqrt[5] Sqrt[b (b y1^2 + 4 ϵ)])/(2 b)}      In particular, I have also the following assumptions:               $Assumptions = b > 0 && y1 ∈ Reals && ϵ > 0;      Then I try to solve the following:               Solve[p[[2]] == -q[[2]] && p[[1]] == q[[1]], y1]      and obtain the answer               {{y1 -> -(Sqrt[ϵ]/Sqrt[b])}, {y1 -> Sqrt[ϵ]/Sqrt[b]}}      However, one can easily test that the second answer is wrong:               In: {p, q} /. % // Simplify      returns: $\left\\{\left\\{\left\\{\sqrt{5} \sqrt{\epsilon },-\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon }{b}}\right\\},\left\\{\sqrt{5} \sqrt{\epsilon },\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon }{b}}\right\\}\right\\},\left\\{\left\\{\sqrt{5} \sqrt{\epsilon },\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon }{b}}\right\\},\left\\{2 \sqrt{5} \sqrt{\epsilon },\frac{4 \epsilon }{\sqrt{b \epsilon }}\right\\}\right\\}\right\\}$ What am I missing?
