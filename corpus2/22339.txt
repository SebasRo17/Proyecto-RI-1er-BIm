I'm looking to access variables in different contexts. The contexts are stored in a list labeled `contexttable`. Each context, of course, is a string. Is there any way, without using `NotebookWrite`, to access a variable of the same name, say `x`, in each context? I am looking for something like                contexttable = {"Context1`", "Context2`", ..., "ContextN`"};      Map[Print[# <> x]&, contexttable]      which would print the `x` variable in each context.
