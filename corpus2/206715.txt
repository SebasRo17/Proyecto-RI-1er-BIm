I know Java and JavaScript pretty well. I have never really worked on C/C++. But at this stage of my career I feel that the fact that I do not have adequate knowledge on C/C++ syntax(especially pointers *), I am missing out vital parts on reading some classic books in the field of software programming. Here are some of the books that I would like to read and understand thoroughly but unable to comprehend the example code as I do not know the C/C++ syntax:   1. Advanced Programming in the Unix environment where C is used.   2. GoF book where examples are in C++/Smalltalk .    3. Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skienna where again C is used. I do not intend to work on C/C++ projects. So I do not want to spend a whole lot of time learning the intricacies of these languages but I would like to at least have some working knowledge so that I can understand at least 80% of the examples in those books. I do not want to miss out on the essence of these classic books. What should I do about this?
