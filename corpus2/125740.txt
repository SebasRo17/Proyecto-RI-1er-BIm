I always veto JavaScript by using CSS as much as possible. i.e. I create tabs and rollover buttons using CSS rather than JavaScript. I have seen some solutions—specifically the Wt web-framework—which advocate JavaScript; but gracefully downgrade to CSS if the browser isn't capable/js- disabled. I know CSS and JavaScript have different purposes, however there is overlap; which is the _bourne_ of this question. **Should I continue using CSS as much as possible over JavaScript?**
