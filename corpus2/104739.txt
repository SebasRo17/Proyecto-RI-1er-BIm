Can someone point me to data or research on the patterns of mistyping on a keyboard? For instance, I've noticed that google will sometimes auto-correct a word that I've mistyped because my hand was out of position and each key was shifted one to the right. I'm also interested words where there is a mis- coordination between both hands, such as `teh`, and any other misspellings that are artifacts of keyboards and manual dexterity. We're looking at some user-friendly auto-correct functions, and I want some data to help our team get an overview of the landscape and decide what we will and will not handle.
