I've written some _Mathematica_ functions which allow the user to verify if a mathematical function has certain properties. What I'm basically doing is generating "random" functions in respect of certain parameters and then verify if these functions have those properties. So at some point, I solve a system of equations as follows:               sol = Solve[function1 == 0 && function2 == 0, {x, y}, Reals];      Lateron, I use a conditional statement like:               If[Length@sol==1, ...]      In this case, I want to continue if there is exactly 1 solution of the form `{x->value1, y->value2}`. Sometimes, however, the only solution is something like:               {{x -> Root[-8 + 16 #1 + 16 #1^3 + 3 #1^5 &, 1],        y -> -2 - 1/2 Root[-8 + 16 #1 + 16 #1^3 + 3 #1^5 &, 1]^2}}      In this case, my _Mathematica_ function will continue calculating and take minutes for a single function because of the high complexity of the `Solve[...]` return value. Is there a built-in function to determine whether the solution is "explicit", or does someone have a trick for this?
