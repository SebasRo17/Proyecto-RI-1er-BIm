I am trying to find non-trivial solutions of the ODE $\lambda u'(x) = u(x+R) - u(x)$ using _Mathematica_. In particular, I am using the command                DSolve[a*y'[x] == y[x + r] - y[x], y[x], x]      which for a standard (i.e., non-delayed, _non-anticipated_ ODE) works fine. In this case I got the error > DSolve::litarg: "To avoid possible ambiguity, the arguments of the dependent > variable in !({a\\ *SuperscriptBox[\"y\", \"[Prime]\", > MultilineFunction->None][x] == (-y[x]) + y[r + x]}) should literally match > the independent variables." Any advice?
