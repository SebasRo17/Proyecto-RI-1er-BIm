class A { public: int i; }; // A.h and defined in project libA.vcxproj (libA.dll)      I'm using class A in multiple places at various projects as below. Apporoximately 100 projects.               include "A.h"     class UseA { public: A *a; UseA(){ a = new A(); } ~UseA() {delete a;} }      My problem is whenever I add a member variable to class A I will have to build all the projects (~100) as the size of the class A has been changed and building 100 project is time consuming. How to avoid building so many projects on size change of a single class? Also I have many classes like class A defined in libA.vcxproj.
