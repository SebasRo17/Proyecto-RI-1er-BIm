I am a programming intern at a company in Australia. Is it normal for a programmer to be given a project that has to be completed within a week? For example, I have been given a task to create a Facebook app for one of the companies we have, I have 2 years experience at University in a Bachelor of Computer Science & my boss knows I have never developed an application using the Facebook Graph API & its IFrame version of apps. He would like me to finish the app in a week; its an interactive calendar that displays different looks based loosely on the facebook users likes (if no likes are present then a default look is shown) & to charge the user credits if they wish to enter a competition. Plus I am the only person in the software development team, the other people in the company do trading, real estate etc. In my 2 months I have been at this job I have developed a website updater (a java applet & a javascript one), 2 websites(css, javascript, html) & am halfway through a mobile application(using the Moync API & C++). Am I working under the typical Agile Software Development or are these kinds of timetables unrealistic for a one person team? Is this kind of thing normal? I dont believe I can introduce myself to the facebook Graph API & develop the app in a week, but I do believe I could get this done in 2-3 weeks. Is a one week timetable something other software developers would assign to a junior programming intern?
