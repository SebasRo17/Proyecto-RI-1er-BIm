My experience with programming came from a field, computational linguistics, where there LOTS of unsolved problems (computationally modeling natural language, or having effective statistical approximations). This is not an exception: many other fields (like computational biology) have big unsolved problems, and promising breakthroughs. Yet, most of the programming that is done (and most of the money made from it) seem to be in areas like Enterprise Resource Planning, Client Relation Management..etc. Companies seem to be able to churn out new versions of such software and make more money year after year, and clients keep spending money upgrading to newer versions..etc. So, as an outsider to that world, I am wondering: What are the great advancements spurring this growth? Were there some grand challenges that got solved or are getting solved?
