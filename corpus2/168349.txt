I have been doing some research into artificial intelligence and I came across a 2007 paper titled "Checkers is Solved" on the game of checkers being solved by AI techniques after more than 16 years of trial. A solution to the game is defined by the team as "determining the final result in a game with no mistakes made by either player". The search for a solution started back in 1989 and it was finally found in 2007. Of what importance is this to the field of AI?
