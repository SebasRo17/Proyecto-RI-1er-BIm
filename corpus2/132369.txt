Assume an interface containing these methods :               Car find(long id);          List<Car> find(String model);      Is it better to rename them like this?               Car findById(long id);          List findByModel(String model);      Indeed, any developer who use this API won't need to look at the interface for knowing possible arguments of initial `find()` methods. So my question is more general : What is the benefit of using overloaded methods in code since it reduce readability?
