I have a very simple question that baffles me for a long time. I am dealing with networks and databases so a lot of data I am dealing with are 32-bit and 64-bit counters (unsigned), 32-bit and 64-bit identification ids (also do not have meaningful mapping for sign). I am practically never deal with any real word matter that could be expressed as a negative number. Me and my co-workers routinely use unsigned types like uint32_t and uint64_t for these matters and because it happens so often we also use them for array indexes and other common integer uses. At the same time various coding guides I am reading (e.g. Google) discourage use of unsigned integer types, and as far as I know neither Java nor Scala have unsigned integer types. So, I could not figure out what is the right thing to do: using signed values in our environment would be very inconvenient, at the same time coding guides to insist on doing exactly this.
