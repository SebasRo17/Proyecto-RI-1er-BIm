I have a plot with some whitespace I'd like to get rid of. Ideally, I'd like to use a command like "ImageCrop", but for non-raster graphics (ImageCrop rasterizes the graphic). The Mathematica documentation tells you how to do this by hand (under the "cropping" section): http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/InteractiveGraphicsLayout.html ...but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this via a command. I've tried all sorts of combinations of FrameMargins, ImageMargins, ImagePadding, etc, but to no avail. Even if I could just manually specify the number of pixels to crop by, that would be an improvement over the current situation, but ideally the best solution would be to replicate ImageCrop for non-raster graphics.
