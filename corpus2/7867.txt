For my Cryptography research I am interested in finding solutions to the following inequalities in terms of $r$ and $s$, where $p$ is some fixed constant. $$\begin{align} 2^{p - s + 4} + 2^{p - r} + 2^{p - r - s + 4} + 13/4 < 2^{p - 8} \\ 2^{p - r + 4} + 2^{p - s + 8} + 2^{p - r - s + 8} + 13/4 < 2^{p - 4} \end{align}$$ I have tried the following computation:               Solve[2^(p - s + 4) + 2^(p - r) + 2^(p - r - s + 4) + 13/4 < 2^(p - 8) &&      2^(p - r + 4) + 2^(p - s + 8) + 2^(p - r - s + 8) + 13/4 < 2^(p - 4), {r, s}]      Unfortunately, it is taking forever to compute (literally days), so does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!
