Is there a specific term to call the process of modifying hard-coded codes into soft-coded codes? I have to report what I am doing to the Project manager, shall I just put "modifying hard-coded codes into soft-coded codes"? Example of "hard-coded codes"               int random(){     return 42;     }      Example of "soft-coded codes"               int random(){     return Random.nextInt();     }      hard coded codes might fulfill requirements for a set of inputs, but it is not flexible. EDIT: Accepted as Code Refactoring.
