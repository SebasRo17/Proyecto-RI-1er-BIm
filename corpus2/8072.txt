I apologize if this is a obvious question and answer, I don't often use _Mathematica_ to display plots or graphics in general to be honest. So, I was tutoring my cousin yesterday in relation to Polar functions and decided to bring up _Mathematica_ to illustrate some of the ideas we were discussing. I quickly typed a one line command into _Mathematica_ 8 and got an odd result. When rendering a polar function, _Mathematica_ took a few seconds to make it smooth. Prior to this it has too many lines (see picture, before is on left and after is on the right.) The code is:               Manipulate[PolarPlot[Sin[nS*t], {t, -5 Pi, 5 Pi}], {nS, 1, 20, 1}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/muNQP.png) Does anyone know why this is happening and if there is a way to make Mathematica render smooth at first?
