Given a list of word characters, such as this one, I'd like to build a tree, similar to this makeTree function, but with the tree in a different format. So, for an input such as               test = {{"h", "e", "l", "l", "o"}, {"h", "o", "l", "o"}, {"h",          "e", "a"}, {"h", "e", "l", "l", "o", "s"}, {"b", "r", "o"}};      I'd like the output to be               output = StartOfString[       "h"["e"["a"[EndOfString],          "l"["l"["o"[EndOfString, "s"[EndOfString]]]]],         "o"["l"["o"[EndOfString]]]], "b"["r"["o"[EndOfString]]]]      So that               TreeForm@output      gives ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/P4dPk.png) So far I haven't got a perfect solution, that's why I'm not posting. I know I must be missing lots of good ways to do this. What I want is not so much one single good solution, or "a fix to what I tried", but to see several ways to tackle the problem, particularly but not at all limited to elegant rule-based solutions
