I want to find all subsets which the total of elements is the same. For example, `Subsets[Range[30], {5}]` means all 5-element subsets and the range of each element is from 0 to 30. But I want to get the subsets which are only the total of elements equals to 30 (e.g., `{6, 6, 6 ,6, 6}`, `{7, 5, 6, 6, 6}`, ....
