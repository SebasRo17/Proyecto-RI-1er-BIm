I am writting a small webapp for learning. Is it better / best practice to create multiple models or one model with multiple custom data types? For example: Let's say the web app is "PublicLibrary." The library would have shelves. Shelves would have books and locations. Books would have titles, authors, text and a dewey decimal number. Would it be better to have a Book model, a shelf model (couldn't come up with a better example for this), and a Library model; or a book class, a shelf class, and a Library model that holds those classes. I understand that a model _is_ a class, but hopefully my question makes sense.
