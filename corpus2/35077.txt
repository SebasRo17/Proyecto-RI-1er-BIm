So here is a question for you, having read some great answers to questions such as "Test-Driven Development - Convince Me". So my question is: **"Can Test-Driven Development be used effectively on non- Greenfield projects?"** To specify: _I would really like to know if people have had experience in using TDD in projects where there was already non-TDD elements present? And the problems that they then faced._
