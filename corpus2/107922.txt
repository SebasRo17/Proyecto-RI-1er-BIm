This question may seems a little bit silly, but what the heck. I started to learn Python. I know basic syntax, etc. When I work with HTML, PHP, etc., I simply write code, put it inside .html or .php file and double click this file. Then my code runs. I can work with databases and other stuff - it's just simple. But how does Python work? I'm working inside Eclipse or Python command line and I can run this code, but what if I want make website with Python for example? I don't think it's like I put .py file on my server, so what I need to do? I understand I need to install Python on my webserver through some server command line (I've never used it, but I will find some tutorials day I will need it) but what's next? How can I combine my Python knowledge with HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.? Python may also be used to create desktop apps, what then? Can I export .exe file with Python code or what? Any links with content describing my concerns are welcome!
