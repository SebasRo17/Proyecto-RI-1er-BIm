I've been looking around for a way to give back to the community, but I haven't found my right fit yet, so an idea came to mind: A non-profit technology "company" that targets non-profits. Do these exist? I've been doing some google searches and can only find software that is targeted for non-profits that is created by for-profit companies or that charges what I believe to be an outrages amount, conferences directed towards non-profits and technology they may use -- or articles complaining about the digital divide and how non-profits view technology as key but dont have the funds or the knowledge to employ it. **Pseudo "Business Model"** An open source 501(3)(c) organization that targets directly targets non- profits to fill the "digital divide." Most services would be free and consulting fees would be charged for customization. Donations would be accepted and government grants would be sought after. This would enable non- profits to keep pace with the for-profits in the technology sector, but at little to no cost. Perhaps the first "industry" to be targeted would be those that fill key social needs like unemployment, or food banks.
