**Short question:** Could registering a work containing probable patentable ideas at one or more copyright registraion services (such as CRS) be used to effectively prove _prior art_ in case someone tries to patent the idea? **Details:** The particular work is software and some related stuff which show some novelties, maybe patentable, maybe not in the US. I live in Europe, and even if I lived in the US, I wouldn't want to care (and leave tons of $$$ in patent offices) about patents: the thing is to be released under GPL when the time comes. I want to protect it in such a way that it could stay free, which, as I see, involves protecting it against probable patent ventures (trying to capture those novelties the project has). Reading about the subject I see that copyright registration services (such as CRS) exist which for an affordable price would archive the state of the work reliably with their registration date. So in case someone tries to "attack" the GPL'ed work in the aforementioned way, how useful could these proofs be in proving _prior art_? (Could you think of any other effective methods for someone who has no reliable connections to release a true _printed publication_ , neither much funds, and neither lives in the US?) My goals are _solely protecting the published GPL'ed work from legal takedown_. That is as I understand patenting it might be possible that someone patents an already existing technology (in this case my published GPL'ed work), and then sues the original author (inventor) for patent infringement. I only seek for protection against this type of abuse building up some robust enough proof of _prior art_ so the work may remain free.
