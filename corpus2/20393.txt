I am having trouble with the `UnitStep` function as in the title. My problem is very simple, but I am not able to get a numerical result. I have               f1[y] = 1/(E^((-1 + y)^2/2)*Sqrt[2*Pi])          g1[y] = (1.0028877725946312*^6*UnitStep[-7.963235463105154 - y])/        E^((-1 + y)^2/2) + (0.12147136083763578*UnitStep[-7.963235463105154 + y])/           E^((-1 + y)^2/2) +               1.001393070562657*                 (0.3484061634773921*Sqrt[E^(-(-1 + y)^2/2)] +                      0.3484061634773921*Sqrt[E^(-(1 + y)^2/2)])^2*                 (-UnitStep[-7.963235463105154 + y] + UnitStep[7.963235463105154 + y])      and I want to solve the problem $$N\left[\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\sqrt{f1[y]}-\sqrt{g1[y]}\right)^2dy\right]$$ However, I did not get any result although I waited for a long time. I can plot $g1$ without any problem as well as $f1$, but I can not calculate the simple integral.
