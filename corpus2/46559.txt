Is there any simple way to zoom a particular portion of a plot (similar to what you can do with gnuplot or xmgrace using the magnifier and selecting a region)? Usually I do it by varying the `PlotRange[]` manually or by putting the `PlotRange[]` under `Manipulate[]`, but that is not very convenient option for heavy plotting (which involve complicated functions or large data). Is there anything like a magnifier tool or something similar?
