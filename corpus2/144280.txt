One way of looking at type safety is that it adds automatic tests all over your code that stop some things breaking in some ways. One of the tools that helps this in .NET is generics. However, both WinForms and WPF are generics-free. There is no `ListBox<T>` control, for example, which could only show items of the specified type. Such controls invariably operate on `object` instead. Why are generics and not popular with UI framework developers?
