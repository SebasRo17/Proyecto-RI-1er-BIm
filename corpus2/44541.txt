I am wondering why there is a difference in the results from evaluating the two expressions, which differ only in the order of the arguments given to `Show`. When I run               Animate[Show[spring[t], bob[t], traj], {t, 0, 20}]      the animation is different from               Animate[Show[traj, spring[t], bob[t]], {t, 0, 20}]      Parts of the plot get cut off, depending on the order of the arguments.
