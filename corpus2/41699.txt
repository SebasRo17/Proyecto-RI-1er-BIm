I'm trying to manipulate a plot of function with some parameters. The function is a long expression, so I tried to put it inside the Initialization options of `Manipulate`. However, once I did that, the performance is really bad, compared to one that have the function explicitly written out. Here is a simplified version: Here is the original one:               Manipulate[      DensityPlot[       Re[( C10 Exp[I 2 τ] )/(0.1 - I (ω - C10/10)) + (          C10 Exp[I 4 τ] )/(0.1 - I (ω - C10/10)) + (          C10 Exp[I 8 τ] )/(0.1 - I (ω - C10/10))], {τ,         0, π}, {ω, -0.5, 0.5}, PlotRange -> All,        PlotPoints -> 60],      {{C10, 0.5}, 0.1, 1.}]      and here is the one with definition inside `Initialization` option:               Manipulate[      DensityPlot[       f[ω, τ, C10], {τ, 0, π}, {ω, -0.5, 0.5},        PlotRange -> All, PlotPoints -> 60],      {{C10, 0.5}, 0.1, 1.},       Initialization :> {f[ω_, τ_, C10_] :=          Re[( C10 Exp[I 2 τ] )/(0.1 - I (ω - C10/10)) + (            C10 Exp[I 4 τ] )/(0.1 - I (ω - C10/10)) + (            C10 Exp[I 8 τ] )/(0.1 - I (ω - C10/10))]}]      Here is the screenshot for comparison: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ApDeZ.gif) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Rjk1.gif) They original one seems much faster than the later one. Why does this happen and how to solve it?
