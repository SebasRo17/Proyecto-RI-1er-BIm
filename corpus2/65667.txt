I'm developing an application, in iOS, that is required to connect to my Windows Server to poll for new data, update, etc. As a seasoned C# developer, my first instinct is to start a new project in Visual Studio and select _Web Service_ , letting my bias (and comfort level) dictate the service layer of my application. However, I don't want to be biased, and I don't base my decision on a service which I am _very_ familiar with, at the cost of performance.   * I would like to know what other developers have had success using, and if there is a default standard for iOS service layer development?    * Are there protocols that are easier to consume than others within iOS?    * Better ones for the size and/or compression of data?    * Is there anything wrong with using SOAP?  I know it's "big" in comparison to protocols like JSON.
