I am a 10 year PHP developer. Just recently I have taken a little bit of an interests in C# after seeing that you can build native Windows desktop programs as well as build sites like Stackoverflow. It's like the best of both worlds. Now recently I started using a text editor many know of called SublimeText which is coded with C++ and has Python embedded so that the users can create almost anything in Python and use it as a plugin for this text editor, I never seen anything like that. This got me looking into Python, as I had always thought Python was just like another language similar to PHP ( a scripting language mainly for the web) but now I am seeing that you can create Desktop programs that work on any OS, make web apps like you can in PHP so it's almost like what you can do with C# but with the added benefit of being multi- platform Now this is no way a One Language vs Another Language debate, I am simply trying to find out more about how these foreign languages to me compare:   * PHP is scripting    * Python I think is scripting    * C# has to be compiled?  Python can be used to build anything C# can? Including fast desktop applicaions, can Python application be compiled into an EXE file or how does that work to use Python program on Windows? Please help me understand I have been stuck in the PHP world for a long time I have never ventured out past Javascript, PHP web stuff Also I am aware that PHP can be used to make GUIs but from what I have read, they are not that good or it is not that good for doing them, something like that.
