My problem is quite simple yet I do not seem to figure out the solution to it. I am simply trying to export a list in _Mathematica_ , actually a list of lists of lists etc, something like `{{...,{...}},{...}}`, but the `Head` is a list. I want to export this as raw _Mathematica_ symbols so that I can access it later. Lets take a simple list, say               list = {1,a,Pi};      I am trying:               Export["listname",list,"RawData"]       and also               Export["listname",list,"Data"]      but getting the following error: > >     Export::infer: Cannot infer format of file listname. >> >   This works for other formats such as `CSV` or `TXT`.
