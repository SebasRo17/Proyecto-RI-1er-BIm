My company is looking to create an app that we'll use internally on several (about 20) BlackBerry Playbooks. We don't want it to be put up on App World because it's just an internal application. I'm wondering if there are any:   * Costs involved with this outside of paying a programmer to develop it - i.e. Are there any license fees, deployment fees, etc.   * License issues involved with deploying the app to multiple Playbooks without deploying it to App World   * Limitations on functionality of the app   * Other things we should be taking into consideration If it matters, the app will be collecting information and downloading it to a computer via USB.
