When I use jquery library I notice that the code will continue execution regardless the previous line complete the execution. More precisely while using jquery ajax, it will continue execution without waiting for the ajax result. Is this because javascript takes advantage of parallel processing? Or to which category this can be referred to. Also can we call javascript as a functional programming language.? It will be greatly appreciated if someone could explain this briefly. Thanks in advance.
