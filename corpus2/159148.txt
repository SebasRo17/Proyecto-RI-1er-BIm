I was wondering your thoughts on the best way to implement a SQL ManyToMany relationship in Java using annotations - in this case eBeans \- where there is extra data associated with the join. I have created a db diagram to help explain: ![An ERD](http://i.stack.imgur.com/brOxP.png) Using @ManyToMany on the organisation and users classes would create the join table but without the extra Job Title. Is the best way to implement this to create the Org_has_users class and use @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations? Would cascade on save ensure that I can access the full join relationships from both the Users and Organisations classes? I hope this is enough to get started. I am more interested in how you would implement this. Thanks! Anthony
