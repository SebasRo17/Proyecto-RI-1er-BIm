I am a web developer, working mostly with ASP.Net(webforms + MVC), C#, javascript and so on. As you know, continuous learning is very important for us, but time is not infinite. I do dabble with the odd technology every now and then that has nothing to do with web but mostly I try to learn more about my field in order to became better at my job. I have the opportunity to attend either a ASP.Net MVC short course or a Metro app short course and not sure which to pick. On the one hand I feel like I would already know 75% of the MVC course material so would not get as much out of it as with the Metro course. but on the other hand I ask myself how useful is a metro course going to be in my future of being a web developer. I could always dabble in it again when I have the time? So my real question is, is there any real benefit to a web developer using his time to learn Metro specifically, instead of something else like knockout.js or some other tec that could actually be of use to me in my daily work life? Thanks
