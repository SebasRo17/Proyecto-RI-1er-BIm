I would like to generate a `ListLogLinearPlot` that automatically shows all the data points. However the option `PlotRange -> All` does not achieve this. Why does `All` not include all of the data in this case? For Example:               x = Range[0.001, 1000];     y = 5 - Log[x];     ListPlot[Transpose[{x, y}], PlotRange -> All]     ListLogLinearPlot[Transpose[{x, y}], PlotRange -> All]      In the resulting plots, the `ListPlot` looks as expected: ![listplot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A9ZmL.png) but the `LisLogLinearPlot` cuts off several points on the left: ![listloglinearplot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j7esZ.png)
