I have looked at the aims of Java-script and it intends to `provide and enhanced user-interface and dynamic websites`. I am trying to get into the Web Development Business and am learning Javascript. But unfortunately, I have never seen an entire website implemented in Java script. Javascript is usually just used for Ads. People use things like PHP or ASP .NET (and C#) for serious web development. So will learning Javascript seriously enable me to make **Dynamic Websites** , and are there any good websites made with Javascript. Is Javascript a good choice for making websites? Is it even possible?
