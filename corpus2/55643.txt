I want to use `Table` to generate a list, but it only allows one iterator to increment at a time. So in               Table[i*r, {i, 0, 5}, {r, 0, 5}]      `r` will run `0` through `5` for `i = 0`, then change `i` and run through `r` again etc., giving 36 elements in a 6 x 6 array. But I want a list of only 6 elements, so that `i` and `r` are changed at the same time, in parallel. So it would give `0*0`, then `1*1`, `2*2` etc. Giving the output of:               {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25}  (* <-This is what I want. *)      Is this possible with `Table` or anything else? Also I know I could do:               Table[i*i, {i,0,5}]      But this is just an example, and in my project this way won't work. Also if at all possible I would like to use a list for one iterator's values, but this isn't so important.
