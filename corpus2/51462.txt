What I'm trying to achieve is model of the heat flow, in this case for the simplest 1D case,its relatively easy to do for the steady state case, but when I try to do it with NDsolve so I get the distribution of heat over time,I fail to come up with a good way to connect the two differential equaions, I recently modeled a gravity field where the same differential equation is applied many times to different bodies, that I got to work, but I dont understand how to link "differeet" ODE/PDE's This is my code, so far, and I intend to display that solution with Manipulate and Plot: :ps I added the [] in u[1] and u[2] last minute to see if it changes anything before they were just called u1[] and u2[] respectively, it might be nonsensical but my original question remains thanks in advance!               heateqs = {D[u[1][x, t], t] == D[u[1][x, t], {x, 2}],         D[u[2][x, t], t] == 0.5 D[u[2][x, t], {x, 2}]};          bcs = {u[1][0, t] == 300, u[1][5, t] == u[2][5, t],         Derivative[1, 0][u[2]][10, t] == 0};          ics = {u[1][x, 0] == u[2][x, 0] == 0};          sol = NDSolve[{heateqs, bcs, ics}, u, {x, 0, 10}, {t, 0, 10}]          NDSolve::bcedge: Boundary condition u[1][5,t]==u[2][5,t] is not specified on a single edge of the boundary of the computational domain. >>
