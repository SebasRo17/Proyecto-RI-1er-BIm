Many of my notebooks have a similar repeating structure, which is very convenient and reliable for my workflow: a chunk of code defining a `Manipulate` for exploring some phenomenon, the output of the `Manipulate`, where the phenomenon can be explored, and then some notes or observations about the phenomenon. When I'm focused on coding, this is fine, but as my focus shifts to the phenomenon itself, the code is distracting and takes up a lot of space, so I'd like to be able to hide or collapse it. Is there a way to hide or toggle the visibility of code, independently of the results it produces? In effect, what I'm seeking is there _reverse_ of the default behavior, in which code and results that are grouped together can be collapsed to show just the code. Note that I'm not seeking a way to move the code elsewhere: the point is the be able to easily move back and forth between having the code behind some data or visualization visible, and associated with the output, and having it hidden or collapsed.
