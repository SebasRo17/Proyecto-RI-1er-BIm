Given a `DSolve` example:               sol = Flatten[     DSolve[{D[x[t, th], {t, 2}] == -0.2*D[x[t, th], t]/2.30,       Derivative[1, 0][x][0, th] == 10.8*Cos[th], x[0, th] == 0},      x[t, th], t]]      Then assigning `sol` to a function:                x[t,th]/.sol[[1]]      I'm having trouble plotting a 2D portion of it:               Plot[x[t,1],{t,0,20}]      And also trouble Manipulating it:               Manipulate[x[t,th], {th, 0, Pi/2}]      What mistakes am I making?
