So I have a small setup file that needs to install a few run-time files. The files are located within sub directories of the root of the drive. The drive letter will be different on every customers machine, so I was trying this and several other methods to no avail.                           // File is being ran from D:\ "eg: D:\setup.exe"                 // All my runtimes are in the Tools\Runtime direcorties                 string path = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();                 string ext = "/q /norestart";                 string location = "\\Tools\\Runtimes\\Net\\";                 string step1 = "dotnetfx35.exe";                 var process = Process.Start(path + location + step1 + ext);                 process.WaitForExit();      As you pros and more experienced programmers know, for some reason... It doesn't work I keep getting file not found.
