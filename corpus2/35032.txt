My current code is:               data = {{0.1, 0.1, 2}, {0.1, 0.2, 1}, {0.2, 0.1, 1}, {0.2, 0.2, 2}};     ListContourPlot[data, Mesh -> None, PlotRange -> All,       InterpolationOrder -> 3,       ColorFunction -> ColorData[{"LakeColors", "Reverse"}]]      It produces the following figure: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ju78p.png) I want to scale the linear x and y axes to a log scale without converting to log units. There is a ListLogLogPlot function but no corresponding ListLogLogContourPlot function. I have read several relevant threads:   * How does one set a logarithmic scale in a ContourPlot?: How does one set a logarithmic scale in a ContourPlot?   * Scale ContourPlot axes: http://forums.wolfram.com/mathgroup/archive/2006/Jun/msg00585.html However, they are all for ContourPlot rather than ListContourPlot. I tried to use way suggested by How does one set a logarithmic scale in a ContourPlot?:               data = {{0.1, 0.1, 2}, {0.1, 0.2, 1}, {0.2, 0.1, 1}, {0.2, 0.2, 2}};     pl = Normal@       ListContourPlot[data, Mesh -> None, PlotRange -> All,         InterpolationOrder -> 3,         ColorFunction -> ColorData[{"LakeColors", "Reverse"}]]     ListLogLogPlot[Cases[pl, Line[a_, b___] :> a, Infinity],       Joined -> True, Frame -> True, PlotRange -> All, AspectRatio -> 1,       PlotStyle -> ColorData[1][2]]      However, it only produces the following, in which the density color background is lost, leaving only lines: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/o7e0U.png) The way suggested by http://forums.wolfram.com/mathgroup/archive/2006/Jun/msg00585.html by using FrameTicks functions seems promising. But, it is for ContourPlot. I do not know how to adopt it to be used in ListContourPlot. Helps are much appreciated.
