I want to learn new things. Initially I was a PHP programmer. Then I thought it was not enough. Then I started learning Java thing. It took me 3 months to learn. Java, J2EE, Spring, Hibernte, Spring Security, Spring Roo and many design patterns MVC and stuff like AOP, DI . I never knew that before but I got the idea what J2EE. After 3 months, I just made a simple page with Registration form integrated with Spring Security. I wanted to make one complete project in it but that was too much for me and I didn't want spend more time on it as then i need to host that as well so I left that. Then I started learning Python and made few sys admin scripts and then Django and now I am finishing a complete web app in Python. Now I want to learn C++, but before that I need to find out what i can do with it. Just like I know Python is very useful because I have my own servers so I can write scripting and websites so Python is good for me. But I am confused in which areas C++ can help me. I don't want to end up like I have with Java where either I have big projects or nothing for day to day use.
