I need to maximize this function on the positive real line: $$ \frac{1}{\Gamma(x)^{14}}\cdot\frac{1}{{\frac{323.6}{14x}}^{14x}}\cdot(1.22578*10^{19})^{x-1}e^{-14x} $$ the correct answer should be around $x=514$, but I could not use mathematica to show it. My plot has a peak at $x=680$ instead. I want to ask if anyone has any idea how to get the correct answer. The code I am using now is:               A = 1/Gamma[x]^{14}*(301.6/(14*x))^{-14 *x}*(1.22578*10^{19})^{x -1} E^{-14 x}      and I plot it by               Plot[A, {x, 513, 700}, PlotPoints -> 1000]      The result is something very strange: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KWqRb.png)
