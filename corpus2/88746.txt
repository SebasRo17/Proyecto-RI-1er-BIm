I have seen some horrible code in my time including people virtually duplicating the code in comments               // add 4 to x     x+=4;          // for each i in 0 to 9      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {         // multiply x by i         x *= i;     }      Taking this concept further, I'm curious whether prose to code compilers exist.   * Is there a valid use case for English prose to code?   * Do compilers exist that do this? The distinction between this and auto generated code, is that auto generated code is generally always a subset of a project. Can we have complete projects auto generated from english prose? I realise that this might overlap with the concept of declarative languages.
