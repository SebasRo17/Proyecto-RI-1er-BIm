I have a non-linear integral equation that I'd like to solve with _Mathematica_ : $$ \int_{0}^{1} \mathrm{d}x \frac{B(x) v}{(B(x) + B(v))^2} = 1$$               Solve[Integrate[B[x] v / (B[x] + B[v])^2, {x, 0, 1}] == 1, B[v], {v}]      This problem comes up in an exotic problem from auction theory where I want to find the optimal bidding function `B[v]` for `v` in `[0,1]`. Is there any way to get a solution to this problem in _Mathematica_? Closed-form solutions are preferred (duh!) but a plot of a numerical one is also OK.
