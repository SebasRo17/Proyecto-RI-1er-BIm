There are benefits to each, and I understand the differences - but what is considered best / standard practice? Why? `"myString".equals(myStringVar)`   * Avoids a potential NPE and does not require a null check. (Good thing?)   * Cleaner to read since a null check is not required.   * If null is not an expected value, your program could be breaking without being any the wiser. `myStringVar.equals("myString")`   * Requires a null check if null is an expected value. (Good thing?)   * Can clutter up compound conditionals with null checks.   * Allows for NPE to let us know if something has broken.
