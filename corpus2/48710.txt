I am using Mathematica 9. If I evaluate               Integrate[Piecewise[{{1 - r, r > 0 && r < R}}, 0], r]      then I get               Piecewise[{{r - r^2/2, r > 0 && r - R < 0}}, 0]      This is wrong, because for $r>R$ it should evaluate $R-\frac{R^2}{2}$ instead of $0$. I get the correct result, if I plug in R manually. Is this a Bug? Here is some minimal test code to visualize the problem               t1[r_] = Integrate[Piecewise[{{1 - r, r > 0 && r < R}}, 0], r]     t2[r_] = Integrate[Piecewise[{{1 - r, r > 0 && r < 1}}, 0], r]     Plot[{t1[r] //. R -> 1}, {r, -0.5, 2}]     Plot[{t2[r] //. R -> 1}, {r, -0.5, 2}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/143g7.png) The plots and the function definitions are only to visualize the problem.   * This problem also appears in a similar way when integrating UnitBox[R r]   * When using HeavisideTheta[R-Abs[r]] it doesn't even evaluate   * When using UnitStep[1-Abs[r]] and UnitStep[R-Abs[r]] both will result in the "wrong" evaluation   * Trying to use t[x_]=Integrate[...,{r,0,x}] will only make it worse, as I have to abort the evaluation after a minute or more. (same with := instead of =) I think this question is related Integral with HeavisideTheta takes too long to evaluate
