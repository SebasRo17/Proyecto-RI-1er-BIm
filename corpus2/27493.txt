I want to paste an image on the surface of a 3D plot. For example consider this image ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JpK4.jpg)which I want to paste on the surface of this sphere               ContourPlot3D[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 == 1, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1}, Mesh -> 1]      What will be the best way to do that? ## EDIT and Clarification My main objective is not to make a globe but to find a general way to use any arbitrary image on a surface. I choose the map and sphere just as an example (a popular one). `Texture` is a good option, but I find some difficulty to use it with `ContourPlot3D` or `Plot3D`. To make my point clear, I would request to show me an example with this image ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XVgk0.jpg) and the following surface,               Plot3D[Abs[x y], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]
