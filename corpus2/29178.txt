I would like to implement the recurrence relation for the polynomials $U_n(x)$ appearing in the large order asymptotics of the Bessel functions. The recurrence in question is $$U_{n+1}(x)=\frac{1}{2}x^2(1-x^2)U_n^{\prime}(x)+\frac{1}{8}\int_{0} ^x(1-5t^2)U_n(t)dt,$$ with $U_0(x)=1$. I saw implementations for recursions for polynomials, but this one involves integration and differentiation. Any idea? Thank you very much in advance!
