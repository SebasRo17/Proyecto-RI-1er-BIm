I have a new site/app going live next week (or somewhere close). I know there will be a relatively small (15,000?) very dedicated group of people on Facebook who will be very likely to be interested in the site, so I know I need Facebook integration of some kind. I won't be doing Facebook logins or pulling/posting to profiles yet, but I plan to... The question:   * Do I just do a Facebook "Page" for now? This is faster/easier to set up and seems a little less buggy.. and then migrate to a Facebook App later? or   * Do I create a "Facebook App" (with the api key/id/secret, etc.) now even if I'm doing nothing but using the "like" button. This means I don't have any migration later and I can use the javascript api to log "like" button clicks to Google Analytics, etc. Thoughts? Experiences? Is there a migration process to move your old Page users to your new "App"? What's the advantages / disadvantages of each.
