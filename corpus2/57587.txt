I'm currently writing a small desktop application for a friend, but I'm doing it primarily as a learning experience for myself. In the spirit of getting educated and doing things The Right Way, I want to have version numbers for this app. My research brought up these related results   * What "version naming convention" do you use?   * How do you version your files (Version Numbers)   * Forked a project, where do my version numbers start? but none of them address numbering of alphas, betas, release candidates, &c. **What are the conventions for version numbers below 1.0?** I know they can go on for some time; for example, PuTTY has been around for at least a decade and is still only at version beta 0.60.
