I would like to import data from this page through Mathematica, http://www.oddsportal.com/soccer/netherlands/eredivisie/ . I tried importing through the default Import function               d = Import["http://www.oddsportal.com/soccer/netherlands/eredivisie/","Data"[[3, 1, 1, 2]];     Select[d, ! StringFreeQ[#[[1]], " - "] &] // Quiet // TableForm      I got a simular table like this where all the interessting data is replaced by a '-'.               Heracles - Cambuur      -   -   -     Willem II - AZ Alkmaar  -   -   -     Heerenveen - Excelsior  -   -   -     G.A. Eagles - Dordrecht -   -   -     Zwolle - Vitesse        -   -   -     Breda - Twente          -   -   -     Den Haag - Groningen    -   -   -     Feyenoord - Utrecht     -   -   -     Ajax - PSV              -   -   -      I've been told this is because the webpage updates the data through a JavaScript, that fetches the information form a database. So is there a way of letting the webpage load it's data before importing it? Futhermore, I found a solution for Windows users, where the webpage is loaded with Internet Explorer by NETLink. But since I mostly use a OSX machine, this won't work for me.               Needs["NETLink`"];     InstallNET[];     ie = CreateCOMObject["InternetExplorer.Application"];     ie@Navigate[     "http://www.oddsportal.com/soccer/netherlands/eredivisie/"];     Pause[3];     doc = ie@Document;     html = doc@body@innerHTML;      This made able to construct a table with all the data, after combing through the html code.               AZ Alkmaar - Ajax       2.96    3.47    2.26     Excelsior - G.A. Eagles 2.38    3.37    2.86     Utrecht - Willem II     2.19    3.4     3.16     Groningen - Heracles    1.7     4.      4.41      So again, is there a way of executing the JavaScript on a page before importing the data? Maybe through a JLink equivalent of the code above?
