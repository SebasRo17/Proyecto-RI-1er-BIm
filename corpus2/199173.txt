For example I have the following. The inputs are on the left. The outputs are on the right. The second term in the input which is the number 3 is the number of output numbers I want. It would be really useful if there was a program which given this pattern could just give me the code written to produce it. Is there such a thing?               0 3 -> 0 1 2     1 3 -> 3 1 2     2 3 -> 3 4 2     3 3 -> 3 4 5     4 3 -> 6 4 5     5 3 -> 6 7 5     ...
