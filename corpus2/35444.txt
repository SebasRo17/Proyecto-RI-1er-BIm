I am trying to make a series of changes in the appearance of the Plot of some function. I am trying to use Manipulate for my experiments. I tried to change the following code `Manipulate[ Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, Pi}], {p, HoldForm /@ Options[Plot]}, {q, InputField}]` so that when, for example, p is AxesOrigin ->Automatic and q is changed to {-3,5} then the plot will be updated with Axes Origin at {-3,5}. Similar if p is taken AxesLabeL->None and p is changed to "A label" then the last plot will refreshed showing the label "A label" at the top(without affecting any changes already made in other options like AxesOrigin above).
