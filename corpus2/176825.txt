Imagine you have such routines               /*just do X. Fail if any precondition is not met*/     doX()          /*take care of preconditions and then do X*/     takeCareOfPreconditionsCheckIfNeededAtAllAndThenDoX()       A little bit more concrete example:               /*create directory. Most probably fail with error if any precondition is not met (folder already exists, parent does not exists)*/     createDirectory(path_name)          /*take care of preconditions (creates full path till folder if needed, checks if not exists yet) and then creates the directory*/     CheckIfNotExistsYet_CreateDirectory_andFullPathIfNeeded(path_name)      How do you name such routines, so it would be clear what does what?       I have come to some my own "convetion" like:               naiveCreateDirectory, ForceDirectoryExists, ...      But I imagine this is very standard situation. Maybe there already exists some norms/convetions for this?
