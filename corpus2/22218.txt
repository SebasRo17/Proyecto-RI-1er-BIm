Has anyone done multinomial logistic regression in _Mathematica_? The binomial case is essentially done on the `LogitModelFit` documentation page and works fine. I am following this formulation to obtain the outcome probabilities for k classes with k-1 calls to `LogitModelFit`. I am getting normalized probabilities out, but they depend on how the classes are encoded for each independent regression. I can post what I have on request but it's a lot of code for something that isn't working. Either multiple-binary or true multinomial would be fine for my purposes, but bonus for both implementations.
