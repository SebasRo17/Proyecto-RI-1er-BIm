I start a job this summer doing work in ASP.NET 4 (C#). I plan on working with some legacy code as well as MVC. I want to get a running start. I have good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript, and pretty good understanding of C# itself, Design principles, Design Patterns, and understand masterpages, basic MVC2, and code behinds for web forms.   * In your opinion what aspects of ASP.NET are the most important to master for web applications?    * What do you value most in your usage of ASP.NET?    * Do you have a recommendation for understanding the internals of ASP.NET itself?
