I am kind of new in agile environment since I always participated in projects before which was only said to be agile while it wasn't. Now I am really in an agile project and I see a setback - if it is setback - of agile methodology, the lack of pre-planning. I see that our BA talks to key users, collects data, which are pretty much just a sketch what they really want. Then we first need to refactor many of things because the real needs are a little bit different. Then there is a second phase when we realize they need a bigger system we expected, following that we need to make bigger refactor and generalize everything afterwards. My questions are: **Is this the way it should be? Given by the information are we doing it in the good way? And if the answer yes, then does the low planning costs match with the higher refactoring and rewriting costs? So to say: profitable?**
