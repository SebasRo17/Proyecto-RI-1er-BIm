Is there a way to play the role of Javascript with any other language like C#? One way came up in my head is, having silverlight installed, using C# instead of Javascript for all the client side scripting (Though C# is not a scripting language). Is it possible? I am not talking about something like GWT(Java) or Script#(C#). Probably the question can be stated as- "With silverlight installed, can I do everything supported by Javascript(like DOM manipulation etc) with C#?" Hope it's clearer.
