I've been trying to write an algorithm that will print separately the digits from an integer. I have to write it in Pseudocode. I know how to write an algorithm that reverse the digits.               digi(n):        while n != 0:         x = n % 10          n = n // 10          print (x)      But I don't know how to write an algorithm to print the digits in the correct order. For example, the input is integer `123467` and the output is: `1 2 3 4 6 7`. The numbers will be input from the user, and we cannot convert them to a string. I need help getting started on writing algorithms.
