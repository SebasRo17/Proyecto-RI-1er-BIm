Say I am building a website that uses two different types of data :   * Static : information that will hardly change, like movie awards or world countries names (I want fast access so no external API)   * Dynamic : information entered by users I have not written a single line of code yet. My static db is more likely to be quite large but will not change overtime. As for the dynamic db I have no idea yet but I might need scalability. Should I use different databases in the long run ? Is it common practice to do so ?
