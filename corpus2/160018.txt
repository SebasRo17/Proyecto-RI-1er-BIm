I've created a pretty simple templating framework and have default implementations for some of my interfaces used for passing around information. I store these in MyFramework.Default namespace However, I am unsure of where to place example implementations, such as a template that creates a concrete class. This template seems like it would be useful to people who use my framework, but I am not sure if it belongs in a separate assembly, or perhaps a namespace within the framework. If it's a namespace, is there any convention for its name?
