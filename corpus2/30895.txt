Documentation of v9 states that `ParametricFunction` is generated by `ParametricNDSolve` and `ParametricNDSolveValue`. Is there any way of creating `ParametricFunction` by definition, similar to creating an `InterpolatingFunction` by `Interpolation`? My motivation behind is that for certain parameters, I need solution of `ParametricNDSolveValue` to be returned and for other parameters I want to use analytical solution to be returner in the same format -`ParametricFunction`.
