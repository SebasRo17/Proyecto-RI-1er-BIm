I have code which inserts an expression into lists that I need to remove. I can insert anything I want, a string, variable, or number, into the lists. Suppose I insert the number 13 as my blacklisted element and have a list like               l={12, 14 y, 13, 13 x, 13 x -y}        I then implement               Select[l, # != 13 &]      but the output is               12        My desired output in this case would have been               {12, 14 y, 13 x, 13 x -y}      I've created a working solution that doesn't feel as elegant as it could be, with now a string blacklist element "13"               Select[{12, 14 y, "13", 13 x, 13 x - y}, Not@StringMatchQ[ToString[#], "13"] &]      which gives the desired output. Is it possible to refine the original attempt at a solution to work a bit more simply?
