I recently accepted a job where I will be working with the IL a lot(on the team of a certain obfuscator that's included with Visual Studio). They know I have little knowlegde of it, so I'll have some time to learn it on the job. But, I want to get a bit of a jump start on it in the interim. For my background, I've never wrote any IL and read very little of it. I do understand what it is though and such. I know x86 assembly and such as well, so I'm not dumb as far as assembly-type code goes. But anyway, what are some good ways of getting familiar with IL and learning the usual opcodes and such and also how it's garbage collection and such magically works at an assembly level?
