I have a software patterns exam this week and one of the topics we are to study is Efferent and Afferent coupling. I understand a package has a high Ce (efferent coupling) if it depends on a number of other types. For example:               class Car{         Engine engine;         Wheel wheel;         Body body;     }      This class would have a high efferent coupling because it depends on the Engine, Wheel and Body types. Whereas the type "Wheel" would have a high Ca (afferent coupling) if several other packages depended on it (Car, Plane, Bicycle). One of the possible questions on our exam is, when is Efferent / Afferent coupling good or bad? This seems odd to me because logically a program would need packages / classes with both high Efferent / Afferent coupling. Does anybody have an example of when / where high efferent or afferent coupling is good / bad?? Thanks !
