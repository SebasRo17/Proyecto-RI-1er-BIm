I am trying to understand the concept of using 3rd party web API. From what I understand so far, web API look like regular URLs with some parameters etc. Will the client program need to download and install any package/bundle etc from the website/server etc providing APIs and include it with their product or no bundle is needed to download from service provider. the client program just uses the web API URLs (like how we do it in browser) What are the variants in common use? Does it boil down to how much we want to do on client side and how much we want to do on server side? like not downloading anything from web API service provider means everything happens on web API provider side..
