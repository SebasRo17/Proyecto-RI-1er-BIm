I'm 15, and I was talking to my friends about what we wanted our future careers to be. I told them that I would like to have a job in the computer science industry (more specifically software development), and in my free time develop indie games that I could sell on the Android store to pull in a bit more cash. They told me that the contract for lots of jobs will say something like: "As long as you are working for us, you cannot develop anything outside of what you are developing for us", or, even worse, "You can no longer develop anything by yourself for the REST OF YOUR LIFE!!!". I'd never heard anything like this before and it has me a little concerned. So my question would be, do lots of careers in the computer science industry make you have to accept this kind of stuff? About how many jobs would make you sign this contract? And perhaps a little more specific info. on what this contract really means? EDIT: Right now I live in Ontario, Canada. Let's assume this is also where I will be living when I become an adult. I do not in fact live in an igloo ;)
