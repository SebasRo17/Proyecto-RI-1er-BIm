I have a difficult client. Every bill is argued and debated over, and each email is parsed with a lawyers eye (because he's a lawyer), looking for a way to avoid paying for something. No amount of generosity on my part is ever reciprocated. The client currently has 60% of his bills unpaid (these are invoices he signed off on), and it is a substantial amount of money. How it got to this stage, admittedly is a product of my own naïveté. Since the client hosts his own code, I can't shut off the hosting and demand payment. **Is it legal to install a remote "Kill Switch" to shut down the customers code unless bills are paid?**
