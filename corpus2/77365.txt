The library that I'm working on has a parameter which defines priority of a certain process. I want the interface to be as clear as possible, but it seems that different people have opposite interpretations of priority values.               1. Lowest number has highest priority (1 - highest priority, 10 - lowest priority)     2. Highest number has highest priority (1 - lowest priority, 10 - highest priority)      Which way do you think is more natural/logical?
