In the Version 10 interface, at least by default, there is no longer a common menu bar in a separate window, and menus appear to be localized to individual Notebook windows. If I select a Palette and attempt to use the menu in an adjacent Notebook, specifically **Generate Notebook from Palette** , the Palette loses focus and that menu item is disabled.   1. Can I restore the common menu bar from earlier versions?   2. If not what is the fastest and simplest way to apply these commands?   3. When is the **Generate Notebook from Palette** item not disabled? I have been unable to use it.
