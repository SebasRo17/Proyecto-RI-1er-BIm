I'm majoring in computer science in college, and I'm currently in summer program for a business minor. With the schedule and all the outside group projects and studying its impossible for me to really program, and I'll only have a short time free before the start of Fall semester. To make matters worse, I've been told my education path—with my business focus—will start to downplay the importance of programming for the rest of my time at school, further atrophying my programming skills. I'd like to apply for software development internships over the summer, but it doesn't seem likely I'll be able to land any when other candidates have spent much more of their time programming. Am I overemphasizing the importance of knowing programming front-to-back for intern/entry level positions, or is it really necessary to focus most of my time to programming, at the expense of other things I want to do (like have a social life)?
