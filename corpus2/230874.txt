I am looking forward to build a media player with java, and basically what I found was JMF. But, then again, this API is not upto date and doesn't support latest formats such as `MKV`. On more research, I stumbled upon http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10440152/any-simple-and-up-to-date-java- frameworks-for-embedding-movies-within-a-swing Got all excited, but then digging some more, left me with this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8153227/adding-other-video-codecs-dvd- support-to-javafx-2-2 Now, I am disappointed and in a fix that how all the good media players (VLC, KMPlayer etc) been able to support all video and audio formats. They must be build using a programming language, IMHO ! So, my question would be, in-order to build a `complete media player` which supports `all kind of media files`:   1. Is `JAVA` incompetent ?   2. Has one ever build a good media player using `JAVA` ?   3. If Java can't, how are their so many media players on `android`, with all video support ?   4. Is it just Java or no modern language can do it ?   5. Do I have rely and choose C, C++ to do this ?
