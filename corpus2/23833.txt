I want to find vertices (has integer coordinates) of the triangle $ABC$ with the centorid is $G(1,1)$ and orthocenter is $H(3,3)$. I tried               a = {x1, y1};     g = {1, 1};     h = {3, 3};     b = {x2, y2};     c = {x3, y3};     Solve[{x1 + x2 + x3 == 3 g[[1]],        y1 + y2 + y3 == 3 g[[2]], (h - a).(c - b) == 0, (h - b).(c - a) ==         0, -20 < x1 < 20, -20 < y1 < 20, -20 < x2 < 20, -20 < y2 < 20,        x2*y3 - x1*y3 + x1*y2 - y2*x3 + y1*x3 - y1*x2 != 0}, {x1, y1, x2,        y2, x3, y3}, Integers]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HPZjB.gif) There are some duplicate triangles. How to delete this duplicate triangles?
