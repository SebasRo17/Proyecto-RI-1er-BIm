...or, in other words: When sending a mail programmatically, do I really need to go through the hassle of setting the correct MIME type or can I just use `application/octet-stream`? The mail clients I tested all do "the right thing" based on the file extension, even if the MIME type is just the generic `application/octet- stream`, so why bother? I know that it is considered "good practice". I'm asking out of scientific curiosity, because I want to know if it makes a practical difference or not.
