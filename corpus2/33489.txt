I'm trying to simulate Fraunhofer diffraction by a single slit using `DensityPlot` I run the code:               DensityPlot[(Sinc[β])^2, {β, -6 π, 6 π}, {y, -6 π, 6 π}, PlotPoints -> 200,                 ColorFunction -> GrayLevel, AspectRatio -> 9/16, Frame :> False]      and get: ![Image](http://i.imgur.com/iGkhRtX.png?1) Which is great but I'd like the coloring to be based on a red scale so that the "lightest" areas are bright red which corresponds to a 632.8 nm He-Ne Laser. The following image shows the type of red scale I'd like to mimic: ![Red](http://tsgphysics.mit.edu/pics/Q%20Diffraction/Q2-Single-Slit- Diffraction.jpg) Thanks
