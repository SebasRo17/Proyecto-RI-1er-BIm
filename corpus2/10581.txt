Should items like Foreign Keys, Constraints, Default Values, and so on be handled by the database management system (in this case, MS SQL 2005) or the application? I have heard opinions from both sides and I'm honestly not sure which way to go. There is a chance we will be spanning multiple servers/databases and I don't think Foreign Keys can be used across linked servers. In addition to that, there are some circular references in the database design which prevents me from using `ON UPDATE CASCADE` on everything. The database is MS SQL 2005 (possibly 2008) and all interactions with it should go through the application.
