It bothers me to see commented out code and it seems often-times a symptom of developers not being proficient in advanced source control features, but on the other hand source control does not really go all the way in solving the problem that commenting out is intended for. I've occasionally seen requirements flip-flop in such a way that code that would have been deleted suddenly is needed again. If the code is really deleted, there doesn't seem to be a clear procedure for locating exactly where to find that deleted code in source control. Is there a better way out there to save developer work that may be needed again besides the tried-and-true "commenting out"?
