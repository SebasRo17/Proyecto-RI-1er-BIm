While searching through many javascript libraries/frameworks, I observed that the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. So, conceptually is it important to distinguish between framework and library? Do people seriously make their decisions based on whether it is a library or framework? Would a user like to browse two separate areas - libraries and frameworks while looking for a solution?
