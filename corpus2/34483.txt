I am trying to calculate some thermodynamical cycles so I often use lists with equations. Here's a simple example:               list1 = {          x + 2 y == z,          z - 2 x == 3z,          y - z == 5 x}          Solve[list1,{x,y,z}]      > >     {{x -> 0, y -> 0, z -> 0}} >   The problem appears when I want to use the calculated values of `x,y,z` later on to calculate some other parameters. _Mathematica_ every time keeps returning `x,y or z` instead of its numerical value. Is that because the result of `Solve` is a nested list? Anyway, what should I do to have an access to these values?
