I have a large amount of data available (in excel), which is not very organised. I can do this by copy paste, but I am trying to do this using mathematica. Hopefully someone can help me. I imported the data, and it is now organised in a matrix that looks like this:               test = {{{dog, 5}, {"", ""}, {"", ""}}, {{cat, 7}, {dog, 2}, {"", ""}}, {{dog,3},{horse, 2}, {cat, 1}}, {{horse, 7}, {cat, 2}, {dog, 1}}};     TableForm[test]      So on day one, they counted 5 dogs, but no other animals, on day 2 they counted 7 cats, and 2 dogs, day 3: one horse, 2 cats etc.. To analyse this data I want to create a table that gives for each day, the amount of animals but then organised in columns per animal (even if the animal is not present at that day) like this:               result = {{"dog", "cat", "horse"} , {5, "", ""}, {2, 7, ""}, {3, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 7}};     TableForm[result]      I tried somethings using `pick` and `sort` but could not figure out how to do this. Of course this example is very simple, but the real data are for a 978x15 table (and does not involve animals ;) )
