I'd like to control the appearance of the components of a `TabView[]` control. Such a control appears constructed of `Button`s, `ButtonBar`, and `Panel`. Some examples follow to illustrate my problem.               appearances = {"DialogBox", "Palette", "FramedPalette", "Frameless"};     Button[1, Print[1], Appearance -> #] & /@ appearances     ButtonBar[{1 :> Print[1], 2 :> Print[2]}, Appearance -> #] & /@ appearances     TabView[{a, b}, Appearance -> #] & /@ appearances      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Plqbd.png) In the above code I can change the appearances of an individual `Button[]` but not buttons in a `ButtonBar[]` or a `TabView[]`.               Button[1, Print[1], Background -> Yellow]      ButtonBar[{1 :> Print[1], 2 :> Print[2]}, Background -> Yellow]      TabView[{a, b}, Background -> Yellow]       ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R0knv.png) The above presents a similar problem. Note that in the `ButtonBar[]` you can see a yellow halo around the entire control. Finally:               Panel[a, ImageSize -> 100, Background -> Yellow]     TabView[{a, b}, ImageSize -> 100, Background -> Yellow]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cZgjN.png) A similar problem, I can affect `Panel[]` but not the panel component of a `TabView[]`. So, does anyway exist to reach settings that affect the component levels of a complex control? Any workarounds appreciated. ... As this seems relevant, I run version 9 on OS X.
