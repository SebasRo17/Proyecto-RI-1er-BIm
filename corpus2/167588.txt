I'm interested in functional programming and decided to get head to head with Haskell. My head hurts... but I'll eventually get it... I have one curiosity though, why is the syntax so cryptic (in lack of another word)? Is there a reason **why it isn't more expressive** , more close to human language? I understand that FP is good at modelling mathematical concepts and it borrowed some of it's concise means of expression, but still it's not math... it's a language.
