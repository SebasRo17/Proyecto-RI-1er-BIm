What is the recommended way for a lower level software component/module to communicate with the GUI? I'm using C++. I have a service layer class that if some conditions occur needs to notify the user, but still continue processing. In the case of an unrecoverable error I understand that I can use exceptions to bubble up to the GUI, but what about in the case of a simple message that needs to be communicated to the user where the lower level component continues executing? **UPDATE** Just to clarify the service layer (aka business logic, compute layer, etc) does not "know" about the GUI nor do I want it to.
