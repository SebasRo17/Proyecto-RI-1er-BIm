I am using VB.net to write a parallel based code. I use _Parallel.For_ to generate pairs of 500 objects or in combination C(500,2) such as the following code; but I found that it didn't always generate all combinations which should be 124750 (shown from variable Counter). No other thread was runing when this code was run. I am using a Win-7 32 Bit desktop with Intel Core i5 CPU 650@3.2GHz, 3.33 GHz and RAM 2GB. What's wrong with the code and how to solve this problem? Thank You.                   Dim Counter As Integer = 0         Parallel.For(0, 499, Sub(i)                          For j As Integer = i + 1 To 499                              Counter += 1                              Console.Write(i & ":" & j)                          Next                      End Sub)         Console.Writeline("Iteration number: " & Counter)
