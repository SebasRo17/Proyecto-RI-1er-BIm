I'm making an IRC bot in PHP. And I've come to the point when I need to determine how would user permissions/accesses would look in the database (and in the application in general). Here are the requirements:   * There are global and local permissions, global are for all channels, while local are channel specfiic.   * There are permissions such as "root", "bot_admin" "glob_op" "op on #channel", in this example, each is weaker than the last (root is strongest, meaning that no one can take actions against root).   * I haven't completely decided on exactly how many permissions are there, and the bot will be extensible, so there needs to be an option of expanding. Some approaches I had in mind:   * Assign each permission level a number (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and add them together to form the access level of a specific user (even adding all of the numbers until `n-1`, they would still be lower than `n`). As for expanding, I could leave gaps (1, 16, 256, etc) and fill it in later. I don't think it's a very good one, as it would be hard to maintain and read later on, even if I use constants to make it more readable.   * Have each permission in its own boolean column. That seems just silly, and there's no easy way of determining the power relations between each role. So what say you? Have a better approach I can take?
