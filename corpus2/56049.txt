Given a (rather complicated) function `H(z)`, what is the best approach to check symbolically whether it is holomorphic? What I tried is checking explicitly the Cauchy-Riemann equations(*):               z = a + I b          H = E^-Sqrt[z^2] / (Sqrt[z^2] + Sqrt[z^2] Cosh[Sqrt[z^2]] + Sqrt[z^2] Sinh[Sqrt[z^2]])          HRe = FullSimplify[ComplexExpand[Re[H]], (a | b) ∈ Reals]     HIm = FullSimplify[ComplexExpand[Im[H]], (a | b) ∈ Reals]     HReA = Assuming[(a | b) ∈ Reals, D[HRe, a]]     HReA = Simplify[HReA, (a | b) ∈ Reals]     HImB = Assuming[(a | b) ∈ Reals, D[HIm, b]]     HImB = Simplify[HImB, (a | b) ∈ Reals]     Simplify[HReA == HImB, (a | b) ∈ Reals]      What I would expect as a result is either just `True` or some equation that `a` and `b` need to satisfy in order for the _CR_ equations to be fulfilled. This would mean that my function is not holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane. The problem that I encounter is that the call to `Simplify` does not complete computation in a reasonable amount of time (> 1 hour, then I aborted it). Checking whether `HRe` and `HIm` are harmonic (which is a necessary condition for `H` to be holomorphic) did not seem to be any easier, with the second derivatives of `H` being even longer. Is there a way to speed this up, or even a completely different approach? The derivatives are so long that a manual inspection is not an option. (*) Note that as correctly pointed out by murray below, the Cauchy-Riemann DEs being fulfilled alone does not already imply holomorphy. Additional properties need to be given, e.g. continuity of H or continuity of its derivatives.
