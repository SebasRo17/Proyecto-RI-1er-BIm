This is how my team has it's development environment set up:   1. Each team member has a local development environment on their own computer, where they check out the code from a shared repository.   2. Every developer work in their local development environment, once they finished writing the code they commit back.   3. The code is then checked out to a staging/testing server with the same environment setup   4. If everything is OK, it will be pushed to a production server. We're trying to integrate unit testing and BDD (behavior driven development) into this setup and we'd like to use a continuous integration server (Jenkins) too. My question is where should we install this and where should we test the code?   1. Install the full testing stack for each developer: TDD tools + BDD tools + Jenkins?   2. Install the test tools only on the staging/testing server and only test code here once each developer made his/her code commit? How is your setup?
