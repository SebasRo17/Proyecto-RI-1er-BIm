I am trying to create an expansion of the form               f[x,y]->Sum[Cn[x] y^n,{n,1,order}]      To replace the function `f` by the coefficients `cn`. Since the function `f` appears in a differential equation, it is useful to get this to work as a set of replacement rules for a pure function, such that the function `f` and all its derivatives are replaced. Something like this works:               f->((c0[#1]+c1[#1] #2+c2[#1]#2^2)&)      Curiously, this expression doesn't               f->(( Sum[c[[n]][#1] #2^n,{n,1,order}] )&)      (where `c` is a pre-defined vector of coefficients). The index `n` is not recognized in the context of defining the pure function (though the same expression defining `f[x,y]` would work). Similarly, if I have several functions and I am trying to define a collection of these replacement rules, this also does not work:               Table[ f[[i]]->f->((c0[[i]][#1]+c1[[i]][#1] #2+c2[[i]][#1]#2^2)&), {i,1,whatever}]      Somehow defining and manipulating a collection of pure functions with an index needs a different syntax. I am curious as for the logic of why this does not work, maybe then I'll understand how to fix it. Edit: Apologies for the vague question. I think the logic that I was missing is related to attributes of pure functions I was trying to use in replacement rules, as pointed out by acl below. This is related to this question: Using pure functions in Table
