I'm trying to plot replicate a graph from one of the articles and it has series of equations it has solved. here is my code so far:               Tan [o] == 2 Cot[B]*(M^2*Sin[B]*Sin[B] - 1)/(M^2*(1.4 + Cos[2 B]) + 2);           Pr1[o_, M_] := 1 + 2*1.4/2.4*(M^2*Sin[B]*Sin[B] - 1)     Plot[Table[Pr1[o, M], {o, {10*Pi/180}}] // Evaluate, {M, 1, 3}, AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}]      The variables `o`, `B` and `M` are related to the tangent expression. After that I'm trying to solve the next equation and plot that with certain value of `o` and as `M` varies from 1 to 3. For some reason, I'm not getting any error but my graph isn't showing up at all. Also note that the tan expression produces 6 roots for given `M` and `o`, I want to only take the lowest positive value out of the 6 roots. * * * ### Edit Here is my new code. I used the 4th root instead of 1st one. Thank to belisarius for helping out:               s = Solve[Tan[o] == 2 Cot[B]*(M^2*Sin[B]*Sin[B] - 1)/(M^2*(1.4 + Cos[2 B]) + 2), {B}];          Pr1[o_, M_] := 1 + 2*1.4/2.4*(M^2*Sin[B]*Sin[B] - 1)     Plot[Table[Evaluate[Pr1[o, M] /. s[[4]]], {o, {10*Pi/180}}], {M, 1, 3},        AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}, Evaluated -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WRKbE.png) The plot shows a step near the value of ~1.4 of M. I want to eliminate this. Any suggestions?
