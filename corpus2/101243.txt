We do online e-learning without using any third party tools like Adobe Captivate / eLearning suite, and it would be great to (somehow) get some text- to-speech going. Is there any way at all to get this working for free (or very cheap, some plans are just ridiculous such as http://www.acapela-group.com/text-to-speech- interactive-demo.html) Ideally what we need is for the user to select their language, however happy to start with just English, then just start reading the HTML on the page.. Or am I just barking up the wrong tree here, if people NEED TTS, they would just be using their own software or the ones the come with O/S...right? Edit: The requirement is to make the content a little more engaging. Also, it aids some people if they are slow readers. The reason I was thinking TTS over a proffesional Voice Over is that is should be easier to implement? Having a VO linked to each text "snippet" will require cutting up hundreds of MP3 files and then programming the elearning framework to do this. Having an automated TTS system should be easier for that, especially if in multiple languages However, I think it does need to be a professional VO. thanks for your thoughts/inputs
