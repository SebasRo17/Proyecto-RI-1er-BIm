Currently, there is a discussion in the PHP-Internals mailing list regarding the implementation of a short syntax for arrays and objects, mainly `[1, 2, ...]` for standard arrays, `['one'=>1, 'two'=> 2, ...]` for associative arrays, and `{'one'=>1, 'two'=> 2, ...}` for objects and there is one general disagreement that bothers me: some people argue it is less readable. The main reasons I see this proposal was made is to augment simplicity and readability when using this fundamental data structure in PHP, but I'm having trouble processing the reason of why some people regard it as unreadable, you can even see that, readability is an item both in the pro and con list, and its both an argument for supporters and opposers. My suspicion is that opposers are just considering the standard case of `array(...)` vs `[...]`, but they are not seeing the nested case, meaning this:               $TV = array(         "flintstones" => (object)array(             "series"   => "flintstones",             "members"  => array(                 (object)array( "name" => "fred",    "role" => "lead", "age"  => 36, ),                 (object)array( "name" => "wilma",   "role" => "wife", "age"  => 31, ),                 (object)array( "name" => "pebbles", "role" => "kid",  "age"  =>  4, ),             ),         ),         "jetsons"     => (object)array(             "series"   => "jetsons",             "members"  => array(                 (object)array( "name" => "george",  "role" => "lead", "age"  => 41, ),                 (object)array( "name" => "jane",    "role" => "wife", "age"  => 39, ),                 (object)array( "name" => "elroy",   "role" => "kid",  "age"  =>  9, ),             ),          ),         "simpsons"    => (object)array(             "series"   => "simpsons",             "members"  => array(                 (object)array( "name" => "homer", "role" => "lead", "age"  => 34, ),                 (object)array( "name" => "marge", "role" => "wife", "age" => 37, ),                 (object)array( "name" => "bart",  "role" => "kid",  "age"  =>  11, ),             ),         ),     );      Would become this:               $TV = [         "flintstones" => {             "series"   => "flintstones",             "members"  => [                 { "name" => "fred",    "role" => "lead", "age"  => 36, },                 { "name" => "wilma",   "role" => "wife", "age"  => 31, },                 { "name" => "pebbles", "role" => "kid",  "age"  =>  4, },             ],         },         "jetsons"     => {             "series"   => "jetsons",             "members"  => [                 { "name" => "george",  "role" => "lead", "age"  => 41, },                 { "name" => "jane",    "role" => "wife", "age"  => 39, },                 { "name" => "elroy",   "role" => "kid",  "age"  =>  9, },             ],          },         "simpsons"    => {             "series"   => "simpsons",             "members"  => [                 { "name" => "homer", "role" => "lead", "age"  => 34, },                 { "name" => "marge", "role" => "wife", "age" => 37, },                 { "name" => "bart",  "role" => "kid",  "age"  =>  11, },             ],         },     ];      For me, the second case would be miles more readable, even refreshing since I can move my eyes quicker through it. There is a clear majority of people that want the short syntax, but I'm very interested in knowing why is the second example I provided less readable for some (being some of them well renowned devs, meaning they must have considered the nested case). Anyhow I've seen this argument other places, that minimalism is not the same as readability, but why for this specific case?, the short syntax is well known in other languages and nobody complains about readability, **_so why?_**.
