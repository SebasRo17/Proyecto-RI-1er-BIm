I'm working on a research project and I need to learn how to use _Mathematica_ to calculate subspaces. Specifically I plan to solve the following operations and I would greatly appreciate if you could give me an example of how to solve it. For example:   1. In the vector space $Î¡^n$, consider the sub space  $$S = \left\langle(1, -2,1,0, ..., 0), (0,1, -2,1,0, ..., 0) ... (0,0, ..., 1, -2,1)\right\rangle$$ Calculate equations defining $S$ for $n = 4, 8, 16, 20$.   2. Find generator subspaces of "magic" matrices of $2\times2$, $3\times3$ and $4\times4$ (a square matrix is called magic if the sums of the elements in each row, each column and in the diagonal are always the same)
