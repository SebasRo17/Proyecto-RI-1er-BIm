I'm planning on releasing a program I made, but I'm not sure exactly how to ensure people don't just steal it. The price point is $1, but I'm not selling it through an "app store" or anything so I have to handle the legal stuff myself as well as building a website. How do I make it illegal (is it by default?) for people to resell copies of it. What about adding Copyrights to the code itself? Often, when I'm buying software, or even when it's free, I have to accept terms and conditions (which I obviously read _sarcasm_ ). Do I need something like that? I don't know if any other information is relevant, but just in case:   * It's written in Java   * There aren't any similar programs (in design) that I know of like it.   * I'm planing on using Paypal for the payment, though I may look into amazon or see the cost of an ssl certificate with my host to see if it makes sense to do it myself.
