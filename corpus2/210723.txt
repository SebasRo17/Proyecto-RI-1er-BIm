So, as Microsoft has created many forks and branches off of .NET, there have been a few different product names come up:   * Silverlight   * .NETCore/WinRT/.Net for Windows Store Apps   * .NET for Windows Phone/CoreCLR   * .NET Micro Framework   * .NET Compact Edition However, what do you call the traditional .NET we all know and love? You can't call it Desktop .NET probably, because it also runs on servers, and that might imply you're using that client-profile thing. .NET for PC seems unusual. You can't really just say "this is a product for .NET" because then people might assume that includes support for one of the other frameworks Does Microsoft have an official "name" for the traditional .NET that runs in Windows PCs?
