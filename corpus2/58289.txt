I want to use ExportString to generate HTML expression. Here is an easy example:               ExportString[x^3, "HTML", "FullDocument" -> False]      gives               <p class="Output">     <img src="HTMLFiles/m-937b9f3a-d110-4ad9-b508-e9c5f1c8dc0f_1.gif" alt="m-937b9f3a-d110-4ad9-b508-e9c5f1c8dc0f_1.gif" width="14" height="16" style="vertical-align:middle" />     </p>      I cannot find the folder HTMLFiles and related file gif. I tried setting the working directory, or looking in any folder of the computer, without having success. My guess is that files are not actually generated. But the point is: ExportString is not useful at all for HTML format. Please, help, any comment is welcome.
