I'd like to use mathematica to solve systems of linear equations, where the entries are non commutative matrices. I just tried the NC package but it doesn't help so far. For example I can solve:                In[1]: NCSolve[a0 ** b0 + a1 ** b1 + a2 ** b2 + a3 ** b3 == 1, a0]     Out[1]: {a0 -> inv[b0] - a1 ** b1 ** inv[b0] - a2 ** b2 ** inv[b0] - a3 ** b3 ** inv[b0]}      what's fine. But NCSolve only works for one equation with one unknown. So I'd like to know if there is any tool to solve e.g.:               IN[2]: Solve[{a0 ** b0 + a1 ** b1 + a2 ** b2 + a3 ** b3 == 1,             a1 ** b0 + a0 ** b1 + I*(a2 ** b3 - a3 ** b2) == 0,             a2 ** b0 + a0 ** b2 + I*(a3 ** b1 - a1 ** b3) == 0,             a3 ** b0 + a0 ** b3 + I*(a1 ** b2 - a2 ** b1) == 0}, {a0, a1, a2,             a3}]      Unfortunately this isn't possible as I posted it and also it doesn't work with NCSolve. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome. Additionally I'd like to know a way how to type this using matrices of non commuting matrices. I.e. what I posted before is just finding the inverse of in the Pauli-Spin basis of a 2x2 matrix, it would be nice to type something like               In[3]: a = a0*PauliMatrix[0] + a1*PauliMatrix[1] + a2*PauliMatrix[2] + a3*PauliMatrix[3]            b = b0*PauliMatrix[0] + b1*PauliMatrix[1] + b2*PauliMatrix[2] + b3*PauliMatrix[3]            NCSolve[a ** b == 1, {a0,a1,a2,a3]      Thanks a lot!
