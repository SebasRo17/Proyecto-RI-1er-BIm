**Background:** My `Manipulate` programs are becoming (too) long. I want to split them up in to independent modules, if at all possible. Take this program as a prototype:               Manipulate[        {i, 2 i, 3 i},        {{i, i, "i="}, -11, 11, 1},        Initialization -> {i = 0}     ]      Suppose this is in fact a custom control with parameters {`label, begin, end, step}`                  {{i, i, "i="}, -11, 11, 1},      Ideally I would be able to code something like               Manipulate[         {i, 2 i, 3 i},         = = = = CustomSlider[i, " i= " , -11, 11, 1 ]  = = = =         Initialization -> {i = 0}     ]      **Question:** So the question is about how to get a function to work as a control in a `Manipulate`, if that is at all possible? Any Ideas or other suggestions to handle my need of refactoring my `Manipulate` code?
