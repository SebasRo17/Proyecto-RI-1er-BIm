I'm reading Sedgewick's book on algorithms in C and I'm looking for an algorithm to evaluate postfix expressions (addition and multiplication only) without using a stack. I tried to implement one but I always get nowhere. I have a simple C implementation for **prefix** evaluation               int eval()     {       int x = 0;            while (a[i] == ' ')         i++;       if (a[i] == '+')         {           i++;           return eval() + eval();         }       if (a[i] == '*')         {           i++;           return eval() * eval();         }       while ( (a[i] >= '0') && (a[i] <= '9'))         x = 10*x + (a[i++]-'0');       return x;      }      and I was wondering if it's possible to do something as elegant as this but for postfix evaluation.
