This topic was taken from Stack Overflow, but it was put on-hold due to Opinion-based question. So I moved it to here. I've had some great troubles with my homework exercises and I've used excessive time on doing simple programs like arrays and methods. For example it took me over 20 hours to create a program that asks user to enter row and columns size and then prints the matrix. I've read over 20 java books and tried 4 MOOCs, and even Buckys videos but it feels like I won't get in-depth understanding of Java fundamentals. Here's a list of problems that I face everyday when I'm coding java:   1. Problem solving   2. Creating methods and using them   3. Arrays   4. "I've no idea how to do this"   5. What is constructor and how to use it   6. "Where can I find help?" I've asked this question before but the answers have been like: "Read books" or "Just start coding" but neither of these haven't helped me because I've tried to code, but I haven't had any reasonable goals and reading books feels like eternal loop that just leads nowhere. I know that Internet is full of 'What is the best way to learn Java'-questions but I think that I've to try ask this because this topics question does not appear in Google Search + I think that there are people who are struggling with the same problem. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm eager to learn Java, I just need to find my own way to do it!
