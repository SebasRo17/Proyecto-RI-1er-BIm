We are currently investigating automated user interface testing (we currently do automated unit and integration testing). We've looked at Selenium and Telerik and have settled on the latter as the tool of choice due to its much more flexible recorder - and we don't really want testers writing too much code. However, I am trying to understand the overall benefit. What are peoples' views and what sort of things work well and what doesn't? Our system is under constant development and we regularly release new versions of our (web based) platform. So far the main benefit we can see is for regression testing, especially across multiple client deployments of our platform. Really looking for other people's views. We "think" it is the right thing to do but in an already busy schedule are looking for some additional insight.
