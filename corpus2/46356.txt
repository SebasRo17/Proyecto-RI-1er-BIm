I am a little puzzled by the fact that if I try to use `Arrow` with `Scaled` coordinates in 3 dimensions the arrowheads are all over the place. Note `Arrow` _should_ work with `Scaled` coordinates as it is mentioned in the relevant documentation. So while this:               pt2D = (Scaled /@ RandomReal[{0, 1}, {2, 2}]);      works fine:               Graphics@{Arrow@#}& @ pt2D      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q7cYK.png) this:               pt3D = (Scaled /@ RandomReal[{0, 1}, {2, 3}]);      gives the arrowhead detached from the arrow:               Graphics3D@{Arrow@#}& @ pt3D      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4M8D7.png) and the same thing happens with `Tube`d arrows. Here's one from the middle to the edge of a plot:               Show[Plot3D[Sin[x - y], {x, 0, 2 π}, {y, 0, 2 π}, PlotStyle -> Green],       Graphics3D[{Arrow[Tube[#]]}& @ {Scaled[{0.5, 0.5, 0.5}],Scaled[{1, 1, 1}]}], ImageSize -> 200]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4cUV0.png) Is this in any way expected behaviour? If not, can anyone recommend an easy fix?
