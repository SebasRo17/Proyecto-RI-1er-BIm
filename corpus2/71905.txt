I just finished reading the Ruby chapter of the book 7 Languages in 7 Weeks. Aside from some syntactic sugar here and there I can't really see anything which can't be done with C# with a similar syntax. I do understand both languages are inherently different, but my question relates to its usage rather than design. Relevant questions make me believe Ruby offers little more than C#:   * Why aren't c# programmers drawn to ruby as java programmers are?   * Is Ruby's code block same as C#'s lambda expression? I hardly worked with Ruby and my understanding of the language is still very limited, so perhaps somebody who experimented with both .NET 4.0 and Ruby can answer with concrete examples. **Which tasks require significantly less work with Ruby than C# 4.0?** P.s.: This question got closed on StackOverflow as too subjective and argumentative, although it did attract some attention. I was hoping it would be merged to here, but instead I'll just have to repost it.
