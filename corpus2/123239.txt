I have a form with several controls on it. Every control has to be declared in the class, formatted in the constructor (-size, location, event subscription etc), and its event-handlers declared, again, in the class. This is getting a bit unorganized, so I was thinking of refactoring this. For every control: Preparing a class which derives from that control-type (which will include location, event-subscription and event-handlers, etc.), and then using an instance of it. Am I going to run into any trouble doing this?
