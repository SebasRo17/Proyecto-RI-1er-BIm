Which aspects do I need to consider when designing and publishing software that must meet the US export restrictions for cryptographic software? Wikipedia says that there are various categories which you can assign to cryptographic software. And the export destination (e.g. China, Russia) does play a major role as well. But I didn't really understand those restrictions and their effect on my work. Can anybody explain that to me? I'm asking because if you try to publish your application (e.g. on Apple's App Store or Android's Market) you have to assure that your application meets the US export restrictions. And there are lots of applications who offer secure information storage, e.g. for passwords. Have they all notified the government and asked for a review? Of course, you cannot know if they did. But do they need to do this?
