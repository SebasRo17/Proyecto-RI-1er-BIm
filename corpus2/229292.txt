My company uses an application called TotalHRWorks for time keeping and what not. They have an Android and iOS application; however, there is no Windows Phone application. Since there is an Android and iOS app, I figure that I should be able to create a Windows Phone app; but I don't know where to start with trying to discover maybe their web service or whatever APIs that I could use to make it. I don't know whether this can be done or if it's "legal" to do such things - but it would be really handy to have.
