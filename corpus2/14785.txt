I have many cells, starting with this first cell:               mcRun = 20;     randomWalk[n_] := RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], n];           RandVar = Table[randomWalk[5], {mcRun}];     Length[RandVar]      MatrixForm[RandVar[[1 ;; 10]]] (* only display first 10 *)     ListPlot[RandVar]      Then later in a 2nd cell:               CorRandVar = RandVar * 10;      Still later in a 3rd cell:               InvCor = CDF[NormalDistribution[], CorRandVar];      And there are many more cells that depend on the value of the initial parameter `mcRun` that I defined in the first cell. At the moment I use 'Evaluate Notebook' to get my results. I wait for one 'Evaluate Notebook' to complete, note down the result from running with `mcRun = 20` (20 monte carlo simulations), edit `mcRun = 20` to another value and repeat. So how could I automate what 'Evaluate Notebook' does and plot, for example, `InvCor` (or any function/value) as a function of the input parameter `mcRun`, say, from 20 to 20,000? ? Or better, how could I incorporate my simulation into a `Manipulate` to add interactivity?
