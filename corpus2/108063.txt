I've done some work looking at Next3 and ext3cow, and a few other file systems that provide snapshots and/or file versioning. It seems a bit strange to me that file systems only go part-way with version control, though. Are there **fundamental** reasons for keeping the two separate? How challenging would it be to, for example, build a version of the ext3 file system which includes a git-like interface for managing file versions?
