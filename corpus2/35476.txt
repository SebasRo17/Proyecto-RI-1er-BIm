I am teaching polynomial long division to my high school students. Not a pleasant topic to have to cover. I went to use Wolfram|Alpha and obviously, internally, they have a really elegant way to express the results of long divisions. ![long-division](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SYkUP.png) I don't suspect there is any easy way to directly ask Alpha (from _Mathematica_ ) to do that division for me? Has anyone implemented anything like this? Would it involve using a table or matrix? Everything is nicely lined up and typeset; it would be helpful to see how such a structure was created. Tom
