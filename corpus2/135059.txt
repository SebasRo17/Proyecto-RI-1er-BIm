I am writing an system for the company to put their promotion material on the site, which is like some kinds of CMS. So, I need a database that store their data, but I am considering how to store their data.... First approach is use a single table to store their data, but use a column, like 'company_code' to distinguish the company, another approach is create a separate database for a company.... (Of course, will check the company_code or company table name is existed or not, if yes, will assign a new company_code or company table name by programme.) So, which approach is better? Thanks.....
