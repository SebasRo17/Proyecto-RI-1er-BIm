I am an MCA fresher and will be working on dot Net for next few months (almost 10-12 months). After that I want to switch over to Java. How is the possibility that I can switch over to it? What type of preparation I am supposed to do? I am also planning to appear for SCJP but don't have any knowledge how to get registered an registration fees. Please also guide me what is company's approach towards the candidates switching their technologies. What are the things that companies look for?
