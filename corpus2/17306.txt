I have a list of numbers like the following:               list = Table[RandomInteger[1000], {i, 1000}];      And I plot them so:               ListPlot[list]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Q9Wd.png) I have drawn the black lines on the plot myself. I'd like to have `min` and `max` variables as a function of `y`, which once set, produce these lines in the chart and highlight the data between the lines. How can I do this?
