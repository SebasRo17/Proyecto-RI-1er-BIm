I have a simple C++ RPC that lets you have remote class instances that support live members (data structures) update as well as method calls. For example I had a class declared like this (pseudocode):               class Sum{     public:         RPC_FIELD(int lastSum);         RPC_METHOD(int summ(int a, int b))         {          lastSum = a + b;          return lastSum;         }     };      On machine `A` I had its instance. On machines `B` and `C` I had created its instances and connected them to machine `A`. So now they actually do all processing on machine `A` but machines `B`, `C` get `lastSum` class field updates automatically (and can subscribe to update event). How to call (`Nice Name`) such a functionality when we have binding over network done automatically by RPC library? How RPC library creator can announce such feature?
