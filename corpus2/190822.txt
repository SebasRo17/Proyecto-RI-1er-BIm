Our application server is JBoss 7 as. We use SVN as our code repository. I need to ship our custom security domain in standalone.xml which is a jboss file (not packaged in my application's war file). However, I don't want to commit all of JBoss to the SVN. The approach I'm thinking of using is to commit standalone.xml in a separate folder in my SVN repository and move it to the correct location under JBoss when the application is deployed at production site. Is this the best mechanism?
