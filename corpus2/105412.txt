With a team of 3 other web developers i have the title as lead web developer for a year now. This is my first job as a lead. I'm pretty set on what my roles are from management. I'm curious what other senior level developers do. I primarily curious as to what others people responsibilities are as the lead/senior developer in other organizations; as I've only encountered working in a small/medium company. (a) What would one expect out of a senior / lead web developer of an organization (regardless of size)? (b) Is there a difference between web development leader and senior web developer? I reviewed some threads and there was just one that discussed when you should call yourself a senior developer but doesn't comprehensively discuss the roles of what a senior developer should do with his/her team.
