I believe in the user experience of always having a confirm pop-up for deletions. However (though we're very used to it), a separate small pop-up window is not ideal and for users on different browsing devices, using different input devices, they can be a nightmare. So I was thinking of changing all my 'confirm delete?' pop-ups into NOT having a pop-up, deleting the record immediately BUT then offering a link to restore the record on whatever page they user is put on after the 'delete'. This absolutely requires that I update the application so that instead of deleting the record, it is either marked as deleted, or moved to a 'deleted_original-table-name' and thus in either case can be deleted. There may then be an 'admin' process available to periodically delete them permanently. I am looking for thoughts on why this might be a bad idea and any pitfalls to watch for. I'd like to know if there are any advantages/disadvantages to moving it to a separate table vs. marking it has deleted.
