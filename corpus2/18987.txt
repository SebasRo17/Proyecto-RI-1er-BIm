This is what I get using Mathematica 9.0.1. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ac0pt.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xlJ5j.jpg) Instead I want this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2m6LW.jpg) I know how to use MakeBoxes, Format and I thought this code would work:               MakeBoxes[(1/2)(expr_), StandardForm]:=     FractionBox[ MakeBoxes[expr, StandardForm], MakeBoxes[2, StandardForm]]      But the code above and all variations that I tried have no effect. This has to be automated to get the look I want. My actual application is much more complicated.
