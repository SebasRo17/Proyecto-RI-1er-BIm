I'm an experienced developer which quite some experience in meta programming. I just found my way to Ruby and want to understand more of Rails (and related) project internals. Even if I understand the high level concepts, it's hard to get an overview of those projects. I wonder how other people approach that problem? How would you for example approach the Mongoid source code to get a good understanding of it's internals?
