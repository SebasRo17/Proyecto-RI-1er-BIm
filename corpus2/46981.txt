My main area: web development. Of course, I don't expect anybody give away their 'gold mine' or whatever but I am struggling to see where I should be advertising my services. I have one other developer I work with and we have a lot of happy clients - on freelance websites. Thing is, freelance websites just seem to suck the life out of you when you're being out-bidded by ridiculous rates. I want to attract customers who are more concerned about quality and accountability than price. Any suggestions at all? I'm so lost with this. EDIT: Added bounty of 200 - all of my 'reputation'. EDIT: Added second bounty of 50 I did hear of a novel idea. Do work for an opensource project and get featured in their 'trusted developers' section, if they have one. Input?
