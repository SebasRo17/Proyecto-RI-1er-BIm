I need an algorithm to place horizontal text labels for multiple series of points on the screen (basically I need to show timestamps and other information for a history of moving objects on a map; in general there are multiple data points per object). The text labels should appear close to their points--above, below, or on the right side--but should not overlap other points or text labels. Does anyone know an algorithm/heuristic for this?
