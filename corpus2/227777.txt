Using Tcl8.5, what is the common practice to transfer **named** variables to a proc/method? Something that will be similar to defining the class members when instantiating a class object _[incr Tcl]_. Something like this:               # Passing 3 parameters: "hello", "how" and "doing".     procName -hello world -how you -doing today     # We can easily add or remove any parameters to/from any location      **Edit #1:**   Same example as above, but more similar to python:               procName hello=world how=you doing=today
