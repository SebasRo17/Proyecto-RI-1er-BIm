I keep running into Senior JS positions where they want CoffeeScript. The reason I don't use CoffeeScript is that my first impression of it was that it puts limitations on JS OOP features that I find valuable. I've seen claims that the two can inter-mix freely but that sounds dubious to me. Should I even bother applying to these positions if CoffeeScript-only is a dealbreaker for me?
