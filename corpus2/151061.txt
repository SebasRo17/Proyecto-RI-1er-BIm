Let's say I need to add a drop shadow behind a box. Some old platforms do not support drop shadows, so I have to fake it by putting an image behind the box. Here's the pseudo code of how I'm currently handling this fallback:               if (dropShadowsAreSupported) {         box.addDropShadow("black");     } else {         box.putImageBehindIt("gaussianBlur.png");     }      Is this the right way to handle it? It seems too amateur to me. Is there a better design pattern? In my actual project, there are a ton of places where I need to style the user interface differently for different operating system versions. It's not only one if-else.
