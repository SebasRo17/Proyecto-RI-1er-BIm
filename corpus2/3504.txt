I am attempting to use the Combinatorica `NumberOfSpanningTrees` command for all `n-cycle` graphs from 3 to 30. I am trying to get a table form showing whether it is true or false that `n-cycle` graphs have `n` spanning trees. However Mathematica does not seem to recognize the command. Am I am pre- loading the Combinatorica packages correctly?               << Combinatorica`     Table[{i, NumberOfSpanningTrees[CycleGraph[i]] == i}, {i, 3, 30}] // TableForm      The output I get is: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CqKsL.png) I have also tried loading Combinatorica using the `Needs["Combinatorica`"]. Any ideas?
