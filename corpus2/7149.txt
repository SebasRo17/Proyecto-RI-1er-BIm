I'm using some iterative arithmetics to calculate wave propagation with the help of NestList. I have to use a small step size for iteration to guarantee the accuracy, which lead to too much data (e.g, 10^6 points) for further plotting, and the results consumes too much memories. Is there any clever way to cope with it? I didn't intend to use loops. This is a simplified example:               NestList[Sin, 1, 10^6]      One of my idea is to use `Sow` and `Reap`. But I've no idea to integrate them with `NestList` or `Nest` Any idea???
