I am working on a Scala project and I want to include some sample data somewhere in the project. Specifically, my Scala project includes code that performs various natural language processing tasks on text data. I want to include a sample set of text files that the user can use to test out the program somewhere in the project structure. Right now I am putting this sample data in the resources folder (mostly because it is the only location within the project that I know how to read from). But I was wondering if this is the best location? In general what is the best practice regarding where to put sample data within the project? Alternatively, would it be a better idea to simply provide this data separately (i.e external to the project)?
