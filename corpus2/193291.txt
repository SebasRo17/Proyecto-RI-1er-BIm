Is there a way to make sure that modifications to free software are released even when no binaries of modified code are _conveyed_? Though it may sound odd and from what I understand, e.g., GPL requires to distribute source only if binary is _conveyed_ to other parties thus making it possible for unlimited private use as it does not fall into _propagation_. I would like to make sure that if someone publishes a final finding in a scientific literature derived with the aim of a modified code, then those modifications are made available. Does any well-known license have these provisions? If not, why would it be bad? From what I understand if I add those provisions explicitly, it would limit the freedom, e.g., rendering result non-GPLish. From one of the answers that disappeared, I guess I can add an _Additional Term_ but would not it be a _further restriction_ that can be simply ignored > If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice > stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a > further restriction, you may remove that term. From what I understand it looks like it depends on how I state it. If I require to make private modification used to derived a result that was published to make available, then it would be okay, otherwise it would be a _further restriction_ if I prohibit from privately using and not making modified code available. **Example** _A_ implements a super duper algorithm but they is bad with BLAS and it takes a long time for the simulation. _B_ claims that they refined the code using CUDA or whatever and can easily get results within second. Based on their work they found this and that from simulations and got it published. And that is it. No GPL violation and no better code for community. **Another example** Imagine if some animation studio took Blender, implemented an improved version of Cycles that allows them to render things way faster and with less problems. So now they have an advantage as they can deliver animations to clients faster. No software conveyance, no GPL violation, no improvements sharing.
