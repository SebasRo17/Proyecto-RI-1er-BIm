Can please someone explain to me the diffrent behavior of this code               (6 - 3);     (5 - 3);     (4 - 3);     {%%%, %%, %}          Out= {3, 2, 1}      and this one               a;     b;     c;     (6 - 3);(*comment*)     (5 - 3);(*comment*)     (4 - 3);(*comment*)     {%%%, %%, %}          Out= {a, b, c}      ? I thought it should be the same. Do the comments block the outputs to be used with %? EDIT: I found a working case ... even if one adds spaces between the comments.               a;     b;     c;     (6 - 3);     (* comment *)     (5 - 3);     (* comment *)     (4 - 3);     (* comment *)     {%%%, %%, %}          Out= {3, 2, 1}
