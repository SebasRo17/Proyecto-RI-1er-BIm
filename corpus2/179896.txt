I need a _very_ simple pseudo random generator (no any specific quality requirements) and I found Microsoft's variant of LCG algorithm used for rand() C runtime library function fit my needs (gcc's one seems too complex). I found the algorithm here: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#C However, I worry the algorithm (including its "magic numbers" i.e coefficients) may by patented or restricted for use in some another way. Is it allowed to use this algorithm without any licence or patent restrictions or not? I can't use library rand() because I need my results to be exactly reproducible on different platforms
