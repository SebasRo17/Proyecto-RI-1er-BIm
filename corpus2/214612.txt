I'm planning to map some of my TFS projects to two different directories as discussed here. I'll be using two different workspaces, both with the same Computer and the same Owner. Is there any reason why this would be a bad idea? Are there any complications with merging or locks that one user with two mappings would run into, that are different from the normal complications that two users checking out a project run into? Basically, I want to keep all of my projects on a shared drive, all mapped to TFS, but then have additional second local mappings for the few projects I'm most actively working so that Visual Studio is faster. I'm using VS 2010 with the TFS Power Tools Extension.
