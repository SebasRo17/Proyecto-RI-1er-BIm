I am recent graduate and I have applied for a job, but I'm stuck on how to answer one of the questions: > What programming technology, programming topics, and programming concepts > are you following at present? I am a little confused with this question as it's a bit vague. I know what programming technologies are—C#, Java, .NET, etc—but what are programming topics and concepts? I take it that programming topics are everything related to C# or related to programming in general? I'm not so sure what programming concepts are. How can I answer this question?
