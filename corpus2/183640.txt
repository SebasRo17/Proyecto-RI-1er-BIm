I have been in various Agile projects and seen many release burndown chart styles. Most of them were handled manually since somehow all the tools that I have run across don't produce really useful burndown charts. In reality, we may not be dealing with all stories estimated and we just keep burning down. Many times, the scope is added during the release. Currently, I am dealing with these problems with the burndown chart and have questions about the following things:   1. How do we represent added scope in the release burndown chart?   2. How do we deal with unestimated stories in release burndown chart assuming that there is high probability that we will do it but we just do not have time to estimate them yet?   3. How do you project the end of the release? The burndown chart below is from the fictional case study in the appendix of classic Mike Cohn's Estimating and Planing book. ![Mike Cohn's burndown](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MXQ5o.png)
