As far as I understand the Actor Model and the Reactive Programming are separate concepts. Actor Model does not seem to be inherently reactive to me. However the Akka framework which is an Actor Model implementation is being described as reactive: > "Java and Scala program logic lives in lightweight Actor objects, which send > and receive messages in a reactive fashion." > > "We Are Reactive" Is it a case of misusing the term or they are completely correct? Is any actor model implementation (e.g. Erlang) already reactive? Is simply generating messages as a response to other messages considered reactive as well?
