My team and I are struggling with the what and how meetings. It's hard for us to choose what to work on when we don't know how it is going to be done. Our estimations may be way off when pointing an estimated level of effort. At this point it's being discussed if we should do the how before the what so that pbi's will be at least reasonably well estimated. What are some other options that don't require changing the order of the accepted scrum practices?
