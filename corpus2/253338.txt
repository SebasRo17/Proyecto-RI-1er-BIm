Situation: We have a desktop application. We also have a web application. We need the two to interact with each other. So when a button is pushed in the web application, the desktop application needs to start running a process (pulling data from the cloud using an API we've created). With two local applications, this can be done with ports/listening, editing a flag somewhere locally, and the other application reading this flag, etc. Can this be done from web -> desktop? Ideally the web application would have direct communication with the desktop application and notify it to begin pulling data down from the cloud using our API. But if this is not possible, having the desktop app run a process that loops and checks for a flag in a file or something would be a good start. After minimal research, I've found some stuff like HTML5 File Api which interacts with "Sandbox" directory on the local machine. I've also read that it is impossible to access any thing on the local machine for security reasons. Also, I dont want the user to be prompted to request a download file everytime, we need things to happen behind the scenes. (Even if the user has to initally set up some lower security / permissions just for this situation) Any input is appreciated!
