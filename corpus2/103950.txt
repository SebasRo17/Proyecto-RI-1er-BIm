For my project I want to develop an web application with Windows Azure as the platform using C# language. The idea is to host the website of a University on the cloud. Whenever it announces the resutls online there is a spike and the cloud will handle the peak usage with its scalabilty and load balancing properties and deploy necessary resources. However since all of this is handled by Azure internally there is no way of demonstrating it in our project. Is there a way where we can specifically implement something to demonstrate it to the evaluator? A virtual way perhaps...
