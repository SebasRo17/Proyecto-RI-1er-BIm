I was wondering what is the best way to organize my source code. I was researching on SO and found http://stackoverflow.com/a/1398594/137261 but this source code layout is library specific and doesn't cover my situation. **My situation:**   * 10 own modules (100k lines of code)   * 15 external libraries (e.g. boost, sqlite, zlib, etc.)   * 2 critical modules have to be available for selected developers only (maybe separate git repos ?)   * project is multiplatform (Linux and Windows)   * Git as version control system   * cmake used to build project **Question:**   * does it make sense to incorporate all libraries into my project e.g. in _3rd_party_libs_ folder ?   * how to handle lib include paths in my modules (environmental variable, relative paths, git submodules, etc. ) ?   * should I always build external libs from source or just use their binaries ?
