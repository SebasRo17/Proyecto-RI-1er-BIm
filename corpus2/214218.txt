Does the web industry have any standard or common name that refers _specifically_ to web applications that don't use the conventional window- HTTP-navigation model, instead relying on mostly or wholly on DOM manipulation? These applications usually have the following attributes:   * load an application frame from the server once (or infrequently)   * use a combination of Ajax requests, DOM modifications and history manipulation (via web fragment or `pushState`) to change state after that (while preserving reloadability)   * do not typically trigger new conventional location bar navigation events (window- or frame-level HTTP requests)   * most likely, present UIs that are highly interactive with a combination of dialog boxes, overlay layers, infinite scrolling, etc. Examples:   * Facebook   * Twitter   * Gmail   * USAToday Popular counterexamples, still relying mostly on traditional models   * YouTube (some navigation is done this way, but not enough)   * cnn.com I'm interested in names for this type of web application specifically. It feels like something I must have heard already, but I can't think of anything specifically. These seem too broad:   * Web application (could mean anything)   * AJAX application (could mean anything)
