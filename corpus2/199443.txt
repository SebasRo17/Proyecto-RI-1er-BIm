I have a program that is offered to the public on the web as a GPL program. This is a hobby type project that i stated 3.5 years ago and i have had one collaborator for most of that duration who has contributed some code me and my collaborator both like to see the program develop as it's both our hobbies. A person has adopted its game board to a play against the computer program. He wrote his own engine and his game he plays on the board uses a different set of rules. I think both me and my collaborator are ok with a more permissive licence grant. I've told the the derived work author that code he modifies he can add his copyright, and any java files that are all his code he can have sole copyright. I can grant a more permissive grant. But if i do what would his right of transferability be. By granting him a modification of gpl and he makes his code open source, could he in turn give the same grant to anyone else or does he not have a right of transferability? The first question (that would cause the second to be not applicable) is: would GPL work for what i'm doing to promote my brand and allow others somewhat permissive use. The secondary question is would my lack of enforcement or accepting modifications of terms be inherited by any users of his work. My open source software is in a hobby area, chess. Understanding the open source licences helps me be persuasive and helps with communication as the eventual adapters of code begin.
