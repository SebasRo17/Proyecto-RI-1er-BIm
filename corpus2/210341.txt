I am writing software (in Java) using three libraries:   * Library A, licensed under **MIT license**   * Library B, licensed under **Apache License, Version 2.0**   * Library C, licensed under **LGPLv3** I would like to make my software publicly available under the MIT license. I'm going to include all libraries in **source** and binary form (jar), including the their **original licenses** and **copyright notices**. I put a **LICENSE** file at the root of my project with the MIT license. I believe this should cover all requirements of MIT and LGPLv3, but I'm wondering about the NOTICE file mentioned in the Apache license. > If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then > any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the > attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those > notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least > one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part > of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if > provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by > the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally > appear.

Second, are there any other requirements that I may have missed? Finally, let's suppose I'm also using Library D, licensed under **GPLv3**. How does that change the situation? I understand that in this case I would have to release my project under GPLv3. Any other implications? Please understand that I'm a student and I cannot afford a lawyer. :)
