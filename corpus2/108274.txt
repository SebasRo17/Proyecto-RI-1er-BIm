Often I come across documentation that says "use a regular expression here" I have to spend quite some time digging around trying to work out _which regular expression_ format they are expecting. As far as I can tell, there are many types of regular expression. But, at my last place of work I was made to feel stupid when I suggested adding some text to our User Documentation to specify _the type_ of regular expression to be used. When someone says "a regular expression" what is _the_ regular expression syntax most people expect and where is it documented? Update: I was prompted to single-out some examples - but no disrespect to these great projects:   * eregi docs page is not particularly helpful in explaining expected syntax.   * Nor can I easily work out the syntax expected here if i just land on the page from a search.   * No explicit mention of the regular expression pattern expected by `PatternExpectation()` on the SimpleTest page.    * etc. etc.   * here is a highly voted SO answer that seems to assume there is only one flavour of regular expressions.
