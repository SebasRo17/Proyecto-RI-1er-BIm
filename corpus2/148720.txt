In reading another programmers code, he uses a format I have never seen. E.G.                   namespace MyNs.HereWeAre              {//tab here for some reason              public class SomeClass                    {//here's another tab                    public string Method()                         {//yet another tab                         string _variable = "";//no tab implementation                         return _variable;                         }                    }//eof - class  (Yes these eof comments are on every file)             }//eof - namespace     // eof - file      I'll admit...this code makes me angry. It is difficult to achieve this style. One needs to fight the default formatting provided by the IDE, visual studio. I could swallow this pill a little easier if I knew that there was a good reason for this style. Does this style stem from some other programming language/IDE?
