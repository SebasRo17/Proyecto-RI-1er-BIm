Many PHP web applications follow this model for installation and upgrade:   1. Un-tar a source tar ball.   2. Point Apache at the source.   3. Navigate a web browser to the home page.   4. Go through several web pages of set-up (e.g., checks for existence of libraries, asks for database connection information, creates or updates database schema, etc.).   5. User renames an `install/` directory to something else so that application knows it has been installed. I don't see any (simple) way to create a Debian package out of this without making the user installing the package go through many of the above manual steps. Note that I am not a developer on the application so I am not in a position to make direct change to how the application installation works. What is the typical approach to packaging such an application?
