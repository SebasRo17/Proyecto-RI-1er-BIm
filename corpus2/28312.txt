I have 5 groups, each containing around 20 elements. These elements are all dependent on x. For example: `Set1 = {1.5x + 1, 2x + 0.5, 1 x + 1, ...}` etc. Now, I want to compare these 5 groups and see if there is a significant difference between one or more of these groups (for `0 < x < 1`). As my data does not follow normal distribution, I use the Kruskal-Wallis test. To try and visualise this, I plugged this into _Mathematica_               Plot[LocationEquivalenceTest[{Set1, Set2, Set3, Set4, Set5}], {x, 0, 1}]      which, unexpectedly, gives a nice plot of the p-value set out over x. Now, I want to determine for what values of x the p-value is <0.05, so I thought that, since the Plot worked out nicely, I might be able to achieve that by using               Solve[LocationEquivalenceTest[{Set1, Set2, Set3, Set4 ,Set5}] == 0.05, x]      Unfortunately, that just gives me a bunch of errors saying that > The argument _list of the elements of set1_ at position 1 should be a list > containing two or more vectors of real numbers with length greater than 2. Is there a function in _Mathematica_ that does allow me to determine for which values of x the p-value would be 0.05?
