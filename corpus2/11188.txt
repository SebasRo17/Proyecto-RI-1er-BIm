I believe that an agile approach is best for projects where the requirements are fuzzy and a lot of interaction is required to help shape the end user's ideas. _However..._ In my professional work, I keep ending up at companies where an "agile" approach is used **as an excuse as to why no effort was put into an up front design;** when the requirements are well understood. I can't help but thinking that if the agile approach wasn't around, I'd be sitting here with a nice high-level specification and not having to revisit the same screen and functionality every second day when something else crops up or so and so hadn't thought of that. > Are the benefits of agile methodologies really enough to outweigh the excuse > for being lame it gives to cowboy technical leads? Update: Ironically I'm now a certified Scrum Master. One of the papers presented on the Scrum course observed that the best development process was one where there was a single expert or guru making the design decisions, however that has obvious weaknesses. Scrum shifts the responsibility for producing quality software to the "Team" which means a sub-standard team can get away with churning out spaghetti which I guess is no different to other Agile and non-Agile development processes.
