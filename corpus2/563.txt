> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Undocumented form for FilledCurve[] A nice trick to get the outline paths of letters is to use the PDF exporter/importer               el=      First[       First[         ImportString[           ExportString[             Style["L", Italic, FontSize -> 24, FontFamily -> "Arial"],              "PDF"           ],            "PDF",            "TextMode" -> "Outlines"          ]        ]     ];          Graphics[{EdgeForm[Black], LightBlue, el}];      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xKY39.png) The outline paths are given in a `FilledCurve` construction (new in MMA8):               el          (*     ===>     {Thickness[0.07507507507507508],       Style[        {FilledCurve[{{{0, 2, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0}}},                      {{{12.887695983062486, 5.160000000000004},                        {1.8237311169604027, 5.160000000000004},                        {5.496094644083314, 22.410000000000004},                        {7.823731116960403, 22.410000000000004},                        {4.5834973678187225, 7.222500000000004},                        {13.319824330510414, 7.222500000000004}                     }}         ]        },         Thickness -> 0.07507507507507508       ]}      *)      This syntax variant is not given in the `FilledCurve` help page:` ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MgqoO.png)   with _segments_ defined as: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iTvG1.png) (The doc page doesn't give a formal definition of _components_ , BTW) While the second argument of `FilledCurve` in the undocumented output above is pretty obvious (the coordinates of the outline), the first part is not. My hypothesis is that it has something to do with bezier control points or so. Anyone got an idea about this?
