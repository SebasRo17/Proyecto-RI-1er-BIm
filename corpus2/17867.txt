The document for Subsuperscript says that: > To enter a subsuperscript in a notebook, use either `Ctrl`+`_` to begin a > regular subscript or `Ctrl`+`^` to begin a regular superscript. After typing > the first script, use `Ctrl`+`%` to move to the opposite script position. > `Ctrl`+`Space` moves out of the subscript or superscript position. This just create a expresion that **looks like** a symbol with subsuperscript! Specifically, I typed `Ctrl`+`-` / `Ctrl`+`6` and a regular subscript / superscript appeared, `Ctrl`+`5` and the opposite script appeared, and after I moved the cursor out of the symbol by pressing `â†’` and checked its `InputForm`, what I saw is **not** something like               Subsuperscript[a, x, y]      but               Subscript[a, x]^y      _Snapshot:_ ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O8Nyb.png) What's wrong with it, I misunderstood the document? I use _Mathematica 8.0.4_ and _Windows Vista Home Basic 32bit_.
