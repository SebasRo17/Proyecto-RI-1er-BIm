Hello Fellow Programmers: I run a small business and we typically communicate over IM during the say. We sign on to IM when we arrive and stay on all day. It seems to be quite distracting, in my opinion, and could detract from work. I'm interested in how other small businesses use IM. Do you use IM? If so, do you stay on all day or only come up when there is a question initiated by e-mail? I'm trying to create the most productive and effective work environment for geographically separated programmers. Interested in your opinions. Thank you.
