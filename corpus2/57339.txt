I have an array of 800,000 data measured at 1.1s time gap. It is oscillating data but has clear linear drift. I want to remove this linear drift. But the estimates by `FindFit` and `Fit` has been very bad.   Here is my attempt with `FindFit`               model = e*x + noise[[1]];       fit = FindFit[noise, model, {e}, x]     {e -> -0.0430509}      The value of `e` is quite visibly wrong. It should be arround `-0.040`. Is there better ways to find and remove linear trends from datas? Thank you very much. The data can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xg2w6d4a6bpaejk/data.dat
