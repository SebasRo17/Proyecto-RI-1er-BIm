the coupled ODE is               f[a_?NumericQ] := NDSolve[{(x[r] (192 + (20 r^3 y''[r])/y[r]))/     r^4 == 5 x''[r]/r,      1000 (2 (x'[r])^2 + 2 x[r] x''[r]) +        250 (2 (y'[r])^2 + 2 y[r] y''[r]) == -5/(4 r),      x[1] == 0,      y[1] == 1/10 Sqrt[1/2 Log[5/2]],      y'[1] == -((1 - Log[5/2])/(20 Sqrt[2 Log[5/2]])),      x'[1] == a,      WhenEvent[y[r] < 10^(-6), end = r; "StopIntegration",       "DetectionMethod" -> "Interpolation"]},      {x, y}, {r, 1, 5/2},      Method -> {"ExplicitRungeKutta", "StiffnessTest" -> False}];      I want to plot this expression:               g[a_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[Evaluate[{(Pi (256 x[r]^2 + 16 y[r]^2))/(2 r^3) +         5/2 Pi ((x'[r])^2 + (y'[r])^2)} /.       f[a]], {r, 1, end}][[1, 1]]      the plot of `g[a]` with respect to `a` in the region `{a, 0.0026, 0.008}` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MeM3R.png) there is a minimum there, so I use `D` the find the derivative at `a=0.0028`               D[g[a], a] /. a -> 0.0028      0.0500445      the result is rather surprising, since the figure show the slope at `a=0.0028` should be negative. what's wrong with `D`? thanks a lot one more fact, `findminimum` and `NMinimize` give me the correct answer of `a` where the slope is `0`
