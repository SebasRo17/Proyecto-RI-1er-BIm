I just completed one year in Smart phone development, working on BlackBerry and Android and also developed one application exclusively targeted to nokia feature phones. And just a month ago I come to know about Titanium Appcelerator tool that enables cross platform development, but there are some developers who complain about it's sub-par functionalities. Even a little bit experience of mine says that developing in native environment rather than these cross platform tools will give you more advantages by giving a developer a chance to add more features with better performance. Do you have same experience? Or you find such cross development tools really useful regarding to advance functionality and performance? As porting (or co developing) same application to different mobile platform is common thing nowadays, what do you think will these cross platform tools evolve and force developers to get a hands on approach on them or majority will stick to the native development environment?
