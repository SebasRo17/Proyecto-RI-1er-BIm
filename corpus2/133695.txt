I'm developing some application with clojure(lisp) alone in my team. It starts as small application. No problem. But as it's having features and extending the area, it's becoming important program. I worried about maintenance or something. No one in my team knows clojure or lisp nor is interested in languages such as them. So, isn't it wrong to do programming in unpopular languages? (for my own fun?) Should I use more popular languages? (at least such as python) I'm sure if I leave the team, --not saying I'm leaving. :)-- no one would maintain it. This program will be destroyed and some will develop with other language. I'm very enjoying developing with clojure though, I came across with that this might be not for my team. What do you think about this? I think many programmers loving unpopular languages have been concerning similar issue.
