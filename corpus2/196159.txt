I'm building a file storage programme that will also display images in photo galleries to users who upload them. I was wondering if anybody could help me out. My plan was if an image was wider than 500px then I would resize it to 500px (gallery and mobile use) width and 250px (thumbnail use) width I have no serious experience with this so I was wondering if anybody could help me. How many different versions of a single image should I store and at what sizes. Thanks
