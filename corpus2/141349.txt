Hope you can help me with this, I've searched a lot and I got really confused of what to do here. I'm building a program in C and I need to run it multiple time as I need. So it's going to be like below, process 1 handle all rows on DB table test where process_flag=1   process 2 handle all rows on DB table test where process_flag=2   process 3 handle all rows on DB table test where process_flag=3   and so on How can I make the processes aware of each other, so if process 3 goes down then processes 2 & 3 start working on process_flag=3?
