I have a list of symbols that I have defined using               d = Table[Symbol["d" <> ToString[i]], {i, 1, n}]       giving               d = {d1, d2, d3, d4, d5}      where n = 5 in this case. I use this as part of an argument to an interpolation, giving me               Vchamber = 0.111549 d1 - 0.101842 d2 + 0.857554 d3 - 1.09366 d4 + 2.24236 d5       Now I want to define a function that gives something like                fVchamber[d1_,d2_,d3_d4_,d5_] := 0.111549 d1 - 0.101842 d2 + 0.857554 d3 - 1.09366 d4 + 2.24236 d5       Now, n is variable. Hence, the argument list is variable, as is the expression Vchamber. I was hoping that something like                fVchamber[d__]:=Function[d,Vchamber]      would work but it doesn't. What am I doing wrong? I have looked for answers but I haven't found one yet.
