What is the best way to annotate who authored a file and subsequent changes that were made? I'm a contractor on a new project, one that's just starting, which is using Subversion. The other day I noticed a team member had updated a script written by an outside consultant, and he updated the header from "Written by X" to "Writen by Y and X" (since he had made a decent number of updates). I didn't think this was a good idea, because others after us may update that script with small or large changes and it'd be unclear when to update the "Written by" header (or how to order the names). I pitched the way I had done it at my previous company (with an edit log at the top of each file - which was enforced by whoever verified the changes, we were using Clear Case so changes wouldn't be pushed up until they were verified), but then he mentioned we could just use the "svn log" command to see edits and it'd be hard to enforce an edit log. So now I'm not so sure what the best way to annotate authorship and changes is. Files can completely change over time, so I don't like the idea of a stale "Written by" header. And a "Written by" header that just includes a long list of people with no context doesn't seem useful. There's removing the authorship header, and simply using the subversion change log, but then what do you do about "Written by" headers from code that's given to you (from consultants, old code bases, downloaded from the net, etc)? How do other teams handle this?
