I currently have the equation below for a beam with a hinge at various locations, the variable a can vary between 0 and 0.5. $$ Tan\left( {a\sqrt \alpha } \right) + Tan\left\{ {\left( {1 - a} \right)\sqrt \alpha } \right\} - \sqrt \alpha = 0 $$ I wanted to use this equation to replicate the figure below: ![Taken from Exact Solutions for Buckling of Structural Members](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LG9YZ.png) My first thought was to solve the equation so that a= whatever the equation became and then I could plot this to replicate this graph. I've tried a few different ways to solve this equation but I'm being repeatedly told: > Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve. A few of the methods I've tried are below...               Solve[Tan[a*Sqrt[α]] + Tan[(1 - a)*Sqrt[α]] == Sqrt[α], a]          Reduce[Tan[a*Sqrt[α]] + Tan[(1 - a)*Sqrt[α]] == Sqrt[α], a]          Solve[TrigExpand[     Tan[a*Sqrt[α]] + Tan[(1 - a)*Sqrt[α]]] == Sqrt[α], a]          Reduce[     Tan[a*Sqrt[α]] + Tan[(1 - a)*Sqrt[α]] == Sqrt[α] && Element[     {a, α}, Reals], a]      Frustratingly a colleague has managed to get the equation to be rearranged with a as the subject but not with alpha as the subject using _MathCAD_ and then I can see that for certain circumstances the solutions are complex. For completeness the solutions using _MathCAD_ are below: $$ a=a\tan \left( {\frac{{\frac{{\sqrt \alpha }}{2} - \frac{{\sqrt {\frac{{\alpha \tan \left( {\sqrt \alpha } \right) - 4\tan \left( {\sqrt \alpha } \right) + 4\sqrt \alpha }}{{\tan \left( {\sqrt \alpha } \right)}}} }}{2}}}{{\sqrt \alpha }}} \right) $$ and $$ a=a\tan \left( {\frac{{\frac{{\sqrt \alpha }}{2} + \frac{{\sqrt {\frac{{\alpha \tan \left( {\sqrt \alpha } \right) - 4\tan \left( {\sqrt \alpha } \right) + 4\sqrt \alpha }}{{\tan \left( {\sqrt \alpha } \right)}}} }}{2}}}{{\sqrt \alpha }}} \right) $$ My questions for this I guess are:   1. How can I can rearrange and solve equations of this type? _Helping me understand why a simple Solve[] struggles with this would also be genuinely appreciated to help improve my understanding in Mathematica_   2. How to recreate the plot once solved? _(I'm not concerned with the smaller diagrams that have been added, I will do that myself in illustrator)_   3. Eventually I'm going to want to find the precise maxima of this and similar equations and I'm hoping that will be fairly straightforward once I've got the equation to rearrange into a more convenient format.
