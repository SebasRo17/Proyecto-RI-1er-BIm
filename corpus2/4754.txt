I read a few questions about how you can benefit from reading blogs, but I wonder what is really the impact of writing one. I had mine, but I neglected it (not having the time, not having fun with it (and I really try to avoid things that are not fun)) and now it's dead. Should I try harder on it? Or I can keep developing (pun) my abilities without having to maintain a blog?
