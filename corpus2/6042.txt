I offered to do a little bit training in F# at my company and they seemed to show some interest. They are generally VB6 and C# programmers who don't follow programming with too much passion. That being said I feel like it is easier to write correct code when you think in a functional matter so they should definitely get some benefit out of it. Can anyone offer up some advice on how I should approach this? **Ideas**   * Don't focus on the syntax, instead focus on how this language and the idioms it promotes can be used.   * Try and think of examples that are a pain to write in an imperative fashion but translates to elegant code when written in a declarative fashion.
