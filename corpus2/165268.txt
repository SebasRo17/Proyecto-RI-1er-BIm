In Java/JVM, why do we call the memory place where Java creates objects as "Heap"? Does it use the Heap Data Structure to create/remove/maintain the objects? As I read in the documentation of Heap data structure, the algorithm compares the objects with existing nodes and places them in such a way that Parent object is "greater" than the children. ( Or "lesser" in case of min heap). So in JVM, how are the objects compared against each other before placing them in the heap?
