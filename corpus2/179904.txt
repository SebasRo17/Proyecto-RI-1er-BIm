I'm in a new position where I need to process a flat files on a regular basis. The last time I did this was 5 or 6 years ago but as part of the file layout I received control totals. It gave me simplistic information on the file like the total number of records as well as sums of the important fields. This helped me during testing then also during production to verify the file arrived and has correct information. I have asked for similar data for this new project and have hit a wall of no. Is this no longer a standard practice? Is there a better way?
