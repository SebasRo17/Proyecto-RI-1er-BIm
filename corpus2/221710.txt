I have always wondered about this, especially in C/Java style languages. For example, consider the first 3 lines of this C# code:               lock (serviceLock)     using (var client = new ServiceClient())     try     {         // Do something         client.DoSomething();     }          catch (System.ServiceModel.FaultException ex)     {         // Handle error         addLog(ex.ToString());     }      This usage has always seemed somewhat questionable to me. However, the alternative is not very practical either (3+ levels deep of indentation for a service call). Apart from pure aesthetics, is there any practical reason to add or not to add the extra brackets in this case?
