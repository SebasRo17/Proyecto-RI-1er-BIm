My company has recently switched to an Agile way of working and as a part of it we've started using SCRUM. While I'm very comfortable with it and feel that this way is superior to a traditional one, some of my teammates don't share the same opinion. In fact they are very skeptical about "all that agile stuff", and don't take it seriously. As an example, one of the teammates is always late on the meetings, and doesn't really care about it. The management IMO tries not to notice this (maybe because it's new, and it takes time for the people to get used to it). My question is, how to address this issue while not raising a conflict inside the team?
