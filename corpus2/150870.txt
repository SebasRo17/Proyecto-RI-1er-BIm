I am implementing a controller class to manage a view. I have a file uploader class, Grabber, which could communicate in one of 2 ways: 1) Offer some kind of notification event to the controller on upload start and finish 2) Provide a property on Grabber that indicates true or false if upload has completed I am concerned that with option 2) I am introducing a dependency between the controller and the Grabber. What is the better design here?
