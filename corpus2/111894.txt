I am writing a class which consists mostly of data storage responsibilities. The context for the use of this class will, in general, be retrieving an array of objects of this type for display later. In light of that, I've created a static method, `build_question_array()`, which queries the database, instantiates the objects, and returns the array. Does this violate the "SOLID" principle?
