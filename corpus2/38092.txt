I'm running _Mathematica_ 9.0.1 under OS X. In order to have separate contexts for each of my notebooks, I used the instructions in the last part of the accepted answer from the following link: Is there a way to separate variables between multiple notebooks? To quote the relevant part of the answer: > "To set this automatically for all new notebooks, open the Options Inspector > (Ctrl/Command+Shift+O), and change the scope to "Global Preferences." Then, > the option CellContext is found under Cell Options -> Evaluation Options. > Change it to "Notebook." However I've found that after I do this, I lose auto-completion suggestions for symbols that I define in my notebook(s). Is there any way to fix this?
