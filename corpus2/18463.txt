Sample data:               data = {        {{2013, 1, 1}, 24.13, 167.67, 231.82},        {{2013, 1, 2}, 32.15, 170.92, 225.99},        {{2013, 1, 3}, 35.43, 172.68, 221.67},        {{2013, 1, 4}, 36.73, 173.05, 218.32},        {{2013, 1, 5}, 58.19, 165.96, 197.05},        {{2013, 1, 6}, 69.99, 163.50, 187.52},        {{2013, 1, 7}, 71.37, 154.21, 175.58},        {{2013, 1, 8}, 72.51, 149.66, 163.25}};      I want a `DateListPlot` with three graphs, so for a matrix formed by columns 1 and 2, one for columns 1 and 3, and 1 for columns 1 and 4. At the moment I'm using this code:               data2 = Transpose[{data[[All, 1]], data[[All, 2]]}];     data3 = Transpose[{data[[All, 1]], data[[All, 3]]}];     data4 = Transpose[{data[[All, 1]], data[[All, 4]]}];     DateListPlot[{data2, data3, data4}, Joined -> True, Filling -> {3 -> {1}}]      but I have a hunch that this can be done more efficiently. I don't like the `Transpose`s in particular. Any ideas?    **edit** (for extra credit)   What if I need to multiply the second column by 2, which in my solution is simply               data2 = Transpose[{data[[All, 1]], 2 * data[[All, 2]]}];
