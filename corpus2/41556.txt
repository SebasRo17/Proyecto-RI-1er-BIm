I am trying to get solution of a vector differential equation               x'[t]= aa*x[s]       where aa is my 9X9 matrix               aa= {       {0, 0, 0, s, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},       {0, 0, 0, 0, s, 0, 0, 0, 0},       {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, s, 0, 0, 0},       {-s, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0, 0},       {0, -s, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3, 0},       {0, 0, -s, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.3},       {0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},       {0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0, 0},       {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, 0, 0, 0}      }      This code               function1 =       NDSolve[{x'[s] == aa*x[s],         x[0] ==  {{1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1}}}, {x[s]}, {s, 0, 10}]      is giving me this error: > **NDSolve::deqn: "Equation or list of equations expected instead of True in > the first argument {True,True}"** Please help out how to solve this vector DE.
