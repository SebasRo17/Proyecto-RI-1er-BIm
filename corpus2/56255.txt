In version 10 using this Front End option no longer gives useful output:               SetOptions[$FrontEnd, EvaluationCompletionAction->"ShowTiming"]      In version 7 the time to evaluate and render would be printed in the window frame (status area) of the Notebook. In version 10 even a long evaluation prints a small value. I can _briefly_ see a larger number flash before it is overwritten by a small value.   1. Why is the useful timing being overwritten by an apparently meaningless one?   2. Is there a way to restore the old timing behavior? I am quite attached to this functionality. * * * As an example, evaluating this I can see a momentary flash of "Time: 3.xx seconds" before it is replaced with e.g. "Time: 0.06 seconds":               Plot[{BesselJ[1, x], BesselJ[2, x]}, {x, 0, 10},      PlotPoints -> 1*^5,       Filling -> {1 -> {2}}     ]
