I graduated from university with a computer science degree (BSc), having done some C, C++, Java, Python, and Oracle along the way. I did some freelancing while I was at university and carried this into a full time job when I graduated, and I've been working full time for a year now. PHP isn't really what I want to do, and I think it's limiting my opportunities the longer I stay along this path. It's not a language I like to use on a daily basis, and I would like to work in a larger organization, where it doesn't seem PHP has much use. I want to stay in web development, and there seems to be plenty of jobs for the Microsoft stack: C#, SQL Server, and ASP.NET MVC. But beyond a half semester writing common-line C++ in Visual Studio, I have no experience with Microsoft technology. Where do I start to make the transition to landing a job in a Microsoft shop? Are there any specific certifications I should be focusing on, or university courses I should be taking? What are employers or recruiters looking for? What can I do besides creating a pet project in my spare time?
