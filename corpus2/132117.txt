I have a database of nodes. Each node can have exactly one parent, but any number of children. Some nodes may be stored with no parent, but at run time, I can create a default "root" node to be the parent of these. First off, what is this data structure called? I think it's just a "tree," but I want to make sure I'm using the correct terminology. Another issue I'm running into is finding an efficient way to create the tree. The nodes can be retrieved from the database in any order, so when I add a node to the tree, its parent may not be in the tree yet. This means that when I add a node, I have to check whether any existing nodes have parents and then add the parent in the appropriate spot. I've searched a lot online, but most talk about trees just refers to "binary trees," and even then I can't even find any good examples of constructing the tree in code -- it's usually working with an existing tree. Are there any examples of efficient ways to build this tree (whatever it may be called)? Language doesn't matter, but I'll be using php.
