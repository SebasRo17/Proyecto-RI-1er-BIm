Our website is written in ASP.NET MVC 3 and we want to change a feature in the core functionality of the site. The problem is not every client can be moved to this new version/format (because of some technical inner restrictions) so it means that we need to keep 2 versions of the same functionality (backend and frontend) simultaneously. We don't want our clients to worry about URLs, so the ideal solution would be keep the same URL but redirect clients to the different versions. The information about clients is stored in database. So the moment when user (client) logs in we know which version of site we should show. I'm thinking about routing and areas but I'm not sure if it's possible for example to have 2 areas with the different versions of the same application. Or is it possible to load the assemblies on the fly? After user is logged in we can decide if (s)he should be redirected to the new or old version. As far as all the clients have been moved to the new version we don't need this system more. How can I do this in ASP.NET MVC?
