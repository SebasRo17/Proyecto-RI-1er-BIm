Is it important for managers to give devs regular feedback on how they're doing and vice versa? I say vice versa because I consider employees to be responsible to their manager, and managers to be responsible to their employees. Everyone seems to think this is a good idea but in practice I rarely see it happen because so many shops are "agile" now and that usually means a daily standup plus a weekly kickoff, etc. So one-on-ones just don't happen. In my last position I had my first one-on-one w/ my manager 6 months after I'd been w/ the company. It turned out there was lots of misunderstanding, misalignment and confusion built up and snowballed. Not really surprising when there's no direct personal communication for that long.
