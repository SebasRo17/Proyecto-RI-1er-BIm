I've got a library up on GitHub, with some of the binaries also distributed on NuGet: https://github.com/relentless/Http.fs I'd ignored licencing up until now, but somebody's asking about it so I though I should put something on. I want to keep it permissive, and having done a little research MIT seems like a good one to use. However, my library references/uses three other libraries, all with different licences, so I'm not quite sure what I need to do. It includes the binaries of:   * FsUnit, which has it's own licence (similar to the BSD 3-clause): https://github.com/fsharp/FsUnit/blob/master/license.txt   * NancyFx, which uses MIT: https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/blob/master/license.txt And a source file from:   * FSharpX, which uses Apache 2.0: https://github.com/fsprojects/fsharpx/blob/master/LICENSE.md The MIT of Nancy doesn't seem to be a problem. The Apache of fsharpx and the FsUnit one both say I need to include the licence text in my project. So my questions are:   1. What do I do with the other licences, just copy the files into the root of my source? I assume I can rename them and add a comment specifying which part of my project this licence refers to.   2. Assuming I go for MIT, could I reasonably describe my project as having an MIT licence? Or is the reality that it's a mixed MIT/Apache 2.0/Random licence?
