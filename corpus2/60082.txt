When developing web applications, how does one keep local files and remote files synced together? There is the obvious way, whenever you edit a file on your local machine, just upload that file to the remote machine. Is there a more efficient way? I ask because I have been using subversion control, and it is so easy to keep files synced on a remote server. All I have to do is "commit" and it will find the files which need to be replaced.
