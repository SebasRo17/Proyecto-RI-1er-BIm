Someone has asked me this question and I couldn't answer as I am not on the web part of development so I'm asking here. If one has just finished college and is trying to break through into web development/web-design a portfolio of already developed projects/sites seems to be essential to me for going to interviews. What would you say is a good number of individual sites to create for your portfolio before sending your CV and going to interviews, for a web developer position? Also what would be a good number of sites to design if you were aiming for a web designer position?
