The new legends functionality in version 9 really simplifies creating legends, and it automatically picks up the styles of the lines.               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 5},       PlotStyle -> {Directive[AbsoluteThickness[3], Orange],         Directive[AbsoluteThickness[3], Brown]}, PlotLegends -> LineLegend["Expressions"]]      ![Nice fat lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2SqPR.png) But if there is a `BaseStyle` option to the plot affecting how the lines are plotted, the legend doesn't pick that up. See how the lines in the legend are now skinnier than in the plot.               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 5}, BaseStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[3],       PlotStyle -> {Orange, Brown},  PlotLegends -> LineLegend["Expressions"]]      ![Oh noes! The lines are skinny!](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6EYEX.png) How can I get `LineLegend` to see the `BaseStyle` of the plot while maintaining the automatic functionality of not having to explicitly specify the colors used in the plot?
