Say I have an aggregate root `Entity` with some flags which are represented by an encapsulated object `EntityFlags`:               class Entity     {         /** @var EntityFlags */         private $flags;         ...     }      I have a repository for this entity. My goal is to modify flags in the DB. There are two ways I see:   1. Get entity from the repository, modify flags like `$entity->getFlags()->set($name, true)` and save it: `$repository->save($entity)`.   2. Create an additional method in the repository, e.g. `modifyFlags(EntityId $id, EntityFlags $flags)` I think the first way is redundant. But it also seems wrong to use repository for partial entity updates like in the 2nd way. Which way is the correct one? Maybe I missed something?
