I work in a middle sized team which shares the same source code and while have a continues integration in place, but as all of us has to work in the same branch, the build is almost always broken. As we also have a rule, which has been introduced recently to alleviate the broken builds, which states that no one is allowed to check-in while to build is red. Having said that, during a day everyone have a handful of 10-15 minutes windows where we allowed to check-in. And as the team is growing, the windows of check-in opportunities shrinking even more. That forces developers to accumulate their changes locally, which results in a bigger change sets which even more difficult to ensure that the changes are not breaking anything. You can see the vicious cycle. What can you recommend to allow me to stay effective working in environment like this. Also, please keep in mind that I am a developer, not a manager, and can't change the process or other people behavior much.
