Below is a simple compiled function `f` that gives multiple outputs.               f = Compile[{{a, _Real}}, Module[{k1=Table[i, {i, a}], k2=Table[i j, {i, a}, {j, a}]}, {k1, k2}]];      `CompilePrint[f]` shows `MainEvaluate` possibly because the ranks of `k1` and `k2` are diferent. Sample evaluation `f[2]` gives the following warning and proceeds to uncompiled evaluation (probably because of the `MainEvaluate`)               CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at instruction 23; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation. >>      Is there an alternate way to get multiple outputs of varying ranks from a compiled function without `MainEvaluate`?
