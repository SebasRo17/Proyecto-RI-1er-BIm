Currently our team develops Web Applications and now we are going to Windows Forms applications. I have created the inception phase for our Windows Forms project structure. eg:               ApplicationSolution          --> Security Project(Login Authentication)                    a. Users will be registered with different applications in our application database.                eg: ProjectApplicationId|ProjectName        | UserId                    1                   |ProjectApplication1| user                    2                   |ProjectApplication2| user                    b. Execute Application (Start)               c. On Security dialog, application automatically get the userid of the user and see all the application it is registered using System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent()                eg: Prototype                   Welcome User! Please Choose Appliations you are registered on below:                                      ProjectApplication1 <--this will be a dropdown                                      ProjectApplication2                   Password: [*********************]                   [Access Application Button]               d. User selects the application with its password              e. If the password is incorrect (application.exit()) else execute Selected Application                   eg: ProjectApplication1 is selected then execute ProjectApplication1          --> ProjectApplication1          --> ProjectApplication2          --> Many to come ++                  if ProjectApplications has been closed then restart security Application.      My questions on this use case:   1. Is my use case possible?   2. Can you give me any recommendations ?  Currently we use setup and deployment to create installer in each Windows Forms application.
