I want to develop a WordPress theme using Roots theme framework and then sell it on themeforest.net. Roots theme license allows me to sell the theme as per its founder's discussion with some guy on this google group post. It says that the product should have an MIT compatible license. The question is:- If I sell it on themeforest then will it be under compliance with the MIT license? I believe that themeforest has its own 'regular license'. Will the purchaser of the theme have the right to modify my theme's source code and sell it again on themeforest? Note: I don't have much knowledge of the licenses, that's why I'm here. Please don't ask me to read the license because I'm unable to understand their complex English. "INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED", "AS IS", "TORT OR OTHERWISE" etc. Can't understand it clearly.
