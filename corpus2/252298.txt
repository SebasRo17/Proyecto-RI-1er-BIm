I'm making an Android app and have it structured as a simple multi-activity app. I want to add a navigation drawer to it, and it looks like I will need to completely restructure the app and load everything as fragments. (http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav- drawer.html) How should I begin performing this "movement" of code? Should I completely copy and paste my class variables and functions into a giant file? This definitely feels like it would be prone to bugs and errors. Perhaps there's a method of separating the class files but still having one navigation drawer?
