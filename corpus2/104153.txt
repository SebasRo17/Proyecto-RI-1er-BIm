**Note:** by 'complex' math I mean an equation with many steps involved and a wide mix of operators. A programmer _should_ know the order that operators are evaluated in an equation. However it can be a royal pain to look at an equation such as:               result = value_1 + value_2 * value_1 + value_3 / value_4 % value_5;       One option is to write out the equation in multiple steps such as:               part1 = value_2 * value_1;     part1 += value_1;          part2 = value_4 % value_5;     part2 = value_3 / part2;          result = part1 + part2;      Another option is to format the original equation with parenthesis such as:               result = (value_1 + (value_2 * value_1)) + (value_3 / (value_4 % value_5));       When dealing with complex math in code, how do you typically format it to maximize readability?
