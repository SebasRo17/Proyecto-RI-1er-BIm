> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Programmers forgetting syntax   >  Do programmers need a good memory? I'm a new web developer. I began learning HTML/CSS around June of this year. I picked them up easily, now I'm moving on to Javascript. My problem is this. I understand the concepts that the training material are teaching but I find myself coming up short when it's time to apply those lessons. Mainly it's due in part to the syntax. I memorize a function, apply it, test it, move on then forget it a few days later (the syntax, not the concept). My question is this. Should I be spinning my wheels trying to remember everything, or is knowing the concept enough. I know this has been addressed before but I couldn't find any real definitive real world answers. Feel free to discuss what methods worked for you when you started out.
