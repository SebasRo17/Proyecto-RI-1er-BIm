I implemented an easy-to-use text search for our application. It has the usual text fields for   * all of the keywords   * any of the keywords    * none of the keywords Now I would like to prioritize my results. Just counting the "all" and "any" hits would be probably good enough, but may be the result is more relevant if more than the one necessary "any" term was hit. Or one could say that a lot of hits for a single word should yield "diminishing returns". Could you please give me a hint how this problem is usually handled? **Disclaimer** : I know that a "hand made" search won't scale and won't give the best possible results. This implementation is just a temporary solution, which will be replaced by something like Apache Solr, as soon as we have the resources.
