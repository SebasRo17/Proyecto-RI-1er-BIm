I would like to know how I can ask _Mathematica_ to expand (and simplify) such an expression : $$ (\alpha A + \beta B)^\top (\alpha A + \beta B) $$ where $\alpha,\beta$ are two real numbers and $A,B$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. $A^\top$ denotes the transpose of $A$. I assume I must tell _Mathematica_ that $A$ and $B$ are vectors. Here is what I have tried :               $Assumptions = (A | B) [Element] Vectors[n];         $Assumptions = (a | b) [Element] Reals;     TensorExpand[ Transpose[a*A + b*B].(a*A + b*B) ]      and the output is :               a A.Transpose[a A + b B, {2, 1}] + b B.Transpose[a A + b B, {2, 1}]      Which is not what I expected since I would like the output to be : $$ \alpha^{2} A^\top A + 2 \alpha \beta A^\top B + \beta^{2} B^\top B $$
