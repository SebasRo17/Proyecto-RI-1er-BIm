(Originally Posted on Stackoverflow) I'm sorry if this question is not appropriate for stackoverflow, I know this is not a technical question, but I feel like it is relevant. I have always been interested in programming, I have messed around with many programming languages and different game engines, making simple apps and things like that. I have been doing Java for a little over a year. Because of school, I did Java mostly on-and-off. I would do it for a month or so then pick up 6 - 8 weeks later... anyway, my point is I know the basics of Java quite well. This is because every time I jumped back into java, I would always recap from the beginning. I understand I know hardly anything. That being said I really want to learn more about the language and get better at it. I am tired of doing System.out.Print() statements, I feel like I have done almost everything I can do with them. I have also done basic work with GridLayouts and Swing. Since school is out I have been doing a lot of Java, at least a few hours a day. I have been following along with these tutorials. http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial/ The first 3 or so tutorials I completely understand, but after that it gets a bit difficult. I am not here to ask a specific question about code. But I would like to know the opinion of an experienced Java programmer. Am I approaching this the correct way? What is the best way to learn the most Java? I feel like it's gotten to the point in the tutorials where I am not befitting from them like I was in the beginning. Should I stick with what I am doing? Attempt to memorize the code? Could someone point me to somewhere else that I could learn? I have never taken a class on programming, I will be a senior in high school.
