I am looking for hints/ideas for the best (most effective) way on how to scroll multi-line items as well as emphasizing of the "current item" and "selected items" such as:               1 FOO ITEM       1 Foo sub-item       2 Foo sub-item       3 Foo sub-item          2 BAR ITEM       1 Bar sub-item          3 BAZ ITEM       1 Baz sub-item       2 Baz sub-item          4 RAB ITEM          5 ZZZ ITEM       1 Zzz sub-item       2 Zzz sub-item       3 Zzz sub-item       4 Zzz sub-item      using _NCurses_ (some combination of windows, sub-windows, pads, copywin? Uff! In fact, the lines could exceed the `stdscr`'s width so that possibility to scroll left/right would be also nice - pads?)... The whole items (including the sub-items) are supposed to be emphasized as full-width window/pad areas. The "current item" (including it's set of lines) should be emphasized (i.e. using `A_BOLD`), selected set of items of choice (including the set of lines for each the selected item) should be emphasized in another way (i.e. using `A_REVERSE`). What would you choose to cope with it the most effective NCurses way? (The less redrawals/refreshes the better and terminal is supposed to have the ability to change it's size - such as XTerm running under "floating window" management.) Thank you for your ideas (or perhaps some piece of code where something similar is already solved - I was not able to find anything helpful on the Internet. I mean I am not going to copy/paste foreign code but programming NCurses _properly_ is still somehow difficult to me). P.S.: Would you suggest to "smooth-scroll" +1/-1 screen line or rather "jump- scroll" +lines/-lines of the items? (I personally prefer the latter one.) Sincerely, \-- mjf
