Does anybody know of any one month creative challenges for programmers, sort of like National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMonth) but for programmers. One month in which you must create something, not just a series of challenges for you to overcome, or problems for you to solve. Something like: National Website Building Month (NaWebBuMo), or National Game Building Month (NaGaBuMo), but real instead of fabrications spun from my mind? I'm looking for something that asks that you have a (relatively) finished product at the end of thirty days.
