So I feel like this should be a common question but I can't find the answer. Maybe I'm using the wrong terminology. Assumptions:   * IDs are supposed to be unique across the document.   * Class attributes are meant for CSS and should not be used in JS selectors.   * Name attributes are not appropriate ID replacements since they don't work the same on all elements and the html 5 spec changed them (removed from certain elements I think). So given something like: The page has multiple of the same widget. Each widget has a unique ID. I need to be able to reference widget sub-elements like `$("#widgetID relativeID")`. So that relative IDs are unique within widgets but may be duplicated outside this scope. I had been using name for this but it seems this isn't the correct way What is?
