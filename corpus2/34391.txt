How might I split a word at each IPA of each unique sound. For example               {"pray", "wade"}     (* {{"p","r","ˈeɪ"}, {"w","ˈeɪ","d"}} *)      ssch answered a question here showing how to add the IPA form to WordData. After adding such values I determined that ideally I am looking to separate the values in between each IPA sound(this probably isn't the correct terminology). An example would be the following `"pray"` and `{"p","r","ˈeɪ"}`. `"wade"` would return `{"w","ˈeɪ","d"}` Ideally a list of each unique IPA sound could be useful something like `{"b", "d", "dʒ", "f", "g", "h"....` So how might I get a list of Mathemametica's IPA sounds such that I can split a word's IPA form at each unique IPA sound?
