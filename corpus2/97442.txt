I live in a small Baltic country and I've been working as a software developer for 5+ years, with coding experience of 10+ years. Mainly specializing in C/C++. The problem is that the projects I had to work on, were really tiny in global scale, and also involved some switching to .NET and that likes. I want to keep growing, and try working on bigger things, with larger teams, environments with new methodologies, with teams following best practices, things like code reviews, and with super-star developers so that I could learn from them, and try to be like them. During the last few years, I've run into a situation where I only develop solutions, but I don't see any career opportunities or a way how I could learn more. I do read books in my free time, but I have a feeling they won't help me much to find a better position or extremely challenging projects. There are still things I want to learn, I want to find a challenging position that would allow me to learn how to write even more amazing things in C/C++, but I don't know how to search for these positions. Does anyone have any tips on where to start? It feels like I'm stuck where I am, but I still want to grow.
