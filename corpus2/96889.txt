In an attempt to not reinvent a wheel, I'm asking if anyone has ideas on a data homogeneity algorithm. A brief example: My data has several elements maybe like   1. Number    2. Color   3. Fruit   4. Letter There are around a 100 of these elements in an array. The algorithm needs to _sort_ the elements so that any 2 entries with the same number are spaced out from each other as much as possible, and the same with color, fruit, etc. It'd also be nice if I could prioritize the elements. It feels like you'd never reach 100% so you'd give it a number of passes to make, check out the result, then try more passes on it. I wouldn't be surprised if there's something out here that just works that I don't have enough google-fu to find.
