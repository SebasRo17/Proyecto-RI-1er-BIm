I have a web application developed using Python, HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The customer installs it in any of their own Machine and uses it through their LAN. In short the customer sets up the webserver in any of their own machine. Since its a web application, all the source code is open for the customer in the document root directory of webserver. I want to encrypt the whole source code in the document root directory in such a way that it should not effect the working of the web application. Is there is any way to encrypt the Python, HTML, CSS & JavaScript for this purpose.
