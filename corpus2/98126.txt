I am in charge of the deployment or implementation work.Due to my company's immaturity product,there is a version upgrade serveral days. Each time there is a upgrade version,I had to notify the customer they had to replace their old version product.What I do is reconfigure all the configuration files for different customers who has its specific needs. Finally email them the new version of products and tell them ... Doing all this work is boring. Is there anyone have similar experiences? Any advice is welcomed. More context: I get a updated version from svn respository,it's configuration files is default.And each customer needs serveral configuration files different from each other,but their own configuration files is normally stay unchanged.My work is to export serveral products from the svn folder for each customer and copy their own configuration files in.
