So I've forked someone else's repository, made a few changes, submitted a pull request, and my changes made it into the product. Great! But...what should I do with my forked repository? Is there a compelling reason for me to keep my repository around, or should I go ahead and delete it? I don't plan on making any additional contributions, but if I change my mind I assume I can always just re-fork it. I'm not really concerned about keeping a backup. I'm more worried about breaking links, losing commit messages, etc.
