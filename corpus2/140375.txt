I've been talking with a friend about the purpose of Javascript, when and how it should be used, etc. He quoted that: > JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages > > [...] > > JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool > >   * HTML authors are normally not programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting > language with a very simple syntax!

My friend also advocates against using Javascript's OOP functionality, claiming that "you shouldn't be processing data, merely validating." Is Javascript really limited to validating data and making flashy graphics on a web page? He goes on to claim "you shouldn't be attempting to access databases through javascript" and also says " in general you don't want to be doing your heavy lifting in javascript". I can't say I agree with his opinion, but I'd like to get some more input on this. So, my question: Has Javascript evolved from the definition above to something more powerful, has the way we use it changed, or am I just plain wrong? While I realize this is a subjective question, I can't find any more information on it, so a few links would be good, if nothing else. I'm not looking for a debate, just an answer.
