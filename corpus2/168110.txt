I am in the beginning phase of create a mobile MMO with my team. The server software will be written in JavaScript using NodeJS, and the client software in Lua using Corona. We need a tool to auto-generate documentation for both the server-side and client-side code. Are there any tools which can generate documentation for both Lua and Javascript? And as a bonus: we are hosting our project on Bitbucket and the Bitbucket Wiki uses the Creole markup language. So if it's possible I want the tool to export to Creole. Edit: I know about tools for generating documentation for one of both languages. However, I don't want 2 different styles for documentation in one project. Therefore one tool which can generate documentation for both languages would be great.
