Using `NMinimize` for finding global minima, one can choose the `DifferentialEvolution` method. You can find a (not so) detailed description in the link Constrained Optimization. That being said, I would like to know if there is a simple way to implement the randomization of the value attributed to the option `ScalingFactor`. Such a feature should enhance the method: > It has been found recently that selecting F from the interval [0.5, 1.0] > randomly for each generation or for each difference vector, a technique > called dither, improves convergence behaviour significantly (Differential > Evolution Homepage) where the `F` mentioned in the quote corresponds to the value of `ScalingFactor` in _Mathematica_. Probably, this is my lack of knowledge on the details of _Mathematica_ showing up, but I don't know how to tell that in each step of `NMinimize` it should put `RandomReal[{0.5,1.}]` in the option `ScalingFactor`.
