I'm programming a windows phone 7 app which needs authentication for news-like read access. I use Application.UnhandledException to handle (my) `AuthFailedException`, which can be thrown from any page, and navigate to a login page. To mimic a modal dialog, I do the following:   1. I attach a `BackKeyPress` event handler to clear the back stack, effectively causing the app to exit.    2. On login, I invoke the actual go-back behavior to get back to the previous page, which threw the `AuthFailedException` (all in the view model via proper dependency injection). This feels dirty, but at least a little better than what hacks might be neccessary otherwise... Any advice on how to improve the situation?
