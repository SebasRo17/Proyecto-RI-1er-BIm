I am working on a Bulls and cows game. And I have the following code that calculated the number of bulls and cows: let User and comp be the lists that have the 3 digits that the user entered and the number randomly generated by the comp               cows = 0          bulls = 0          for x in User:              if x in comp:                  if comp.index(x) == User.index(x):                      bulls += 1                  else:                      cows += 1      This works completely fine, unless the number generated by the computer has repeated digit(like 277) and I enter 447. then what happens is that I get 1 cow and zero bulls. Whereas I should get 1 bull and 0 cows. **Note that there is no issue with the game when there are no repeated digits.** I am unable to get what the problem is and why it is occurring. I would greatly appreciate any kind of help in understanding the root of this problem. **more importantly** I want to get this done with. So I want a clarification on this approach or I want a new way to think about this. I am using Python Tkinter to program this game. **please** help me with this issue.
