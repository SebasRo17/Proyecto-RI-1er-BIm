I want to test, for example with `MatchQ`, if the argument of a function is an arbitrary expression in a single or several variables whose names can be assumed to be known. Except of these variables the expression should contain only numeric values. An approach would be to generate a list of unknowns in an expression and to compare this list to a given one. But I do not know either how to create that list for an arbitrary expression. By expression I mean a mathematical expression here. **Edit** Exampe:               (1-Exp[I*(x-5.6)*23.4])*Log[Abs[x-4.3]]/(1.7+3.2*I-x^2)      should be matched if I require it to be an expression in `x` and               (1-Exp[I*(x-y)*23.4])*Log[Abs[x-4.3]]/(1.7+3.2*I-x^2)      should not be matched in this case. Note that this does not mean that you can assume that the expression contains only these functions and rationals. My function               func[expr_?...,var]:=Module[{},...]      should evaluate only if the expression is e.g. of the first kind               func[(1-Exp[I*(x-5.6)*23.4])*Log[Abs[x-4.3]]/(1.7+3.2*I-x^2),x]
