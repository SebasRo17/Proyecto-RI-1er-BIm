Is it possible to define the format for a part of `Text` in a plot? For instance, is it possible to have `v` bold and `(a)` italic:               Show[Graphics3D[Line[{{0, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1}}]],      Graphics3D[Text["v(a)", {1.1, 1.1, 1.1}, BaseStyle -> Large]],      PlotRange -> {{0, 2}, {0, 2}, {0, 2}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/50kbE.png)
