I have a program that gives the average distance as the output. When I tried to repeat finding the average distance 100 times using Table, It failed to generate the output. This is the program.               Xarray = A @@@ Tuples[Range[0, 4], 3];     Table[M = RandomSample[Xarray, 7];     energies = RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[1.5], {7}];     f = {#, First@Pick[energies, M, #]} &;     list = Map[f, M]     c = Subsets[Range[Length@list], {2}];     d = Length@%          distanceBetween[{n_, m_}] :=        Norm[List @@ list[[n, 1]] - List @@ list[[m, 1]]]          Map[distanceBetween, c]     ans = % // N;          Total[%/d], {i, 100}]      The program is like this. I created an array of let say 500 elements and assigned energy to it. Next I choose a coordinate from the list and find the distance from other coordinates using the norm equation. Next I sum up that distances in the list and take the average of the distance. The Problem comes when I am trying to do this process 100 times using Table or Do command.
