I'm starting a brand new project. The main access from the client side app will be via an API written in ASP.Net MVC3.   I'm looking for discussions on how best to handle logging information for security access as well has how to handle Phishing and Brute Force.   On the Information side of things, I'd also like some ideas on what to keep track of to help me both better improve the application in the future and to be able to market it better.   Anyone got any suggestions or links?
