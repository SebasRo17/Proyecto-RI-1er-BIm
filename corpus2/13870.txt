A bit of background: I've got a small open source project that I've started on, a basic framework which provides an object oriented means of generating HTML code (since I don't really like HTML, and I do like PHP). It has some released source, and a few downloads, but primarily, the project is for me, with the Open Source portion just being a side benefit. The original project which caused me to be able to develop on this project has mostly gone into hibernation for the time being, which means that all the development I get to sink into it at this point is personal time only. Unfortunately, I'm currently working toward my bachelor's degree, studying for certifications, and I have a three month old baby at home. In short, by the time I get around to "me time", I rarely feel like doing work, but rather usually feel like just chilling out. So, if there's anyone else out there who feels like they're in a similar position, what strategies have you used to keep yourself motivated toward working on the project? I would really like to at least be able to work on this until I have 100% spec coverage, but I haven't committed source in months. Anyone out there who can help?
