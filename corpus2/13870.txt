As near as I can tell, `NotebookPrint` goes directly to the default printer, without employing the system standard process of opening a print dialog first. Specifically, I'd like to he able to use `NotebookPrint`, or an alternative function, `somePrintFunction` to print an arbitrary expression, `expr`, using the form               somePrintFunction[expr]      and have the standard system dialog for printing appear. Is there a way to force `NotebookPrint` to do this? Is there some other function that does?
