Consider this simple 3D rendering with some geometric primitives:               Graphics3D[{Cylinder[{{-1, -1, 0}, {-1, -1, 1}}, .42], Cuboid[],        Polygon[{{-2, -2, 0}, {2, -2, 0}, {2, 2, 0}, {-2, 2, 0}}],        Sphere[{.3, -.6, .5}, .5]}, Boxed -> False]      How can I get the depth of each _pixel_ of the rendering, i.e. the distance of the corresponding point to the camera? **Edit:** The required depth image would be something like the OpenGL z-buffer. Vertices alone are not enough - I need the depth of every pixel in the rendered image.
