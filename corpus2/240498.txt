I just got done watching an informative Box tech talk by Nicholas Zakas on a javascript architecture for web development: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKouqShWI4o&feature=youtu.be This image, which I acquired from http://alanlindsay.me/kerneljs/index.html#nav-what , will give you an overview of the architecture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oKTpl.png) However, to give you a brief summary and help you avoid mundane stuff, the Kernel is basically an Application Controller which makes up the C in the MVC. Now I obviously have to take care of the possibility of an environment where Javascript is disabled. I was wondering if that effectively meant developing an application controller in a language such as PHP and maintaining it in parallel to the one written in Javascript along with the ensuing commands/modules? There's something smelly about that, is there a better way to do this?
