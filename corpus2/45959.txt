I have an image that has various characters hand drawn in it, like numbers and letters. I'm trying to partition each character into it's own image so I can run it through `Classify[]` and identify them one at a time (since `TextRecognize[]` doesn't work well on individual characters). My images look like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GjN95.jpg) That's a bunch of 1's for putting into `Classify[]`. So it should be pretty easy to partition each one, but I'm not sure what the best way to do it is. I tried adapting this example: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/example/AnalyzeSegmentedCellsInAnImage.html but I couldn't get it to work.               characters =        SelectComponents[        DeleteBorderComponents[Binarize[a, {0, .7}]], {"Area"},         100 < #1 < 1000 &];          outlines =        ComponentMeasurements[         ImageMultiply[a, characters], {"BoundingBox"}][[All, 2]];          Show[a, Graphics[{Red, Thick, Circle @@ # & /@ outlines}]];      This just returns a slightly lighter version of the original image with no red anywhere.
