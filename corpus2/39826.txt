Is it possible to increase the perforamce the `DensityPlot`? For example, let's try to plot this "flower"               f[x_, y_] := (x^2 + y^2) Exp[-x^2 - y^2] Sin[10 Sqrt[x^2 + y^2] + 10 ArcTan[x, y]]^4;          DensityPlot[f[x, y], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}, PlotPoints -> 200,       MaxRecursion -> 3, ColorFunction -> Hue, PlotRange -> All,       ColorFunctionScaling -> False, ImageSize -> 600]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aSwfo.png) This toy example takes about 12 seconds on my laptop, eats about 1GB of RAM while plotting and the 34MB result slow down the notebook. The question is   1. How to increase the speed?   2. How to decrease the `MaxMemoryUsed`?   3. How to decrease the size of the output?
