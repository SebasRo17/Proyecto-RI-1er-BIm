So I'm creating a very simple project/task management application in Laravel 4 and I'm not sure how these relationships would work. I have a `Project`, `Task` and `User` model. A `User` can own a `Project` or be a member of a `Project`. A `Task` belongs to a `User` and a `Project`. What is the best way to define the `User`/`Project` relationship? I could have a many to many relationship from `User` to `Project` and use a `project_user` pivot table to associate the two. If I wanted to determine if a `User` owned the project I could add a field to `Project` called `owner` and populate it with the id of the `User` who created it. This seems kind of wrong though as this relationship would normally be modeled in a belongs to relationship? Any advice is greatly appreciated :)
