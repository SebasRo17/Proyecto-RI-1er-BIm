I'd like to be able to define functions (at least simple ones that _Mathematica_ can otherwise understand) using `TraditionalForm`; but this seems to require the use of an underscore. For example, I'd like to be able to have something like $$f(x) = x^2$$ correspond to               f[x_]:=x^2      but _Mathematica_ seems to require $$f(x\text{_}) = x^2$$ which goes a long way towards defeating the whole purpose. Is there, perhaps, a way to define some formatting that's less obtrusive, and more "conventionally notational" than the underscore that could correspond to the `TraditionalForm` underscore (and thus resolve any ambiguities)?
