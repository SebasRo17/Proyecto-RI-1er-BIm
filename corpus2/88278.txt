I've just recently been on a project and during the release, we realized that it didn't work in Production. It works in all other environments but because we have a separate release team, and we cannot set up the servers and environments ourselves, we have no visibility of the configuration on them. We suspect that Prod has some user permissions in its account or IIS settings that are different, so we are working though it now. So I think this whole thing has been a learning experience for me and I don't want the same thing repeated again. I would like to ask, how different should these environments be? I always thought that PreProd should be an identical copy to the Prod environment using a copy of the same database, using a copy of the same user account, should be installed on the same servers etc. But how far should I take it? If the web site is externally facing, should PreProd be externally facing? What if the website has components that don't require a user account or password to navigate to? Is it still okay to expose it to the outside world?
