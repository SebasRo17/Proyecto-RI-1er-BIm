Reading a recent question: Is it actually possible to have a 'useful' programming language that isn't Turing complete?, I've come to wonder whether non Turing-complete programming languages are considered programming languages at all. Since Turing-completeness means a language has to have variables to store values as well as control structures ( for, while )... Is a language that lacks these features considered a programming language ?
