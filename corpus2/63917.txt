I'm a novice programmer who has just learnt some languages and want to experiment & sharpen my skills. I've learnt quite a few languages like C, C++, Python, VC++, Java. I want to learn to program on Mobile(Hand-held) devices.What would be the best way to start? Could anyone please suggest me from where to start? I have heard that I would have to work on Emulators, but googling it didn't help. I know that there are quite a few experienced programmers who could help me and show me the appropriate path. As you'll must have guessed by just reading my question that I don't have a perfect picture of what I want, so may be my question isn't Bang On!! ... Please Help
