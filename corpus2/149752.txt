I have a class which contains two methods. These methods add & remove an object to a datastore. The class which contains these methods has a no arg constructor but each of the two methods takes a variable amount of parameters for the addition / removal. Should these methods be static and if not should the method parameters be initialized within the structure as instance variables instead of at the method level ? pseudo code :                  class Utility {                 public Utility(){         }              public void add(String arg1, int arg2, boolean arg3){         //add logic here         }              public void remove(int arg1, char arg2, float arg3){         //remove logic here         }         }
