How does one multiply a list of matrices by a list of vectors, elementwise? For example, multiplying               A = {IdentityMatrix[2], 2*IdentityMatrix[2]}     x = {{1, 1}, {2, -2}}      should return               {{1, 1}, {4, -4}}      Neither `Dot` nor `Times` accomplishes this; both have the wrong dimensions. A cumbersome way would be               result = {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}     Do[result[[i]] = A[[i]].x[[i]], {i, 2}]      but surely there is a cleaner way.
