At work we have a varied number of websites selling second-hand products. The bosses have noticed that there's often some overlap between the products sold on some of the websites and would like to syndicate content from one site to one or more of the others. The main problem I'm having is that taxonomy on each site is different, so it's not a straight-forward task to put adverts from Site A into a known taxonomy location in Site B. e.g. three sites sell second-hand bicycles but each site's each taxonomy is different... Site A's taxonomy: For Sale > Sports Equipment > Bicycles Site B's taxonomy: Bicycles > Mountain Bikes Site C's taxonomy: Second-hand > Bicycles > Adults' Bikes > 26" Wheel The notion is, for example, that all adverts placed on Site A would be pushed to a routing engine which would decide whether or not the advert should be pushed out to other sites, and it struck me this could be a place to do the taxonomy mapping... but I'm stumped as to an elegant way to go about it. I'm also conscious that although these taxonomies are fairly stable, they're not set in stone! Anyone any ideas on how they'd go about approaching this problem?! Cheers, Adam
