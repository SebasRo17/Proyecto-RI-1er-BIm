If the question appears to be off topic then please migrate to some other suitable domain on stackexchange. **Q.why to have GUI along with CLI, when you already have command line interface?** I'm currently developing an application. As of now application has a command line interface. The target machines for application will be **80% servers and 20% workstations**. I'm considering to provide GUI too for the application. **GUI Use Case:** Product registration is main use case i.e. my product needs license key to run. And after that only some text info will be shown every time its launched. Only 2-3 buttons to perform extended functions. **CLI Use Case:** Product registration will expect some arguments as command line arguments. Later the 2-3 extended functions available in GUI can also be started from command line.
