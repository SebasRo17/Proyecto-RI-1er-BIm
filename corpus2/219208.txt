I'm trying to understand if a programming languages design is built on some a theoretical model.   I came across few links that was describing Programming Language Theory, Lambda Calculus, Formal Languages and Turing machine. I got lost in all that theory, what I understood from all that is that (any ..?) programming language is built on lambda calculus, that boils down to few language constructs.   1. is my understanding correct?   2. are there any models other than lambda calculus?   3. if the languages shares the same model, can we use that to convert a source code from one language to the other?
