I'm trying to understand the differences between controlling kernels and subkernels. I created 3 local kernels (kernel configuration options > add), each using a maximum of 8 local subkernels. However on the Wolfram User Portal my license reads               Controlling 2      Computing 8      So what are these "controlling kernels" ? Is there a limit on local kernels that can be started ? Cf. This question on the same topic, but the answers appear contradictory. Following one of these answers, I don't understood how I am allowed to run 3 local kernels. Additionally, what is the difference between launching 1 front-end and having many local kernels and launching many front-ends each with only one local kernel ?
