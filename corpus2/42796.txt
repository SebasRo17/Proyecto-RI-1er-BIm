I have a `Manipulate` that uses `RandomVariate` and `Random` that I would like to have redraw and recompute random values selectively, depending on what `Manipulate` parameters have been changed. For example, I would like to be able to control redraws and recomputations so that   * new `data` and `honestMeans` are only computed if `n` has changed;   * new `punishMeans` are computed only when `n` or `punish` have changed;   * a redraw is triggered when `zoom` changes, but without triggering an update to `data`, `honestMeans` or `punishMeans`;   * a redraw triggered when any of `data`, `honestMeans` or `punishMeans` or `zoom` changes (without triggering a recomputation of `data`, `honestMeans` or `punishMeans`);   * everything updates if an explicit update is requested (somehow) as indicated in the comments below:               scale = 5;     dist = HypergeometricDistribution[scale, Round[0.7*2*scale], 2*scale];     genVotes[punish_, n_] := Module[{},        votes = {data[[1]]};        For[i = 2, i <= n, i++,         If[Random[] < punish,          If[votes[[i - 1]] > data[[i]], vote = 0, vote = scale],          vote = data[[i]]          ];         AppendTo[votes, Mean[Append[data[[1 ;; i - 1]], vote]]];         AppendTo[votes, Mean[Append[data[[1 ;; i - 1]], data[[i]]]]];         ]; Return[votes];        ];          Manipulate[       data = RandomVariate[dist, n];(* Should only change when n changes *)       punishMeans = genVotes[punish, n]; (* Should change when punish or n change *)       honestMeans = genVotes[0, n]; (* Should only change when n changes *)       GraphicsColumn[{ (* Should redraw when any of the above change, or if zoom changes, without triggering recompilation of data, punishMeans or honestMeans *)        Show[         ListPlot[punishMeans,          Joined -> False, PlotStyle -> Gray, PlotMarkers -> Automatic,           PlotRange -> {{0, n}, {(1 - zoom)*#, (1 + zoom)*#} &[Mean[data]]},          Frame -> True, Axes -> None,          Epilog -> {Blue, Line[{{0, Mean[data]}, {n, Mean[data]}}]}],         ListPlot[honestMeans,          Joined -> True, PlotStyle -> Black, PlotMarkers -> None]         ],        Show[         Histogram[data, scale, PlotRange -> {{0, scale + 1}, All},           Frame -> True,          FrameTicks -> {{Automatic,              Automatic}, {{# + .5, #, 0} & /@ Range[0, scale], None}},           Axes -> None],         DiscretePlot[n*PDF[dist, x], {x, 0, scale + 1}, Joined -> True,           PlotMarkers -> None, Filling -> None]         ]        }],      {{n, 100}, 10, 5000},      {{punish, 0.5}, 0, 1},      Delimiter,      {{zoom, 0.2}, .1, .5},      TrackedSymbols :> {n, punish, zoom}]      Is there a way to do this kind of selective update of elements of a `Manipulate`?
