My team just started using crucible/fisheye for initiating code reviews whenever one of us checks something in. There are only 3 of us, and we're each encouraged to review the code and leave comments where we see fit. My question is, how do I best leave a comment on a line of code I see a problem with? I want to get my point across without seeming abrasive. I don't want to seem like I'm on a high horse and say " _I've been doing it this way..._ and I also don't want to seem like I'm trying to be authoritative and say something like " _This should be done this way..._ " but I still need to get the point across that what they're doing is not very good. **To Clarify:** This is a really good resource for _what_ I should be looking to comment on: code review: Is it subjective or objective(quantifiable)?, but I'm looking for _how_ to comment on it.
