I am trying to create a table with conditionals inline. For example, I'd like to create a 2 dimensional table like this:               Table[{i, j} -> 1, {i, 1, 3}, {j, 1, 3}]      Now, I'd like `Table` to generate values _only if_ `i != 1`. It should be easy, but I'm lost. I've tried several approaches, like the following, but I don't get what I want in a neat way:               Table[If[i != 1, {i, j} -> 1], {i, 1, 3}, {j, 1, 3}]      > {{Null, Null, Null}, {{2, 1} -> 1, {2, 2} -> 1, {2, 3} -> 1}, {{3, 1} -> 1, > {3, 2} -> 1, {3, 3} -> 1}} I know, I could delete cases, but there must be a clean and simple way!
