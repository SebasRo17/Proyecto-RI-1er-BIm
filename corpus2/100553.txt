We have a team of .NET developers (C#) with a range of experience from 2 to 6 years. Over the last few years we have been developing Silverlight, ASP.NET MVC, and WPF applications. However, there is a new two year project which means we will develop a HTML5 application on Linux. The company I work for would like all developers across their offices to use the same programming language which is Java. Although there is talk of using Mono but using the same language and sharing modules, services, etc. already created in Java is the main reason for moving to Java. Some of the developers here are upset. How do I find something positive in moving over that will convince the other developers? There will be a training budget, but the thought of learning to work with Java libraries and a new platform (Linux) will be scaring a lot of the guys. What should I do?
