Given a constructor that will never, ever, have to use any different implementations of several objects that it initializes, is it still practical to use DI? After all, we might still want to unit test. The class in question initializes a few other classes in its constructor and the classes it uses are pretty specific. It will never use another implementation. Are we justified in avoiding trying to program to an interface?
