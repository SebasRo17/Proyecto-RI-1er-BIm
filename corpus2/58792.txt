I use the following command to export plots to PDF which I then use in latex:               plot = Plot[x^2, {x, -2, 2}, AxesLabel -> {x, x^2},             PlotLegends -> {"Function f(x) = x^2"}]     Export[NotebookDirectory[] <> "SimplePlot.pdf", plot]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XJk4R.png) Now the "problem" is that the font of $x$, $x^2$ and $f(x)=x^2$ is not at all similar to the standard font of latex. I found that the command `TraditionalForm` produces output with a font that seems to fit latex much better: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PCsuS.png) But simply putting `AxesLabel -> {TraditionalForm[x], TraditionalForm[x^2]}` for example does not change the plot's font. So how can I change the font in my plot to the one that `TraditionalForm` offers? And no, I do not want to change the font in latex. ;)
