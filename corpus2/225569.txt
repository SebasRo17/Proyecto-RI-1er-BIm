We are a team of programmers and are employing a new person who will be a project manager only. Our project are only programming ones and we are not sure how to decide who will be the best for project manager. Shall we find a senior programmer from our programming field? Or we must find a regular guy (economics or management studies) who never coded in his life? **EDIT** A project manager will_   * Create tasks for developers   * Monitor that our ticket workflow is respected   * Warn developers is they cross estimated work time    * Manage weekly finance timesheets   * Help client and reply to his questions   * Set meetings between client and developers (internet meetings) And similar things. Now, when I wrote this I see that there are no IT tasks in here. But what about simple questions the clients ask and which an educated It person will be able to reply? we obviously cannot bother programmers for this all the time. this is the main reason whay we are in doubt.
