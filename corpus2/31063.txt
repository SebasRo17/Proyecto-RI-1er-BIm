This is semi-hypothetical, and as I've no experience in dealing with massive database tables, I have no idea if this is horrible for some reason. On to the situation: Imagine a web based application - lets say accounting software - which has 20,000 clients and each client has 1000+ entries in a table. That's 20 million rows which I know can certainly slow down complex queries. In a case like this, does it make more sense to create a new table in the database for each client? How do databases react to having 20k (or more!) tables?
