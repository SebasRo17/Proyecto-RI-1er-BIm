Suppose, I have a function written as Taylor-Maclaurin series               f = Sum[c[n]*x^n, {n, 0, Infinity}]      Now, I wish to differentiate this expression with respect to `x` symbolically               D[f, x]     (* --->     Sum[n*x^(-1 + n)*c[n], {n, 0, Infinity}] *)      Resulting expression is correct except from the fact that expansion starts from `n=1` now, because `n=0` term vanishes after differentiation (if done explicitly). In this case it isn't a problem because `n=0` term vanishes anyway, but for more complicated computations it may be the reason for breaking further simplifications. So, my question is: How can I teach Mathematica to correctly change bounds of summation?
