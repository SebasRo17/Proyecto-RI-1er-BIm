Today I posted a question asking about which language C# or Java would be better for me to study. I had some great answers. One thing that came up was that perhaps Java is now rather behind C# with new features. I saw some web links and most pointed out what C# had and what java did not have. So my question to you all is will Java catch up with C# again? And if you were to take a guess where would it stand in 5 years time. Would it have all the things that are maybe now missing? How about Java 7?
