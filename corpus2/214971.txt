I have a class, say `Foo,` and every instance of Foo will need and contain the same List object, `myList.` Since every class instance will share the same List Object, I thought it would be good to make `myList` static and use a static function to set `myList` before the constructor is called. I was wondering if this was bad, because this requires the setter to be called before the constructor? If the person doesn't, the program will crash. Alternative way would be passing `myList` every time.
