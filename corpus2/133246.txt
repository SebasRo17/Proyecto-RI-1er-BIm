I have worked in a highly specialized position for 10 years which involves RPG, CLP programming on an AS400, mainly to supplement a poorly written EDI app. My company does not hire enough people so I have also been wearing other hats up to and including help desk. The job is so demanding and frustrating that I am ashamed to say I have lost some of my skills in other programming languages and I have not had time nor the money to pay for any refresher courses. In fact I would not even know where to start. What is the easiest way for a person like me to transition from doing something I hate to something more fun or at least a change of pace.. like Web Development? I am looking at taking a training course and eventually getting an MCPD certification..would this do it? Also, do you really have to have some hands on experience with these languages to get certified or would 10 years of programming in another language suffice? Any advice would be helpful as I am extremely unhappy with my current professional life.
