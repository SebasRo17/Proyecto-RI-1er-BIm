Working on a statically typed language with type inference and streamlined syntax, and need to make final decision about syntax for variable declaration versus assignment. Specifically I'm trying to choose between:               // Option 1. Create new local variable with :=, assign with =     foo := 1     foo = 2          // Option 2. Create new local variable with =, assign with :=     foo = 1     foo := 2      Creating functions will use `=` regardless:               // Indentation delimits blocks     square x =         x * x      And assignment to compound objects will do likewise:               sky.color = blue     a[i] = 0      Which of options 1 or 2 would people find most convenient/least surprising/otherwise best?
