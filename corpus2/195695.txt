Argument which is always made in favour of Clojure is that. The syntax is simpler and there is only one way of expressing code with no complicated rules. However Scala has loads of different types of syntax and constructs as compared to Clojure. But from last one week while trying to learn Clojure, I have noticed that the list of inbuilt macros are endless, Even though we write them with the same parenthesis syntax we need to learn how each works. So in what sense is Clojure's syntax simpler ? For LISPers it might be but for people from a different background learning different constructs in Scala seems simpler. So from a neutral point of view, which syntax is simpler and readable?
