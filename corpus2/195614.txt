I am learning how to draw a UML class diagram and after reading a few tutorials, I am still confused about the appropriate usages of **Association type** (The clear diamond and black diamond). I understand their usages but I haven't got a very concrete understanding on when to use them and when not to. For example in the sample class diagram below, I would have thought that if **Customer** does not exist, the **Order** will be gone too but an association diamond was not being used. Hope someone can provide me with more explaination/examples on the usages of association types. Thanks. ![Sample ordering class diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HQxT9.png)
