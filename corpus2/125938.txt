To be more specific, let me explain my end result goal or more of what I would LIKE to have someday and then you can tell me if its even feasible and if not possibly an alternative method. I really would like to have a tool like `smush.it` it is a website Yahoo runs that optimizes images, it is currently one of the best out there. There FAQ page say they use all these programs to do it... **ImageMagick:** to identify the image type and to convert GIF files to PNG files.   **pngcrush:** to strip unneeded chunks from PNGs. We are also experimenting with other PNG reduction tools such as **pngout, optipng, pngrewrite**. Hopefully these tools will provide improved optimization of PNG files.   **jpegtran:** to strip all metadata from JPEGs (currently disabled) and try progressive JPEGs. **gifsicle:** to optimize GIF animations by stripping repeating pixels in different frames. More information about the smushing process is available at the Optimize Images section of Best Practices for High Performance Web pages. So basically you upload an image and it determines it's file type and runs it through the appropriate programs or programs and returns an optimized image and tell the original size and thew new size of the image. If you search across StackOverflow you will see that many people are searching for an all in one program that can do this, mainly from the command line for Build scripts to use. Now I am curious, is it possible to make a program that could be like 1 package that would include all these other programs into it, so on Windows it would be like 1 exe file or even a jar file would probably work as I know Yahoo has a jar file for Javascript compression that my Build script can use. In my searches I have found 1 project that is similar but I am not sure if it is really what I am after, it is http://trimage.org/ it uses uses OptiPNG, PNGCrush, AdvPNG, JPEGOptim. My problem with this 1 is first of all they do not release it for Windows but they say it's may be able to work on Windows, but mainly I saw the source code and it is just a bunch of Python scripts, also the programs it uses, all have to be installed separately. My goal is to be able to not have to install 4-5 separate programs but to have them as 1 Please tell me if this is just a dream or something that's id possible, I only have a PHP background so hardly the knowledge for a project like this
