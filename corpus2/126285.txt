I'm trying to work a bit with Entity Framework and I got a question regarding the separation of layers. I usually use the UI -> BLL -> DAL approach and I'm wondering how to use EF here. My DAL would usually be something like               GetPerson(id)     {         // some sql         return new Person(...)     }      BLL:               GetPerson(id)     {         Return personDL.GetPerson(id)     }      UI:               Person p = personBL.GetPerson(id)      My question now is: since EF creates my model and DAL, is it a good idea to wrap EF inside my own DAL or is it just a waste of time? If I don't need to wrap EF would I still place my Model.esmx inside its own class library or would it be fine to just place it inside my BLL and work some there? I can't really see the reason to wrap EF inside my own DAL but I want to know what other people are doing. So instead of having the above, I would leave out the DAL and just do: BLL:               GetPerson(id)     {         using (TestEntities context = new TestEntities())         {                 var result = from p in context.Persons.Where(p => p.Id = id)                                     select p;         }     }      What to do?
