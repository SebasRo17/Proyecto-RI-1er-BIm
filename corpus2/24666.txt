I am trying to plot my velocity profile, similar to this plot (not the arrows, just the shape) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lmzSd.jpg) Here is my function               Diam = 2;     Uavg = 200;     SL = 40;     R = Diam/2;     theta[r_] := ArcCos[SL*Diam^2/(8*Uavg*(R^2 - r^2))];     Plot[Piecewise[{{SL/Cos[theta[r]], r >= 0}, {8*R^2*Uavg/Diam^2,      r = 0}}], {r, 0, 0.99}]
