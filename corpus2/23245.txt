Provided two _unlabeled_ graphs, $G$ and $H$, I would like to test where $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. In other words, I'd like to test whether we can prune some fixed number of vertices or edges from $G$ to transform it into the graph $H$. Is there an implementation for something like this in _Mathematica_ 9, or perhaps available elsewhere? Efficiency, within reason, doesn't matter too much to me. NOTE - I can somewhat tolerate false-positives, but no false negatives.
