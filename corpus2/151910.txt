I am programming in Objective C, iOS. I create a `Class A` which is a parent class, and `Class B` inherits to `Class A`. Now I have `Class B` variables which I also need to use in `Class A`. And also one another `Class C`, `Class A` add in `Class C` (not inherits), and I want to use `Class B` variables in `Class C`. How can I access? I have created object also but not working, is that possible to access?
