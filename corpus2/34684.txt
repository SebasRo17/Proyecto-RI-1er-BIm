I'm trying to manipulate with Mathematica symbolic expression created in Matlab. I'm using the MATLink package, and I've succedeed in importing numerical variables, but not symbolic ones :               MEvaluate["syms g real"]     MEvaluate["syms l real"]     MEvaluate["u = g + l"]     MGet["u"]      will output :               u =      g + l % Matlab correctly defines the variable     {}    % Mathematica doesn t succeed in getting the variable      Anyone with experience in dealing with this ?
