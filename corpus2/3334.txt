I'm trying to do multivariate statistical analysis on a data set and I'd like to quickly visualize my information first using Trellis-like plots. For example, I'd like to create scatterplots for body mass and height separated by region. I'm currently creating all the graphs individually and then displaying them together with GraphicsGrid but I'm wondering if there's a better way of doing it.
