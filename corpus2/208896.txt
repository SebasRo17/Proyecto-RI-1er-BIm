I was talking with a co-developer. He has a client that wanted to make sure that he delivers on time. The client wants repercussions for missed deadlines. While I do not do freelance work, I couldn't give an answer. So, my question is: What repercussions do you (freelancers) agree upon with your client if you miss deadlines on your deliverables (aside from being fired)?
