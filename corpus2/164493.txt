Recently I stumbled once again on the issues of Haskells records, in particular the uniqueness of field names (it's a pain ...) I already read A proposal for records in Haskell  from SPJ and Greg Morrisett but it's last update was 2003.   Another paper Lightweight Extensible Records for Haskell from SPJ and Mark Jones is even older: It's from a Haskell workshop in 1999. **Now I wonder if the process of giving Haskell new records made any progress.   Does anybody know something about it or can point me to some further reading ?**
