I am building an API platform. I have already ensured that the platform always returns JSON responses. My question is **Should my API platform enforce the rule that all requests must be JSON? What are the benefits of making all requests to be JSON?** I understand the benefits of making all responses to be JSON as this means consistency for the client apps using the API. I fail to see the benefits of making all requests to be JSON as well. I am asking this because GitHub API v3 appears to be enforcing this rule. My API platform will involve uploading of files in the requests. As far as I know, JSON requests does not work well with file uploads. Or do I do a hybrid? Enforce that anything NOT to do with file upload should send their requests as JSON? And allow an exception for file upload?
