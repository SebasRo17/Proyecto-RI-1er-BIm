I copied the package folder (ProPac, http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~hgk22/software/ProPac/ProPac.html) in `$UserBaseDirectory/Applications` in Linux mint. But when I called it by               <<ProPac`      the ouput is               Get::noopen: Cannot open ProPac`. >>     $Failed      I tried install it from File menu but appears the same error. But in Windows OS I have no problem with installation of this package and using it.
