It's my understanding that the Virtual Book (of mathematica 9) is in notebook (.nb) format. It appears to be a very polished style of documentation which I want to reuse (parts) of it to create my own documentation. However, I'm new to mathematica and the virtual book pages (notebooks?) aren't editable by merely highlighting text. Is there a way to get the notebook to be editable?
