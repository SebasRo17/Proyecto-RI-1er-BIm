I can't say I am a good programmer but I've been earning money for programming last decades. I've thought I was born for programming and people said I was very good at it - at some point. But after 10 years of programming, I feel my programming efficiency is not as good as others. Of course, CS education is way better now and many young programmers are smarter than me. But one of my problem is that when I am executing a task, I tend to dwell on specific problems I am facing with the task rather than focusing on completion of the task. I understand to keep thinking about it does not solve the problem. But I habitually do that and easily become exhausted. I hope I am not the only one feeling in this way. Did you feel the same feeling? If so, how did you get rid of this terrible habit?
