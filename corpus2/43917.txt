I often need to generate or run through very large numbers of integers (we're talking `{i, 1, 10^9}` and higher) and want to add certain integers to a list, say `list1`. So far what I've been doing is use the following structure:               list1 = {};     Do[If[PrimeQ[i] && Sort[IntegerDigits[i]] == Range[9], AppendTo[list1, i]], {i, 10^9}];     list1      (This is an example of a function that adds to `list1` only those values that are prime as well as pandigital from 1 to 9) Now I realise that this is probably a horribly inefficient way to generate lists. How can I ensure that my `Do` only runs through those functions which fulfil my criteria, e.g. being prime, or being divisible by 14, and so forth, and skips those which it doesn't need to run through - especially when I am running through 1 billion values for `i`? Is this even possible? Won't my function by definition have to run through every value anyway?
