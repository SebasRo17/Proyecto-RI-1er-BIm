I was under the impression that you start in a programming job, do a good job, demonstrate willingness, get sent to a bunch of internships by the employer, and make your way up until you are given responsibility of an entire project. But a friend of mine told me that you also need at least a Masters' degree to be considered for that job. Is that true? How do people typically get to be in that role? PS notice I said "typically". I want to hear the general case, not private cases about someone you know.
