I work in a bunch of tools that do things to customer's computers. Some of these tools allow scripting, which allows someone to run a script to nuke files, registry keys, or the like. Of course, if the script is bad, or if there's a serious bug in the tool, it could cause damage to the person's system. I'm concerned that a user might become... angry... with me if something goes wrong. How do I minimize the likelihood of being sued as a result of publishing such a tool?
