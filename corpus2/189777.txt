We are developing a ReSTful HTTP API with Servicestack(.NET). Some of the API clients, which have a subset of the actions, demand a service which could be easily added with all the entities, like with the "Add Service Reference" with Visual Studio. We are thinking about creating a simple asmx web service, but our thoughts on how to do it divide to two:   1. The asmx WS will call the ServiceStack service with an HTTP client.   2. The asmx WS will reference the same BL that the main service references and will call it directly. **Which is the preffered way?** **Is there any other way you would recommend?**
