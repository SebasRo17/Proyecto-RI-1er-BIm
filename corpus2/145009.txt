Lately, I've been writing code in SAS Enterprise Guide, which produces "code" that looks like this (screenshot from the linked page): ![SAS Enterprise Guide screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vozla.jpg) My question is twofold:   1. Do you think it's necessary to perform code review on this type of code? My gut feeling is **yes** , given that (1) it's still code, just visually laid out, and (2) errors = big problems.   2. If "yes" to above, how to perform the review? Are there standards for visual code? I'm really open to any ideas, comments, and suggestions here. Thanks!
