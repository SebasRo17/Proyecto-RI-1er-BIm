I recently came across the **Flight micro-framework** , I want to use for a project because it seems lightweight, easily extensible and maintained. Most of the other micro-frameworks I looked into and liked were updated about 2 - 4 years ago (like Epiphany, Recess or Dingo) However, basically Flight is **based on static classes** , but you have the **opportunity to run it with an object instance** (as mentioned here: http://flightphp.com/learn#methods)   1. How would you run the framework? (static or non-static)   2. What do you think about this framework in general? Thank you!
