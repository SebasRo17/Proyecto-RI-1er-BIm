I have an array of strings that look like this:               list = {{valueA1, valueB1, valueC1, valueD1, valueE1, valueF1, valueG1, valueH1}, {valueA2, valueB2, valueC2, valueD2, valueE2, valueF2, valueG2, valueH2}, {valueA3, valueB3, valueC3, valueD3, valueE3, valueF3, valueG3, valueH3}, ...}      I'd like to prune the list so that I generate some `selectedItemsList` which contains only the entries where some select set of (`valueA...` through `valueH...`) pass some test. For example, `valueB...` and `valueH...` could be real numbered values, and I'd like to only put entries in list when its the case that, for some entry `k` we have `1 < valueBk < 3` && `-10 < valueHk... < 5` and so forth. If `list` has millions of entries, so maybe we don't want to go through the list in multiple passes, what is the most efficient way to perform this selection?
