I've made a program that is just some points on a plane. Red points are cops and green points are robbers. Each point has a vector indicating where it is going to be in the next step of $t$. Right now $t = 0$ but I want to see what happens when $t=1,2,3,\ldots$ Here is a picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KxnSk.png) The points are in this list. `rob[i]` and `cop[i]` make random pairs of x-y cordinates:               r = Table[rob[i], {i, 1, n}],     c = Table[cop[i], {i, 1, m}]      The next position are given by the formulae:               Table[r[[i]] + Normalize@Sum[(r[[i]] - c[[j]])/Norm[r[[i]] - c[[j]]]^2, {j, 1,Length[c]}],{i,1,Length[r]}]      and               Table[c[[i]] + Normalize@ Sum[(r[[i]] - c[[j]])/Norm[r[[i]] - c[[j]]]^2,{j, 1,Length[r]}],{i,1,Length[c]}]      for robbers and cops, respectively. I want to do something like add a parameter $t$ and when that parameter changes the next position of the points should be updated by the above formulae. Thanks for helping. **EDIT:** Using the answer of asterix314 I came accross this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uu4LY.gif)
