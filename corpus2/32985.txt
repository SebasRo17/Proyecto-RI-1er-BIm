When I do a `StreamPlot`of a rather complicated pair of differential equations, it loses some details. For example:               StreamPlot[{Tan[y - x], 2^y - 2 Cos[Pi/3 - x]}, {x, -4, 4}, {y, -4, 4}]       Here is the result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uewBK.png) Is there any way to:   * Change the color near each of the critical points to a different set of colors?   * Increase the level of detail near the saddle points and spirals? That is, add more streams?   * Any way to make a collage (for example, a landscape variant in order to capture more of the rich details and global behaviors of all critical points, including the periodic ones in this particular example)?
