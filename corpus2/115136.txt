We currently have the following stack :   * VS 2005   * Web forms   * SQL Server 2005   * IIS 6 We are planning on transitioning to this :   * VS 2010   * MVC and Web Forms   * SQL Server 2008   * IIS 7 My question is, when we move to MVC with VS 2010, should we use Entity Framework( or another ORM), a micro ORM (like Massive), or just plain SQL? All the tutorials I've read about VS 2010 are all geared towards using Entity Framework for data transactions, but is that going to be around for the foreseeable future (5+ years)? If it matters, our client's applications can have anywhere from 10 - 1,000 active users.
