Is there a programming language that can be used as a bridge for learning several programming paradigms? I am introduced to the Oz programming language but I think there are several more languages that could also be used in learning several paradigms and this thread can be a good survey of those. I think it is better to learn those paradigms first in order to learn several programming languages, especially if you are jumping from one paradigm to another every time you study a new language.
