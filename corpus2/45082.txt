I have some transformation rules acting on subscripted variables. When I match the a product the order matters.               Subscript[Z, 2, 1] Subscript[Z, 3, 1] /.       Subscript[Z, l_, m_] Subscript[Z, k_, n_] -> {{l, m}, {k, n}}     Subscript[Z, 3, 1] Subscript[Z, 2, 1] /.       Subscript[Z, l_, m_] Subscript[Z, k_, n_] -> {{l, m}, {k, n}}      both cases yield               {{3, 1}, {2, 1}}.      It seems k,n always get assigned the subscripts with the smaller first value. Why is this and how can I influence this?
