I have text file with data in 2 columns. I have imported it using the following line               c = Import["ab", "Table"];      This text file has a large amount of data, and I need only a certain range. What I mean is, if my data runs for example from `-10 to +10`, I need only from `-5 to +5` and its corresponding values. So I naively tried this               Plot[c, {-5, 5}]      which is clearly wrong, and its little wonder that I am getting an error message. Not sure what to do. Please help!
