I'm deciding which I need for my new LOB application. I will list PRO's of each and if I'm wrong - correct me please as this is how I see it. In Browser   1. Users can navigate using URL's. I see it as a BIG thing. Users can share links like app.com/orders/12345   2. With elevated permissions I can do all the same stuff. Use COM, file system, etc.   3. I can open other browser windows with other functionality if multi-window needed. The only difference - I won't have such control over those windows as with out of browser. Out of browser   1. Runs out of browser. Not sure why I care?   2. More problematic to handle updates   3. Yes, there is windows I can open but not modal. So, in-browser separate IE window almost identical Do I miss anything? I tend to keep it in browser but I want to see where I'm limiting myself.
