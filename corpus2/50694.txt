I'm enrolled in an undergraduate Master's degree. It will be my first degree - 4 years course - but it will be called Master's. I will not get any intermediate degree. It's from one of the most prestigious institutes in India ranked in Top 20 in Asia for technology and science by Asia Week. How does the industry treat this? On par with other MS candidates or on par with other BS candidates?
