Can someone clarify the following things for me ? Let's say I want to build a website and add publicity to it so I can make money out of my work.   I would use Html5 for the interface and C# with ASP.NET for the background programming.   I would use Visual Studio as my IDE and SQL server as a database. This is just an example on the top of my head but I don't know where to start for the licenses. Do I need one :   * For VisualStudio and SQLServer only ?   * For VisualStudio, SQLServer and pay some kind of rights for Asp.net ?   * The whole package.. Both VisualStudio, SQlServer plus rights for Asp.net AND C# ? I know this question is a little vague but I really don't know where to start and the opinion of someone with experience int this might give me just the help I need to get started.
