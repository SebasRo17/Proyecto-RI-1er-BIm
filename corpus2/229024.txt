At the moment, I create a Java-Wrapper for Apples *.pkpass-Files (Passbook). Since I need to parse a JSon-File, I planned to add java doc to every field, so one know what exactly this field is in the pkpass and how it should be displayed. (There are some other meta data which are interesting). At https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/PassKit_Bundle/Chapters/TopLevel.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012026-CH2-SW1 you can see a description of this file format. So, my question is: am I allowed to use text snippets (or the whole text) from the description column when I add also the link to the page into the java doc?
