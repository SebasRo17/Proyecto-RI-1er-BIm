First of all, it appears to me that $$\left|\frac{1}{x} + x^2\right| \Leftrightarrow \frac{|1 + x^3|}{|x|}$$ is true. I don't know why, but my attempt to verify it in _Mathematica_ failed.               In[1]:= Abs[1/x + x^2] === Abs[1 + x^3]/Abs[x]     Out[1]= False      It's weird because _Mathematica_ is unable to find a counterexample.               In[2]:= FindInstance[Abs[1/x + x^2] != Abs[1 + x^3]/Abs[x], x, Complexes]     Out[2]= {}
