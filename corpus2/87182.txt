> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is there a canonical book on Ruby on Rails? I've found switching from Java to Ruby/Rails to be very difficult. I feel like the rails books and websites that I've seen are program by example, and I have yet to see anything like a complete reference. In the java/spring world there is plenty of examples but also very thorough reference manuals. So even though I can get toy application xyz up and running in an afternoon with rails I'm apprehensive about doing anything of significance. I'm willing to admit that maybe this is because I've done java/spring for a few years and have near zero experience with ruby/rails. Just wondering if anyone else has run into this or if I'm missing something.
