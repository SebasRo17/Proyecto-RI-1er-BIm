In a few weeks, my project is going to be finished and I want to start getting my code ready for other people to use it. I am going to be posting everything to GitHub so people can tweak it and hopefully make it better. I guess what I'm asking is, what would be the best way to make sure my code is sufficiently documented and worded right for other people to use? I know you should always comment everything and I'm going to be putting in the @params feature for every method, but are there any other tips in general?
