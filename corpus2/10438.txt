I write the equation of the plane passing through the three points $A(-1, 5, -2)$, $B(2, 4, -3)$ and $F(4, -8, 6)$, and this is my code               A := {-1, 5, -2};     B := {2, 4, -3};     F := {4, -8, 6};     M := {x, y, z};     u := A - B;     v := A - F;     w := A - M;     n := u\[Cross]v;     Sort[Simplify[w.n] == 0]      I want the equation $ABF$ has the form $21 x + 29 y + 34 z-56=0$, but Mathematica out $0 == -56 + 21 x + 29 y + 34 z$ What must I do? Please help me.
