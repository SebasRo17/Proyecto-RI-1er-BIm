I work in a small office (only 1 designer, me and plus 1 programmer). We have a solid background in classic ASP development and some sort of a small proprietary framework/cms based on ASP + MySQL + Javascript written line by line in here and the projects aren't so big until now and we want to step up with something more fast and secure way to develop without reinventing the wheel (again). I have a little knowledge in PHP and .Net (C#) from some particular projects and personal learning. We have researched various languages and frameworks, as well as some new (to us) methodologies like TDD and some version control oriented workflows with GIT, etc. Until now we have thought in PHP with some framework like CodeIgniter or Kohana and ASP.net (C#) with MVC 3, since I can start from some knowledge I already have and maybe adopting GIT as our version control system for the bigger projects. We need some advice in getting a new set of skills and tools that work the best for us before getting 1 by 1 and trying. **EDIT: What we need to change(maybe)**   As you can imagine, we don't have a testing process like TDD or BDD and the testing is done very breafly (We have luck with so little problems after release) nor a real idea of how to use it (need more study and clarification). We use Dreamweaver most of the time to code and need a more fast and robust development environment with an autocomplete feature like MS Intelisense and nice highlighting (I personally like to write code and have used the notepad to write almost all of my first apps, but in a profitable work with a short deadline we can't go this way. Not that Dreamweaver is bad, but it's too general and lacks some features). I know that security is a thing to see at the programmer side, but there's plenty of frameworks with features that helps in this case and now we have a very basic and limited set of tools written by us to do this (poor SQL injection protection, etc). Our "version control" is purely based on a network share and our machines. The final version is always the one in our file server and most of the time, when we have to make some changes, we change the files directly and upload them again. A backup of this share is made each 2 or 3 months. We are growing up and expect to hire someone soon. Its hard to find a VBScript programmer for ASP and when we find one, the salary is to high for us by now because nobody is learning it in this days and who knows already have a job with a good one. **Final concerns:** We've decided to use ASP.Net(C#)/MVC as our primary framework and use CodeIgniter as an alternative to linux servers and other projects. Thinking in joining some MS program for startups and small business to help with some costs. We're getting Git as our vcs in our private file server for the origin and instances in each develop machine for us to clone, work and push back. We also considering a service like Bitbucket to maintain a copy on the cloud. If some of you have any more advice or other thoughts about this I'll follow- up. I would like to thank you all and mark many of the answers as right but I can't. I think this question may be a base of reference for small offices like us to get some points and help on the same decisions.
