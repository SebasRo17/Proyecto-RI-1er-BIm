I would like to import multiple files to a 2d array. I know to get a list of files I can do               myfiles=FileNames["*.txt"]     alldata=Import/@myfiles      Is it possible to get my data files in a 2d array if, for example, my files look like               myfiles={file11.txt,file12.txt,file21.txt,file22.txt}      where the numbers in the filenames correspond to an x and y index. I have done this using for loops. Is there a more functional way?
