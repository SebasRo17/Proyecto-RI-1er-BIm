Yesterday I asked a question about burning out. It did receive a high number of comments and answers and left me thinking if programmers are more prone to burning out than other professions. I'd be specially interested in academic studies, if any. Example of questions about burning out here on Programmers.SE: Burned out on programming and given up? What to do when coding begins to feel boring, like it is all just more of the same? What are advisable career options for a burnt-out programmer? There's also a burnout tag. Do you believe there's a high correlation between burning out and being a programmer, or at least, a correlation higher than burning out and other professions?
