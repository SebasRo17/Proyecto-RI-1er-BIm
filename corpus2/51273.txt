I extract path subgraphs $P_4$ of an undirected graph $G$. And want to list the VertexNames of the subgraphs in the same order as they are connected. Here is an example:               g = Graph[{6 <-> 7, 1 <-> 6, 3 <-> 1, 3 <-> 2, 5 <-> 4, 3 <-> 4},      VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 10];     h = Subgraph[g, {1, 3, 6, 7}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 10]     HighlightGraph[g, h]     VertexList[h]      ![GraphImage](http://i.imgur.com/nG0E6NO.png) `VertexList[h]` always gives the vertex names in the order specified in line 5. Is it possible to extract the vertex names in the order of connectivity? The given example should give `{3,1,6,7}` or the reverse instead of `{1,3,6,7}`.
