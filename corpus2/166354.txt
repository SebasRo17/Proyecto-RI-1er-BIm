I am just wonedering is there a tool/software (ideally free) to do a auto code formatting in the PHP for batch of files (not one by one which i can use the IDE for that) Ideally something like this where i can set the settings and it will do the auto formatting for all the files in side that folder ...etc http://beta.phpformatter.com/ this is very useful but issue is i have to do this one by one copy pasting .. thats why i am looking for another tool..
