I want to use _Mathematica_ to turn a picture into low poly style. That is, to make the following conversion: Bill to Bill low poly(Using Image Triangulator App). I think the biggest difficulty is how to extract the points on the boundaries of different colors appropriately. Too much points make the output picture messy, while the picture generated by too little points are not beautiful. And then, after I have extract the points of the original picture, how to turn the original picture to the low poly style? Is using `DelaunayMesh` possible? Or, extract the color of a certain point in a triangle(using `ImageValue` or some functions similar) and make it to be the main color of the triangle? **Edit** : No, I don't think that the answers in artistic image vectorization fit my problem. Because you can see that the question is not using Delaunay mesh or other triangular mesh.
