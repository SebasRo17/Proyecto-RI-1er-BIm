I have one boring problem with changing parameters in printing output. If I have equation                   eq = Plus[Times[a1,Derivative[2,0][q2][x,y]],Times[a2,Derivative[3,1][q1][x,y]]];      I want to replace all derivatives with new variables, for example this                     Derivative[2, 0][q2][x, y]      I want to replace it with $C_{\mathrm{q2}}^{2,0}$ and for all of them on the same way to get `eq` output automatically in this form $\mathrm{a1}\,C_{\mathrm{q2}}^{2,0}+\mathrm{a2}\,C_{\mathrm{q1}}^{3,1}$
