I was taught by an old-time programmer who called this nested code               if(condition){       <div>         <b>text <u>text</u></b><br/>         <table>           <tr>              <td>a</td>              <td>b</td>           </tr>         </table>       </div>     } else {       log();     }      as opposed to this code which was considered to be not nested               if(condition){<div>     <b>text         <u>text</u></b>         <table><tr><td>a</td><td>b</td></tr></table>         </div>     } else {log();}      When I started reading tutorials I found early on that I had the wrong definition to nested. Messy vs clean is not sufficient for this because messy code encompasses other problems that I am not talking about, for example confusing flow of logic, using static initializers inappropriately, poor use of variable names, using twice the code to get the job done in a more confusing manner, etc. What is the right word for this, where the first example is ... and the second example is not ...?
