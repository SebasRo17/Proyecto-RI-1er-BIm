I'm really n00b in _Mathematica_ , so please bear with me, as this seems to be my only option to learn how to do what I wany to do. I have a system of two differential equations:               y' = v[t]     v'[t] = -a^2y      Now, assuming I know the solution of this system is: $y = cos(a\,t),\ v = -a\,sin(a\,t)$, I want to plot the integral curve of the two, on the v-y surface, with `a t` getting values from 0 to `2 Ï€`. I've tried various combinations of `StreamPlot`, `VectorPlot` and many other functions, without any success, although I think it's suppose to be really simple. I've tried also to make a plot in 3D with `VectorPlot3D`, but to no avail. I'll appreciate any help.
