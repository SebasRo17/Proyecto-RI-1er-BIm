I hope this is right area on Stack Exchange to ask this question. People out there have built emulators for every game console but I don't understand how they do it. I consider myself (and have the professional title of) a senior level developer in several languages including Javascript but I don't have the faintest idea about how to begin writing an emulator in Javascript. How do they figure out how to read the ROMs and emulate the game?
