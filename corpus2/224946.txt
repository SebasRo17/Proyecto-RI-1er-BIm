Recently I learnt about a new methodology based on waterfall and scrum: Water- Scrum-Fall.   Some say that is the new "reality" and is what scrum pragmatist use nowadays.... But, from the definition of "Avalanche": > The Avalanche model is a Software Engineering project management anti- > pattern, it is a combination of a sequential process such as the Waterfall > model and Agile software development methodologies [...] What do you think about these two models? Aren't those the same? * * * More info:   http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/12/water-scrum-fall-is-the-norm http://www.slideshare.net/harsoft/water-scrumfall-isrealityofagileformost
