I've been thinking lately about how I handle config changes between multiple developers on a project. Specifically here about a Laravel project in PHP, but I guess this applies largely to all frameworks/languages. In general would you say it's a best practice to not commit your configuration? If so what's your practice for doing this with version control such as git? Or do you set up each configuration as a different environment config? E.g. In Laravel there are environment configs, so each developer has a directory of just their own different settings, and this is what I'm _currently_ using. Then in the code you can set how Laravel will detect which environment it's on. This works, I'm just wondering what other developers working on projects with other developers do.
