I work at a web design shop. Our workflow is divided into two parts: frontend programmers make static html and css templates of the site design, then backend programmers tie the templates into a CMS. We have a set of common functionality for our sites, and I'm wondering if there's a unit testing framework we can use to test for this functionality. For example, one of our common functionality guidelines states that _all links to a pdf must open in a new window_. I would like to write a unit test that goes something like this               if(a.class = 'pdf_link')       assert(target='_blank)      Wikipedia's list of unit testing frameworks doesn't seem to have anything that encompasses this relatively simple functionality (checking strings against a template), and I'm leaning towards writing a bunch of bash scripts and tying them into our CI server. But is there an better way to do this?
