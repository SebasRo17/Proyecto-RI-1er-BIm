I have the following Values: $a[0]=1;a[1]=0;a[2]=0;a[3]=0;a[4]=\frac{g_2}{20};a[5]=0$. I need to compute the value of $b[n]$ in the following equation $$a[n]=\sum _{m=0}^{n} (m-2) \;\;a[m] \;\;b[n-m]$$ where $n=0,1,2,3,4,5$. For $n=0$, I get the value of $b[0]$. For $n=1$, I get the value of $b[1]$ using the value of $b[0]$. For $n$th iteration, I get the value of $b[n]$ using the values of $b[n-1],b[n-2],\dots,b[0]$. The values of $b[n]$ will then be used to solve for another variable, say, $c[n]$, for $n=0,1,2,3,4,5$. Is there any simple way of doing this in Mathematica? I am basically doing one iteration at a time (using the Solve command), which is very tedious. Thanks, Radz.
