I have data in an Excel spreadsheet that has 4 rows and 1,000 columns. I am using `Import` as follows:               fittedMatrix  = Table[          Import["sheet.xlsx", {"Sheets", "MC", #, i}] & /@ Range[2, 5],           {i, 2, 1001}     ]; // AbsoluteTiming      which is importing on a column by column basis -- a thousand imports per spreadsheet. Is there a way to import row by row basis? Hopefully, this would improve the speed of import. Or would it be better to transpose my data within Excel first? EDIT: I tried transposing within Excel first to get dimensions of 1,000 x 4 and tried again using:               fittedMatrix=Table[          Import["sheet.xlsx",{"Sheets","mcTransposed", #,i}] &/Range[2,1001],             {i,2,5}     ];//AbsoluteTiming        but now it is giving:               {{1/2 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/3 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/4 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/5 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/6 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/7 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/8 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/9 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/10 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),       1/11 (Import[sheet.xlsx,{Sheets,mcTransposed,#1,i}]&),        instead of my actual Excel data?
