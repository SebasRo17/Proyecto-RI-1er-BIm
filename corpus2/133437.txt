On my interview for an internship, I was asked following question: > On a whiteboard write the simplest algorithm with use of recursion which > would take a root of a so called binary tree (so called because it is not > strictly speaking binary tree) and make every child in this tree connected > with its sibling. So if I have:                      1           /   \            2     3           / \     \          4   5     6         /           \      7             8      then the sibling to 2 would be 3, to four five, to five six and to seven eight. I didn't do this, although I was heading in the right direction. Later (next day) at home I did it, but with the use of a debugger. It took me better part of two hours and 50 lines of code. I personally think that this was very difficult question, almost impossible to do correctly on a whiteboard. How would you solve it on a whiteboard? How to apprehend this question without using a debugger?
