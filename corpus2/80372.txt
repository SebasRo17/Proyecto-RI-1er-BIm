I've seen a spate of questions on Stack Overflow and elsewhere about downloading programming tools and where to find them. Sometimes developers can't find a download link or availability in their country. Rather than encouraging them to violate laws, I think general education for these users is of the utmost importance. ## How do I know what tools I can download in my country? ## Why can't I download all tools for software development in my country? Acceptable answers will indicate why users can't download tools in their country. Any links to resources to make tools available in countries where they should not be available will be deleted without haste, and will likely result in a short ban-period for the poster. This is a how and why question.
