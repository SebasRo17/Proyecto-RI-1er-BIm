I have some questions about system identification. I made some measurement of current step (input) and voltage response(output) and I want to fine the parameters of my impedance. The sample rate is 1000 samples/s so that I have a very large list of current and voltage samples include noise (40000 Samples). My voltage is U(kT) and current is I(kT) where k=1,2,3,.....40000.   1. to filter the noise I used `ExponentialMovingaverage`; is there any other possibility to filter the noise from the list?   2. in _Mathematica_ there is a function with the name `NonlinearModelfit` to find system parameters. Is there any other possibility to find the system parameters like nonlinear Least Square?
