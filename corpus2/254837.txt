I'm working through a problem in Programming Pearls -- specifically, the implementation of a program which sorts a file containing, at most, 10,000,000 integers, each of which is 7 digits long (Column 1, Problem 3). The problem has some very strict constraints when it comes to memory, so I'm considering reading and writing the integers in ASCII -- 7 bytes at a time. I need to know if ASCII has any headers or footers or anything similar that I should be considering (I'm putting everything on 1 line without any separators, so new lines aren't an issue).
