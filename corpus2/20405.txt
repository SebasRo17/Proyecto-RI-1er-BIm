Consider the following:                Table[Table[x = 20; y = 30; 2 i x + 3 j y , {i, 10}], {j, 3}]      Suppose I want the result of this nested Table to be stored to an appendable file, I could do something like:               Table[Table[x = 20; y = 30; 2 i x + 3 j y >> test.dat, {i, 10}], {j, 3}]      Where `test.dat` has been previously opened using `OpenAppend["test.dat"]` However, this doesn't work as I would like it to as the answer is stored differently than the actual output shown below and _Mathematica_ returns Null for every element of the output.               {          {130, 170, 210, 250, 290, 330, 370, 410, 450, 490}, {220, 260, 300,           340, 380, 420, 460, 500, 540, 580}, {310, 350, 390, 430, 470, 510,           550, 590, 630, 670}        }      My question is this. How can I save the output of the Nested Table to a file for every iteration of the outer `Table` and prevent any `List` from being returned by _Mathematica_?. That is, I don't want _Mathematica_ to return the following `List` as it currently does:               { {Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null}, {Null,        Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null}, {Null, Null,        Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null, Null} }      I will also like the data stored in the file to be exactly as the output shown above, since I will use it for further calculations in _Mathematica_. This is basically a way to prevent excessive memory usage. If there are better ways to achieve the same thing please feel free to post that as an answer.
