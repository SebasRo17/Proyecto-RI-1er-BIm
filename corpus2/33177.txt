I tried using `NDSolve` to solve the following system of equations:               t x'[t] == -x[t] + y[t],      t y'[t] == -5 t^2/x[t]^2 + x[t] - y[t],            x[1] == 4, x[100] == 1      It's weird. The system tells me there is infinity at the boundary $t=1$, so I change the boundary from $t=1$ to $t=2$, and I get the same message again. If I eliminate the nonlinear term `-5 t^2/x[t]^2`, the function can be solved analytically. So I do not know whether these equations are well posed or not with such boundary conditions just for `x[t]` Anyone have a suggestion?
