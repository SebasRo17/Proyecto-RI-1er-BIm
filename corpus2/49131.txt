I'm trying to derive some of the results of the following paper: _Electrodynamics of semiconductor-coated noble metal nanoshells_ , JT Manassah - Physical Review A In the paper there is matrix $\mathbf M_l^M$, defined as follows, with $\alpha$ as a parameter: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S19Wx.png) as you know, $j$ and $n$ and $h$ are different types of spherical Bessel functions. Now, I want t solve the following equation: $$\det ({\bf M}_l^M)=0$$ and obtain the roots in terms of $\alpha$.( I think the equation doesn't have analytical solution, and so I tried to use `FindRoot` command, but this equation has $\alpha$ as a parameter and the roots should be founded with respect to $\alpha$. If there is no (better) way other than `FindRoot`, how can I do this using this command? I mean, how can I make `FindRoot` to solve the equation for different $\alpha$s and what is $x_0$ in the `FindRoot`? (The roots are complex numbers.) (All I want is to obtain a plot, showing the real part of the root versus $\alpha$) **Here is my code (definition of $\bf M$):** http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZV8Rs.png
