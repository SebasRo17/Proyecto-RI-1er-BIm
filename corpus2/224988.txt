I want to know what should I write in copyright part? I mean the copyright part when you right click on the executable, click properties, and click the details tab. I was developing a little tool that parses some information from output files. It's been a year now and somehow it became something more than a simple, personal tool. We are using it for academic purposes and it's going to cited in several academic papers. BTW, I do not want to make it freeware. Also, I am the only developer of the software. I have used Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate that I obtained for free with the academic license provided my university.
