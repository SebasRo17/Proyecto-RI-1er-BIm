I would like to use `VectorPlot3D` to plot a vector field with 3D arrows:               B1 = 0.0005;  (*G/Î¼m*)     B2 = -2*B1;     b[x_, y_, z_, Bf_] := {B1*x, B1*y, B2*z + Bf};          VectorPlot3D[b[x, y, z, 0], {x, -13, 13}, {y, -13, 13}, {z, -13, 13},                   PlotRange -> {{-13, 13}, {-13, 13}, {-13, 13}},                   VectorScale -> {0.1, 1, None}, VectorPoints -> {6, 6, 5},                   VectorStyle -> {"Arrow3D", Red},                   RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, x^2 + y^2 + 2 z^2 < 13^2],                   Boxed -> True, Axes -> False]      Is there a way to change the properties of the 3D arrow tails? For example, to make them thicker. I'm guessing it has something to do with the `Tube[]` function, but I cannot quite figure it out. Thanks in advance!
