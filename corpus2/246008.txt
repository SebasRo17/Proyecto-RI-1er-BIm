I am working in a team of 4 members. we have started reviewing code 2 months ago. we are using Gerrit as code review tool. while reviewing code initially we have found lot's of problem in the code i.e. no proper code comments. method are too big. no null pointer checking. no proper exception handling etc. but now a days it looks code has improved. so when i am reviewing code i am not getting that much problem in the code. so my question is should we continue code review even there is not that much flaws in the code? or will we stop?
