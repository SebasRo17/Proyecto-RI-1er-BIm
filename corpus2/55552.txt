I would like to translate a imported txt file to Dataset.               test = Import["E:\\mathematica\\example.txt", "table",             {"FieldSeparators" -> ",", "CharacterEncoding" -> "ASCII"}]      The result is: > {{"naam A", "naam B", "naam C", "naam D"}, {1, 2, 1.2, "a"}, {2, 3, 2.3, > "b"}, {3, 4, 2.3, "c"}, {4, 5, 4.5, "d"}, {5, 6, 5.6, "e"}, {6, 7, 6.7, > "f"}, {7, 8, 7.8, "g"}, {8, 9, 8.9, "h"}, {9, 10, 9.1, "i"}, {10, 11, 10.1, > "j"}} Now I would like to translate it to `Dataset` which is new in _Methematica 10.0_.               dataset = Dataset[{        <|"naam A" -> 1, "naam B" -> "2", "naam C" -> {1.1}, "naam D" -> {a}|>,        <|"naam A" -> 2, "naam B" -> "3", "naam C" -> {1.2}, "naam D" -> {b}|>,        <|"naam A" -> 3, "naam B" -> "4", "naam C" -> {1.3}, "naam D" -> {c}|>,        ....        }]      I tried it with the next code:               data = Dataset[<|"key1" -> test[[All, 1]], "key2" -> test[[All, 2]],         "key3" -> test[[All, 3]], "key4" -> test[[All, 4]]|>]      This code gives the wrong output. Anyone a suggestion how to do it?
