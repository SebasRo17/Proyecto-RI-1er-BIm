Based on the "featured apps" section of the main page http://www.emotiv.com/index.php Alot of the so called "mind control" apps so far seem to be fairly rudimentary read/scan apps that look to profile a certain activity, or perhaps allow the user to manipulate or control an app in a way loosely analogous to using a mouse/keyboard. I'm just wondering if anyone is currently working on something (assuming they can talk about it) that is a mind blowingly spectacular use of the Emotiv headset? thanks.
