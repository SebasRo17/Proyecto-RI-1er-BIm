I am learning design patterns. I read this article. Point no. 3 is not clear to me. The writer said that **strategy lets you change the guts of an object**. But this is a violation of the **open-close** principle. Am I wrong? If I am wrong, then help me to understand what writer wanted to describe.   1. Strategy is like Template Method except in its granularity.   2. State is like Strategy except in its intent.   3. Strategy lets you change the guts of an object. Decorator lets you change the skin.   4. State, Strategy, Bridge (and to some degree Adapter) have similar solution structures.    5. They all share elements of the ‘handle/body’ idiom. They differ in intent - that is, they solve different problems.   6. Strategy has 2 different implementations, the first is similar to State. The difference is in binding times (Strategy is a bind-once pattern, whereas State is more dynamic). Strategy objects often make good Flyweights.
