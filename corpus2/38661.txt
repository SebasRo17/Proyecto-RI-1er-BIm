I have done or was part of some mobile projects that are uploaded in their respective markets and currently live, and I am already mentioning status as LIVE for respective projects. One of my friend -who is actually a web developer- has recently suggested me to put the urls of the application if the project is live. And I am taking this suggestion seriously. But i have found that some urls are really long and they desperately need to be shortened. So my question is : Is it fair to shorten all the urls of the live application? Or just shorten those which are so long. In case I shorten all the urls, can any employer take this point negatively? Thanks **EDIT** : After reading your response I think I need to clarify one thing.... The applications I have developed are mobile applications and they are uploaded in their respective markets, like Blackberry App store and android markets. It means a lot for an application accepted to be sold in market. And I want to put the url of these market sites. The links are there for a long time, so there is no threat that the link goes offline in a year or two.....
