# Update Using               Manipulate[Plot[{(LogIntegral[x])^(1/2),      (((x*E^s)/Log[x*E^s]) ((((Log[Log[x*E^s]])^(w - 1))/((w - 1)!))))/     RiemannR[x]}, {x, 2, 5000}, PlotStyle -> {Blue,Red}, ImageSize -> 700],      {w, 33.34, 40, 0.01}, {s, 43.2, 50, 0.01}]      to play with the plot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rleKB.gif) I am trying to find the max values of `w` and `s` **_where the $y$-value of the red curve is at no point greater in value that of the blue curve (for any $x$)_**. Is there a better way of doing this? (I have started `w` and `s` at a reasonable estimate, but when values become much higher than $1000$, manipulation is not really feasible.) N.B. My best guess so far at the relationship between `s` and `w` is `s=[N[Log[((w/5) + 1)!]]`, but this is clearly way off. # Original question Which approach would be the best to take in order to calculate the max value of $a$, where $a\log(x+1)$ at no point exceeds $\sqrt{x}$?               Plot[{a Log[x + 1], Sqrt[x]}, {x, 0, 100}, PlotStyle -> {Blue, Red}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IxC0x.gif) I have tried using `Manipulate` to get a rough guess, but I am really searching for a more accurate approach.
