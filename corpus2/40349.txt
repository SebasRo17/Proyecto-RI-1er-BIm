In `C`, one can have variables that are declared `static`. These are not re- initialized every single time a function is called. I.e.:               int f(int inc)     {         static int x = 0;         return x += inc;     }      Then `f(0);f(1);f(2);` will return `0`,`1`, and `3`. Is this possible in _Mathematica_? One use that immediately comes to mind is having a compiled function stored as a static variable for use in a ME function.
