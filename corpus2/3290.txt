I seek to use a token as an axis label, but this token, having other meanings, is expanded by Mathematica. If I enclose the token in quotes, it is not expanded, but it is also no longer italicized. Using `LabelStyle->{Italics}` results in italicization of all fonts in the figure (axis labels and axis tick labels). How do I circumvent token expansion (or equivalently, in effect, italicize only the axis labels and not the axis tick labels)? Two examples: (1) I may wish to plot a function `f` (say `f=x^2`) and want the axis label to be simply `f` (in italics), but it is expanded to `x^2` by the command `Plot[f, {x, -2, 2}, AxesLabel -> {x, f}]`. Changing to `Plot[f, {x, -2, 2}, AxesLabel -> {x, "f"}]` results in italic `x` and roman `f`. (2) I may wish to label an axis with `E`, but it is changed by Mathematica to `e` (the irrational constant). Again, I can use `"E"`, but this has the undesired effect of altering the font face.
