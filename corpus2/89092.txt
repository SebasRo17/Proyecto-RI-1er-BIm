I am thinking of uploading on source forge some personal projects that may be useful to other people.   The main reason I decided to do that is I am planning to start pursuing job in another company (leave current one).   I thought this might help me, by showning to employers stuff I did.   Is this a good idea (for the reason I am aiming) or there are any pitfalls?   Also is source forge the best place for something like this? Thanks
