I am attempting make life easier, and, instead of using Mathematica at the same time that I'm using LyX (a front end for LaTeX), I was hoping that I could just use LyX and use the CAS option to do some of the simple algebraic computations that Mathematica can handle so powerfully. Of course, this has been a headache for me, as I am not very comfortable with anything Unix related. I already know where to locate Mathematica, its absolute path name, and can put it inside the "PATH prefix" that LyX demands of me. But, even doing that, I cannot get an output on the simplest of computations. ![Path for Mathematica's kernel that I entered in LyX](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i8ttr.png) Is anyone familiar with this, because I'm up against a wall. I have no idea what to do. I've been trying for hours. By the way, as is evident from the picture, I am on a Mac, I don't know if that makes a significant difference. Thanks! Edit: Here is some more information about something that I'm asking LyX to do, in a picture: ![The Option to Use Mathematica](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CdRzM.png) ![LyX Tries to Communicate with LyX and Fails to Produce an Answer to a Simple Addition](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CpKa3.png)
