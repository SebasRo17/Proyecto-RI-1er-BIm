In the past I have done a lot of Java and Python coding. Mostly, I worked on web apps and some simple console or gui apps. I also have a formal education in computer science. What route should I take to become a systems developer? I always did like C++, but never had a chance to use it for anything. Would mastering C++ be one of the steps? If so what resources can you suggest? Also, I would like to know how much different is the work between plain old development and systems development. There seem to be a lot of overlapping between the two.
