I would like to create a stereogram from a 3d plot; I would like to export two images of a 3d plot at a slightly different angle, so that when each picture is presented to a different eye, one gets the feeling it is actually 3 dimensional. I have tried to put two plots next to eachother, then turn one plot slightly by hand (mouse), but when I then export, it is as if I hadn't turned the plot at all! example:               s1 =        Plot3D[PDF[MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0}, {{1, 1/2}, {1/2, 1}}], {x, y}],         {x, -2.3, 2.3}, {y, -2.3, 2.3}]     Show[GraphicsArray[{s1, s1}]]      How can I specify at which angle the 3d plot is exported? PS: Just to be clear: I don't want to rotate the function which is plotted, I want to rotate the plot, including the edges of the bounding box of the plot.
