Starting from an image I would like to apply a custom filter to an image. I have thought and implemented this filter in HSL space and it goes like this :   * Boost the saturation of the pixels that have a S value > .5    * Decrease the ones where S < .5. Would I have the HSL Values instead of the HSB the code would go like this :               img = Import["ExampleData/lena.tif"];     ImageColorSpace[img]     img = ImageResize[img, 128];     img = ColorConvert[img, "HSB"];     imgd = ImageData[img];     newimg = ({#[[1]], 1/(1 + E^(10*#[[2]]*(#[[2]] - .5))), #[[3]]} & /@        imgd[[#]]) & /@ Range[Length[imgd]];     newimg = Image[newimg]      **My Problem :** I cannot figure out how to convert HSB (only hue based space in M9 to my knowledge) to HSL.
