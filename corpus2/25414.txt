I'm running in to some problems with generating a persistent HSQLDB and during some troubleshooting I came upon the following behavior.               Needs["DatabaseLink`"]     tc = OpenSQLConnection[      JDBC["hsqldb", ToFileName[Directory[], "temp"]], Username -> "sa"]     CloseSQLConnection[tc]      The above code generates three files (which will be located in `Directory[]`). Despite the fact that the connection is closed, two of the files (temp.lck and temp.log) cannot be deleted until the Mathematica kernel has been shut down. Is this 'normal' behavior?
