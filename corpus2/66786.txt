We've 4 embedded firmware at hand. Two of them are released, are in maintenance phase. Other two are going to be released. The released product uses OKI 411 micro, where as yet to be released products are on OKI 431 micro. So far we've been compiling the code using OKI's CCU8 3.08 compiler. It supports both 411 and 431 hardware. Recently they've updated the compiler to 3.10 and we started using it for all the products. Suddenly we've found that 3.10 is producing unexpected behaviour in one 431 based project. It is related to compiler optimization. So the release build exhibited a bug and two whole days were wasted to figure it out that the firmware works fine if compiled with 3.08 version of the compiler. Note that the other 431 based product didn't show any issue. So we've decided to abandon the latest compiler for all projects and use the previous one. What steps should be taken when this kind of situation occurs? Also when upgrading compiler, what should be done to ensure that it will not break any build?
