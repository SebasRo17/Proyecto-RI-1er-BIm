Despite increases in screen size and resolution, many sources still suggest that code be limited to 80 characters per line. I realize than there are many different opinions on this subject, but I wonder whether there are any standards bodies or influential firms that use other limits (120 characters is a common alternative). For example, are any standards bodies considering "enlarging" the suggested limit? Are there large scale software projects (e.g. at NASA or ESA) that use larger limits? > Note: This is not yet another question about what individuals do, or about > related opinions, though I'd welcome such information as _comments_.
