In at least the following situations, I have experienced that the kernel has shut down during evaluation. The thing is that there is no message at all when it shuts down.               SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];     temp = Partition[Flatten[Import["temp.dat", "Table"]], 3];     ResetDirectory[];          ListContourPlot[temp]      P.S. The file `temp.dat` is in the following link: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7611247/temp.dat. **Why has the kernel shut down without any warning message? What can I check or how can I fix it?**
