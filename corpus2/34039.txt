Instead of adding `AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}` every time to code in order that the axes appear, how can I make _Mathematica_ display the axes by default? Also, how can I get _Mathematica_ to display the axes, by default, as they are shown in the following image? I want to obviate having to by rotate my images manually every time _Mathematica_ makes its initial display. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WhEXS.jpg)
