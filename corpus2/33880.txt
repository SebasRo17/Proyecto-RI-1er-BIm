I want to filter a data file choosing those elements that match a condition and then plot them. Here is the corresponding code I use:               data = Import["data.out", "Table"];     pick[m_List, i_Integer] := Module[{s = m[[i, 8]]}, Pick[m, s, s != 0]];     dataP = Table[{PointSize[0.005], Red, pick[data, i],        Point[{data[[i, 3]], data[[i, 4]], data[[i, 5]]}]}, {i, 1, Length[data]}]      The module `pick` is supposed to choose those elements from the list `m` for which $s\neq 0$. However, it does not work and therefore all the elements of the list are plotted. I used also `Select[m, s !=0]` but with no success. What am I doing wrong? This is a small sample of the data file               data1={{-4.05, -0.48, -1.4648, -1.36804, -1.7282, 648.01, 1.03023*10^-13, 7},     {-4.05, -0.41, -1.2762, 1.7369, 1.55982, 278.54, 1.99574*10^-14, 0},     {-4.05, -0.34, -1.54191, 1.42069, 1.59888, 178.32, 9.0609*10^-14, 5}}
