As some of you may know already, Google Native Client is going to be released with Chrome 14. Google native client is a technology that allow us to run native code(C, C++) on the web. (Cross-browser). I heard it's pretty secure as well. Is it the end of client/server side programming? The end of javascript, php, asp.net, ruby, jsp etc.??? It seems google native client has the potential to change the game. What do you think?
