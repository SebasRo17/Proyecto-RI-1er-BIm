> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Best supporting argument for refactoring Has anyone got any tips for persuading management that refactoring code is a good idea ? I was asked something like > "After this refactoring, will I have a better product ? How does time spent > on this benefit the company?" Or something along those lines. I can see why management asked it but my response was not fantastic. I said something about how a well designed piece of software will mean that adding new features in the future will be quicker and easier. Does anyone else have any tips ? Many thanks.
