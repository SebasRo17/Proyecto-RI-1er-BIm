So I am trying to understand this TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer). But I am having a hard time grasping it. in context of having two streams of addresses, tlb and pagetable. I don't understand the association of the TLB to the streamed addresses/tags and page tables.               a.  4669, 2227, 13916, 34587, 48870, 12608, 49225     b.  12948, 49419, 46814, 13975, 40004, 12707                    TLB     Valid   Tag Physical Page Number     1   11  12     1   7   4     1   3   6     0   4   9                    Page Table     Valid   Physical Page or in Disk     1   5     0   Disk     0   Disk     1   6     1   9     1   11     0   Disk     1   4     0   Disk     0   Disk     1   3     1   12      How does the TLB work with the pagetable and addresses? The homework question given is: Given the address stream in the table, and the initial TLB and page table states shown above, show the final state of the system also list for each reference if it is a hit in the TLB, a hit in the page table or a page fault. But I think first i just need to know how does the TLB work with these other elements and how to determine things. How do I even start to answer this question?
