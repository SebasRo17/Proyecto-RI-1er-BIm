In the movie theatre I go to they have ticket kiosks that allow you to select the seats you want; they also have a website that does the same (the website also has a countdown timer of like 30 secs in which you must choose a seat). While I understand things such as database transactions and other techniques for handling multiple simultaneous users, I just can't get my head around how multiple people can be allowed to select a seat at the same time; is it as simple as the first one to press BUY gets the seats and the other person will get an error message, or am I missing something?
