I'm new to Mathematica and my assignment is very vague... I'm hoping someone can explain to me a bit more of that this quesion means: > Given the curve C, display the point on the curve and the tangent vector > there for t=[0,1]. Use the manipulate function. I do not want the answer, just an expansion on this question if someone else understands what I am supposed to do. Pointing me in the correct direction would be great. I don't even know what function to use, which means I do not even know enough to Google this problem...
