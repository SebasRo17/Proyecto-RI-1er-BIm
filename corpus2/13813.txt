I defined a binary operator in as the first statement in a new _Mathematica_ notebook.               {x1_, y1_} âŠ• {x2_, y2_} := Module[{}, Print["do anything"];]      where the code in the `Module` is somewhat more meaningful. My questions:   1. Why does this not show up in a `?Global`*` query?   2. How can I set the `Attributes` for this operation to be `Flat` so it is associative?   3. Do I need to use the `Notations` Package to do this "properly"?
