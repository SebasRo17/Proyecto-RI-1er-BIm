**Update** : (11/29/2012) Looks like Mathematica 9 has the same behavior. The following graphic shows how Mathematica kerns italic characters in an inline math formula cell ( **first row** ) where an \[InvisibleSpace] has been inserted between consecutive characters (which could represent either multiplication of terms or multi-indices depending on context) _vs._ in an ordinary, non-math text cell which was switched to italics using Ctrl-I ( **second row** ). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vC6qM.png) When the letters _ijk_ for example appear together in a subscript as indices, the spacing between the _i_ and the _j_ appears too wide relative to the distance between the _j_ and the _k_. **Original Q** : Is it possible to turn off this special kerning in math formula cells? **Updated Q** : (10/1/2012) A reasonable but nevertheless somewhat inconvenient method to work around this issue has been suggested below. Does anyone know the reason why the kerning rules for juxtaposing italic characters inside math formula cells are different from those for normal, non-math italic text? * * * For ease of copying:               Cell[TextData[{      "Text ",      Cell[BoxData[       FormBox[        RowBox[{        "a", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "b", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "c",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "d", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "e",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "f", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "g",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "h", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "i",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "j", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "k",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "l", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "m",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "n", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "o",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "p", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "q",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "r", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "s",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "t", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "u",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "v", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "w",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "x", "\[InvisibleSpace]", "y",          "\[InvisibleSpace]", "z"}], TraditionalForm]],       FormatType->"TraditionalForm"],      " Text"     }], "Text"]
