I have the following classes:                  Teacher        Student        Class (like a school class)      They all extend from KObject that has the following code:               - initWithKey     - send     - processKey      Teacher, Student Class all use the functions processKey and initWithKey from KObject parent class. They implement their own version of send. The problem I have is that KObject should not be instantiated ever. It is more like an abstract class, but there is no abstract class concept in objective-c. It is only useful for allowing subclasses to have access to one property and two functions. What can I do so that KObject cannot be instantiated but still allow subclasses to have access to the functions and properties of KObject?
