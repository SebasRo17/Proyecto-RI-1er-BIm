Code kata is a concept that proposes to hone programmer's skill by doing small problems many times trying to improve the code at each iteration. The name comes from an analogy to martial art kata where forms (aka kata) are practices done over and over leading to improvements. From the reaction I got to my last question on the topic, I wish to know what are the draw backs of this approach?
