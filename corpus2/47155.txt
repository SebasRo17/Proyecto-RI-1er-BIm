Recently, I have being using _Mathematica_ to write my undergraduate paper. I want to use two pattern lists such as `{ A -> a, B -> b, c -> C, ....}` and `{ a -> A, b -> B, c -> C, ....}` to make my code short. I can exchange `{ A -> a, B -> b, c -> C, ....}`'s elements to achieve `{ a -> A, b -> B, c -> C, ....}`, my trail is as below:               firstPattern = { A -> a, B -> b, c -> C, one -> two, tom -> david};      To achieve `{ a -> A, b -> B, C -> c, two -> one, david -> tom}`, I write the code:               {#1, #2} -> {#2, #1}& /@ firstPattern      However, it failed. I wonder why and how to correct it.
