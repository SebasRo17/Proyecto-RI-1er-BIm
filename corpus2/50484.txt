I would like to have a code that given a state "i" in S, it give the set of states "j" which are accessible from "i". Is that possible in mathematica? My state space (S) is               StateSpace = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5"}      and my transition matrix is               transitionmatrix = {{17/25, 3/25, 5/25, 0, 0}, {5/18, 5/18, 7/18, 1/18, 0}, {4/21,       9/21, 4/21, 0, 4/21}, {0, 0, 3/4, 1/4, 0}, {3/4, 1/4, 0, 0, 0}}       And i know that a state "i" goes to "j" if in the transition matrix the value (i,j) is higher than zero. I would like something like this               If[transitionmatrix {i, j} > 0, t];      And then i will have               transitionmatrix{1,2}     true      (as 1 goes to 2)
