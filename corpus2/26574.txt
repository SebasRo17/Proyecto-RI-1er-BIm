I have a large set of ordered pairs and I am trying to add the second elements together for any group of pairs that has the same first element. For example my data looks like:               data={{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{3,2},{3,6}}      and I want to return something like:               newdata={{1,5},{2,3},{3,8}}      I figured out how to group the data based on their first element using `GatherBy[data,{First}]`, but I'm not sure where to go from there. I feel like there is probably a much easier way than that, but it is evading me.
