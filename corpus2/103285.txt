For your record, I am a programmer myself, and I still do coding. We are not doing your-just-another-CRUD-app, instead we are working on CAD apps. The nature of software development makes it really hard to gauge a programmer's worth. How can you tell whether a programmer is good or not-so- good? All programmers who are working with me work on different parts of the applications, and how difficult it is to get those parts working is only known to the person who spend most time in it, in this case it's the programmers themselves; me as an outsider would not be able to fully appreciate the amount of sweat, ingenuity, effort they put in into solving those problems precisely because I don't have a chance to do the same job. This gives me a hard time when I evaluate them. How do I know programmer A is really great at solving the problem at hand and therefore I can throw him a bigger, harder task? And how do I know programmer B is just working hard, but not working smart? How can I evaluate and compensate programmers fairly?
