I was thinking that if all the users of a website are required to have JavaScript enabled, Is it ok to use obtrusive JavaScript? I'm all for progressive enhancement, but what's the point when an advanced web application bounces users at the door if they have an old browser or JavaScript disabled? We have a very slim target audience, and we can tell our target audience what browser and plugins/functionality they are required to have. So my question is, is mixing JS and HTML alright in that case? Like using onclick attributes.
