I'm trying to find a clean, intuitive way to implement this problem. Basically, I have three numbers, and based on relationship (less than, greater than, and equal to) among these numbers would change how I execute the next set of code. For example, if there are numbers A, B, and C. Here are some examples of relationships among them:   * A < B < C   * A = B > C   * A = B = C   * B < A = C A consumer of my framework would build this kind of relationships between the three numbers and would pass into a class that would process the relationships. So far, I could think of one way to implement that is relatively simple but not clean. I would represent relationships between the three numbers in flags. So, there would three different flags (A to B, B to C, and A to C). Each flag would have LessThan, EqualTo, and GreaterThan options. I would have to run through many checks to make sure that the 3 given flags are valid. If A < B and B < C, then A cannot be greater than C. If A = B and A < C, then B cannot be greater than C. The list goes on. Is there a better way to design this?
