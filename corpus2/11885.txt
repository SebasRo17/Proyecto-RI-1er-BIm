Suppose I have a bunch of graphics that I want to display in a grid:               GraphicsGrid[{       {Graphics[Circle[], Frame -> True],        Graphics[{Circle[], Circle[{2, 2}]}, Frame -> True]},       {Graphics[{Circle[{5, 5}, 2], Circle[{9, 9}, 2]}, Frame -> True],        Graphics[Circle[{100, 100}, 2], Frame -> True]}}]      ![1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mN7ED.png) Each graphic is roughly the same size, but the range they cover differs. You can only see this by looking at the numbers on the axes. What I'd like to do is automatically replot the graphics over the same range so that objects are correctly sized relative to each other. Something like: ![2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ReL5o.png) So given an array of graphics, how would I extract all the plot ranges and determine a new plot range for each one?
