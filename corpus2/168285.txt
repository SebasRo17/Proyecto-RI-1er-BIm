Noob question. I am not quite able to tell the difference between a REPL and an interactive shell just by reading the definitions on Wikipedia. Wiki notes that REPL is a particular kind of interactive language shell. Is it a proper subset though? The Wiki definition seems to restrict the terminology REPL to Lisp-like languages, whereas the stated properties don't really contain any distinguishing features. In particular, would it be correct to call IPython a REPL?
