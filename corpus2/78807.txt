I have used a couple of the hosted SCM's like Unfuddle and Codespaces before and I like that they have Project Management tools built in. I've started using Mercurial and really like it, I would like to make the switch to it, but I can't seem to find any hosted mercurial solutions that contain project management tools. Does anyone know any hosted solutions that have mercurial repositories with project management solutions? Similar to Aseembla, CodeSpaces, Unfuddle, etc. I know there is BitBucket, but I don't see any project management tools. EDIT: Details about the types of tools I'm looking for. It is for a very small team, 2-5 people. Looking for Agile (or close to Agile) tools. For example, in CodeSpaces there is a card wall, Assembla has a robust ticketing system that you can create swim lanes in, etc.
