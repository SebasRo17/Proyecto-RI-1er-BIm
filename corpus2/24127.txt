I have a list of line segments stored in the form:               { {{x11,y11},{x12,y12}} , {{x21,y21},{x22,y22}} , ... , {{xn1,yn1},{xn2,yn2}} }      Now I want to rotate all of them by 90 degrees about their own centers. To do that I wrote a pure function like this               {{{0, -1}, {1, 0}}.(#[[1]] - (#[[1]] + #[[2]])/2) + (#[[1]] + #[[2]])/2,     {{0, -1}, {1, 0}}.(#[[2]] - (#[[1]] + #[[2]])/2) + (#[[1]] + #[[2]])/2} &      As you can see this is pretty lengthy compare to the simplicity of my request. But I do not have enough _Mathematica_ experience to shorten it. So can anyone help?
