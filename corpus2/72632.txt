I am asking about this git branching model or workflow. I really like this. It strikes me as very intuitive and productive, but what I am asking for is whether there are any flaws or negatives to this approach that are not yet clear to me (coming from another world where ClearCase ruled the day). (You don't need to answer every question, whatever you can is helpful)   1. Do you use this or a similar git branching workflow?   2. Do you consider this a productive approach?   3. Do you see any flaws with this approach? Any potential downside?   4. If you have a better approach, would you mind sharing, or providing a link to an article or discussion about it?
