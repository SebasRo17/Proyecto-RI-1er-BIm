I have just moved to a new company and they are using TFS 2010 (2012 in a couple of months) as their version control system and recently started to use it as a work tracking system for the developers. However, there doesn't seem to be a bug tracking system for use by people outside development & test. Production support are getting reports of issues, fixing them on the fly and reporting back to their users at the moment. This needs to be changed but I don't really want to have a sperate system for tracking bugs and tracking dev work. Is there a way that I can create a very light weight way of entering bugs into TFS similar to the way that FogBugz does? Logging into TFS to fill out a bug report seems to be a lot heavier and you have to associate it with a particular application. Support may be able to do this but I want to be able to triage the item and potentially change the association to something other than an application. I have used FogBugz in the past and when adding a bug, you can add a much/little as you want to the item so it is at least recorded and later you can bounce it back to get more information when you come to triage the ticket.
