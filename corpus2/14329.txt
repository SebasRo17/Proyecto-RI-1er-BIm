I have files that look like this:               8853,548600 39,021824        8143,632600 37,200790        7815,964200 35,926544        7106,337000 34,761822        6724,260400 33,491154        6178,100200 32,254318      I want to import it and then change the decimal point from , to . and convert it so that it has the the right head (so I can manipulate it like a number). My attempt that doesn't work:               data = Apply[StringReplace[#, {"," -> "."}] &,        Import[file, "Data"], {2}]
