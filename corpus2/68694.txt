Programmers, like myself, often is too worried about if their code is really going to work, rather than how to communicate with the users. Scared of throwing an exception at the user, we test with different scenarios in different environment like development, staging and production. But when it comes to deliver a simple line of information to the user - we fail. We try to convey a message that explains to us what is really meant rather than a message, in plain english, easily understood by the user. And even more - we use a very strict and formal language. We spend 1% or less of our time to think about who receives the message, and what they think of it when they do. I use phrases like **"Not selected to the next step"** instead of **"We're sorry, but there where others with higher score than you who made it to the next step. But keep up the good work, we like to see you here again. Sometime soon it will be your turn"** I dislike this attitude that I seem to be adapting. I'd like this behaviour of mine to change. How do I keep myself out of the rabbit hole?
