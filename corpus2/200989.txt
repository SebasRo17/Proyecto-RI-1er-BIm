I got a bunch of questions to answer to prepare for an exam and this one I'm actually not sure what's the clear difference : "Explain the difference between designing software and designing physical products" I have an opinion on this, but the more I think about it the more it feels like there's no real difference except that the tools and formula's used when making physical items has been established hundreds of years ago and the heuristics/models have been in place since forever. I also thought that, once you design a spoon and make it, it doesn't evolve with time, it fulfills it's requirements and that's that, while for software new requirements come in all the time so you have to consider certain quality attributes in that regard. This is from my software architecture class if you guys need a context. What are the differences between software design and physical design, and am I off the mark with my answer?
