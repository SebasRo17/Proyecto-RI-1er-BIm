Recently a friend of mine went the Hackfest sponsored by Quick Left. Which sounded like a lot of fun, and I kind of wish I could have participated in it myself. So, now I'm looking for ideas that like the Hackfest that could help developers on my team innovate, and think wildly about how do stuff with the Web, etc. Anyone have some ideas?
