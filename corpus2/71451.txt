The more I program on the Android for smartphones platform the more I like. The way they made task management and inter-task messaging clean and easy is a treat (e.g. - AsyncTask, broadcasters, receivers, etc.). How similar is Android development on other platforms, for example tablets or later Android based TVs, to Android for smartphones? How compatible is code developed to run on the Android (phone) emulator to Android code running on other hardware platforms. If I write a lot of cool code for an Android smart phone, how much of it will I have to tweak/reinvent to get it to run on other Android platforms? That leads to a huge question concerining Android (phone) UI widget portability. Does code that uses those objects run unmodified on other Android platforms? If not, how much effort is it to make Android code cross-hardware platform portable? If the code is fairly portable, I think programming for the Android O/S on a table or regular Android PC if they gain popularity would be an excellent experience. If any of you have done Android programming on smart phones and on other hardware platforms, I'd love to hear what your experiences have been.
