I'm used to delimit statements by a semicolon from Java, so naturally I do it in Scala code too. I also feel that the code is easier to read, because it's evident where one statement ends and another begins. But many times when I post a piece of Scala code on SO, the code gets edited just to get semicolons removed.   1. Should I use semicolons or not? Are there any "official" guidelines or coding style?   2. Are there cases where semicolons are required, otherwise the code is ambiguous?
