Accordingly to the first paragraph of Joel's post, a Program Manager is a very good thing to have in products. But what about having a Program Manager for a company that doesn't have a product, but have projects? The only coincidence that I'd see if you ask me and ask me to answer right away is that a Program Manager for an outsourcing company would be someone that oversees all the projects that the company have, ensuring that the things are being done aligned to the company strategy, from a technical point of view.
