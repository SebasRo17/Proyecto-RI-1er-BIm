I'm aware there are a lot of topics about MVC design but it's hard to find good explanations: what I should do, what are the consequences of the different possibilities... So I'm working on an ASP .NET MVC application with a HTML/Javascript front- end. Currently there is a view which allows the end-user to edit some objects like the others users. The form is automatically generated based on some meta- data. But these objects are rather complex, with many system properties and need to be edited by non-expert users. As we don't want to spend much time on the view, we decided to just hide all the input fields except the most simple ones like first name, last name, phone... My question is, does this filtering should be done in the controller or in the view ? Should I Ignore the most complex input fields in the view or only returns the needed fields from the controller ? Also my controller returns the data from the model without any post- processing. So it is done in the view. I could do it in the controller in order to save some ajax-calls and a little bandwith but I don't know if I should adapt the controller to the view or the view to the controller.
