Recently I have read some interesting things about `CompilationTarget->"C"` on SE, e.g. in http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/54459/11116 where @MichaelE2 mentioned that " _compilation to C and Listable do not always get along_ ". In this regard, I want to pose three questions:   1. What are other things that are incompatible with `CompilationTarget->"C"`?   2. According to this http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/34070/11116 " _double inequalities is not yet implemented for`CompilationTarget -> "C".`_" What are some other functions that fall in that category? Is there a way to get the list of implemented functions?    3. Are there some guidelines on when `CompilationTarget -> "C"` performs better than `CompilationTarget -> "WVM"`?
