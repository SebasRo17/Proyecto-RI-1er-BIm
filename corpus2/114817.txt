I've been programming in C++ for a few years, and I've done a school project or two in C (as well as several other languages). However, I don't know C very well at all. I have a programming interview in two days, and I just realized that this interview will be in C. How do I approach this? How do I learn C well enough to succeed in a programming interview? This job is not looking for a "C expert" or anything like that, so I think they'll be somewhat understanding if I explain that I have not programmed much in C. They just choose to host their interviews in C. Buying and reading a textbook is not feasible, so my resources will have to be on the internet.
