I have been reading the Wikipedia article on double check locking and one thing that's not clear from it (at least to me) is what the pattern achieves. What is the reason for making the two checks below? Why not have triple checked locking? Wouldn't that be even better?               if (mySingleton == null) { // 1st check                 lock (myLock) {                     if (mySingleton == null) { // 2nd (double) check                         mySingleton = new MySingleton();                     }                 }             }
