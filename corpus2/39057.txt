In a reply here  Leonid wrote, “Compile can handle a number of higher-level functions, such as Transpose, Partition, Map, MapThread, etc. Most of these functions return expressions, and even though these expressions are probably passed to the calling function, they must be created. For example, a call to ReplacePart which replaces a single part in a large array will necessarily lead to copying of that array. Thus, immutability generally implies creating copies.” However, I still don't understand what things besides the obvious would lead to a CopyTensor. Please help me understand what constructs lead to CopyTensor in my CompiledFunction, and how the CopyTensor can be avoided.
