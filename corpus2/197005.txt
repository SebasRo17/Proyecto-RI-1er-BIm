I need to validate some form inputs in complex way. E.g.               <select id="options" multiple="multiple">       <option>A</option>       <option>B</option>       <option>C</option>       <option>D</option>       <option>E</option>       </select>        For example, if user selects A and B, user should be given an error if user also selects D. Note, I'm trying to keep this business rule in a separate layer from this UI code, which could be an entirely different form, e.g. checkboxes, drag-and- drop, add/delete options with possibly accompanying fields. I'm looking for a framework, design pattern, or other elegant way to code this logic, preferably ultimately through validation attributes in a model.
