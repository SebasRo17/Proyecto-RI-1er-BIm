I have a set of data               plotgamma6 = {{0.1, 14/15}, {0.2, 17/20}, {0.3, 11/15}, {0.4,      43/60}, {0.5, 2/3}, {0.6, 13/20}, {0.7, 7/12}, {0.8, 17/30}, {0.9,      17/30}, {1., 31/60}, {1.1, 31/60}, {1.2, 7/15}, {1.3,      7/15}, {1.4, 9/20}, {1.5, 9/20}, {1.6, 9/20}, {1.7, 13/30}, {1.8,      5/12}, {1.9, 2/5}, {2., 2/5}, {2.1, 2/5}, {2.2, 23/60}, {2.3,      23/60}, {2.4, 11/30}, {2.5, 11/30}, {2.6, 11/30}, {2.7,      7/20}, {2.8, 1/3}, {2.9, 1/3}, {3., 1/3}, {3.1, 1/3}, {3.2,      1/3}, {3.3, 19/60}, {3.4, 19/60}, {3.5, 19/60}, {3.6, 3/10}, {3.7,      3/10}, {3.8, 4/15}, {3.9, 1/4}, {4., 7/30}, {4.1, 13/60}, {4.2,      13/60}, {4.3, 13/60}, {4.4, 13/60}, {4.5, 13/60}, {4.6,      13/60}, {4.7, 13/60}, {4.8, 13/60}, {4.9, 13/60}, {5., 13/60}};     plotgamma10 = {{0.1, 93/100}, {0.2, 89/100}, {0.3, 83/100}, {0.4,          81/100}, {0.5, 37/50}, {0.6, 18/25}, {0.7, 17/25}, {0.8,          16/25}, {0.9, 61/100}, {1., 59/100}, {1.1, 14/25}, {1.2,          14/25}, {1.3, 13/25}, {1.4, 13/25}, {1.5, 49/100}, {1.6,          23/50}, {1.7, 23/50}, {1.8, 9/20}, {1.9, 9/20}, {2.,          43/100}, {2.1, 43/100}, {2.2, 21/50}, {2.3, 41/100}, {2.4,          2/5}, {2.5, 19/50}, {2.6, 37/100}, {2.7, 9/25}, {2.8, 7/20}, {2.9,          17/50}, {3., 33/100}, {3.1, 29/100}, {3.2, 29/100}, {3.3,          29/100}, {3.4, 27/100}, {3.5, 13/50}, {3.6, 6/25}, {3.7,          6/25}, {3.8, 6/25}, {3.9, 6/25}, {4., 6/25}, {4.1, 21/100}, {4.2,          1/5}, {4.3, 1/5}, {4.4, 19/100}, {4.5, 9/50}, {4.6, 9/50}, {4.7,          4/25}, {4.8, 4/25}, {4.9, 4/25}, {5., 4/25}};      which I plot using ListPlot               Needs["PlotLegends`"]     a = ListPlot[{plotgamma6, plotgamma10}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},       PlotRange -> {{0, 5}, {0, 1}}, AxesLabel -> {"gamma", "quantity"},       PlotStyle -> PointSize[0.02], PlotLegend -> {"N=6", "N=10",},       LegendPosition -> {1.1, -0.4}, Joined -> {True, True},       PlotMarkers -> Automatic]      Now, I also want to plot a function which needs to be compared with the above data, i.e.,                   f[z_] := Exp[-z/2] BesselI[0, z/2];         b = Plot[-2 f'[z], {z, 0, 5}, PlotLegend -> "Theory",        LegendPosition -> {1.1, -0.4}]      Now, I want to combine these two plots into one, so I use               Show[a,b]      However, this gives a messed up plot! If I remove the plot legends from both the plots, then the combined plot looks reasonable though. But I really want to retain the plot legends. How would you combine these two plots? It doesn't matter to me how you plot these data, i.e., if you use `Show` or some other function. Please note that my question is closely related to How to show legend in a combined plot of many lists, However, that question wasn't answered fully either. Thanks! dbm368
