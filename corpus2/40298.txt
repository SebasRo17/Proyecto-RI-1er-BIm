How can I print my expression with my function's arguments hidden? For example:               exp=A[r,z]+B[s]^2;          HideArgs[exp]      Output:               A+B^2      The expression that could be tested is this one:               r^3*(Br[r, z]^2+Bz[r, z]^2)==E^(6\[Psi][r, z])*(r*D[\[Psi][r, z], z, z]+r*D[\[Psi][r, z],r,r])      Where the unknown functions are:               Br[r,z],Bz[r,z],\[Psi][r, z]
