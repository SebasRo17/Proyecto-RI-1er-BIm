I am having trouble doing something that seems straightforward. I have a recursive sequence that I would like to produce which looks as follows:               a2 = {1, 2, 3}     RecurrenceTable[{a1[n + 1] == a1[n] + a2[[n]], a1[1] == 1}, a1, {n, 1, 3}]      This seems like it should work, but _Mathematica_ is complaining about `n` not being an integer when I try to call the $n$-th part of `a2`. What I am really interested in is a very large `RecurrenceTable` of this form rather than what I have posted. Since `RecurrenceTable` seems to be much more efficient at generating large recursive sequences than any other functions I have been able to find, I would love to find a way to be able to use it.
