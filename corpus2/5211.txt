I aim to develop a series of timeline ZUI visualizations which will display a set of events similar to Wolfram's own Timeline of Computable Knowledge, but that can also handle crowdsourced uploading of events (and hyperlink to, say Wikipedia articles). In addition, I would like the layout to look more like the printed poster version of the Wolfram timeline (shown at the bottom of the page), which means developing a layout engine so that labels don't overlap. Could this project be developed as a CDF? With WebMathematica? Any pointers to documentation, tutorials or identification of other technologies (such as databases) to this end are appreciated.
