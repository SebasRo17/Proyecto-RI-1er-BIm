I'm wondering if I should use acronyms or initialisms when I list technical qualifications or mention specific technologies on my résumé or CV. For example:   * _Entity Framework_ vs. _EF_ vs. _EF (Entity Framework)_   * _Graphical User Interface_ vs. _GUI_ vs. _GUI (Graphical User Interface)_ Is there a reason to prefer one version over another? Is it better to be as clear as possible, companies view not using the correct acronym a sign of lack of knowledge about the subject?
