I started learning Java recently. I started learning it using books that I picked up from the library, some that I bought, and here and there from Java documentation.   The book that I use for Java was published in the year 2011. In 2012, Java8 will be released followed by Java9 in the year 2013.   The questions are:   * How do I keep myself updated about developments in Java without having to buy a tome for Java8 and/or Java9   * Is a book published in 2008 an outdated book for studying JSP and Servelets? I'm talking about Head First Servlets and JSP
