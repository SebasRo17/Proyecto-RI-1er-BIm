Reading Niklaus Wirth, one can notice that despite some popularity of Pascal, he is not glad that Oberon (as a "polished" successor of Pascal and Modula) didn't get much popularity. I never did anything in Oberon, but reading the page Oberon For Pascal Developers I really did not like many of the changes as a Delphi/pascal developer, for example   * forcing the reserved words to be always uppercase   * making the language case-sensitive   * getting rid of enumeration types  What do you think about Oberon, is it really "a better Pascal" from your point of view?
