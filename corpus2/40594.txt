Here is an example of what I mean, the tooltip doesn't show most of the requested text ("example" in this case). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XCcJp.png) There is more information about my code in my previous question: show contour area as tooltip. However, I made this post to address the display issue with the tooltip which is likely a broad problem. Here is the code from the symptomatic screenshot I showed.               w = 4;     plot = ContourPlot[         Sqrt[(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 5], {x, -15, 15}, {y, -15, 15},          PlotPoints -> 30, MaxRecursion -> 4, Contours -> {w},          ContourStyle -> Blue, ImageSize -> 250] /. _Polygon ->          Sequence[] /. Tooltip[x_, y_] :> Tooltip[x, "example"]        Which can be simplified to just               ContourPlot[        Sqrt[(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 5], {x, -15, 15}, {y, -15, 15},         Contours -> {4}] /. _Polygon -> Sequence[] /.       Tooltip[x_, y_] :> Tooltip[x, "example"]        and still have the same issue with the tooltip not showing. I have tried adding a `Pane` wrapper around `"example"` within the argument of the last `Tooltip`, but this hasn't helped.
