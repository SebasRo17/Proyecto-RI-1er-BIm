I'd like to evaluate the following recursive integration using _Mathematica_ $$ \ M(T) = \int_0^T\int_0^\infty e^{-\delta s}g(x,s)dxds\ +\int_0^T e^{-\delta s}f(s)M(T-s)ds\, $$ where $g(x,s)$ and $f(s)$ are statistical probability density functions. Since it's a recursive function, the initial condition is given by $M(0) = 0$. For simplicity we can assume $f(s)$ to be an exponential PDF and $g(x,s)$ to be a Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern Copula PDF. I am not interested in the closed form solution of $M(T)$, rather I am interested only in its numerical answer. This is what I've tried so far:               FGMExpExp = Exp[-2 (s + 10 x)] (36. - 18. Exp[s] + Exp[10 x] (-18.  + 19. Exp[s]));     Delta = 0.04; a = 10; b = 1;      M[0] = 0; (* Initial Condition *)          Mu[T_] := Mu[T] = NIntegrate[Exp[-Delta*s]*x FGMExpExp, {x, 0, 1.05}, {s, 0, T}] +          NIntegrate[b Exp[-(Delta + b)*(T - s)] Mu[s], {s,0, T}]   (* Defining the integration *)     Mu[1] (* The quantity we are interested in. Will change T=1 to T=5 later *)      Your help is greatly appreciated.
