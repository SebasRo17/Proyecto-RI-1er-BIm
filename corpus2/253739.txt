i have written the following code,                  //main.cpp          #include<iostream>          #include<string>          #include"human.h"          #include"computer.h"          #include"referee.h"          #include"RandomComputer.h"          #include"Avalanche.h"          #include"Bureaucrat.h"          #include"Toolbox.h"          #include"Crescendo.h"          #include"PaperDoll.h"          #include"FistfullODollors.h"          using namespace std;          int main()          {          Avalanche pla1;     Avalanche pla2;          referee f;     pla1.disp();     for (int i=0;i<5;i++)     {                   cout<<pla2.mov[i];         }          return 0;          }      in this program all included classes except referee.h and human.h are drived from computer.h. each drived calls has a char array variable which is initialized when a member of a drived class is declared. the problem is that when i declare tow diffrent drived class memebers lets say Avalache and ToolBox. upon printing the char array for one of them using for loop it prints nothing. However if i declare only one of them in main.cpp the it works properly. and the file for computer.h is as such:                   #ifndef COMPUTER_H     #define COMPUTER_H     class computer     {         public:         int nump;         char mov[];         void disp();     };     #endif      ToolBox.h is like this:                   #ifndef TOOLBOX_H          #define TOOLBOX_H          #include"computer.h"          class Toolbox: public computer          {              public:              Toolbox();          };          #endif      finally Avalanche.h is as following:               #ifndef AVALANCHE_H          #define AVALANCHE_H          #include"computer.h"          class Avalanche: public computer          {              public:              Avalanche();          };          #endif
