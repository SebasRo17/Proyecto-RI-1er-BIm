My amateur reading of the MIT license suggests that any software is distributed to my customers containing any MIT-licensed components can be freely re-distributed in its entirety. > Permission is hereby granted [...] to deal in the Software without > restriction, including [...] the rights to [...] distribute [...] copies of > the Software. > > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in > all copies or substantial portions of the Software. It's not clear whether "the Software" refers to the entire application, or just the individual MIT-licensed component. So which is it?
