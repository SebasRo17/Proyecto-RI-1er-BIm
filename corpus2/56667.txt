I'm having trouble with the Fourier function at the moment. I'm solving a set of differential equations with NDSolve, then need to extract the spectrum associated with the curve below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G3PNG.jpg) So i use table to generate a list of data from the output of NDSolve, called 'list', and then use the following code to do generate the Fourier transform:               T = 800;     dt = T/(10000 - 1);     n = Length[list];     ssf = RotateRight[Range[-n/2, n/2 - 1]/(n dt), n/2];     fft = Fourier[list, FourierParameters -> {-1, 1}] // Chop;     Fourdata = Transpose[{ssf, Abs[fft]}];      this gives the spectrum: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HfsaA.jpg) it seems like something weird is happening at zero frequency, with a small discontinuity, and a line running along at zero for all frequencies. I've messed around with both the propagation time and time steps, but it doesn't seem to go away. Does anyone have any insight into this? Thanks in advance, Jake PS. I hope i have included enough detail here, but let me know if you need more...
