I have written an app for the computer in java, but i don't want to give it out for free. I only want to charge somewhere between $0.99 - $2.99, is there a website that i can upload it to, to do this for me. I am looking for something like the apple app store, or the android market, but for the computer. Does this exist? also, is there a way to control the amount of computers it can be installed on? ie. if a person is using a specific key, they can only use the program one one computer at a time, like i-tunes movies. the program is a standalone app, meaning there is no installation process, you just open the executable file and it works. will this be a problem for integrating a licensing function.
