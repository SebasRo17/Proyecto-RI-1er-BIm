I'm looking for good reference on patterns that apply to user security and ACLs for multi-user network applications. I'm re-writing a fairly large application from scratch. Now I'm looking at the user management and security. I'm not so interested in user meta data, but rather ACLs and security. Right now the application has users, groups, and roles. Users and roles have ACLs. Groups do not. A user can belong to none or any number of groups and/or roles. I cannot find a good reason not to combine roles and groups. However, I'd like to hear the various opinions on the subject. It would be nice to be pointed to some design patterns and references on the subject.
