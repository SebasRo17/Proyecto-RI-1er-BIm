I've been reading a few books on c# development over the last few months (clr via c#, architecting applications for the enterprise, c# 4 in nutshell just to give you an idea). I really feel it's been a worthwhile exercise however, at the moment, it feels like I've slightly scatterbombed my head with theory (although I have been trying to put it into practice where possible). I have worked on c# projects since .net 2.0 here and there so I have got a few years programming experience, I'm just really making an effort now to try and get to the next level. What I find hard to do sometimes is putting it altogether. What I was hoping to find was some sample project or maybe an open source project or something similar that tries to tie all these aspects of development together in a large project that deals with a fairly complex problem (100s of classes preferably although i know this is not a good yardstick for complexity), in a true object oriented sense, that includes generics, delegates, web services, some different design patterns, linq or nhibernate etc etc, mvc 3/4, with documentation and unit testing... one can dream So is that possible? (edit: without writing it myself)
