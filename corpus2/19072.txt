By default horizontal GridLines are placed in front of vertical GridLines:               style = Directive[#, AbsoluteThickness[5]] &;     Graphics[Circle[], Frame -> True, ImagePadding -> 1, GridLines -> Automatic,          GridLinesStyle -> style /@ #] & /@ {{LightGray, Black}, {Black, LightGray}} // GraphicsRow      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bxm7H.png) **How can I place the vertical lines in front so that they appear uninterrupted?** I do not wish to resort to manually drawing `Line` expressions.
