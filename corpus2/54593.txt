Mathematica 10 freezes while 'Formatting notebook contents'. This happens already during the startup of Mathematica and it takes a long time for Mathematica to recover. It can also happen when I am editing a Notebook or browsing the documentation. Especially the documentation is very slow. Is this somehow related to the Mathematica FrontEnd? Is anybody else struggling with problems like this? EDIT: I'm using 64 bit Windows 7
