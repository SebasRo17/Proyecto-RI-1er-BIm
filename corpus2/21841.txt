I am trying to find a convex hull command for a `Graphics3D` object. Does it exist in _Mathematica_?               egg = Graphics3D[Cuboid /@ Position[DiskMatrix[{12, 10, 8}], 1]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7AVBz.png) The `ConvexHull` command of the `"ComputationalGeometry`"` package does not work on 3D objects:               Needs["ComputationalGeometry`"]     ConvexHull[egg]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xSWSV.png)
