It seems to me that, for everyday use, more primitive data structures like arrays get the job done just as well as a binary tree would. My question is how common is to use these structures when writing code for projects at work or projects that you pursue in your free time? I understand the better insertion time/deletion time/sorting time for certain structures but would that really matter that much if you were working with a relatively small amount of data?
