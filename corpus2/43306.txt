I supose probably yes, but at the end I assume that internally mathematica has to use Set or SetDelayed. Am I right? Background: I am developing a super simple phraser that takes a code description how objects should work and changes it slightly. Part of the code deals with assignments. They have to be handled in a somewhat special way. The generic indexing works like               OBJ[id_]@f := f[id]      I noticed that during the assignments _Mathematica_ does not bring `OBJ[1]@f to the bitter end, i.e.,`f[1]`; for example in               OBJ[1]@f = 1      the left hand side is not resolved to `f[1]`. I changed how `Set` and `SetDelayed` works for fields in objects, and would like to make sure that _Mathematica_ always goes through my definitions:               OBJ /: Set[OBJ[id_]@f, rhs_] := (f[id] = rhs);     OBJ /: SetDelayed[OBJ[id_]@f, rhs_] := (f[id] := rhs);     OBJ /: OBJ[id_][f] := (f[id]);      the first two lines handle the cases like               OBJ[1]@f = 1;     OBJ[2]@f := 2;      while the third line handles the cases like               a = 2 * OBJ[1]@f + 1      of course, a combination is possible:               OBJ[1]@f = OBJ[2]@f + 1;      I am providing the background to the question, which should hopefully put the question in the right context. Hope someone can help.
