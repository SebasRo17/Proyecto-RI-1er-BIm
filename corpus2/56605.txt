Consider this example:               ds = Dataset@Transpose[<|"a" -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1}, "b" -> {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0}|>, AllowedHeads -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1xM43.png) Now say I need to work with the ratios of these two values. This works fine:               ds[;;-2, #a/#b &]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xiozu.png) But this fails:               ds[All, #a/#b &]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pJpS6.png) It would be easier for me to just get a result with some ComplexInfinities. Does the operation fail by desgin or oversight? Is there a workaround? Should I just use               ds[All, Quiet[#a/#b] &]      all the time or is there a more general solution? `Off[General::infy]` doesn't prevent this from failing, though the failure message can't be displayed properly.
