Is Solve[] very inefficient in solving equations involving square roots? The input below attempts to find out the explicit expression of either x or y in terms of other variables {x|y, a, c}, and c is the focal length, a is directrix. F = (Sqrt[(x+c)^2+y^2]-Sqrt[(x-c)^2+y^2]==2a && x>0 && c>0 && a>0 && c>a) Solve[F,y] Solve[F,x] After running on my Acer dual core laptop for over 4 hours this input is still shown in “running” state. http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Solve.html “Solve deals primarily with linear and polynomial equations.” So is the equation above an example that Solve[] works not so well with equations involving square roots (and likely other order roots) ?
