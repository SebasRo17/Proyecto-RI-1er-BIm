I am a C# software developer. I was recently approached by a client to develop a multiplayer board game (max 4 players). I fiddled around with WCF, WPF and EF 4.1 to get something going but I keep running into small stumbling blocks. It certainly does appear that integrating all these technologies into one solution is problematic. I do not have extensive experience in WPF/WCF but I find the concepts easy to grasp. It's just that I keep running into little problems which are huge stumbling blocks. My thoughts were to first create a WCF service to manage the boards and rules. I would then turn to the UI (possibly Silverlight/WPF). I am actually at the point where I think I should try a framework or even venture to PHP/Ruby/Python. The requirements are simple:   * Web based   * Turn based   * Board game   * Database backend As a C# developer (possibly a poor one), what would you suggest?
