I'm interested in the experience of software developers who have become programming teachers, -- at a junior college, teaching college or high school. I'm wondering if anybody has made the switch and if they've stuck with it or if they've gone back to industry -- and why. I've been thinking for the past 7 years (on and off) that I'd like to try it out and see what it's like. I have friends that are teachers and seem to love their jobs. From what my friends know of me and from what I know of myself, I think I'd like it.
