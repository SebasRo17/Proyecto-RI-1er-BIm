I need a loop for a text analysis involving about 1000 papers (identical structure of all papers) I have these two commands to read all the papers into memory.               papers =        Table[         StringJoin[{"/Users/maxm端ller/Desktop/Arbeit/Info Jan2014/", ToString[i], ".pdf"}],          {i, 1, 1000}]          AllPaper = Table[Import[paper], {paper, papers}];      This is a too big a dataset for my laptop to hold in main memory, so I want to select the relevant info before I load all the data in the loop. I need following info for my analysis:               DOI = FindList["/Users/maxm端ller/Desktop/Arbeit/Info/1.pdf", "ARTICLEDOI"]          Author = FindList["/Users/maxm端ller/Desktop/Arbeit/Info/1.pdf", "/Author"]          Volume = FindList["/Users/maxm端ller/Desktop/Arbeit/Info/1.pdf", "Vol.", 1]      It would be great if someone could help me to creat an efficient command for my analysis.
