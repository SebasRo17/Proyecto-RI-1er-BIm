From W3C Software Notice and License: > Permission to copy, modify, and distribute this software and its > documentation, with or without modification, for any purpose and without fee > or royalty is hereby granted My app depends on the xml-apis 1.4.01 library that in turn includes W3C software and I need to distribute it along with my non-free app. I am not explicitly charging for the included xml-apis/W3C components. Does the stated license statement exclude such a paid distribution? Don't answer if you are not aware of the GPL linking exception.
