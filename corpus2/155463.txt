I have done some searching on Google, but haven't come up with much as of yet. I am wanting to take a set of point data, which I had previously been using to create weighted points for a heat map through the Google API, and turn them into a contour map to overlay on the Google Maps API. I haven't seen anything in Google's code that would let me do this. Does anyone know of a good API to create such an overlay? Or is there possibly something I have overlooked that Google offers?
