I have seen many times that if you want to look good on resumes you should have some project coded as open source on bit bucket and Git. I want to do that , even though it may be small but at least i want to starts the steps which can make me a good programmer and it looks good on resume. I knows these languages like `php bash python django jquery joomla` Can anyone give me some example what type of projects i should upload there which i can mention in resume. i usually build websites , how can i put those type of codes. Does putting shell script for backing database can also be put in there
