I am trying to generate a parametric plot in _Mathematica_ 8 using the following:               pp1=ParametricPlot[{Evaluate[Qin[t]]*10^3,Evaluate[PhiOut[t]]},{t,0,1/f0},AspectRatio->1/1,PlotRange->All,AxesOrigin->{0,0},PlotStyle->Directive[Thickness[Medium],colour]];      This works fine but I was wondering if it is possible to switch the styling of the line from solid to dashed for a certain range of the plotting parameter `t` e.g. for `t>0.5*1/f0`. I know that this can be done by generating separate plots and then combining them. This is not very convenient in my case. Is it possible to do this in a single `ParametricPlot` command?
