I am trying to control the style for edge labels in treeplot and have run into a problem. Consider these two graphs:               edges1 = {{1 -> 2,"Test"}, 2 -> 3}     edges2 = {{1 -> 2,"Test"}, 2 -> 3, 1 -> 4}      If I plot the first then the labeled edge displays correctly:               TreePlot[edges1, BaseStyle-> 20]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pm4rf.png) But if I plot the second it slants the text:               TreePlot[edges2, BaseStyle-> 20]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R6FF9.png) Anyone have any insight how to stop the second behavior? **Edit** Here is a more complicated example showing how it slants the text in both directions and in different amounts (Note that in actuality my edges have different labels)               edges = {{1 -> 2, "Test"}, {1 -> 3, "Test"}, {2 -> 14,      "Test"}, {3 -> 4, "Test"}, {4 -> 99, "Test"}, {3 -> 6,      "Test"}, {6 -> 7, "Test"}, {6 -> 8, "Test"}, {7 -> 9,      "Test"}, {8 -> 10, "Test"}, {8 -> 11, "Test"}, {10 -> 12,      "Test"}, {11 -> 13, "Test"}};     edges[[All, 2]] = Map[Panel@Style[#, 12] &, edges[[All, 2]]];     TreePlot[edges, Top, 1, AspectRatio -> 1/3]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q9NMG.png) * _Edit 2 *_ Combining M.R.'s solution and LayerSizeFunction I can somewhat still control the aspect ratio, but Mr. Wizard's solution is much better M.R. + LayerSizeFunction:               DeleteCases[TreePlot[edges, Top, 1, LayerSizeFunction -> (1/4 # &)], AspectRatio -> _]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1mzx7.png) Mr. Wizard:               edges3 = {{1 -> 2, "Test"}, {1 -> 3, "Test"}, {2 -> 14,      "Test"}, {3 -> 4, "Test"}, {4 -> 99, "Test"}, {3 -> 6,      "Test"}, {6 -> 7, "Test"}, {6 -> 8, "Test"}, {7 -> 9,      "Test"}, {8 -> 10, "Test"}, {8 -> 11, "Test"}, {10 -> 12,      "Test"}, {11 -> 13, "Test"}};     TreePlot[edges3, Top, 1, AspectRatio -> 1/3, EdgeRenderingFunction -> ({Line[#1],       If[#3 === None, {}, Text[Panel@Style[#3, 16], Mean@#1]]} &)]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ImiTn.png)
