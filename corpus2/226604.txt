What's the name for a class that has only methods? There are no fields/properties. Just two methods with the ability to parse some file in two ways. I have named the class Parser, but it just doesn't seem right to have a class do only that. Or? Should it be in a class ? EDIT: Dummy Example               class Parser     {          public int parseMethod1(string file)          {              //parse & return          }               public string[] parseMethod2(string file)          {              //parse & return          }     }      How could I write an interface `IParser` which allowed me to have a subclass only implement one of the methods?
