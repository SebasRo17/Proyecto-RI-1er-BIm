I have a commercial Android project that I have created a client-specific version for (mainly UI tweaks). Since the bulk of the tweaks are in the res/ folder in XML files, we have the changes currently in a branch but I really don't want to have to port changes back and forth between branches in perpetuity. I'm curious if anyone has any source control strategies that will make managing multiple client-specific versions of an Android application as painless as possible. Also, not sure if this belongs here or StackOverflow. Feel free to transition over there if I guessed wrong.
