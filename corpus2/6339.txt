Consider the following snippet of code:                 Module[{pts},        pts = {{0, 0}, {0, 2}, {6, 0}};        Graphics[{Blue, Polygon[pts]}, PlotRange -> {{0, 4}, {0, 4}}]       ]      A graphic is displayed that doesn't entirely fall within the plotrange. Question : I have a Panel that displays graphics of different shapes and size. When automatic resizing of the graphic is not an option what is the best way to calculate the plotrange ( or any other suitable option ) so that graphics fit ?
