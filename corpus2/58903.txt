I stumbled (here, in the expression for the block diagram) upon a version of Graph that I don't see in the documentation over here. That documentation admits three overloads (the following are in my own words):   1. `Graph[{` _edges_`}]`   2. `Graph[{` _vertices_`}, {` _edges_`}]`   3. `Graph[{` _decoratedVertices_`}, {` _decoratedEdges_`}]` For instance, the following example invokes overload 2:               Graph[{1,2,3}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8tfwu.png) If I add a `Null` in an undocumented place, I get arrows:               Graph[{1,2,3}, { {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}}, Null } ]      Notice there is an extra level of `List` in the list of vertices. It's as though the list of vertices contains a nested list of vertices and a Null vertex. This seems to produce similar results to               Graph[{1, 2, 3}, {1 \[DirectedEdge] 2, 1 \[DirectedEdge] 3, 2 \[DirectedEdge] 3}]      Anyone happen to know what's going on? I'm ok with blindly using the cool feature, but I wonder what the other options for this API might be. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fxs14.png)
