I'm recruiting coders. The first step is to carry out a test to cut out the "chafe", but do I just make a decision based on the fact that the shortlisted candidates are the best in the world at coding? What should I look out for that would guarantee that the persons i finally hire are not only the best coders but also are the best fit for my company. What should the tests exactly measure?
