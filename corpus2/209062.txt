I have a Model Car in my iOS application where it's parameters like name, year, value etc are fetched from a web service in order to fill a list with cars data. **Where should I put the method that asynchronously goes to the server and returns an array of cars (this method already converts the JSON to a Car array)?** My current approach is a static method in my Car class that receives an HttpClient (so I'm able to unit test it mocking the client) and returns an NSArray of cars, is this good? What have you guys done in this situation? I'm concerned because I recently started reading clean code which says that a Class should do only one thing, and the way I have it now appears to do 2 things (hold information about a Car and get a list of cars).
