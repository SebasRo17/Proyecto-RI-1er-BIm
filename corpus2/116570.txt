I want to make User Manual/Help to my program. I found two good ways - XML or HTML - which should I use and why? I know how to do it in html (I know how to use js, css and such) but in XML it's harder (or I imagine?) anyway which way should I choose and why?... **Edit** : There's one important thing I forgot to mention: I need it for the army, I can make it only on army's computer and I cannot install anything you said. I can use notepad and that's it.
