How can I symbolically calculate the variance of the following random walk in _Mathematica_? Given several discrete random variables such that $p(Z_i=1-2k)=p$, where $k$ is a small real number, and $p(Z_i=-1)=1-p$, a random walk is the sum $X_t = \sum\limits_{i=1}^t Z_i$. The expectation is given by: $$\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^t\mathbb{E}[Z_i] = \sum\limits_{i=1}^tp(1-2k) -(1-p) = (p(1-2k)+p-1)t$$ I would like to calculate the variance of the random walk $Var[X_t]$. I tried using `EmpiricalDistribution`, but it does not accept symbolic values. **EDIT** After a bit more research into Mathematica's documentation I found the function TranformedDistribution. Since my random walk does not have unit steps I thought maybe the distribution can be obtained from a Bernoulli like this:               TransformedDistribution[      If[\[FormalX] == 1, 1 - 2 k, -1], \[FormalX] \[Distributed]        BernoulliDistribution[p]]      Could someone please show me how to use this to calculate $Var[X_t]$? As someone in the comments said, the variance of $X_t$ is the sum of variances of $Z_i$ so at some point I will have to calculate $E[Zi^2]$ where $Z_i$ is a tranformed Bernoulli distribution like I attempted above?
