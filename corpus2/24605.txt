I'm building a small app as an interface to support functions, monitoring, web-based running of unit tests, etc. This will be checked into Subversion. I want to include a third-party app which is also available via Subversion. Thus far I prefer to reference the remote repository to ease upgrades, particularly when I have made local modifications. Now, I want the third-party app to be distributed alongside the parent app. Subversion externals are out, since I can't commit my local mods. `git svn` seems like it has potential, but I'm not sure on the details. (Seems dirty to have a .git directory with svn metadata stored in an svn repository.) So how do you handle modifications to Subversion projects you can't commit to? I'm pretty open to any combination of git and svn, preferably allowing the code to live in our existing Subversion repository. **Update:** I'm currently exploring vendor branches, which is more convention than feature. There is a tool called `svn_load_dirs.pl` to assist with the process.
