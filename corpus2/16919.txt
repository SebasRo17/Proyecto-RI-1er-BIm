[Corrected equations and added simple example] Can you solve a system of (loosely) coupled recurrence relations like this in _Mathematica_ somehow?               {A[k] ==1+((n-k-2)/n) A[k+1] +(2/n) B[k+1] + (k/n) (A[0]),       B[k]==1+((n-k-1)/n) B[k+1] + (k/n) A[0]}      We want to solve it for $A[0]$ as a closed form function of $n$. $A[k]$ is defined for $0 \leq k \leq n-2$ and $B[k]$ is defined for $1 \leq k \leq n-1$. Version 8 doesn't do anything useful but I suspect I am not asking it in the right way. As a simple example, if you set $n=3$ then you get four simulataneous equations.               A[0] == 1 + (2/3)*B[1] + (1/3)*A[1]     B[1] == 1 + (1/3)*A[0] + (1/3)*B[2]     B[2] == 1 + (2/3)*A[0]     A[1] == 1 + (2/3)*B[2] + (1/3)*A[0]      Solving for $A[0]$ gives you $33/5$ I believe. To start things off, how do you get _Mathematica_ to do this? **Update.** If you just take the second recurrence alone.               B[k]==1+((n-k-1)/n) B[k+1] + (k/n) A[0]      How can you get _Mathematica_ to give a sensible solution for $B[k]$ in terms of $n$ and $A[0]$? It seems Rsolve ought to be able to do this. I even tried               RSolve[{B[k] == 1 + ((n - k - 1)/n) B[k + 1] + ((k)/n) (A[0]),        B[n - 1] == k A[0]/n}, B[k], k]      which should be identical. However this now gives an empty solution with the following warning.               RSolve::bvnul: For some branches of the general solution, the given boundary conditions lead to an empty solution.      I would like to tell _Mathematica_ to only try to solve it for the defined range of $k$. Is that possible?
