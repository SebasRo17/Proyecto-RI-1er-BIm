The MATLAB code               filter(0.5,[1, -0.5], [1:10])      is equivalent to               Rest@FoldList[(#1 + #2)/2. &, 0, Range[10]]      I don't know how to implement something more general likeï¼Œ`filter([1,2,3],[4,5,6], [1:10])` in _Mathematica_. I'm trying to rewrite a snippet of MATLAB code to _Mathematica_. I'm just interested in the `filter` function and there is no other purpose. What is its equivalent or how can I implement it?               v = [0.0 + 2 j; -sqrt (3) - 1 j; sqrt (3) - 1 j];     n = randi (3, 1, 10000000);     p = filter (0.5, [1 - 0.5], v (n));     plot (p, '.b');
