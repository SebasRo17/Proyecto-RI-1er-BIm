What would be the way to design a system which has logic that may change year wise? There is an application which conducts online exams. There are five questions for a particular subject. The questions may (or may not) change year wise. As per my current design, the questions in database are stored year wise. There are some year specific code logic as well. In order to enable the application for another year, the year specific database records and code will be copied or duplicated. How to avoid this code duplication?
