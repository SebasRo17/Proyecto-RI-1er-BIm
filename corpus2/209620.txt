My college has a course on Introduction to programming using python and we are using Python 2.7.5. I would like to know if it will be helpful to read Python Cookbook which is for python 2.4? There are no separate cookbooks for python 2.7.x, to my knowledge. But, are there any similar books? There is a later edition to python cookbook for Python 3, but it turns out that python 3 and python 2 are quite different.
