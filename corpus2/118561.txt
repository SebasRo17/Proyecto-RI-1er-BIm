I just asked this question at SO about some bugginess I am experiencing with jQuery and IE8, and someone commented that he was appalled that I would mix JavaScript with jQuery (he has since deleted his comment for some reason). This person had a high reputation, relative to mine (3000+), so I don't want to ignore his criticism. I'm still relatively new to web development, and I mostly work alone, so I wasn't aware that this could be a problem. Why should mixing the two be avoided?
