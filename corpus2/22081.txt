I am using _Mathematica_ to numercially solve the following equations:               2 D[f0[r], r]/r + D[f0[r], r, r] == -2 A f1[r]/r^4 +  2 A D[f1[r],      r]/r^3 -2 f1[r]/r^2 + 2 D[f1[r], r]/r + D[f1[r], r, r] == 2 A D[f0[r], r]/r^3      And my boundary condition is               f0[10] == 0.01, f1[10] == 0.01,      (D[f0[r], r] /. r -> 1) == 10^-3 A,      (D[f1[r], r] /. r -> 1) == 0      When I take A to be small, say 1, everything is fine. However, if I take A to be large, e.g. 100, _Mathematica_ complains and gives me crazy results. Here are the error message I get: > NDSolve::bvluc: The equations derived from the boundary conditions are > numerically ill-conditioned. The boundary conditions may not be sufficient > to uniquely define a solution. The computed solution may match the boundary > conditions poorly. >> > > NDSolve::berr: There are significant errors {-5.55116*10^6,-7.26312*10^6,0., > 0.} in the boundary value residuals. Returning the best solution found. >> Can anyone help me to deal with this issue? I appreciate your help!
