I'm developing an ipad app for managing HR attendance, so the idea is that the staff come to the center, choose their name from a table, and write down their personal id, for the time they come and the time they leave, still evaluating for the requirements if they want the time automatically saved or the staff write the time down (with a roller disk), or both, so what other way of authentication with an ipad comes to mind? (other than typing a code), (no ipad 2 wanted), so they don't want pictures. also how to avoid one person writing the code for a friend??, the data will be stored in coredata, and sync with server, thank you!
