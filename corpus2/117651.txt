We are in the middle of a strange situation. We and a partner firm have to put up a web portal. They have a lot of functionality already done on their other portal and we are the managing firm on the project. But there are also some new development needed on their side which is designed by us. Strange thing is, we are going to do the GUI on the project and they will provide us some web services to gather data. They are using .NET and we will be using PHP for the frontend project. So what do you think that the best approach is to avoid communication and integration problems? For example   1. We provide them with just the view files and they do the rest all by themselves?   2. We develop a PHP project where we gather the required data using SOAP/REST web services?  Thanks in advance guys.
