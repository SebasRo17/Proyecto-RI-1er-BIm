I have a set of (real) linear equations/inequalities and I want to know whether they have a solution, and to find at least one. The goal is to do this quickly. `FindInstance` seems rather slow -- it is possible that it's just the size of my problem, but I thought it could be done faster. In particular, since all my equations are linear, I thought I might try to see if `LinearProgramming` would be faster. Unfortunately, the function doesn't seem to take parameters the way I want it to: I have 0-1 matrices $M_1$, $M_2$, and seek a vector $x$ such that $M_1x = 0$ and $M_2x \geq 1$. The vector $x$ is however allowed to have negative entries. Any help for how to solve this problem is appreciated. Edit: on request, here is an example of $M_1$ (in fact, it always looks like three identity matrices, though its size varies) and of $M_2$ (which has, to the best of my knowledge no nice pattern except that it has precisely 3 ones per row):               M1 = {{1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0},            {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0},            {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0},            {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1}};          M2 = {{0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1},            {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0},            {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}};      I am looking for a real vector $x$ of length 12 (in this case) such that $M_1x = 0$ and each entry of $M_2x$ is at least 1.
