I have a program (technically an addon to a program) whose code I want to be freely available for educational purposes or to create derivatives for personal use. However, I do NOT want to allow unregulated redistribution of either modified or unmodified code, whether for free or for profit. However, I do want to allow the possibility of "pre-approved" derivative works - that is, the ability for a developer to request permission to distribute a derivative work (essentially an addon to an addon). Finally, the licensing for the parent program (which I do not own) forbids selling my addon directly but does not forbid monetization via other means (such as adfly). I do not want to allow others to monetize my original code, but do want to allow them to monetize pre-approved derivative works. Because of the rather nuanced nature of these requirements, and the fact it is NOT a free-distribution license like would be required for a "true" Open- Source license (as per the official definition), I do not know what license to use. Would creating my own be the best choice? Note that I do not have a lawyer nor do I have the resources to obtain one. It appears on its face to be closest to a "visible source" license, but those do not seem to accommodate the "approved derivative work" aspect I want. Here is the license as I have it so far. Is this a valid format and are these terms permitted to be used in this manner?                   /*******************************************************************************         * @author Reika         *          * This code is the property of and owned and copyrighted by Reika.         *          * Any and all users are permitted to use the source for educational purposes, or to create derivative works         * for private use only.         *          * Unless given explicit written permission - electronic writing is acceptable - no user may redistribute this         * source code nor any derivative works.
