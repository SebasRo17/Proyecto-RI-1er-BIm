I would like graphs to appear somewhat larger in my notebooks (running v8.0.4 on OSX 10.8.2). Naturally I can specify `ImageSize` in each individual plot, or drag each plot to the size I want. But how can I just make it happen all the time? This legacy documentation indicates `ImageSize` typically defaults to 288px but shows no way to change that default. Checking the frontend preferences also comes up empty. How can I get bigger plots by default?
