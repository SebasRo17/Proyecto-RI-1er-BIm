Let $A∈R^{4×4}$ be a non-invertible matrix, with $2$-dimensional kernel. How can I compute the inverse of the restriction of $A$ on a subspace where it is invertible: $A^{-1}v \,\,\,\,$ where $\,\,\,\,v∉kerA$ I have the matrix $A$ precisely, but the vector $v$ depends on some parameters and is really complicated, but I know that it doesn't belong to the kernel. More precisely               e=0.001;     A={{e, -1, e, 1/2+e}, {-e, 1/2, -e, -e}, {e, 1/2+e, e, -1}, {-e, -e, -e, 1/2}};     NullSpace_A={{(1-2e)/(2e), 1, 0, 1}, {-1, 0, 1, 0}};      The above NullSpace_A was computed using the function NullSpace of Mathematica, so we see that $$kerA=span\\{(c_0,1,0,1);(-1,0,1,0)\\}=\\{(c_0α-β,\,\,α,\,\,β,\,\,α) \,\,/\,\,α,β∈R\\}$$ where $c_0$ is a given constant. P.S. Maybe this is trivial, but I am new to _Mathematica_.
