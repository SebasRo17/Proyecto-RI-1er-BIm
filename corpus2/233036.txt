I have learnt that if there are more columns in table, then get those results using join query. How to decide the max number of columns in table? How feasible is "Join Operation" if too many table involved? **And if join operation hurts performance** Can we define all columns in one table to get rid of join operation? I found many developer telling me that its better to have few extra columns if needed frequently in most database operation than to have multiple tables.
