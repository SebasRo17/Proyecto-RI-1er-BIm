Quite often I find myself referring in text to objects which have strict naming conventions e.g. Java objects, processes, services. I find myself in a dilemma over how to pluralize these names. It seems wrong to pollute the meaningful name by adding an 's' - or worse, a plural that modifies the rest of the name like SomethingUtility -> SomethingUtilities. What if someone does a text search looking for the name? Or cuts and pastes from my comment to search through a log file? I have sometimes resorted to an ungrammatical apostrophe, but this can confuse plural with ownership. Is there any better solution?
