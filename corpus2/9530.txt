How can I align tick labels so the tick label text ends centered under the data point? Of Course it works fine with a rotation of 90 Degrees, but not with 45 or similar angles. I see an example of how to do this charts but not with Plot or ListPlot http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/2656/388               d = Table[n, {n, 10}];     xticks = Table[{n,      Rotate["The y value is " <> ToString[n], 45 Degree]}, {n, d}];     ListPlot[d, Frame -> True,       FrameTicks -> {{Automatic, None}, {xticks, None}}]      ![Labeled list plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/npnsK.png)
