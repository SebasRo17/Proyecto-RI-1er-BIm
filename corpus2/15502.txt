When do you start writing your Exception Handling Code? When do you start writing Logging Statements. For the purpose of elaborating this question, let us assume that we are on .NET platform with log4net logging but feel free to answer in a generic way. Solution: A Windows Forms Project. Projects: UI, BusinessRules, DataHandlers So, do you go about writing your DataHandlers which does your Data Manipulations such as Create, Read, Update, Delete first. Then follow it up with your Business Rules And then your UI or any other permutation of the above. Test your Application for Functionality. And _then_ start writing your Exception Handling Code and _finally_ your Logging code? When is a right time to start writing your Exception Handling code? PS: In the book Clean Code, they say Write your **try-catch-finally** block first. That, prompted me to ask this question.
