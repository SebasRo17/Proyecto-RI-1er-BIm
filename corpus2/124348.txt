As a student programmer, I only have very limited knowledge of the workings of much of the consumer software. I would love to one day be able to reverse engineer software to learn what makes it tick and implement it in different ways. My real question what is the general process that reverse engineering requires. I am aware that this is very broad. I was just wondering the tools such as decompilers that people use.
