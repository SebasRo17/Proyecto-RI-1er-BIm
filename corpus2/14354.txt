I have written a For loop in my Mathematica notebook. This For loop, when activated, will generate a sequence something like:                   0.1         Null         0.3         0.4         Null         0.6      etc. The output solely consists of numbers and nulls. **What I want to do is plot these values generated by my For loop, using ListPlot**. However, to use ListPlot I must first have a list, and the output of my For loop isn't in the form a list. How can I convert the output of my For loop into a list? (Note: My For loop generates a large amount of numbers, so it is too laborious to manually enter these values into a list one by one). My For loop is:                   For[i = 0,  i <1000,  i++,            Print[                  For[n = 100, n < 600, n++,                     If[Abs[Nest[f, i*StepSize1, n] - 0.51304]<0.0001,                         {Print[i* StepSize1], Break[]}, {Indeterminate, Break[]}]                     ]                  ]           ]      StepSize is pre-defined, by the way.
