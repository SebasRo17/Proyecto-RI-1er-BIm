I've always had this struggle to get folks to update their issues, both at my company and at work. I've had a few cases when people actually do it from the goodness of their heart, but ~70% of the time I have to be chasing people down. Being the one that generally does some or other form of management (I am firstmost a developer), the main reason I try to give is that I don't want to be chasing people down and interrupting to query on progress, but I don't think in the end people mind that much being asked. In some rare and extreme cases I end up updating their tickets (when I need to create reports). So, have you ran into this problem?, how have you encouraged developers to update the issue tracker frequently?, what degree of success have you had?
