I'm using the `Table` command to generate a list of values:               FullForm /@ Table[10. - x, {x, 2.7, 2.8, .1}]      and I get the following result:               {7.3`,7.199999999999999`}      Why do I get `7.199999999999999'` instead of 7.2? Moreover, if I try to calculate the `Complement` of `{7.2}` in this list, I get `{7.2,7.3}`, which is not what I would expect. At the same time, using the `Complement` option `SameTest->(#1==#2&)` gets me `{7.3}`. This behavior is observed in Mathematica 7/8/9, and even on WolframAlpha. P.S. I know that using `Range[7.3,7.2,-0.1]` would be clearer, I'm just curious about the aforementioned problem.
