I'm studying BIBD(Balanced Incomplete Block Design) and want to draw some graphs by coloring their blocks in different colors, respectively. A block is a collection of edges (or vertices). For example, (10,4,2)-BIBD, with blocks               {{0,1,2,3},{0,1,4,5},{0,2,4,6},{0,3,7,8},{0,5,7,9},{0,6,8,9},      {1,2,7,8},{1,3,6,9},{1,4,7,9},{1,5,6,8},{2,3,5,9},{2,4,8,9},      {2,5,6,7},{3,4,5,8},{3,4,6,7}}      can be drawn by               GraphPlot[{0 -> 1, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 0 -> 1, 1 -> 4, 4 -> 5, 0 -> 2, 2 -> 4,                 4 -> 6, 0 -> 3, 3 -> 7, 7 -> 9, 0 -> 6, 6 -> 8, 8 -> 9, 1 -> 2,                 2 -> 7, 7 -> 8, 1 -> 3, 3 -> 6, 6 -> 9, 1 -> 4, 4 -> 7, 7 -> 9,                 1 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 8, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 5, 5 -> 9, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 8,                 8 -> 9, 2 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 7, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 5, 5 -> 8, 3 -> 4,                 4 -> 6, 6 -> 7},        Method -> "CircularEmbedding",        BaselinePosition -> Top,        VertexLabeling -> True,        MultiedgeStyle -> 0.04]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aBpcq.png) (This example is from the text book _Combinatorial Design - Stinson_ ). I want to draw each block in its own individual color. How do I do that?
