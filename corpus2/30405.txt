Imagine we have a list with some hierarchical structure:               list = {{{2,3},{2,4}},{{{3,4}}},{{5,6},{7,8}}};      Which we then flatten to some level in order to process the data points:               Flatten[list,1]     >> {{2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8}}      We then do "something" to change the value of the elements in the list, without increasing or decreasing the number of elements:               >> {{5*10^9, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {191991, 6}, {7, 8}}      Can we reverse the flattening procedure to go back to a list of the form:               >> {{{5*10^9,3},{2,4}},{{{3,4}}},{{191991,6},{7,8}}};
