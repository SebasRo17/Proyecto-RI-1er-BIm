I've asked a question here before about multiple writers on a FIFO, and I know now that the write is thread safe as long as I write less than the PIPE_BIF, here is the link for that limit. What about read? what if have two(or more) readers in multiple threads for reading from the same fifo, do I need locks here? or all I need is to read less than the PIPE_BUF? BTW, I'm talking about Linux FIFO, And I'm using C.
