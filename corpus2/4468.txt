Is there any way to securely stick a notebook window (e.g. a dialog) on screen that it cannot be closed/removed/hidden by any of the standard OS shortcuts, like `Alt``F4` or `Alt``Tab` under Windows? The ideal solution would allow me to specify a range of key-combinations that can be used, and block any other, though it would not be a problem to block _all_ keyboard input, as there are other ways to close a modal dialog. I have a feeling that this cannot be done entirely from under _Mathematica_ , though I'll give it a go. You can experiment with the following example:               CreateDialog[{TextCell["Click OK to close"], DefaultButton[]}, Modal -> True]      **Purpose** : I'm doing some experimentation on humans in _Mathematica_ , and since this species is known by its extensive explorative behaviour (i.e. pushing all buttons) and the ability to ruin everything, I want to make the experiment-gui foolproof so that they can't remove it from the screen. This is a must, as it could happen that they hit `Alt``F4` (accidentally or intentionally) and quit at the middle of a test, rendering any saved data useless.
