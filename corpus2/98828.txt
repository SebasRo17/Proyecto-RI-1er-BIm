I am searching for some charts, tables and other empirical evidence on how a typical programmer's activities are distributed (per day, per project, etc). Example activities are programming, phone calls, reading documentation, writing documentation, fixing bugs, requirements engineering, tests, meetings, etc. In particular I am interested in the amount of time a programmer actually works on _executable_ stuff.
