I'm an apprentice and I've been on a couple of training courses in C#, I understood the concept of c# programming and covered inheritance etc, but when I've came to code for my coursework "I've got to make a shopping basket and save the contents into a .txt" I just seems to not know what to do, as if I've got no idea how to program. I've got a copy of the end product apart from it's altered so we can't copy it whole, so I've just been taking code and not really understanding everything that's doing on. I just seem as if I don't want to program as if I'm in a different mind set, I just seem to go blank at the thought of creating a simple program from scratch and have no Idea where to start? Any one got any ideas for help ? :) thx
