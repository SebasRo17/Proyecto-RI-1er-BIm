I am a small business owner and my sole developer quit. Cold. I am not a coder. He developed an existing application that works .net, c#, javascript, sql, visual studio based, 250,000 lines of code. Needs to evolve to v2.0. I have zero documentation. Is there a product that can read the code and generate documentation that would significantly reduce the learning curve for my new development team? What is it? If not, suggestions?
