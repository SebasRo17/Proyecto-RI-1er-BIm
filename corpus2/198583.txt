Some days ago I saw in this site the algorithm below to convert color images to binary images and I used it in my application (with some small changes). However, I need to know what is the name of the implemented algorithm and, if possible, some references about it. Thanks in advance!               public static boolean[][] createBinaryImage( Bitmap bm )     {         int[] pixels = new int[bm.getWidth()*bm.getHeight()];         bm.getPixels( pixels, 0, bm.getWidth(), 0, 0, bm.getWidth(), bm.getHeight() );         int w = bm.getWidth();              // Calculate overall lightness of image         long gLightness = 0;         int lLightness;         int c;         for ( int x = 0; x < bm.getWidth(); x++ )         {             for ( int y = 0; y < bm.getHeight(); y++ )             {                 c = pixels[x+y*w];                 lLightness = ((c&0x00FF0000 )>>16) + ((c & 0x0000FF00 )>>8) + (c&0x000000FF);                 pixels[x+y*w] = lLightness;                 gLightness += lLightness;             }         }         gLightness /= bm.getWidth() * bm.getHeight();         gLightness = gLightness * 5 / 6;              // Extract features         boolean[][] binaryImage = new boolean[bm.getWidth()][bm.getHeight()];              for ( int x = 0; x < bm.getWidth(); x++ )             for ( int y = 0; y < bm.getHeight(); y++ )                 binaryImage[x][y] = pixels[x+y*w] <= gLightness;              return binaryImage;     }
