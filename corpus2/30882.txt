I am interested in constructing a bifurcation diagram for parameter a in the dynamical system given in the code below. I want to see how parameter changes affect the stability of the system. The answer in bifurcation-diagrams-for-multiple-equation-systems does not apply for Mathematica 8. The following code include the system of differential equations:               Derivative[1][x][t] == -10^12 x[t] - y[t],      Derivative[1][y][t] == x[t] - 10^12 y[t] + a z[t],      Derivative[1][z][t] == -a y[t],      x[0] == y[0] == 0, z[0] == 1      Thanks
