I'm studying R, and am very impressed by the simplicity of some commands and in the way R handles temporal data. For example, in R, if you have some one- dimensional temporal data, you can easily transform it into a data series using:               url<-"http://www.massey.ac.nz/~pscowper/ts/cbe.dat"     data<-read.table(url,header=T)     timeSeriesCol1=ts(data[,1],start=1958,frequency=12)      In _Mathematica_ , we have the new `TemporalData` function, but to do the same as in R, the code is a little clumsy due to the lack of frequency option or an equivalent. See the code:               url="http://www.massey.ac.nz/~pscowper/ts/cbe.dat";     data=Import[url];     timeSeriesCol1=TemporalData[Rest@data[[All,1]],{{1958,1},DatePlus[{1958,1},{Length[data],"Month"}]}]     DateListPlot[N@timeSeriesCol1["Path"]]      The part `{{1958,1},DatePlus[{1958,1},{Length[CBE],"Month"}]}` is very inelegant and `DateListPlot` does not directly recognize the object (and you need to convert it to a number, which look likes a bug). Does anyone have a clue for a more elegant way to handle this using `TemporalData`?
