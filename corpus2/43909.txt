Sorry if this is a duplicate, but I have a variable called `H`. `H` is some complicated function of `s`. Now I want to make this variable `H` into a formal function `f[s]`. I've tried just doing               f[s_] := H      But that doesn't seem to work. `H` was initially a value in a `InputField` and the type on that `InputField` was an `Expression`. Any ideas on how I can turn this into a proper _Mathematica_ function?
