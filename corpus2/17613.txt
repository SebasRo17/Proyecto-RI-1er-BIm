I'm having some problems with slow Mathematica code... I'm basically doing a computation that's is expected to take 3 hours (!) in my Core i7 with 4 processors... I'm basically computing an index (of stock market options implied volatilities), with my data coming from a (359,835 x 17) matrix, which I call **CompleteMatrix**. However, I know that my code is too basic, and I'm trying to find some ways to improve it with **ParallelMap** / **ParallelTable** or even **Compile** (don't know how though). And, more interesting, for some calculations **Map** is faster than **ParallelMap** and **Table** is faster than **ParallelTable**... Here are some samples of my code and how long it takes to calculate:               PregaoMC[v_] := CompleteMatrix[[v, 1.]];     n = 359835;      (Is there any way to improve this function with Compile?!)               In[17]:= DeleteDuplicates[Table[PregaoMC[x], {x, 2., n}]];//AbsoluteTiming     Out[17]= {0.824105, Null}          In[18]:= DeleteDuplicates[ParallelTable[PregaoMC[x], {x, 2., n}]];//AbsoluteTiming     Out[18]= {1.080137, Null}          In[19]:= DeleteDuplicates[Map[PregaoMC, Range[2., n]]];//AbsoluteTiming     Out[19]= {0.707090, Null}          In[20]:= DeleteDuplicates[ParallelMap[PregaoMC, Range[2., n]]];//AbsoluteTiming     Out[20]= {1.022129, Null}      Another calculation which is taking a lot of time is:               AtivoMC[v_] := CompleteMatrix[[v, 2.]];          In[32]:= Select[Flatten[Position[{Table[AtivoMC[x], {x, 1, n}]}, "StockName"]], # > 1 &]; // AbsoluteTiming     Out[32]= {0.887112, Null}          In[33]:= Select[Flatten[Position[{Map[AtivoMC, Range[ 1., n]]}, "StockName"]], # > 1 &]; // AbsoluteTiming     Out[33]= {0.793101, Null}          In[34]:= Select[Flatten[Position[{ParallelTable[AtivoMC[x], {x, 1, n}]}, "StockName"]], # > 1 &]; // AbsoluteTiming     Out[34]= {1.150145, Null}          In[35]:= Select[Flatten[Position[{ParallelMap[AtivoMC, Range[ 1., n]]}, "StockName"]], # > 1 &]; // AbsoluteTiming     Out[35]= {1.040132, Null}      Apparently these calculations don't take too long, however I have to do them several times, for several different stocks and several different days... Is there any way to improve whis code with Compile? Thank you! Rodrigo
