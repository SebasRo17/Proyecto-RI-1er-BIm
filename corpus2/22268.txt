From time to time I get this error message when I save my .m file in Wolfram Workbench: _LinkObject::linkv: Argument Null in Null is not a valid LinkObject_ I can't really figure out what causes this message exactly, maybe when I save my file after deleting or adding a lot of characters but I'm not sure. I'm not calling Java at all from my program so maybe that comes from Workbench itself? It happens that Workbench freezes and closes from time to time without warnings at all, so there might be something broken in there... And now just after Workbench freezes one more time, I relaunch it and get the message: _"Could not open the editor: The editor class could not be instantiated. This usually indicates a missing no-arg constructor or that the editor's class name was mistyped in plugin.xml."_
