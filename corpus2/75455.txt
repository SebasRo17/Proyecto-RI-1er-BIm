I have 1 year and 6 months of experience on Android. All of my experience has been into application development. Recently I have got offers from two companies. One is offering me a profile to work on application layer and other is offering a profile on Android middleware. Can you guide me which would be better? Is middleware development better than application layer development from the career perspective in terms of money and other opportunities? I am really in a big dilemma. Any help would be appreciated. Also if someone can tell me as to who will earn more-a five year application layer guy or a middleware guy? Thanks a lot in advance.
