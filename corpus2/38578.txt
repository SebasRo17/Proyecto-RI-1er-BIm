I am trying to make a surface graph on Mathematica using Excel Data. My x-axis should be the "A" Column and my y-axis should be the "1" Row. The box of data in between the x-axis and the y-axis should be my z-values. I'm not familiar with data importing Excel data to make these types of 3-D graphs. I was wondering if someone could help me out? Thanks! ![What I am Trying to Graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JA3dy.png)
