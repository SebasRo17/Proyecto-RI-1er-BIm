I'm planning on writing an open source HTML parsing library in .Net so that I have a project out in the wild when I start looking for developer jobs. Now, in my Masters program I started learning Java and found that I like it as well and was also thinking that I could also write the library in Java at the same time, to improve my Java skills at once. Would that be advisable? Does the fact that Java and C# are similar languages play into the decision to do two libraries at once? My main concern is instead of having one great library, I end up with two mediocre libraries. Being new to development, are there any other pitfalls I should look out for? Also would having the library on the JVM and .Net work to my advantage any more than just one of those platforms when it comes to future employers? I did see this question, but my motivations aren't the same and I plan on releasing this code as well, so I'm not sure if the answers will differ.
