I am trying to examine the properties of the following product for a given tuple $\vec \lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_n)$, then the product is as follows: $$ \dim \Gamma_\lambda = \prod_{i < j} {(l_i^2 - l_j^2) \over (m_i^2 - m_j^2)} = 2^{n-1} {\prod_{i < j} (l_i^2 - l_j^2) \over (2n - 2)!\cdot (2n - 4)! \cdots 2!} $$ where $l_i = \lambda_i +n - i$ and $m_i = n- i$. The function `dim_calc(n, lambda)` might take a tuple `lambda` and the length of the tuple, `n`, and then define the $l_i$ and $m_i$'s accordingly? I'm not really sure how to write this though...any hints for this symbolic computation? Thanks!
