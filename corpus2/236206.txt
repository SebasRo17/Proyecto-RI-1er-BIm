What is the difference precisely between an Embedded System (like Tegra, Raspberry or similar) and a Microcontroller? I understand there is a difference but I'm finding it difficult to understand. What does one intent when he says: "are you able to develop for microcontrollers"? Does it mean simply program in C/C++ for an embedded system or something more? What is the difference between programming in C/C++ for Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers? If I commonly program for ARM in C/C++, can I say that I can program microcontrollers or can I apply for such a job?
