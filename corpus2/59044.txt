My initial question deserves some explanation. I signed up for an account at learnersparadise.com. After signing up I couldn't login so I opted to use their "send password" feature. Upon receiving my password in my email I confirmed two things A) They trimmed off 2 of the last digits of my 10-digit password without informing me and saved it that way in their database B) my password is not saved in their database using a one-way hash since they were able to email me my password. I'm quite certain that both of these are perfectly awful programming practices. I suspect that the mentors/trainers at learnersparadise are not necessarily affiliated with the website and it's design since they are basically people like you and me (hopefully more skill than me) who have signed up to become mentors. However, I'm still uncertain about signing up for training/mentoring at a site that uses such poor programming practices themselves? Would you let learnersparadise poor programming practices affect your opinion of their trainers/mentors?
