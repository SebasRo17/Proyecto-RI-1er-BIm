My question is that is the P part of the LAMP really necessary? I will have the database and I can connect to it via the appache http so why will I need php/python in the server side (if it is a really simple set up) also from a seperation of concern it might be more robust at least thertically to leave the P out of the equation and to use LAM only. What are you guys think? I need to build this as a linux server in order to backend mobile ios and android. cheers
