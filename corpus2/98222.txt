In a month, I have to hand in a Java project. I have to make an e-shop program which has two types of users (admin and normal users). The admin can add/delete/restock stuff in the shop while the normal user can watch products and buy them. In order to buy a product the customer has to make an account in that e-shop. I'm not the best Java student but I've made a plan of what classes I might use and this kind of stuff. But what I can't really figure out is how to:   1. make the users register to the e-shop   2. make different menus without doing a GUI, we are allowed to make a GUI but it is only a bonus and is not really required. By the way I haven't ever tried making a GUI.   3. how to make the program save things like the username and the products on the hard drive. I don't want anyone to do this for me, I just need some guidance, just to find out where to start and what I should look for.
