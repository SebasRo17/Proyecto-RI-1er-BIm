I am looking for the name of the box in the Box Language of Mma making integrals, such as those shown in the image below ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5t7Nx.jpg) as well as of the sign of the partial derivative. I understand that I can get it through MakeBoxes trick, but it would be nicer to have special operator for such a purpose. The code with such an operator will be more concise.
