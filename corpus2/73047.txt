I'm currently designing a protocol for internal use, so it doesn't make a huge difference in this particular case, but it got me wondering: Is it better for a method to accept a single object of a specific type, or an array of objects, with the documentation specifying the type it will contain? Obviously the array allows for greater flexibility in calling the method, but specifying a type gives the programmer greater clarity as to what the method will be doing. For example, my protocol has a single method (so far), called recieveDroppedItems:. It needs to accept either one or multiple NSURLs, which point at the files dropped on the sender. Thanks in advance for any advice you have! :D
