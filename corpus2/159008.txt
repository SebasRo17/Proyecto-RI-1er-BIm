I'm a web development intern working on a small PHP application (just a few pages with a little database access) which has fast become a couple of very non-DRY, non-OO, individual scripts. A framework seems like overkill (maybe not?) but I was wondering what some best practices for code / folder structure and general solo, small-scale PHP development. What is your starting point for a small application such as this?
