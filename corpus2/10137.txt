Suppose I have a string `str` that contains only whitespace-delimited real numbers:               str = " 0\t1.46604\t1.44829\t12.0546\t1.57075\t1.64044\t12.0489\t1.58142";      I would like to convert `str` to a list of real numbers. One way to accomplish this is to split the string using `StringSplit` and then `Map` the function `ToExpression` across the resulting list:               Map[ToExpression, StringSplit[str]]      which gives the correct output: > {0, 1.46604, 1.44829, 12.0546, 1.57075, 1.64044, 12.0489, 1.58142} But, is there a cleaner or more efficient way to do this? I will be converting about 100,000 strings `str` -- each of which are approximately the same length as the example `str` above -- which will be read as records from a text file (i.e., using `OpenRead` and `Read`), so it would be nice if the method is relatively efficient. Thank you for your time!
