I truly acknowledge that _Mathematica_ is not supposed to do this modeling, but it is what is at fingertips for the time being and, according to the Documentation Center, _Mathematica_ somehow does it when rendering a 3D object: > "Directional lighting" simulates a uniform field of light pointing in the > given direction.

The only thing I want is to take out that brightness number from processing of graphics and now I wonder does anybody know how to accomplish that?
