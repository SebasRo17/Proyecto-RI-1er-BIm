..by this I mean a logic handler for a chess game. Basically validating a move and checking if somebody has won. Now ignore the complexity of the game(if you can..) I'd like some sort of psuedo code on how it would look using callbacks in javascript. For arguments sake imagine once a move is completed in the browser it sends a JSON object of the piece that has been moved and to which space it has been moved to. On the server we have access to a JSON object which contains data for the complete board. With this information I expect to pass it in to my engine and determine from the output if the move is valid..and if so is it a winning move? I'm not looking for any specific logic on how to determine a move in chess -> just a kind of psuedo example/template of the flow of the game using the above paragraph as a guide to what must be done. The reason for this is I would like to understand how callbacks can be used to produce something of this nature as opposed to synchronous code.
