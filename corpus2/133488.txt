There's a lot of documentation out there on how to _use_ the 'jvisualvm' profiler, but very little (if any) real-life advice on how to _analyze_ all those charts and dumps. I'm just a little overwhelmed by all the graphs and having trouble making sense of it all. I know this is sort of a monolithic-type question, but there _has_ to be a way to condense its _typical_ uses into a fairly concise list - finding memory leaks, zombie threads and such. What specifically are some of the common analyses for VisualVM?
