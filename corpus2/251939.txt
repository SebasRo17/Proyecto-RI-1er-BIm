If you have a constructor that takes a lot of parameters, like this:                 public OrgUnitsHalRepresentation(List<OrgUnitSummaryHalRepresentation> orgUnitSummaryHalRepresentationList,       int count, int providedCount, int total, int page, int filterLimit, boolean hasNextPage, boolean isDefaultCount)      You can use a separate class that takes nothing in the constructor and set these parameters using setters and pass in this into the constructor instead:               public OrgUnitsHalRepresentation(Pagination(Name of pattern) p)      Does this have a name so that I can use it in my class name?
