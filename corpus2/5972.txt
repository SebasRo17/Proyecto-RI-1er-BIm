Maybe a top 2-3 if there is some contention. (Perceived popularity is enough) Thus Far: **C#** - Visual Studio, SharpDevelop **Java** - Eclipse, NetBeans, IDEA **Objective-C** - Xcode **Delphi** - RAD Studio **Object Pascal** - Delphi, Lazarus **C, C++** - Visual Studio, Vim **PL/SQL** - RapidSQL, Oracle SQLDeveloper **PHP** - Eclipse, NetBeans, Nusphere PHPed **Actionscript (AS2, AS3)** - FlashDevelop **Flex** - Flash Builder 4 **Python** - Eclipse, IDLE **Perl** - Padre **Common Lisp** - Lispworks, Emacs **Ruby** - TextMate **Haskell** - Vim **Fortran** - Vim **Visual Basic** - Visual Studio
