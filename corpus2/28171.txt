I have loaded data from a CSV file which i want to plot in a `BarChart` but i only wish to plot `0:100` instead of the entire dataset. Is there a way to set a range for the `data`? So far i am just plotting everything:               data = Import["/Users/matek/NetworkTest/without_use_in_and_out.csv", "Table"]          Show[         BarChart[data, ChartLegends -> {"TX", "RX"}],         ImageSize -> 600     ]      `data`:               {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6},...}
