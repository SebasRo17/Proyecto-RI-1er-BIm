I am confused about paying subversion. Our company has a solution and wants to manage the version of the source. Our company product is obviously commercial product and not open source. & it's not for distribute purpose.   1. Can I use the subversion without payment for the company?   2. Should I open the source of our solution because we use the subversion free?    3. Is there any obligation followed by this?   4. Exactly, in which case do I have to pay for using the subversion? Thank you.
