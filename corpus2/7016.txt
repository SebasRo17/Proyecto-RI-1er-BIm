I'm not very experienced with Fourier Transforms, so there may be something inherently wrong with attempting to do this, but how can I make the discrete Fourier behave like the continuous FourierTransform? What is the equivelent way of doing the following with Fourier?               Func[x_] := Sin[x];          LogLogPlot[      Abs[FourierTransform[Func[t] UnitStep[t], t, \[Omega]]], {\[Omega],        1*^-1, 1*^5}, PlotRange -> All]      ![Fourier Transform of Sin\(x\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6LdcJ.png) My unsuccessful attempt at this is the following:               Func[x_] := Sin[x];          ListLogLogPlot[      Abs[Fourier[Table[ Func[t] UnitStep[t], {t, 1*^-1, 1*^5} ]]],       PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9qSGV.png)
