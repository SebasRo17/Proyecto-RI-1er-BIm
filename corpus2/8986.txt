This isn't about the typical naming conventions, where to place your comments, should we use regions, etc. This is about a coding standard that discusses specifics on how a programmer should design his applications. Stuff like: (on a .NET app and not in the exact wordings)   * Make as few classes possible   * Classes should do as much as their real world counterparts can   * Modification is better than extension   * One DLL per category (One library for email functions, one library for File related functions) Everyone's had their experience with bad code and possibly bad design, but what if you were placed in a team (leaving is not an option) where they had design standards that just don't feel right. I'm unsure how to respond professionally when I feel like I'm dying inside whenever I'm asked to code this way.
