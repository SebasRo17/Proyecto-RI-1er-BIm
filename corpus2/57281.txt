I'm having trouble calculating the median of a `Dataset[]` in Mathematica 10. The situation is as follows. Consider a dataset that was defined as follows:               dataset = Dataset[{<|"a"->1,"b"->2|>,<|"a"->3,"b"->4|>}];      The mean and variance of columns `a` and `b` can now be calculated by               mean = dataset[Mean, {"a","b"}]     var = dataset[Variance, {"a","b"}]      That works pefectly, but               med = dataset[Median, {"a","b"}]      returns a `Failure[]`! Somehow, `Median[]` is not compatible with a list of associations as its argument and the other functions are. Can someone explain why this happens and maybe help with a solution?
