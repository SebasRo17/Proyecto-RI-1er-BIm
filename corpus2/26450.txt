I am trying to change order of a table.               n1 := {6.`, 3.31791383741595`, 2.549684922097378`, 2.2444170593578363`,     2.109892159984955`, 2.0489264006542918`, 2.0214035890309514`, 2.009186379955868`,     2.0038735759286572`, 2.0016085340677456`, 2.0006594467480365`, 2.000267493804639`}          ListLinePlot[n1, DataRange -> {0, 11}]      This is for the graph with the datarange from 0 to 11. However I want to get the graph start at -11 and end at 0. (From the table, n1, 6 is at 0 and 3.3179 is at -1, 2.54 is at -2,...,2.0002674 is at -11.) Is there any good way to do this?
