I have a project which uses a large number of LGPL, Artistic and other open- source licensed libraries. What's the canonical (i.e. the "standard") way of acknowledging multiple sources in a single project download? Also, some of the sources I've used are from sites where using the code is okay, but publishing the source isn't. What's the usual manner of attribution in that case, and the usual manner of making the source available in an open- source project?
