I have AS3/PHP background and some basic understaning of enums from C++. Saying shortly: I read this: > http://haxe.org/ref/enums > > http://haxe.org/doc/cross/more_on_enum And though - good heavens! What the sorcery is this??? Enum Constructors Parameters? Enum Type Parameters?? Could someone explain with working examples (preferable on http://try.haxe.org/ ) the concept of enums in HaXe for someone coming from languages like PHP and AS3? What I tried? Firstly I wrote this:               enum Color3 {         Red;         Green;         Blue;         Grey( v : Int );         Rgb( r : Int, g : Int, b : Int );         Alpha( a : Int, col : Color3 );     }      Then this:               Color3.Grey(5);      And I don't know what to do with this further, and don't know where to search.
