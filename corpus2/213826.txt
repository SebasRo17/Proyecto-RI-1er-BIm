I'm starting to develop a new program. It's basically a database interface, run a few queries, show the data in a nice way and be able to easy input new data (like this website). Thinking about which programs I use daily I realise that only my web-browser is a GUI program, the rest is TUI (in this case TUI is Text User Interface, as in ncurses). So I plan to write this in ncurses with a vim/mutt-like interface. This program will only be used by experienced users and speed is much wanted. I've found one study about this: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2655855/ All other studies I've found has only looked at novice users and for them GUI is better. For an experienced user that will work daily with the program what is best? This is sligthly similar but the difference is that this question was about a non-interactive program:   Is the development of CLI apps considered "backward"?
