I, for the life of me, cannot find any literature on this, simply because I have no clue how it is called. I want to learn how to implement a payment option that consists of paying with your credit/debit card directly without the use of a third party like paypal. This is what I am talking about ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9gYOn.png) Can you please give me some information about how this payment method is called and possibly some articles I can read up on. Thank you!
