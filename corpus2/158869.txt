I have been recently asked in an interview if I know about any garbage collection algorithms. I knew what garbage collection is but I never really thought about learning about garbage collection algorithms since as a developer I never had to worry about it and the Garbage collector does all the hard work for me. Do you guys think that Java developers should know about garbage collector algorithms? If yes can you tell me which ones should I look into?
