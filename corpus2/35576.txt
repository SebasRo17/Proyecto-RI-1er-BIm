While I am able to use `InstallJava[]` (or `ReinstallJava[]` for that matter) with a TCP/IP link to a JVM running on the same system just fine (as shown on page 110 of the jlink user guide, e.g. for debugging purposes), I am not able, however, to get `InstallJava[]` working with a TCP/IP link connecting to a JVM running on a remote system. When I try to have `InstallJava[]` connect to the remote JVM, the link itself seems to connect fine (because when I kill the _Mathematica_ process, the remote JVM exits as expected), but `InstallJava[]` never returns and cannot be interrupted/aborted. (Tried this with links from Linux 64 ( _Mathematica_ ) to Windows 64 (jvm) and Linux 64 to Linux 64. Used JVMs installed with Mathematica and others. No problems with underlying link communications, remote or local. Just `InstallJava[]` hangs exclusively with remote JVMs.) Questions:   1. Is this not supported?   2. If it is supported, how to troubleshoot? Thank you!
