What things need to be considered for a Website that contains International strings, for instance Simplified Chinese and English mixed. UTF8 seems to me a natural choice, including a meta tag. Still, some users may only see white boxes. What is the best solution do deal with this? Currently I am thinking to provide an alternative image-based rendering, or even make it default. But IMHO this seems a weak solution. Or I could tell the user which OS/Browser combinations are known to work but such a list would probably be endless. Update: it's a Chinese learning site, most users will not have visited Chinese websites before
