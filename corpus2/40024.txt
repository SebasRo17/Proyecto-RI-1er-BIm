I have a function $O_{2}$ with boundary conditions $O_{2}(r_{o}) = p_{o} $ and $O_{2}(g) = O_{2}'(g) = 0$. I plot it using the solver code below;               a = 5*10^-7;     po = 100;     omega = 3.0318*10^7;     ro = 5*10^-6;     Do2 = 2*10^-9;     ko = 1;     con = (a*omega)/(Do2);     g = 110*10^-6;          s = NDSolve[{D[r*O2'[r], r] - con*r*((O2[r])/(O2[r] + ko)) == 0,      O2'[g] == 0, O2[ro] == po}, O2, {r, ro, g},       Method -> {"Shooting", "StartingInitialConditions" -> {O2[g] == 0, O2'[g] == 0}}];          Af = Plot[Evaluate[{(O2[r]) /. s}], {r, ro, g}, PlotStyle -> {Red},        PlotLegends -> LineLegend[{"Solution"}]]      This produces the following solution; ![110 solution](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mnC5W.png) Now, we can see that at $g$, the solution doesn't reach zero. Let's choose a different $g$ - let's say $g = 130 \cdot 10^-6$ - then we get the solution; ![130 image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DRUKe.png) Which does indeed seem to hit zero. I'm trying to find the approximate value of $g$ such that the initial conditions are satisfied and $O_{2}(g) = 0$ - So I have two questions; (1) Is there a automated method of doing this such that the "ideal" value of $g$ is found to satisfy the equation? (2) Is there a way I can get or extort the solution value at a point of my choosing? For example, is I want to find $O_{2}(g/2)$ or $O_{2}(g)$ , what would I have to enter it? I have, for example, tried               s[g/2]       and this merely tells me the solution is an interpolating function, not the specific value of it. All advice welcome, thanks in advance!
