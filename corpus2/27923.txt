Lets say I have a file named `file.m` that contains:               test[] := (       Print["test"]     )      How would I go about extracting the function declarations in such a file consistently as a list? I have figured out how to extract the data without having it execute.               Import["file.m", "Text"]      This is my current code.               Cases[      FullForm[       MakeExpression[Import["file.m", "Text"], TraditionalForm]       ],      SetDelayed[x__, y__] -> f[x, y]      ]
