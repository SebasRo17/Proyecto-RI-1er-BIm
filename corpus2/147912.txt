I need to process 2 million messages per second (perhaps in a scale out configuration) and route each message to a N delegates or multicast delegates. **Question** How should I structure my application in C# so that I can achieve the best performance when receiving the message, and routing it to the correct delegate? **Additional Details** Each inbound message has the following properties in the format of a JSON array:   * Customer   * Category   * TopicID   * DateTime   * Data[] Each message will be processed by a delagate function that is interested one or more of those properties. **Simple examples of delegate processing needed:**   * A customer counter function may count the quantity of messages per customer,    * A category counter may count the quantity of messages that counter   * A customer-counter will count messages unique to that customer.
