This question is focused on **extracting the advantages and disadvantages of using Web based Frameworks** : such as Cake PHP, Zend, jQuery, ASP.NET). This question is completely _language agnostic_. Let me start with the notion of _"Standing on the shoulders of Giants_ ". ## Advantages:   * **Empowers Developers** \- by taking features that would have previously have taken 100's of lines of code and compressing them into one simple function call empowers developers to integrate more complex features into their Web Sites.    * Allow for **Quicker development** of applications - this is very relevant for people that need websites created in a very small window (has anyone any examples of this?)   * **Lower Costs** \- allows programmers to pass cost savings onto the customer, a whole new range of customers generated that wanted a website but previously could not afford the higher development costs. ## Disadvantages:   * **Lost Understanding** \- by relying on the features of a framework a developer is in danger of loosing understanding on how things work (underneath the hood).    * The configuration cliff - once you go further than the configuration of your framework your productivity drops right off, it can be difficult to implement features outside of a frameworks configuration.    * **Developer tramlines** \- you (the developer) has to do things the way that the developer want you to do things.  I wonder what people make of my points, and whether anybody disagrees with them? Also if people have additional points I would be grateful.
