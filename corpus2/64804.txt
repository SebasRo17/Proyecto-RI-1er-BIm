I have a number of machines running VS, and each has a slightly different config - display styles, installed plugins, source control extensions, project templates, service packs and so on. Not only is this annoying when moving from machine to machine but also I have no real way of wiping an install and starting again. I know I _could_ use a virtual machine but I really don't like the added overhead of VMs. What I'm looking for is a way of rolling up a Visual Studio install, with all the extra plugins into an installable package so I can just define it once and deploy it everywhere. Is this possible?
