When looking through job postings I noticed some employers listing MCSD or MCAD certifications. Are these certifications correct ones for web developers? Which track should one choose?. I also noticed looking at MCSD that most certifications are "retired". So how are suppose to take the exam it it's no longer offered?? thanks
