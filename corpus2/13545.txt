I have an array `s5` I want to plot using `ListContourPlot`               s5 = Import[       "https://github.com/downloads/stackmma/Attachments/data_13545.m"];     ListContourPlot[s5, InterpolationOrder -> 6, ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap",          ContourLabels -> True, ColorFunctionScaling -> True]      ![Mathematica graphic with labels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZmGGp.png) Note, the blue spot in the corner. Turning off `ContourLabels` gives               ListContourPlot[s5, InterpolationOrder -> 6, ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap",        ContourLabels -> False, ColorFunctionScaling -> True]       ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OoQpV.png) The resulting images have entriely different colors. I cannot understand why adding `ContourLabels` should change the colors, and for other data sets it seems to not do that. I ended up using a workaround that involved making one of the pictures mostly transparent and overlaying it with a picture that had the right colors. This I think is actually the simplest workaround proposed so far:               wl = ListContourPlot[s5, InterpolationOrder -> 6,      ColorFunction -> (Append[ColorData["TemperatureMap"][#1], 0] &),      ContourLabels -> True, Contours -> contours];          nl = ListContourPlot[s5, InterpolationOrder -> 6,      ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap", Contours -> contours];     Show[nl,wl]
