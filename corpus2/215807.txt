Whenever I read something or hear someone talking about HTML5, CSS and JavaScript support, they always refer to Internet Explorer with the version number such as Internet Explorer 6, and Internet Explorer 9. But they only refer to Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari and others without version numbers. Shouldn't they also specify the version number in which certain web technologies are incompatible for other browsers instead of just Internet Explorer?
