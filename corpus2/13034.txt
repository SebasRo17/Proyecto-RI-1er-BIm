Recently I worked with a group to create a logging system for tutoring labs to track Tutor hours, and usage of the labs. We had to change the design a fair amount to be in compliance with FERPA. My question stems from the curiosity that in my course of study there has never been a real mention of how people in this field have to deal with complying with the law in their work. So I would like to know how much programmers have to consider the law in the work they do.
