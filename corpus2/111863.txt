I hear a lot from TDD practitioners that one of TDD's advantages is that it forces developers to follow SOLID principles (Single responsibility, Open- closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion). But as for me it is enough to just write some tests (unit test primarily) to understand it is important to follow SOLID (and thus create testable architecture). Does TDD force developers to follow SOLID more actively than just writing unit tests?
