`Composition` is sometimes useful for clarity of a code. For the same purpose I try to `Apply(@@)` functions as often as it is possible. **My question is how to combine** `Composition` with `Apply`, or, to be more precise, is there any simpler way than one I'm going to show (there is no `Composition` :)):               Fold[#2@@#1&, arg, {f1, f2,...}]      alternatively:               Fold[Apply[#2,#1]&, arg, {f1, f2,...}]      So for **example** :               Fold[#2 @@ #1 &, {1, 2}, {{##} &, {#2, #1} &, {#1, 0, #2} &}]      > >     {2, 0, 1} >
