I have a relatively simple web application that is written in Python using the Flask microframework. I've really enjoyed Flask's ease of use, however, as the app has grown larger it has started to become unwieldy having all of my actions (and utility functions) in a single file. My views.py is about 700 lines of code and I'd really like to break things out into more discrete units. How should I restructure my code?
