I am thinking about starting a small project and I want to make its versioning with git. Bitbucket seems a good option for me with their free plan. I want to use it as the main tool for working with git since they nice tools, like web-interface, Mac OS client, and so on. But in order to have higher protection from any accidental damages that can be caused by using third-party service I want also to install git on my NAS as a second back-up copy of the repository. Now my question is, whether it is possible to create a repository on two different hosts and then keep them in sync? For example once per week I update the repository on my NAS to what is on the Butbucket. And in case something happens with Bitbucket, I still have full repository with full history of development on my local NAS storage. And is there a way to import existing repository with full history to another git-service?
