This creates a manipulate object show two static plots,               pic1 = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, Pi}];     pic2 = Plot[Cos[x], {x, 0, Pi}];     CloudDeploy[Manipulate[pic, {pic, {pic1 -> "sine", pic2 -> "cosine"}}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GlLWE.png) Is it possible to replace the static images above with gif animations, so that it shows different gif animations as I select different buttons? For example, I tried something like               pic1 = Table[Plot[Sin[n x], {x, 0, Pi}], {n, 0, 2, 0.1}];     pic2 = Table[Plot[Cos[n x], {x, 0, Pi}], {n, 0, 2, 0.1}];          CloudDeploy[Manipulate[ExportForm[pic, "gif"], {pic, {pic1 -> "sine", pic2 -> "cosine"}}]]      but it doesn't work. This is what I get from the cloud ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uzdau.png)
