I have to work a lot with three functions $\;o_1(t), o_2(t), o_3(t)\;$ that are solutions to the certain system of differential equations:               Halp = {       D[o1[t], t] == o1[t]*o2[t] + o1[t]*o3[t] - o2[t]*o3[t],        D[o2[t], t] == o1[t]*o2[t] + o2[t]*o3[t] - o1[t]*o3[t],       D[o3[t], t] == o1[t]*o3[t] + o2[t]*o3[t] - o1[t]*o2[t]}     sol = DSolve[Halp, {o1[t], o2[t], o3[t]}, {t}]      The system cannot be solved explicitly with _Mathematica_ , but I do not need the solution. What I would like to do is computing higher order derivatives assuming that $o_1(t)$, $o_2(t)$, and $o_3(t)$ are solutions to the above system. How could I tell _Mathematica_ to do this?
