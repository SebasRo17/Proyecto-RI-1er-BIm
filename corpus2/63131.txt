I don't specifically mean date-related issues like 2038, but more generally, bugs that fit the pattern:   * A generation ago, programmers tended to write code that ass-u-me-d X, which was reasonable at the time.   * But circumstances have changed, and now X is a common source of problems that need to be fixed. For example:   * X = "Memory is too expensive to justify storing all 4 digits of the year. Don't worry about 2000; that's a long way off." (broken by Y2K)   * X = "Who needs `size_t`? We can just use `unsigned int`." (broken by 64-bit systems)
