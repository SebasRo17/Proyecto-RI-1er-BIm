I personally stay awake late at night, coding and enjoying working on personal projects. My other colleagues also feel the same and like coding at night. However, it's not about being passionate about personal hobbies, rather, I really feel that I'm more productive at night. I think that there is something about night, maybe its darkness, maybe its silence, maybe another attribute that makes developers become more productive. Is there some truth to this? Why do some developers believe that they are more productive at night? Is there any scientific proof to justify this proposition? Maybe something like "in night, monitor light is less harmful" or "the natural air in night has more oxygen, thus is more suitable for thinking process", or anything like that. > ### Moderator Note: > > The question is asking for **scientific proof** and otherwise cited > information on this subject.
