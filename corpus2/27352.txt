I am just getting started with _Mathematica_ and need help plotting tangential vectors to a 3D parametric function. I know how to do this in 2D but am unsure how to do it in 3D. Maybe I am using the wrong functions? Anyway, here is my attempt :               Clear[t, x, y, z, P];     x[t_] = 2 Sin[t];      y[t_] = 6 Sin[t/2]^2;     z[t_] = 3 Cos[t];     P[t_] = {x[t], y[t], z[t]};           curveplot = ParametricPlot3D[P[t], {t, 1, 6}, PlotStyle -> Thickness[0.01]];          velocity[t_] = {x'[t], y'[t], z'[t]};     velvector[t_] := Vector3D[velocity[t], Tail -> P[t], VectorColor -> Blue];          velocityvectors = Graphics3D[Arrow[{{P[t]}, {velocity[t]}}]];          Show[curveplot,          Table[velocityvectors[t], {t, 1, 6, (6 - 1)/10}],          PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}]
