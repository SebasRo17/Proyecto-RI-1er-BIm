I have a GUI with a number of `TabView` and other `Manipulate` controls. Sometimes clicking from one tab view to the other can take a while, and I would like to have a global "Please wait" indicator. So one way is to implement it for each button or slider, but I would essentially like to have a visual indicator that will show if any cell in my notebook is being evaluated. Any ideas or suggestions? (Have searched for answers here but I only found those related to progress bars for a specific calculation)
