I have an exam question that I am unsure of the answer. The question is: > In organisation X valid user names have the following structure. The user > name can be either the employee’s name followed by a colon and then the > department name or a string of one or more alphanumeric letters consisting > of lower case, upper case letters and digits from 0 to 9. All user names end > with a period ("."). The employee’s name is expressed as ﬁrst name followed > by an underscore and then the surname. The ﬁrst name and the surname must > begin with an uppercase letter and is followed by an arbitrary number of > lower case letters. All department names are an arbitrary number of lower > case letters. Express the language for valid user names as a regular > expression. The answer I have is, > [A-Z][a-z]+"_"[A-Z][a-z]+":"[a-z]+"." | [A-Za-z0-9]+"." The next question is: > Construct a deterministic ﬁnite state automaton for recognising the user > names as described in Question 1. For which I have this:![finite automata](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4ukWq.jpg) I am under the impression this is wrong because [A-Z] is a subgroup of [A-Za-z0-9] and a DFA cannot have the same symbol going from one state. Does anybody have an idea how to solve this / is it correct? Thanks !
