For my research work I need to put a comparison of different community detection algorithms. Instead of implementing all those algorithms once again, I would like to use the methods already provided by Mathematica. Would anyone help me in figuring out the different algorithms used in FindGraphCommunities. I found there are 6 methods to get the community structures. Among the 6, the method "Centrality" possibly use the same algorithm by Girvan and Newman in 2002 with edge betweenness centrality. And the method "Modularity" works similar to the algorithm proposed by Newman and Girvan in 2004. However, there are different version of the same kind of algorithms in the literature. I would like to put proper citations for these algorithms. How could I find the details of the implementations of all 6 algorithms. Please provide me with the information. Also, please provide me with the link of full documentation of the Function FindGraphCommunities with all the options available to each method. I could not able to find options in the reference documents. Thank You.
