I just started learning the ASP.NET MVC framework and it's very different in architecture from regular ASP.NET development. Transitioning from windows forms to WPF was nice, and seemed a way forward in technology. But, while learning ASP.NET MVC, I don't feel the same, I am unable to convince myself that MVC is better than WebForms. It just seems that they made some tweaks to the already available web framework and adopted the MVC architecture from some other language. Is ASP.NET MVC the step ahead in development? Should I learn and develop my future projects based on this platform and architecture? To me, it just seems like Microsoft is throwing a new architecture just along with WPF or copying Ruby on Rails. WPF seems promising and great while ASP.NET MVC just makes you crumb-some _[sic]_. They have removed the controls, thrown a new control system and data-packaging, and it's all together an extreme change to WebForms. I realize that with MVC you have great freedom in the testing aspect, but I don't believe that this makes a lot of difference in small website or projects. If you ignore the value of testing, What are your takes on this?
