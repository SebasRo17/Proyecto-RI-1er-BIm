In his answer to this question, Leonid helped me find a way to programmatically generate contexts for holding sets of symbols with the same names. Perhaps a simpler way is to use `DownValues` so:               dataRaw["Paris"] = Import["Paris.csv"];     data["Paris"] = Differences[dataRaw["Paris"]];     dataMax["Paris"] = Max[dataRaw["Paris"]];          dataRaw["Madrid"] = Import["Madrid.csv"];     data["Madrid"] = Differences[dataRaw["Madrid"]];     dataMax["Madrid"] = Max[dataRaw["Madrid"]];      lets me make a plot using               ListLinePlot[data /@ {"Paris", "Madrid"}]      and can be implemented with a simple function               importCity[cityName_String] := (         dataRaw[cityName] = Import[cityName ~~ ".csv"];         data[cityName] = Differences[dataRaw[cityName]];         dataMax[cityName] = Max[dataRaw[cityName]];     )      Other than cluttering everything with a lot of `[cityName]`, are there hidden perils to using `DownValues` in this way? Is there some disadvantage to storing every `dataRaw` as `DownValues` of the same symbol instead of individually in multiple contexts?
