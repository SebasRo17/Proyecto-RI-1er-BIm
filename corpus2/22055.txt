I want to compute a multidimensional table in Mathematica and write it to an external file. Here is a simple example. I have three lists `x`, `y`, `z` and the output include all possible combinations of sums. In the output file, I want 27 = 3x3x3 rows. Each row should have four values: `x`, `y`, `z` and `x+y+z`. Here is my code.               x = {1, 2, 3};     y = {4, 5, 6};     z = {7, 8, 9};     output = Table[x[[i]] + y[[j]] + z[[k]], {i, 1, 3}, {j, 1, 3}, {k, 1, 3}]     sfile = OpenWrite["C:\\Temp\\test.txt"]     For[i = 1, i <= 3, i++,      {For[j = 1, j <= 3, j++,        {For[k = 1, k <= 3, k++,          Write[sfile, x[[i]], y[[j]], z[[k]], output[[i, j, k]]]]}]}]     Close[sfile]      The problem is there is no space in the output file. So I get something like               14712     14813     14914     15713     15814      but I actually want               1 4 7 12     1 4 8 13     1 4 9 14     1 5 7 13     1 5 8 14      I need help to get the format above. I am quite new to Mathematica and don't know much about other functions. I am OK with any functions as long as they can generate the output I want. Thank you.
