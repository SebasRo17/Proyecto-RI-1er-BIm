I'm attempting a simple Plot that I want to add asymptote markers to:               Module[{p, g},      p = Plot[1/Sqrt[1 - x^2/4], {x, -2, 2},        PlotRange -> {{-2.2, 2.2}, {0, 5}}];      g = Graphics[{Line[{{2, 0}, {2, 5}}], Line[{{-2, 0}, {-2, 5}}]}];      {p, Show[g, p]}]      With just the plot I get my tick marks ![with ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dg6nb.png) However, when I combine the plot and the pair of lines: ![no ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TSzLw.png) the tick marks on my axes disappear? Observe that it even the vertical ticks are gone, so this isn't an issue of them being pushed off the combined image.
