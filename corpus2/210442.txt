My team are developing Umbraco websites and looking to improve the automation of our database deployment. Currently we have automated builds and deployments of our source code using Kiln and Team City, but cannot work out how to handle the database deployment. The challenge is applying changes made in the development environment, while keeping new database content that has been added in the live environment via the CMS. Currently our changes are deployed using courier manually, but we aim to convert this into a '1 click deployment' which is what we desire for running our automated tests and ease of deployment. How can we automate this without wiping new content added in the CMS?
