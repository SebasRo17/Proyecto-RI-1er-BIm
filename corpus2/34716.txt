I have a group of lists, for example:               lists = RandomInteger[10, {100, 2}]      > >     {{6, 7}, {7, 4}, {3, 3}, ....} >   Now, I want to multy-set as follow:               ls1={6,7};     ls2={7,4};     ,,,,     lsX=lists[[X]]      How to do that by a simple way? Thanks. * * * UPDATE: How about lsX but not ls[X]? I have tried to generate a list of names:               names=ToExpression["ls" <> ToString@# & /@ Range[100]]      How to multy set then?
