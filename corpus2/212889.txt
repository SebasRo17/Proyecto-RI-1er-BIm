Before I'm flamed, I'm just a beginner in programming. I have been learning Python for about 1 week by myself. I have a real problem to solve: **Goal:** The fastest route through a pathway. **Problem:**   * Walk forward to get to the goal. The pathway is 128 steps.   * Walking 1 step increases the danger value by 113   * If the danger value is over the limit then there is a fight. The fight takes 15 seconds to win.   * The limit is randomly assigned on each step.   * The danger value resets to 0 after a fight. **Here's the essence of the problem though:** There are two possible options if there is a fight:   * The fight can be escaped. Escaping takes 2 seconds. But does NOT reset the danger value.   * Accept the fight. Resets the danger value.   * The higher the danger value, the higher the chance of getting a fight. I've written the code to take one step. And I've written the code for the relevant randomness of the danger value, etc. I've even made a graph that shows exactly the pathway and potential fights, with the respective limits. This graph shows what happens when you accept every fight (don't escape): ![Fighting Pathway](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7p4Nv.png) **Being self-taught, I just don't know how to write a search algorithm for finding the quickest way through a particular route.** I believe I need to write a **backtracking algorithm** ; essentially a kind of **brute force**. I just don't know how to translate it from english into code. It's been around 4 days of just thinking about this, and I cannot write anything that expresses the even attempts to solve the problem. Any books or advice on how to even start solving this? As I've said, I have all of the code for what happens on each step (here: http://pastebin.com/LnV4h9NV). I just don't know how to even begin trying to brute force/search.
