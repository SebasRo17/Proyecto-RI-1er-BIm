I would like to create a CDF document that uses dynamic content. The example code is:               fun=x^2-1;     InputField[Dynamic[fun]]      And what I get is $Aborted instead of interactive document. How to make a useful document? EDIT: What I am really trying to do is to make a CDF document in which the given function is plotted. Initially the function is x^2-1, but the user should be able do input any function.
