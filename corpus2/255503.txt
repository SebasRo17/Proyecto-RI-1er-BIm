I had to implement some code which traversed a small object hierarchy to fetch a value and display it in a TextView object (this is Android / Java). I had to do this _6 times_ to populate _6 TextViews_ for various values in the object hierarchy. My implementation was **Implementation B**. But upon review, my colleague disagreed and certain that **Implementation A** was the way to go. I believe that my version is not just cleaner, but also less error prone as I could easily miss something as a developer. Could you provide me with your opinion, with pros and cons for both of these implementations? ### Implementation A:               if (house != null && house.getLounge() != null && house.getLounge().getLetter() != null)     {         String myValue = house.getLounge().getLetter();         textView.setText(myValue);     }     else     {         // Do nothing, or maybe make textView hidden.     }      ### Implementation B:               try     {         String myValue = house.getLounge().getLetter();         textView.setText(myValue);     }     catch (NullPointerException e)     {         // Do nothing, or maybe make textView hidden.     }
