We're evaluating a set of requirements for a customer who wants Liferay which mainly has AAA and Web CMS requirements, and allowing user to upload their own content. Also all inetgration is via web services. However there is no need for other features such as actual "portlets", i18n, mashups, skins, themes, tagging, social presence, no collaboration etc So we feel we can do this as a standard JEE web app and not use Liferay (or any other portal product) since these are overheads we dont need. The customer feels the **Web CMS requirements + user upload justify the "portal" product.** Can anyone help me with some points to convince the customer? Assuming our point of view is right.
