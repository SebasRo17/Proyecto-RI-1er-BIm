I've read a couple of definitions and discussion on REST and/or RESTful applications, but I still do not understand the real meaning of it. I usually work with the apps which either fetch data via GET or send data via POST to some web service (usually a PHP script) which then either get data from the database or do writing into the database. Now, is this a RESTful app? If not, what would be a RESTful app? What is difference between RESTful concept and the concept I worked so far with? Please explain via an example. Also, someone is talking about the REST and someone about RESTful apps. I found that the REST term refers to the theoretical concept, while RESTful is used when we talk about the specific app. Is this right or there are real differences between REST and RESTful apps?
