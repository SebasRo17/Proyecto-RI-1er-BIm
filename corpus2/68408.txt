The developers of these frameworks must be generating some kind of money, no? They aren't all just regular old joes with full-time jobs developing web- frameworks in their spare time for the love of programming? Do the sites themselves generate any kind of income? Or do they make money off giving talks? Writing books? Would like to see some numbers/statistics if you have any.
