What is the best way to generate a list of all factorizations of some number $n$? I'm quite new to Mathematica so this might be obvious. I have been trying some basic stuff with `For`-loops and `FactorInteger` and `Divisors` but I'm not really getting anywhere. There must be some elegant way of doing this. An example of the result I'm after, for $n=60$: $$\{\{2,2,3,5\}, \{4,3,5\}, \{2,6,5\}, \{2,3,10\}, \{2,2,15\}, \{12,5\}, \{2,30\}, \{3,20\}, \{4,15\}, \{6,10\}, \{60\}\}.$$
