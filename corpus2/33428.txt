Can I define a relation between variables, such that the expression will also be evaluated (then assuming all indices are equal) when no index is given? $$ x_i + y_j = \delta_{ij} \stackrel{Mathematica\ recognizes \ then\ that}{\Rightarrow} x + y = \delta_{ii} = 1 $$ $$$$ $$$$ _INITIAL QUESTION WAS:_ I define a relation for the annihilation and creation operator $a_i$ and $a_j$ like this $$[a_i, a_j^\dagger] = \delta_{ij}.$$ The commutator can be defined with the Quantum Notation package. I want to make the index ($i$, resp. $j$) **optional** , such that Mathematica recognizes that $$[a, a^\dagger] =1,$$ i.e. it assumes $i=j$ if no index is given. Is there a way to do this?
