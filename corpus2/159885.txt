If you have a class which inherits from two distinct classes, does not this mean that your subclass automatically does (at least) 2 things, one from each superclass? I believe there is no difference if you have multiple interface inheritance. Edit: To be clear, I believe that if subclassing multiple classes violates SRP, then implementing multiple (non-marker or basic interface (e.g. Comparable)) interfaces violates SRP too.
