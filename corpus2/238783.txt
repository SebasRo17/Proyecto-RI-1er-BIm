While reading about strict mode on MDN I really was surprised to read the following near the end of the page, quote: > Browsers don't reliably implement strict mode yet, so don't blindly depend > on it. Strict mode changes semantics. Relying on those changes will cause > mistakes and errors in browsers which don't implement strict mode.

As far as I understand it, strict mode is a redused set of "nonstict" mode, thus I can't imagine situation where strict code can't run correctly in a nonstrict browser. So, the question is this statement really makes sense? Is the any situation where strict to "nonstrict" switch will make code invalid?
