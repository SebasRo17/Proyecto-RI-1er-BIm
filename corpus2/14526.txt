I understand that I can use `Chop` to force a very small number to be treated as `0` and can use `PossibleZeroQ` to as a way to test whether such a number might effectively be `0`, but applying `Chop` every time a small number is close to zero in order to "make it be" zero is tedious and error prone; while `PossibleZeroQ` seems to have its own ideas about what constitutes `0`. Are there global settings that will let me   * treat every number smaller than some specified value as `0`, effectively applying `Chop` automatically to all results; and   * specify how large a number `PossibleZeroQ` should recognize as `0`?
