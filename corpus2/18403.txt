Dose anyone take notes in a technical class using a _Mathematica_ notebook? If anyone does, how does it compare to paper and are there useful commands? I have a hard time remembering ctrl/alt/esc commands. I normally type faster than I write but typing equations is a pain. Especially considering that _Mathematica_ (without Wolfram|Alpha) doesn't show the steps to a solution, which I sometimes want to copy down.
