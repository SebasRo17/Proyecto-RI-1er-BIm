How can I sort the following list:               list={{1498, 1495}, {1498, 1733}, {1553, 1552}, {1552, 1495}, {1733,1776}, {1776, 1553}};      such that the next group contains one element of the first. The result would be:               {{1498, 1495}, {1552, 1495}, {1553, 1552}, {1776, 1553}, {1733,1776}, {1498, 1733}}          Sort[list,SameQ]       does not work completely as the results are still incorrectly sorted. > >     {{1498, 1495}, {1498, 1733}, {1553, 1552}, {1552, 1495}, {1733,1776}, > {1776, 1553}} >   It does not matter if the elements are in increasing order. An equally acceptable result would be               {{1498, 1495}, {1498, 1733}, {1733, 1776}, {1776, 1553},{1553, 1552}, {1552, 1495}}
