I want to map a function over a matrix of rank n, for example:               PercentChange[v_?VectorQ] := Differences@v/Most@v*100     PercentChange[v_] := Map[PercentChange, v, {Length@Dimensions@v-1}]          m = N@Range@10;          PercentChange /@ {m, {m, m}, {{m, m}, {m, m}}}      This works as expected. Now, as a lazy beginner, I thought that I could get rid of the duplicate definition of "PercentChange" and simply state:               PercentChange[v_] := Map[PercentChange, v, {Length@Dimensions@v - 1}]      However, to my disappointment this didn' t function because "Map" doesn't accept a level {0} parameter:               Map[Differences@m/Most@m, m, {0}]*100      On the other hand, this functions in all cases:               Percent2[v_] := Map[Differences@#/Most@# &, v, {Length@Dimensions@v-1}]*100      How would you write this without duplication and slot-notation?
