I would like to do a following: I have a fairly large data set, say billions of rows, each row having multiple binary columns. I would like to generate estimated stats with some certainty about those rows. Stats would have a simple form: how many rows are there with columns 1, 7 and 10 set. Obviously going through entries is not a viable solution. To be honest, I would prefer not touch the data set at all when I have to provide an estimation. I would like to precompute everything and then used precomputed data to answer questions about the data set. Do you know of any algorithms/techniques of solving such problem?
