My manager wants me to refactor a **gigantic amount of terribly-coupled, macroed, full of private namespace methods, hierarchy-perverted (even 10+ levels of inheritance)** code which hasn't been (indeed) designed with a "whole-vision" concept. I tried to explain to him that this code needs to be rewritten, not just refactored but he didn't listen and stated explicitly that **I need to refactor it.. somehow**. I could dive into all the "dealing with legacy code" books but I think nothing useful would come out. How can I convince him that a rewriting, instead of a refactoring, is actually needed?
