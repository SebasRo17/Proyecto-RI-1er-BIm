I have a rather big expression which contains many sums of form `q x + w y`. I know that `y` is much smaller than `x` and i want to omit it where possible, namely if both `q` and `w` are integers. So i apply the replacement rule               q_?IntegerQ x + w_?IntegerQ y -> q x      However this rule obviously doesn't work if either `q` or `w` (or both) is equal to unity because `FullForm` of `q x` contains `Times` and one of `x` doesn't. So to get replacement done i need to use the ugly set of rules               { q_?IntegerQ x + w_?IntegerQ y -> q x , x + w_?IntegerQ y -> x , ... }      and in place of dots there are two more rules with `w` and both `w` and `q` omitted. So the question is whether it is possible (in general) to somehow simplify this ugly set to anything more simple.
