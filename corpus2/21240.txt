In The Road to Reality there are plots of surfaces that use a variable density of dots to suggest curvature. You can see some examples here and here. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1LDCz.jpg) ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QI0z4.jpg) I suppose they've been drawn by Penrose, but to me they look like something that could be quite easily generated algorithmically---say, starting from image of a surface of 3D object with lighting. Some of my initial attempts at this below. First, for a sphere:               ImageAdd[#, ColorNegate@ImageEffect[#, {"SaltPepperNoise", 0.5}]] & [       Graphics3D[{GrayLevel[.25],           Specularity[White, 1], Sphere[]},           Lighting -> "Neutral",           Boxed -> False]       // Rasterize]      ![output of the above code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bAacN.png) And for a more complex object:               Binarize@ImageAdd[#, ColorNegate@ImageEffect[#, {"SaltPepperNoise", 0.78}]] & [       Graphics3D[         {GrayLevel[.25], Specularity[White, 1], KnotData[{6, 2}, "ImageData"]},         Lighting -> "Neutral",          Boxed -> False]]      ![output of the above code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QWUSu.png) I'm decidedly inexperienced at using all of _Mathematica_ 's image processing functions, especially compared to others on this site! I've been reading the many answers to this related question to get ideas. **So I have two questions.** Firstly, can some of you do better than I at generating these diagrams (I'm sure many can!), or perhaps point me in a fruitful direction? Second, suppose I have a series of frames of surfaces that together make a smooth animation. As soon as I "Penrose-ify" them, I expect that the placements of the points in the frames will sort of "quiver" from frame to frame (if there is a random component in how they are placed), thereby breaking the continuity of the animation. How can one get around this? I ask this question in hesitation after reading this on meta. I hope it will not be judged too similar to other questions or uninteresting. Personally I can see many semi-practical applications of automated ways to generate diagrams like these, e.g. for illustration purposes. Many thanks in advance.
