I work as a kind of mixture of a Scrum Master and a team lead. In my team I have the problem that one of the members delivers bad quality. The code he produces is difficult to understand, difficult to maintain by anybody else than the guy himself. The solutions are more a "hack" (if not a botch) than a conceptual or elaborated work. And what is worst: he doesn't see it. He thinks he is a quite good programmer, when all the other team members are constantly complaining about his code - when he's not there (which is not so difficult since the guy works remote most of the time). They all avoid to tell him what they think about his work because they don't want to offend or demotivate him. What should I do?   * Try to tell him what the others think in 1-to-1 meeting? But I don't find it right to say "the others are complaining" when the others are not there and don't bring up their examples.    * Set up a team meeting and encourage the other members to tell what they think? But this feels like a tribunal to me. (And all against one is not fair.)   * Something else?
