I have many project ideas and unfortunately all require a team of at least 3-5 developers. I've started a project by myself too many times without reaching the end. The point is to involve people in the project with the hope of giving them a share if the project succeeds. I know that the last point however is the hardest and most complicated one. I’m hoping to get some answers that point me in the right direct.   1. Where do I find people that may be interested in the idea?   2. How do I convince people in my network to put time in new ideas? **Update:** Regarding "projects" I'm referring to projects in which I have initiated during my career as developer. Of course it wouldn’t be serious of me to launch several simultaneous projects and complain about not to be able to deliver them to the end.
