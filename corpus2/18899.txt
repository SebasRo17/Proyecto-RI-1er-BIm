I'm looking to solve the following cubic equation for x: $\beta\, x^3 - \gamma \,x = c$. I have plugged in some sample values ($\beta = 2$, $\gamma = 5$ and $c = 2$). When I try to solve this equation using mathematica's Solve[] function, I get one real root and 2 complex roots. However, I have tried plotting the equation for these values, and can clearly see there should be 3 real roots. How can I obtain them. I am sure the roots are real, but mathematica gives me back complex roots. Thanks.
