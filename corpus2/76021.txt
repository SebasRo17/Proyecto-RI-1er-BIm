I program on my desktop in my office, but also sometimes at home in a different room on my laptop, and even away from home. What I need is a system that automatically or on-demand syncs my work from one to the other, at need. I do not have a home network setup, and although I guess I could do it, that would be a question for another board, perhaps. I've thought about some kind of system that would keep the source code in the cloud, but I don't know enough about this to get started. I need a kind of free or cheap way to do this. I work in .NET (Windows Phone 7, in fact).
