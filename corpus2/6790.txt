I am running a Linux box and as usual the documentation for this type of box is not great. I am trying to open up and extract and possibly include later on information from a "mdb" file. The file size is not big, but bigger than 100 MB. Unfortunately, the `Import` function does not work at all for certain requests. It takes too long and then the Kernel breaks down/quits while trying to process the import request. Is there any other way ? I understand there is some sort of way to do things using OBDC. Unfortunately, the documentation is written for windows machines and I have little experience in handling database connectivity with OBDC under Linux. Ideas greatly appreciated.
