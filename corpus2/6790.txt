I've recently read through Joel's guide to finding great developers, and I feel really strongly that I am _smart_ and _get things done_. The problem is, I didn't learn how to _get things done_ until about halfway through college, so my GPA is less than stellar. Additionally, I've got a few other things going against me: late into the job market (~30), no internship, state college instead of university, and when I graduated, I pretty much had to take the first job that offered. With all of these things piled together, my resume (the first step to getting a job), is not terribly impressive. What can I do to let people know that I'm a great developer and would complement the best companies in the world?
