I'm pretty sure there has to be a more idiomatic way of writing this:               (defn update-2nd-level-vector       [map index value]       (assoc map :key1 (assoc (get map :key1) :key2 (-> map (get-in [:key1 :key2]) (assoc index value)))))      Example of its working:               => (update-2nd-level-vector {:key1 {:key2 [0 1]}} 0 1)     {:key1 {:key2 [1 1]}}
