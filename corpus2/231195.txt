According to the Pragmatic Programmers, code should be for abstractions, while configuration and details should live in metadata. Rails seems to diverge dramatically from this pattern. Much config is done in code files such as `application.rb`, `routes.rb` and the various `environment.rb` files, while other types of config is done in yaml files (e.g. `database.yml`). What is the thinking behind this design decision?
