I want to know what architectures are commonly used in developing PHP web applications. I've used MVC earlier for J2EE, but in J2EE everything is separated as part of the language itself (pojo/servlet/jsp). I don't know how to utilise MVC in PHP as the separation of concerns is code- only. Can we use MVC in PHP as well and if so, how? Are there any other architectures that I should be aware of?
