I am am trying to learn JAVA on my own. In one book I am reading the author says there is no convention for writing a correct setter. His example would go something like this:               public void setUnitCost(double inUnitCost) {          unitCost = inUnitCost;     }      However, when using Eclipse, and tell it to create getters and setters it does this:               public void setUnitCost (double unitCost){          this.unitCost = unitCost;     }      My question is which way is better? Does it make a difference in the programming world? What exactly is the difference between the two?
