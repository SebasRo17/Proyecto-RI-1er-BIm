I have seen examples of web design teams sitting under marketing with the development being done in IT. How do other IT depts and marketing ecom depts share the workload for web development in other companies citing any pros and cons for the different possible structures? Personally having any type of development resource sitting outside of IT just sounds like a bad idea.
