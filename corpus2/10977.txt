I'm running a sum, the elements of which are calculated by calling functions that I wrote. The only issue is, I've implemented this pretty stupid solution where I have 4 or 5 (nested!) if statements to handle cases where mathematica returns `Indeterminate` when it should be returning "0". What I'm essentially looking for is some kind of "If" statement that returns either 0 if Mathematica returns `Indeterminate`, and evaluates to something I have implemented already otherwise. Any ideas? I've tried using combinations of the `If`/ `Check` functions, without too much luck. **Summary:** I'm trying to write an `If` statement that checks for `Indeterminate` values, and returns one of two values. Any ideas?
