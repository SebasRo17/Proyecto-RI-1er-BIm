I'm working on an application written in PHP using OOP principles. The classes in my application usually represent a table in the database; for instance, 'student', 'teacher', 'class', 'schedule', etc. As the application gets more and more complex, I start running into situations where it feels like writing a new query would be more efficient / faster than reusing the lower level objects + methods than I've already written. What's the standard philospohy when it comes to this? Is it handled on a case-by-case basis? Do you **always** reuse your code to prevent repeating yourself, even at the cost of the efficiency gained from one database query?
