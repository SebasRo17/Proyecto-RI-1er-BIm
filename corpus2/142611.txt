We have an Azure service (web role) that heavily depends on the database. For offline development/testing, we'd like to have the app+db run offline within the emulators. Running the webrole itself within the emulator is straightforward but doing so for the Azure SQL isn't so. What is the simplest way to ensure that the cloud Azure SQL database and the emulator/local Azure SQL database are in sync? We can afford some level of staleness for simplicity of sync operation (meaning it's ok for the local copy to be a few hours stale versus mirroring every write as soon as it happens) Thanks
