I'm currently developing a replication system to keep data in-synch between an arbitrary number of servers. Some of these servers exist in one cluster on one LAN. Others exist somewhere else in the world. I'm wondering what are the pros/cons of different paths that we choose to flow replicated data on between servers? In other words, what are the different strategies to load balance the replication process ?
