As a relatively new computer science student, I am trying to find my niche within this broader field. My main goal is not academia but, well, a job. As such, I want to choose a specialization or two that will provide two benefits: 1\. Interests me. I will find the work to be engaging and enjoyable. 2\. I can actually get a job doing it. My more rational brain is encouraging me to do something like database work or web development, seeing as there will likely be an ongoing need for that type of work. On the other hand, I am finding myself attracted to things like artificial intelligence and machine learning, as they both seem really fascinating. I could see myself doing some really exciting things in that area. However, I often get the impression that it's more of an academic thing than something with actual industry demand. (Though that's just my immediate perception.) Do you think an AI specialization is likely to open up sufficient job prospects. Although it seems interesting, I'm the kinda person who is fine with doing work that isn't necessarily that interesting, and I'm more concerned with job availability and security, at this point in time. Your thoughts are appreciated...thank you!
