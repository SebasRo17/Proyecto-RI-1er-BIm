I am going to be releasing some software soon which will require users to run a local database. There is a competitor in the space that is doing the same thing and they have a pretty sophisticated database schema that they use. Their software is commercial but the database schema is completely viewable once installed. What's the legality of basing my product of the same database schema and just potentially renaming columns and tables and maybe removing one or two things?
