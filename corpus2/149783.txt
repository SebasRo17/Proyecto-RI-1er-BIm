I just wonder if having two conditions in an IF statement executes faster than having it separated into two like these: ### Single Statement, two conditions               if ( (conditionA == true) && (conditionB == true) )       //Do something;      ### Two statements               if ( conditionA == true )       if ( conditionB == true )         //Do something      Or are they just the same when compiled? Both of them have the same code, only the `if` statement part is different. There won't be any other code under `conditionA` in the second example (two statements), only afer `conditionB`. Does this have an effect on PHP and JavaScript?
