I am in the last year of my BS in Engineering - Information Technology degree. Some things I have noticed while looking for jobs is that larger older corporations want you to know java or c# for their existing enterprise level systems, while most high-tech, startup or mobile centric software companies want you to know the latest languages, technologies and have experience with open source stuff. The startup/mobile company appeals more to me. The companies usually seem to have more young people working for them and advertise how fun it is to work there. I was thinking about trying to get a developer position in either mobile or web development fields. My main problem is that I have no experience working just as a programmer. I have had an internship that dealt mainly with systems administration work, along with learning all of the corporate business side of things and helping the marketing team with their web page. Now in my last semester I am rushing to try to put together a portfolio. I have a wide variety of small projects in PHP, ROR, C#, along with hybrid type html/css/javascript mobile apps. None of these projects are what I consider to be completed and polished. I have a wide range of half done web apps. Would it be a bad idea to but unfinished projects in a portfolio on a resume? I am really tempted into getting more into iOS objective-c development but would it be to late at this point? I know that it is important to master something but I only have a few months until graduation, would it be better to just go back and finish a small php app or something similar? (that essentially isn't really anything but a personal project). I feel I have a good understanding of core principles but don't know how to best allocate my time. Any advice would be helpful, Thank You.
