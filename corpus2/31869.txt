After applying `FindHamiltonianCycle` to a graph, one generates output that looks like the following:               {{1<->2,2<->3,3<->4,4<->5,5<->6,6<->7,7<->8,8<->9,9<->10,10<->11,11<->12,12<->13,13<->14,14<->15,15<->16,16<->17,17<->18,18<->19,19<->20,20<->21,21<->22,<<3670>>,77<->75,75<->73,73<->71,71<->69,69<->67,67<->65,65<->63,63<->61,61<->59,59<->57,57<->55,55<->53,53<->51,51<->49,49<->47,47<->45,45<->43,43<->41,41<->39,39<->36,36<->1}}      I've replaced `\[UndirectedEdge]` with "<->" here to deal with formatting. How can I quickly return an ordered list of vertices in the path, and an ordered list of their (previously specified) coordinates?
