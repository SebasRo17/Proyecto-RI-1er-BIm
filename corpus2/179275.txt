Since my graduation (late 2005) I was working for the same company as a c++ software engineer. A year ago I was promoted as a software architect but I have found myself involved more and more in qualification and fixing bugs, level 2 support. 50% of my time spent in Notepad++ analysing the software logs and trying to figure out what went wrong. 30% fixing other's bugs and the remaining (if any) reviewing developers spaghetti code. I started hating this product and thinking about an exit strategy out of this company. What do you think I can do in this situation? do you other software architect still fixing bugs in the code?
