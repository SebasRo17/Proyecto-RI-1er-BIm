I have multiple segmented Rails apps that are connected to each other:   * App A   * App B   * App C While I try to keep the design, such as header and footer, to look similar, but each app has its own stylesheet, javascript and images in the asset folder. Some of these assets are duplicate, like CSS for footer. It makes maintenance difficult. I'm wondering if I could do something like having App D, where App A, B, and C will just retrieve the assets from App D. So if I need to change anything, I can just change the assets in App D. How do I achieve this?
