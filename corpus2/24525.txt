I export graphics to PDF using:               Export["/path/figure.pdf", plotname]      It gives me more than enough quality for PDFLatex. But somehow, some exported plots have 'extra' lines (it doesn't happen when I export to PNG/JPG for example): ![image showing plot with extra lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J7JVN.pngFunctions) It doesn't happen to all exported plots, and in Mathematica itself, the plot looks correct: no extra lines visible. The `ListPlot` is more than just a `ListPlot` (it uses external data to make five different `ListPlot`s and is then showed in one plot using `Show`), but the other plots made in the same way are perfectly fine, so I guess it has nothing to do with how the plot has been generated. Sorry I am sich a n00b, I don't know how to add all this code. So again, I have shared it online: [link to notebook code].2 The funny thing is, I have 'built' three of these plots, only the one in the shared code, gives this problem. This plot is the 'middle' plot, i.e., there has been a plot made before, then I clear the counters, and start again. FYI: You can't run the code, because it needs external data. The external data are many CSV files containing 9 rows of each a text string and a numeric value. I am using Mathematica 9.0.1.0 on Ubuntu 13.04. Thinking it might be some 'leftover' information, I've tried to clear all parameters/variables, quit the kernel (local), quit Mathematica as a whole. But the problem isn't solved. I hope someone here knows what might be going on. I prefer not to change all my figures to a different format. If there is a best format for PDFLatex, then of course I will reconsider, at least for the future. But I expect PDF to fit perfectly with PDFLatex...
