Given time series data as follows:               data =        {{{2011, 1, 13}, 10}, {{2011, 2, 14}, 17}, {{2011, 3, 15}, 20},         {{2012, 1, 16}, 30}, {{2012, 2, 17}, 40}};      Evaluating               Cases[data, {{year_, month_, day_}, val_} /; year == 2011]       will return the data that are in year 2011. Are there any ways that I can define a function that can change the criteria of matching patterns? For example,               TimeSelection[data_, pattern_] := Cases[data, {{year_, month_, day_}, val_} /; pattern]        If the pattern is `month == 2`, the return will only be the data in February.
