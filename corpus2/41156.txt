I noticed that the nice symmetric layout of a grid graph gets distorted when additional edges are added to the graph. Is there way to prevent that from happening and to keep the rectangular, grid-like layout? A minimal example would be               g = GridGraph[{3, 3}]     Graph[Range[9], Join[EdgeList[g], {1 \[UndirectedEdge] 5}]]      giving the following two outputs. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FKJq5.png) I would like the additional edge(s) added to the original graph, keeping its layout unchanged. Thanks. **Edit** : I realize that               EdgeAdd[g, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 5]      does what I want. I'd still be interested to learn how I can force a grid-like layout when constructing the graph explicitly from vertex and edge lists, in particular since `EdgeAdd` does not seem to work well with edge weights. **Edit 2** : A concrete example of how I would go about constructing the weighted edge would be               n=5;     ind = RandomVariate[BernoulliDistribution[1/2],{n-1,n-1}]+1;     crossedges = Table[{(j-1)n+i \[UndirectedEdge] (j-1)n+i+n+1,(j-1)n+i+1 \[UndirectedEdge] (j-1)n+i+n}[[ind[[j, i]]]],{j,1,n-1},{i,1,n-1}] // Flatten;          g = Graph[Range[n^2],Join[EdgeList[GridGraph[{n,n}]],crossedges],EdgeWeight -> Join[ConstantArray[1,2n(n-1)],ConstantArray[Sqrt[2],(n-1)^2]]];      This construction is motivated by this question on MO.
