I am working on a C++ project where I have a bunch of math functions that I initially wrote to use as part of a class. As I've been writing more code, though, I've realized I need these math functions everywhere. Where is the best place to put them? Let's say I have this:               class A{         public:             int math_function1(int);             ...     }      And when I write another class, I can't (or at leat I don't know how to) use that `math_function1` in that other class. Plus, I've realized some of this functions are not truly related to class A. They seemed to be at the beginning, but now I can see how they're just math functions. What is good practice in this situation? Right now I've been copy-pasting them into the new classes, which I'm sure is the worst practice.
