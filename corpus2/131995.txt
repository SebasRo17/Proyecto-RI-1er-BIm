What are the pros/cons (if any) to using               string output;      int i = 10;     output = string.Format("the int is {0}", i);      versus               string output;      int i = 10;     output = "the int is " + i;      I have always used the latter example, but it seems as though a good majority of online tutorials use the string.format example. I don't think that there are any real differences in terms of efficiency, my initial thought is so a coder doesn't have to keep breaking the string to insert variables.
