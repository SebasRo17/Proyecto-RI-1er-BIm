This is probably a fairly trivial question, yet I have been unable to find an answer - help would be much appreciated! :) I am trying to plot a 28 x 28 matrix (tabulated data given here), containing continuous pixels values on the interval [0;1]. I am using MatrixPlot and ColorFunction -> GrayLevel, so that 0 comes out as black and 1 as white, and all values inbetween will cover the gray spectrum. MatrixPlot produces a lovely 28 x 28 matrix plot - however, for some reason it uses a medium gray for 0, and scales the remaining values accordingly on the gray spectrum, with 1 still being white. This is the code used:               input1 = Get["http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=PP2t8tp6"];     MatrixPlot[input1, ColorFunction -> GrayLevel, Mesh -> None, AspectRatio -> 1/1, ImageSize -> 300]      The resulting image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3GGxr.png) Adding a file extension (.dat, .csv, .txt) and adding separators made no difference - I also tried forcing the color spectrum with ColorRule, but no luck.
