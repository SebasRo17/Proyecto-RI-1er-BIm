I'm having a bit of trouble making a ParametricPlot from two curves. I defined two functions p and g as:               Clear[p, g];     g[t_] := t*(1000 - t)/(500^2);     solns[t_] :=      Solve[((1 + 1*(.33)*.05*p^2 +            11*.33*(.05^2)*.66*p^4)/(1 + (.33)*.05*            p^2 + .33*(.05^2)*.66*p^4 + .008*.33*.33*(.05^3)*.66*p^6))/       g[t] - p == 0, p];     p[t_] := p /. solns[t];      Notice that the function $p$ can take on 1-3 values for certain t:                 Plot[{g[t], p[t]}, {t, 0, 1000}]      However, using the command                 ParametricPlot[{g[t], p[t]}, {t, 0, 1000}]      gives some random curve on an x-axis from 3-9 that doesn't have these values. The x-axis should also be going from 0 to 1 for $0\leq t\leq 1000$ because the x-component is defined by $g$. Could anybody tell me what's going on here, and show me how to make an actual parametric plot? Thanks in advance.
