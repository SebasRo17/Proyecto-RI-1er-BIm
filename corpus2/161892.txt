I'm writing documentation for some interactive Ajax user interface but instead of writing everything in words I would rather provide diagrams that are faster consumed than whole paragraphs of text. I did provide page navigation flow diagram but that's very high level before you drill down to individual pages and their inner workings. ## Example Suppose I have to document a typical search panel:   * is collapsed by default and can be expanded on click   * has basic search fields that provide basic search criteria over my model entity   * has advanced fields as well that show when one clicks a particular link which expands search with additional fields   * has two actions Search and Reset that are pretty much self explanatory, but have particular behaviours attached to them I know you will say that this already is documentation, but it's usually not this simple and trivial. Search panel is just an example. I can see that most of my interfaces (or interface components) need two types of documentation:   1. **properties** related to contained controls (i.e. drop down field with these and those values of which that particular one is selected by default)   2. **actions and behaviours** that describe what happens when user interacts with controls related to those properties ### What would be the best diagram or documentation format to describe these kind of interactive interfaces so that it's easy and quick to consume by implementers?
