I apologize for the text description, but new users are not allowed to post images. I want to draw a circle that cuts through the center of a sphere and has an inclination of 15 degrees with the horizontal axes (equator). Actually, there are infinite number of great circles that can satisfy this requirement. If someone can show me how to make a `Manipulation`, that will be better.
