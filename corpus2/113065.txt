I have been working in a professional software development environment for a short while now. Over this short period of time I have heard some terminology I never knew existed. For example, in a status call a few weeks ago one of our developers said that he had been "hand-jobbing" things left and right. A few days ago, I heard a new one again, where someone in our company wants to "dog-food" some product of ours. So what is a "strange" term with respective definition, or list of terms that you know, that can improve on a new developer's professional vocabulary to improve on their communication and understanding of processes in the workplace? My list is as follows and I will add more as I come across them!   * Hand-jobbing: When a programmer resorts to some primitive or less-than-best-practice method of getting the job done, for the sake of getting something working, usually temporarily.   * Dog-fooding: When a company uses a product for internal use that they have or are currently selling to their customers, usually to save time and money, but also to show confidence in their own products. Also as a side note, I guess they don't have to really be TRUE software terminology as I've never heard anyone ever "hand-job" something as much as he did. However it should be something you have heard used in a professional environment that you would like to share.
