I want to learn multiple technologies. Currently I have knowledge of core Java, C, and PHP. I want to know the approach which should be followed to learn multiple things. I know if you know the core concepts of the behavior of programming language, any programming language can be learned. I want to make command on such language in a way that I can talk with them. I am doing lots of coding and surfing but I think there is an approach by which we can communicate or talk with programming language.
