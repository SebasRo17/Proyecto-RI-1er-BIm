I thought I understood _Mathematica_ V9 units. However, I can't get these numbers to plot, or even to come out to a nice clean unit of mass (say grams). The `Kelvin's` always stick around: even though they should cancel. Note that the `UnitConvert` with `"gram"` does work at all... But `"Convert to SI unit"` seems to get me close with `"kg K^(3/2)/K^(3/2)"`. Same for `UnitSimplify` ... ![\[PNG of math notebook with problem\]\(https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5614270/Eqn.png\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AHRKd.png) Why doesn't _Mathematica_ divide out the `Kelvins`? Is this somehting to do with the `Kelvin` vs `KelvinDifference` unit thing? I can't seem to find the right way to do this. I just want to plot grams... This is the Jean's mass eqn from Astrophysics.. I would have included a picture of the notebook, but this thing won't let me link/embed pictures.
