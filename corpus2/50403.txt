I got the following problem I don't know how to solve or if it's at all possible to solve(I'm quite new to _Mathematica_ and don't have an IT background, so please explain slowly if possible:)) I'm trying to convert a simple string which I imported from a homepage into a list of numbers. The string looks for example the following:               {"1,2,3,5,10,12,13,17,26,30,32,41,42,43,113,115,121,125"}      _Mathematica_ sees this as one string, this is important, not as a list of strings. (I used the head function to check that) My question: is it possible to convert this one string into a list of numbers so that each number in the string above is recognized as an individual element and can be calculated with? Another important note: these strings don't all contain the same amount of numbers, a couple of them are shorter than other ones. Is there any way I can convert these different strings into lists of numbers?
