I've been doing some reading about DNSSec and am interested in the algorithm that they chose to use when splitting the trusted key up between the 7 Trusted Community Representatives (TCR). I unfortunately can't find any information about the algorithm itself anywhere. Is it just an implementation of the Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm, or is it using a different approach? A little bit of information can be found here.
