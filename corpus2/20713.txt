Let's say I have 100 cores/kernels as my disposal and want to compute a function of two variables `f[x,y]` over `{x,1,10}`, `{y,0,59}`. So in total 600 data points. Ideally I would like to utilize all 100 cores giving each core 6 data points to compute. How can I achieve this?               ParallelTable[f[x, y], {y, 0, 59 }, {x, 1, 10 }]      Would only parallelize on the first 60 cores and give each core a workload of 10 points and               ParallelTable[f[x, y], {x, 1, 10 }, {y, 0, 59 }]      would do even worse- parallelizing on the first 10 cores and giving each a workload of 60 points. I think doing               ParallelTable[f[x, y], {y, 0, 59 }, {x, 1, 3 }];     ParallelTable[f[x, y], {y, 0, 59 }, {x, 4, 6 }];     ParallelTable[f[x, y], {y, 0, 59 }, {x, 7, 10}];      Would only evaluate the three calls sequentially when the previous `ParallelTable` had finished so would also do not better? Is there a way around this?
