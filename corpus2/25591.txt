Too often I have seen the programs of inexperienced users greatly slowed by using `Position` in an iterative fashion, when far faster would have been to compute a look-up table for positions beforehand. _Mathematica_ provides such functionality for `Nearest` and `Interpolation` "out of the box" with the syntax of `function[data]` along with dedicated functions `NearestFunction` and `InterpolatingFunction`. There is no equivalent with `Position[data]` producing a `PositionFunction` object. I observe that `Position` appears to be used more often than either of the other functions so this seems like a regrettable omission. Two complications I can think of are:   * the levelspec of `Position`   * the handling of patterns Based on this I ask:   1. What other complications are there for creating a PositionFunction?   2. How best can such a function be implemented?   3. How can the utility and performance of the function be maximized?   4. All limitations considered would such a function be valuable?   Why is there no such functionality in _Mathematica_?
