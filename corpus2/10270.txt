Many companies, especially larger ones have mandatory professional development plans for their employees. Employees and managers set out a personalized professional development plan and follow up on the progress every so often. As a developer, do you find such PDPs useful, do you follow through with your commitments? As a manager, do you think such PDPs bring value to the company and improve the overall quality of the employees? It seems that good developers will continue to educate themselves and strive to be better regardless of companies' procedures while bad ones won't. Are there benefits of having PDPs or is it just something managers feel they need to do?
