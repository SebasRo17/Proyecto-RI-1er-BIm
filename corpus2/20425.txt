I'm trying to plot a Fourier transform of solution of differential equation. I have tried with:               Plot[Evaluate@       Abs[FourierTransform[         Re@Evaluate[           p[t] /. NDSolve[{p'[s] == 1 + (-1.3 + I*10 + p[s])*p[s],               p[0] == 0}, p, {s, 0, 10}, MaxSteps -> 100000]],          t, \[Omega]]], {\[Omega], 0, 100}, PlotRange -> All]      without success. What am I doing wrong?
