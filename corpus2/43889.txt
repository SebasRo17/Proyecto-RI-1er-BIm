I'm developing code for manipulating graphs. Spot the difference in the 2 Manipulates below:               Manipulate[      {n, m},      {{n, 10, "no of vertices"}, 1, 18, 1},      {{m, n, "number of edges"}, n, n (n - 1)/2 , 1}      (* using the +/-/slider for the number of edges does not generate Reals          but only Integers as expected *)]      ![first image of Manipulate](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xJo1C.jpg) this first example works as expected but               Manipulate[      {n, m},      {{n, 10, "no of vertices"}, 1, 18, 1},      {{m, n, "number of edges"}, n - 1, n (n - 1) /2, 1}      (* using the +/-/slider for the number of edges now generates Reals          not Integers: what gives? *)]      ![second image of Manipulate](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7au2q.jpg) turns my nice integers into reals as soon as I change the number of edges. I can turn this back into an integer when that's what I need, but I'd prefer not to. Naturally I have a more complex task to complete but these examples are simple enough to illustrate the issue.
