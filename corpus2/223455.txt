I'm faced with the following problem: I have an array which is produced by the parsing of a yaml file which contains patterns in the following structure.               "Programming books"         Title:               a list of titles         Author:     "Art Books"         Title:               foo               bar         Author:               Mrs. Foo               Mr. Bar         Year:      the program is supposed to be given random input and find if there is a book with that particular Title,Author and Year. So far I'm using the following                foreach book_type,values from config{            tag_match = 0            foreach tag from values{                 tag_no = values.length()                 foreach value from tag{                      if value in input                           tag_match++                 }           }           if tag_match == values.length()                /* tag the book matched continue matching*/      }      The program is not supposed to receive many matching lines bu it is supposed to receive a huge amount of data. So far it has to do book_type.length() * tag.length() * value.length() iterations for each line of input, is there a better way to do this?
