I wrote this code:               #include <iostream>     int main()     {         int a;         std::cin >> a;         if(a*a== 3){             std::cout << a;         }         return 0;     }      On MSVC I turned ON all optimization flags. I expected that since a*a can never be 3, so compiler should not generate code for the section:               if(a*a== 3){         std::cout << a;     }      However it generated code for the section. I did not check GCC or LLVM/CLang. What are the limits of expectation from a C++ compiler in these scenarios?
