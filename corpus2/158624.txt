I'm curious about this, let's say I have:               00000000001 90                              nop             00000000002 90                              nop             00000000003 90                              nop       Is it executed exactly the same as this?               00000000001 0F1F00                          nop        dword [ds:rax]      What effect would the second example have as opposed to the first?
