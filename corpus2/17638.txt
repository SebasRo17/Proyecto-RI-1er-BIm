I wonder is it possible to render `Graphics` in _Mathematica_ with bitdepth higher than `"Byte"` which is the maximum bitdepth supported by the Windows XP operating system (it is so-called "True Color")? Tracing the rasterization with the option `TraceInternal->True` shows that `Graphics` is always rendered to a matrix of `Integers` in the range from 0 to 255, then it may be converted to `Reals` if requested but such conversion does not increase the bitdepth, of course: it changes only the internal representation of the `Image`. For example, let us consider rendering of `VertexColors`:               Cases[Trace[       Image[Graphics[         Polygon[{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, Sqrt[3]}},           VertexColors -> {Red, Green, Blue}], ImageSize -> 4], "Real"],        TraceInternal -> True],       x_List /; MatrixQ[Unevaluated@x, NumberQ], {1, Infinity}]      One can see matrixes of values between 0 and 255 in spite of requested `"Real"` bitdepth. Let us compare the results of rendering with different requested bitdepths:               In[21]:= Image[       Graphics[Polygon[{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, Sqrt[3]}},          VertexColors -> {Red, Green, Blue}], ImageSize -> 4], "Real"] ===       Image[Image[        Graphics[         Polygon[{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, Sqrt[3]}},           VertexColors -> {Red, Green, Blue}], ImageSize -> 4], "Byte"],        "Real"]          Out[21]= True      It is obvious that the requested bitdepth does not change the real rendering bitdepth. So the question is: is it possible to render `Graphics` with bitdepth higher than `Byte`?
