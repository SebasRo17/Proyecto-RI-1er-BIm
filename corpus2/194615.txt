I'm developing a WordPress theme and am planning to sell it myself. I was thinking of having a 14- or 30-day refund policy for customers, but my concern is that people can essentially get the theme for free, if they: 1) buy it, 2) download the files, and then 3) request a refund. Then they would have both the theme and their money back. I've been looking into software refund policies and noticed there are a few different schools of thoughts on providing customer refunds: **School of Thought #1** \- Provide refunds. If your software is good quality, not many people will request a refund. My response: But in my case, even if users think the theme is high quality, they can still request a refund and also keep the theme. I have also put a lot of work into the development and testing of the theme, so it is quality work. **School of Thought #2** \- Provide refunds, but some customers will abuse the refund process, so have an activation code and only provide refunds to people who have not activated the software. My response: This sounds like a good idea, but there isn't an activation mechanism for themes in WordPress, so I don't know how I could implement it. **School of Thought #3** \- No refunds. My response: This seems really inflexible. I'm not against refunding customer payments for good reason, but I don't want to give away my work, either. Have you heard of any other good options in setting up a refund policy?
