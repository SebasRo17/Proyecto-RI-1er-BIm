Currently in a debate at work and I cannot fathom why someone would intentionally avoid Inheritance with Master Pages. For reference here is the project setup: >   * BaseProject   > >     * MainMasterPage >       * SomeEvent >   * SiteProject   > >     * SiteMasterPage   > >       * nested MainMasterPage >   * OtherSiteProject   > >     * MainMasterPage (from BaseProject) > The debate came up because some code in BaseProject needs to know about "SomeEvent". With the setup above, the code in BaseProject needs to call `this.Master.Master`. That same code in BaseProject also applies to OtherSiteProject which is just accessed as `this.Master`. SiteMasterPage has no code differences, only HTML differences.   If SiteMasterPage Inherits MainMasterPage rather than Nests it, then all code is valid as `this.Master`. Can anyone think of a reason why to use a Nested Master Page here instead of an Inherited one?
