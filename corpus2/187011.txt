I thought of asking on SO, but it seems this is more of a "concept" type question than a "problem" type question. If it needs to be moved, please do so. Anyway, I'm having a tough time finding straight info on this. I'm using Unity.Mvc3 to setup dependency injection for controllers and other components the controllers might use. From what I understand from the Unity.Mvc3 website, anything that is `IDisposable` will be disposed at the end of the request from the container if it is registered with a `HierarchicalLifetimeManager`. Does that mean that things registered with the `ContainerControlledLifetimeManager` will be registered as the same instance for all requests for as long as the server/application is running? Can I register an instance using the `HierarchicalLifetimeManager` or does it have to be a type? How do the application/session/request lifetimes work? I ask, because I come from PHP and PHP has no scope outside the request, so this is obviously something I need to get a hang of.
