I want to build a web app that uses Salesforce.com data, and I want to build it fast. I'm a .NET developer (WPF, C#, ASP.NET MVC). I understand Ruby and RoR fairly well, but I haven't delivered any Rails apps. I'm wondering, is Ruby on Rails a suitable tool for rapidly building Salesforce apps, or is it better for the "traditional" web2.0 stuff like Groupon and Twitter? In other words, would using RoR help me achieve my fast (e.g., three months) goal over using .NET, which I already know?
