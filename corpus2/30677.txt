Why is the reponse time of of kernel significantly different when I use the first code rather than the second? Shouldn it not be the same? Is there any way that the response time can be made smaller without having to use probability distributions built into _Mathematica_? Code 1:               triangular = TriangularDistribution[{0, 12}, 6];     Manipulate[       Plot[{         PDF[triangular, x]*If[x <= Quantile[triangular, p], 1, 0],          CDF[triangular, x],          PDF[triangular, x]},          {x, 0, 12},         PlotRange -> All, Filling -> {1 -> Axis}, ImageSize -> Large, AxesLabel -> {x, ""}],        {p, .6, "Percentil"}, 0, 1, .001, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]      Code 2:               D = ProbabilityDistribution[       Piecewise[{{         x/36, 0 <= x <= 6},         {(12 - x)/36, 6 < x <= 12}}],        {x, 0,12}];      Manipulate[       Plot[{         PDF[D, x]*If[x <= Quantile[D, p], 1, 0],         CDF[D, x],          PDF[D, x]},          {x, 0, 12},         PlotRange -> All, Filling -> {1 -> Axis}, ImageSize -> Large, AxesLabel -> {x, ""}],        {p, .6, "Percentil"}, 0, 1, .001, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]
