First, I LOVE Python, and Python is my first programming language. I'm just wondering why Python's packages got kinda ~~ugly~~ unmemorable and sometimes very long names? I find other languages (e.g. Node.js and Ruby) more creative and descriptive. I feel python package creators just try to throw the 'py' letters anywhere in the name (e.g. autopy, Boupy, IMDbPY, Pybooru, etc.). Not to mention abbreviating or even using all the words describing what the package can do (e.g. Matplotlib, virtualenvwrapper). **Is there any naming convention that had unintentionally constrained creativity?** _P.S. I by no means try to offend creators of the packages mentioned above. Nor is this question meant to be a this vs that._
