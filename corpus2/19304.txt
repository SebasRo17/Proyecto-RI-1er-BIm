Have been experimenting with the Log function to demonstrate simple Log relationships such as Log[xy], Log[x+y] etc.               Clear[x,y,m,n];     m =b^x;     n = b^y;     Log[b,m]+Log[b,n]       The output i get is               log(b^y)/log(b)+log(b^x)/log(b)      Why is Log[b,b] not being evaluated to 1 ? Also Log[b,b^x]=x so why is it not showing this ? Also the log statements in the output have no base shown ? I tried               Log[b,m]//Trace      which gives me ![Result](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jQR2b.jpg) Simplify doesn't seem to do anything Thanks David.
