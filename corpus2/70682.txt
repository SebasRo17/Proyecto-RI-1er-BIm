Today I interviewed with a big-ego VP for a Rails and Rails position at a profitable company in my city. He asked me to explain what ActiveRecord is in Rails. I told him the following: > ActiveRecord provides an object-oriented interface to an application's > database to make development easier and friendlier for the developer. It > provides validation functionality as well which helps keep data in the > database clean. ActiveRecord also pertains to the model part of the MVC He then told me that was "kind of mickey moused." So, IS my explanation "mickey moused," or should I just have hung up on him right then and there?
