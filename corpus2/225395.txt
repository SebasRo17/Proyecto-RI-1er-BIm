I have a style question about overloading methods/constructors. I have a constructor which does something very simple, and then calls a method with some side effects. Sometimes however I don't want the side effects so I made a separate overloaded constructor. I show two versions here. Version 1 is simple: if I pass any bool then TrickyFunction won't be called. But maybe that's confusing, because the value of no_tricks does not affect the behavior (only that no_tricks exists). Version 2 actually does process no_tricks and makes a decision to run TrickyFunction based on that. Which version, or another version, is more stylistically "correct?"               public foo MyFunction(string a)     {         variable = a         TrickyFunction(a)     }          #Version 1     public foo MyFunction(string a, bool no_tricks)     {         variable = a     }          #Version 2     public foo MyFunction(string a, bool no_tricks)     {         variable = a         if (notricks == true)         {             TrickyFunction(a)         }     }
