I am currently struggling with memory handling. I have an if statement and each `case` instantiate a new object from a class. Does this affect the memory allocation in java?               switch()     {     case 1:     test t1 = new test();          case 2:     test t2 = new test();          case 3:     test t3 = new test();          case 4:     test t4 = new test();          case 5:     test t5 = new test();          case 6:     test t6 = new test();          }
