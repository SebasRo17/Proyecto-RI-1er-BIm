I am currently planning to implement a little painting app using OpenGL ES 1.1. I believe this question applies to any OpenGL ES project. I am starting development on Android and I would like to know if you would recommend writing the drawing logic (using OpenGL) in C++ with the NDK so it will easier to port to iOS, or to use the Java API and being locked on Android. The reason I am asking that is because I have seen mixed opinions on the Web about using the NDK (some people say it is an added level of complexity). From what I have already seen, I believe that I should go with the Java API since I am starting on Android and then, if I decide to go on iOS, to rewrite the OpenGL logic in Objective-C or C++. This should be pretty straightforward since the calls appear to be the same in both languages. What do you think? Am I right?
