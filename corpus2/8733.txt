I'm running some code based on @R.M.'s answer to **this question** to create a couple plots side by side. I want to export the plots rasterized to a png. However, when I `Rasterize` the plot at a higher `RasterSize` or `ImageResolution` it splits the row on to two seperate lines. See the following simplified example below:               Rasterize[      With[{size = 250},        Row[Show[#, ImageSize -> {Automatic, size},            ImagePadding -> {{30, 15}, {40, 5}}] & /@ {Plot[           Sin[x], {x, -1, 1}], Plot[Sin[x], {x, -1, 1}]}]],       ImageResolution -> 200]      It looks like this: ![Mathematica graphic](http://i.imgur.com/C1yJ9.png) I want both plots on the same line but at higher resolution, like this: ![Mathematica graphic](http://i.imgur.com/nFb3e.png) What is going wrong?
