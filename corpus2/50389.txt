my closed loop transfer function is:               H(s)=2exp(-q)/(1+exp(-2q))           q=sqrt((a+k*sqrt(s)+s)*s) ,  s=sigma+jw      how can i draw root locus of H(s) as 'a' changes for different values of k? in other words, how can i solve below equation and plot real(s) versus imaginary(s)?               1+exp(-2q)==0      i need a code for mathematica 9,i have examined some codes, but they didn't work.Tnx All.
