Many people recommend that we should code against interfaces and avoid statics for testability. Interfaces are not just for testability, they are sometimes a requirement. But sometimes we introduce new interfaces in application only for testability. If type mocking frameworks help us to isolate dependent types, then why should we use interfaces just for the sake of testability? Also, why should we avoid static members?
