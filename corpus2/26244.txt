equations={{2 u,2,1+t,1}=={a c,a b+c,a+b,1},{u,t,0,1}=={c d,c+b d,b+d,1}};     Thread/@equations//TraditionalForm      equations was typed to do some `Solve` How to get the following TraditionalForm I typed(I hate typing directly too much) the following equations by hand to show the result expected. Saving equations to `.tex` also could get beautiful appearance. I'd like the equations become beautiful in _Mathematica_ or _Tex_ ( Row/Column seems will not preserve the effect after converting to _Tex_ ). So how to convert equations to (1) or (2) both in Notebook and `TeXForm`? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wCu2K.png)(1) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TXiIZ.png)(2) as @chris mentioned in the comment, this is one good look, so problem is to convert equations to `Piecewise` in this way.               f[x_] = Piecewise@{{Sin[x], x < 0}, {x, x >= 0 && x < 1}, {x^2, x >= 1}}           f[x]//TeXForm      \begin{cases} \sin (x) & x<0 \\\ x & x\geq 0\land x<1 \\\ x^2 & x\geq 1 \end{cases}
