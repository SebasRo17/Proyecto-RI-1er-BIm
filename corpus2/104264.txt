I want to dig into C and normally when I want to learn a new language I think of a simple/attainable project goal that has some practical purpose (make use of an api, automate a task, etc...) I'm having a harder time coming up with one for C mainly because everything I read points to the fact that C's primary use currently is in embedded systems and more complex software projects like operating systems. Does this point me to the fact that I don't need to learn it or that I just need to be a bit more convoluted in my learning strategy? References to practical learning resources? (tutorial/how to that produces an end result that has some purpose/benifit)
