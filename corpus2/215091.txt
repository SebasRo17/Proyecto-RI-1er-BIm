Many of the most popular programming languges (such as C++, Java, Python etc.) have the concept of **hiding** / **shadowing** of variables or functions. When I've encountered hiding or shadowing they have been the cause of hard to find bugs and I've never seen a case where I found it necessary to use these features of the languages. To me it would seem better to disallow hiding and shadowing. Does anybody know of a good use of these concepts? **Update:**   I'm not refering to encapsulation of class members (private/protected members).
