The standard and robust method for piping to/from external commands under Windows is to create a temporary file, save the input into it, pipe it to the command and save its output to a second file. Here is a crippled version of the built-in `RunThrough` (that is the standard way for piping), that omits the output, for testing purposes, and prevents the command window to pop up (you can check the definition of `RunThrough` by removing its `ReadProtected` attribute).               runThrough[comm_String, s_String] := Block[{in = OpenWrite[], out = OpenWrite[]},        WriteString[in, s <> "\n"]; Close /@ {in, out};        (* If[i > 2040, Print[{i, in, out}]]; *)        Read["!" <> comm <> " < " <> First@in <> " > " <> First@out];        DeleteFile@First@# & /@ {in, out}];      In the following example I called the Windows `ver` command that simply returns the OS version, so it's pretty harmless to run. The problem comes when this `runThrough` is run iteratively. **Always precisely and reproducibly at** `i=2045` on my machine, error messages start to rain.               Dynamic@i     Table[runThrough["ver", "x"], {i, 10000}]      > >     OpenRead::noopen: -- Message text not found -- (C:\...\Mathematica > 9.0.1\Documentation\English\PacletDB.m) >     General::stream: -- Message text not found -- ($Failed) >     OpenWrite::noopen: -- Message text not found -- > (C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp\m-49f8c51e-d090-4dc3-87b4-0a5310380f70) >     General::stream: $Failed is not a string, InputStream[ ], or > OutputStream[ ]. >     ... >   If the commented line is uncommented (I left it for everyone to figure out the platform-dependent time of breakdown), I can see that the `out` file is not created by `OpenWrite`, as the result is `$Failed`. It happens to any external command, even for those that properly accept input from a pipe, not just OS natives like `ver`. Furthermore, somehow the kernel gets messed up, as any attempt after the messages to access the Documentation Center (for example `F1`-ing a function) brings up a dialog: > The file you tried to open was not found or could not be opened. Is it a problem of `OpenWrite` or I simply try to do too many things too fast and the OS cannot keep up with `Mathematica`? If so, how can I overcome such unwanted effects?
