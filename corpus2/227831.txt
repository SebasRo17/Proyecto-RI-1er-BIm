I have a factory method as given below               public class AutomobileFactory     {         Dictionary<string, ICar> internalFactory = new Dictionary<string, ICar>();         public AutomobileFactory()         {             internalFactory.Add("fiat",new Fiat());             internalFactory.Add("ford", new Ford());         }              public ICar Create(string carType)         {             return internalFactory[carType];         }     }      It is a very humble code. Now, I referred Factory pattern with generics. But I am not able to understand what extra this generic approach can offer. **QUESTION** What is the shortcoming of the above given factory when compared to the generic factory?
