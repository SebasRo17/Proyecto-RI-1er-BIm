We have a central server that sends and recieves messages from a number of PCs that are located on client networks in various locations. To facilitate this, currently I'm using WCF with TCPNetBindings, using duplex communication secured with certificates. Now, we have a number of issues with this - mainly that we are being asked to support "disconnected mode" (we need to be fault tolerant). From what I know, there is no simple way to do this using the WCF stack - we'd need to implement something and perhaps use msmq. I've been looking at NServiceBus lately, and from I can see it seems to fit the bill well - fault tolerance, messages can be sent over the internet via a simple http gateway, etc. I know it's well respected in the community, and I can see why from looking into it. So, my question is...Does employing NServiceBus sound like a sensible idea, or does anyone have any other suggestions / real world experience that relate to this? I guess I'm worried of introducing a new tech that I know relatively little about, and facing problems with things like securing it, setting everything up in a reliable way, gotchas along the way.. I'm also wary of "gold-plating" the architecture, and choosing something shiny that will end up bogging me down in implementation versus sticking with WCF and just making it work for me.. Thanks!
