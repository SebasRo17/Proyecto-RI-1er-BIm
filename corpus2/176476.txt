If I take a program, and basically translate its source from some language to python, with some small changes, can I do a entirely my new lib or I have to make a "version" of the old one? would this be a copy of the first or a new lib based in the ideas of the first? **OBS: Consider the original lib is using Apache License v2** Not sure if well explained, but I can't see for now how to make it more clear.
