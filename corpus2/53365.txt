There has been a lot of media attention paid in recent months and years to the increase in CS majors and the possibility of a second tech bubble. Some news reports have suggested that as more people enter CS, the market could be flooded with CS professionals and jobs could be increasingly difficult to find. Is this a bad time to be majoring in computer science? Edit: I'm a non-trad student who allready has a Bachelor's degree in economics and will be pursuing a CS degree starting this upcoming summer semester at the Univ of Kansas. I've been programming for about two/three years and just need a more formal education to fill the holes in my head. I have an interest in CS, it's just that I am worries about the prospects for the future.
