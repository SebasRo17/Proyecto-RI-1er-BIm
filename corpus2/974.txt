As shown below, I am trying to find a cool way to show some variance weighted deviation from the mean. There are 10 attributes that I compute the distance for. How can I add a color function such that it is progressively a darker shade of red when its value is negative (towards the left) and green when the value is positive (towards the right of the graphics)?               distance = {0.245, -0.235, 0.053, -0.048, -0.128,                 -0.007, -0.075, -0.067,-0.005, 0.082}          Show[       Function[         attributes,         Graphics[           Rectangle[             {If[distance[[attributes]] < 0, distance[[attributes]]*10, 0],               attributes - 1},             {If[distance[[attributes]] < 0, 0, distance[[attributes]]*10],               attributes}           ],           PlotRange -> {{-5, 5}, {0, 10}},           Epilog -> {White, Line[{{0, 0}, {0, 11}}]}       ]] /@ Range[10],       Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/e2Pft.png)
