I import a data file:               SetDirectory["C:\\Users\\SE7EN\\Desktop\\mathematica\\test"];     dd = Import["data.dat", "Table"]          Out[2] = {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}}      and I want to apply the statement below on the elements of the data file but it doesn't work               For[i = 1, i < 7,        i++, {If[dd[[i]] < dd[[i + 1]], Print[dd[[i + 1]]],          If[i > 5, Print[dd[[i]]]]]}];      Of course there are some other ways to the goal of the program but I want to work with the elements of an imported data file directly in the first of IF statement.
