I've just read the Vogella JUnit tutorial and found it very helpful in understanding how to use JUnit. However, I'm a bit confused about what the convention is for placing multiple test methods in code. The tutorial only places one test method in a class, then describes how you can use a test suite to group multiple test classes together. Does this mean that it's common practice for each test class to only have one test method and then test suites are used to chain them together? Or was that just unintended and instead common practice is to put multiple test methods in a class?
