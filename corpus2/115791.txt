I'm confused about the PO's responsibility here. I was a developer on a Game Feature Team, but also a PO. The daily work of the developer is almost full time, so I have to work over time to take care my PO duty, and the responsibility of PO seems to be against developer's thoughts. As a PO, I will chose more features next sprint. Otherwise, I will tell myself not to do so, because I'm a team member to develop those features. This situation makes me confused, so I want to hear some ideas from you guys. I'm a new to Scrum and Game Dev (about 1 and half year), and also new to here and English.
