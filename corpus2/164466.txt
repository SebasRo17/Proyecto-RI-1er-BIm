After using version control tools, it is no longer necessary to comment out old code. However, some team members still comment out old code. Therefore, I want to clean them up. I want to mark commented lines which are really comments / documentation, so that every time I do not need to re-read all commented regions. The unmarked lines left are new commented code. How do I achieve this? Any existing tools or need to write on my own? Similar concept: in git, we have 'partial commit' to select some lines to commit. However, the lines marked in 'partial commit' is valid once only.
