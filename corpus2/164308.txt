In several of my programming courses in the University, my teachers always told me the following: > A function and a procedure are basically the same thing: the only difference > is that a function returns a value, and the procedure doesn't. That means that this:               function sum($a, $b) {         return $a + $b;     }      ... is a **function** , and this:               function sum($a, $b) {         echo $a + $b;     }      ... is a **procedure**. In the same train of thought, I've seen that a **method** is the equivalent of a **function** in the OOP world. That means that this:               class Example {         function sum($a, $b) {             return $a + $b;         }     }      Is a **method** -- but how do you call this?               class Example {         function sum($a, $b) {             echo $a + $b;         }     }      What's the equivalent name, or how do you call a method that **doesn't returns anything**?
