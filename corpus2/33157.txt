I was pretty good with algorithms and data structures once, a long long time ago. Since then, I programmed professionally, and then went to manage a small team, which totally shot my tech skills in this field back. I've decided I want to be a developer again, and work for Google. The thing is, I'm so out of practice, that if I were to be interviewed right now I would surely flunk out in 10 minutes. What training program would you recommend for me to get back into shape? I already started this weekend by going back to the absolute basics and implementing a few sort algorithms, linked list, and hash table. Next, I think I'll read through the entire course material on the other basic data structures and graph algorithms. I want to find a focused set of practical exercises I can do in a relatively short amount of time, to juggle the old brain cells. I know this stuff - I just need to remind myself that I know it.
