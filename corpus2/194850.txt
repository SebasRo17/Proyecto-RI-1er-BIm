I am a SCADA consultant and I work with many software packages. Due to their robust nature they include the capability of executing internal/external activex and vbscript code. Over the years I have written 10's of thousands of lines of code which my clients have utilized happily. I've met a point in my career where I want to go independent with these libraries due to their complex nature. That being said, is it legal for me to advertise "SoftwareX Expansion libraries" or "SCADA expansion libraries for software X/Y/Z"? What exactly can I state on a website or software package which would not get me swarmed by lawsuits? SCADA is supervisory control and data acquisition. Writing advanced reporting/software for industrial hardware and software. I work with human machine interface(hmi) software which allows internal/external execution of vbscript. Think of it as adobe flash, and how it executes actionscript. In the case of adobe flash, I would want to sell my actionscript libraries. My question is - Is it legal?
