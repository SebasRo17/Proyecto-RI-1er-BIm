I've been working for a year now in an agile project to redesign an insurance application. I really like working in an agile environment, although management and analysts I work with still have waterfall thinking ingrained and makes it a little complicated to embrace the new paradigm shift to agile. From a developer standpoint sometimes I feel like since we're doing "agile" we don't over-think or think enough our designs and just go with the flow and refactor later. Many times that ends up in rework because we never put enough though to certain pieces of the application. As far as I understand, agile is like having small waterfalls and deliver small pieces at a time (iterations), but sometimes we lose the big picture and end up paying for it later with rework. Are agile methodologies encouraging or tolerating procrastination more than traditional waterfall? Is this constant rework for pieces of software with defined requirements acceptable? Is anyone else experiencing something similar in their projects?
