I have a equation (x^2 + q1^2 - y^2)/2*(x + q1 - y) + (1 - 2*a)*q + 2*F = 2*(1 - a)*c[q] in q(variable) with parameters q1,a,F and function c(in variable q also, and I define it outside Solve so I can change it easier), when q=x,y the equation will be satisfied. I am new to mathematica, and not sure whether I define c in right way, whether I write my question in correct code. Any suggestion will be appreciated! Thanks in advance.               a = 0.25     F = 0.015641     q1 = 5.3415     c[b_] = ln[b + 1]     Solve[{(x^2 + q1^2 - y^2)/2*(x + q1 - y) + (1 - 2*a)*x + 2*F -       2*(1 - a)*c[x] ==      0 && (x^2 + q1^2 - y^2)/2*(x + q1 - y) + (1 - 2*a)*y + 2*F -       2*(1 - a)*c[y] == 0}, {x, y}]      and the output is:               Solve::inex: Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients or the system           obtained by direct rationalization of inexact numbers present in the system. Since many of      the methods used by Solve require exact input, providing Solve with an exact version of      the system may help. >>     Solve[{0.031282 + 0.5 x +       1/2 (5.3415 + x - y) (28.5316 + x^2 - y^2) - 1.5 ln[1 + x] == 0 &&     0.031282 + 0.5 y + 1/2 (5.3415 + x - y) (28.5316 + x^2 - y^2) -       1.5 ln[1 + y] == 0}, {x, y}]      I do not understand the above paragraph, and what are inexact coefficients?
