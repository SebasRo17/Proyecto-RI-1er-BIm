A colleague of mine was under the impression that our software department was highly advanced, as we used both a build server with continuous integration, and version control software. This did not match my point of view, as I only know of one company I which made serious software and didn't have either. However, my experience is limited to only a handful of companies. Does anyone know of any real company _(larger than 3 programmers)_ , which is in the software business and doesn't use these tools? If such a company exists, are there any good reason for them not doing so?
