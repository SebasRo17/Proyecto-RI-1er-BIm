At a major IT company the project that I was working on got cancelled. The entire team was _benched_. Since the team size was large (>300) not everyone was immediately employable. To cover the losses the company took on a project that involved content cleaning. It involved reading 1000's of pages of documents and fixing the disparity between them i.e. fixing the English! We had to make sure the punctuation was correct, word spellings were consistent, sentence structure etc. We were given 3-5 pages of a checklist of the most common mistakes. This was NOT a programming job at all. It was just given to the folks who were _on bench_ and had them billable for some time. However, this project duration was about 6 months! There were no projects coming by or the talent pool had more resources IMO. Of course, I did quit the company but I still show the entire duration of my work at the organization on my CV. However, this 'English' (non-programming) project is a bit embarrassing (although I try to frame the English well so it doesn't feel so :) Should I just get rid of such a project altogether? It was quite a while back, but I'm only concerned about the authenticity of the duration - I did work from date A-B. Should I just indicate the primary project for the entire duration and drop the English one?
