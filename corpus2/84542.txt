I'm a very ambitious university student who wishes to learn pretty much everything there is to know about computers (bash me if you want, I love learning). Recently I thought it would be a fun project (albeit a lengthy one) to design and build my own kernel. I got some basic info and I've gathered that I need to master Assembly and C/C++ to really make this work. While I'm working on those, I'd like to learn HOW a kernel actually works from a programming perspective. I've spent hours browsing the linux kernel's code but that can only take you so far. What are the basic steps in building a kernel? Things you need to address? Order or doing things? I know I'm biting off a lot but I'm determined enough to handle it.
