The words `invert` or `control` are not used at all to define Inversion of Control in the definitions that I've seen. ## Definitions Wikipedia > inversion of control (IoC) is a programming technique, expressed here in > terms of object-oriented programming, in which object coupling is bound at > run time by an assembler object and is typically not known at compile time > using static analysis. ~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control Martin Fowler > Inversion of Control is a common pattern in the Java community that helps > wire lightweight containers or assemble components from different projects > into a cohesive application. ~ _based on_ > http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html _(reworded)_ * * * So why is Inversion of Control named Inversion of Control? What control is being inverted and by what? Is there a way to define Inversion of Control using the terminology: **_invert_** and **_control_**?
