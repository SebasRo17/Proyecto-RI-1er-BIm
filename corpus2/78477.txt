Jeff Atwood's blog post on Amazon's Mechanical Turk suggests that it should not offer monetary rewards but rather intrinsic motivation, _"motivation that is driven by an interest or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on any external pressure."_ How does a team member (a manager, a lead, or a developer) foster intrinsic motivation in a software team? **EDIT:** Please provide comprehensive answers. Share your personal experience with objective analysis. **EDIT #2:** To facilitate a productive and on-topic discussion, we should assume that monetary compensation is satisfactory to the developer.
