I was reading Towards Architecture-based Self-Healing Systems, and came upon the term `first-class connectors`. What are they? Searching some more finds this paper Systematic Construction of Software Architecture Supported by Enhanced First-Class Connectors, which looks like it might have an answer, and I might read it in detail later, but regardless, it would be useful to have the question up here with an answer shorter than that paper. :) An example of why having a connector being first class might also be relevant.
