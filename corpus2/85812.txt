Is CodeIgniter is recommended for a large web based ERP or Business Application? I want to use CodeIgniter for my future Project and I'm so confused whether to use it or not. Im so worried about in the long term process or lifetime of the application that it may crashed or produce a bug or error. I also worried about the performance of the framework when the data becomes larger and containing millions of records. I searched on the internet the answer but there is no exactly answer that will satisfy me. I think this question is important for the programmers like me who wanted to use PHP Framework for their large business application. I need an advice from you guys in order to decide whether to use it or not. thank you very much!
