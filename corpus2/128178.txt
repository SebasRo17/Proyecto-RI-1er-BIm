I've been tasked with creating a small web application, where users have a series of forms (I can't currently think of a better way of doing this) which will contain, either a)text input fields or b)drop down lists. The form will look as follows: `form1` `input box input box drop down box` `form2` `input box input box drop down box input box` `form3` `input box dropdown box input box drop down box` Now for each form, I would need to concatenate the resulting string stored within each box (drop down or input). Seems fairly simple and I already have a working prototype. Problem is for each form there can be multiple rows. What would be the easiest way to approach this? My skills are limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some (light) JQuery. The working prototype I currently have the user fills out all the fields and then presses a "generate" button which generates all the conctenated strings. Is this approach that you would take?
