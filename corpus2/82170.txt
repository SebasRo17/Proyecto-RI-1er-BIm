I've started my company in UK. Used to work as a freelancer, therefore legal issues didn't use to be a big headache. Now, I'd like to see an example of the document a company would sign with a client when starting to build them a website. This should include a project quote, project overview, agreed upon things, deadlines, etc. Anyone is so kind to share such a document?
