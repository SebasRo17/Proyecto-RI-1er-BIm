I found Profile[] in the Mathematica workbench does not run on my function. To investigate, I provided a simple function,               In[]:= test[arg_] := (Print[arg]);          In[]:= Profile[test[1]]     Out[]=      1     1      This is as expected, only that the profiler called the function twice. However, after running my code, if I run the same test function again, I get               In[]:= test[arg_] := (Print[arg]);          In[]:= Profile[test[1]]     Out[]=      1     1     1     arg_     arg      Very strange that the profiler tries to call the function with arg_, instead of the given argument 1. And this is exactly the first error message I got when I use Profile to run my code. EDIT: I created an empty project and the above simple example does not make a mistake. Thus the problem should be some part of my code is incompatible with the Profiler... PS: my code is too long to be provided here. Just in case of an interest, it is at https://github.com/tririver/MathGR/tree/experimental               << MathGR/gr.m     Profile[Simp[t[DN@"a", DN@"a"]]]
