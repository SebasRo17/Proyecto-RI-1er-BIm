I am solving a system of four non-linear equations in four variables using FindRoot. I have some sense of the relationship between the variables so I don't want Mathematica to do its computations in certain funky regions of the domain. For example, I want to solve: $\begin{align} g_1(w,x,y,z) &=0\\\ g_2(w,x,y,z) &=0\\\ g_3(w,x,y,z) &=0\\\ g_4(w,x,y,z) &=0\\\ \end{align}$ such that $\begin{align} x &\in& \\{25,75\\} \\\ y &\in& \\{0,80-f_1(x)\\} \\\ z &\in& \\{x+f_2(x),800\\} \\\ w &\in& \\{y,z\\} \end{align}$ and I would like my FindRoot to operate only in the above domain. How can I get it to do that? Simply writing this doesn't seem to work:               FindRoot[{g1==0,..,..},{x,50,25,75},{y,a,0,80-f1(x)},{z,b,x+f2(x),800},{w,c,y,z}]
