I have a requirement where I have to make numerous calls to webservice to update the local database. Since I have to support lower-end Android phones also, I'm not yet sure as to how this would be possible without actually exhausting the device memory and eventually crashing the app? Possible issue: Consider I have to sync 100 records to webservice and each of them have particular set of results returned and local database operations linked with it. The problem I am facing right now is, if I use synchronous calls the memory issue become major one and app crashes and if I use asynchronous calls, the app takes too much time and also recognising data returned will be a huge difficulty. **Platform** : iOS + Android **Technology** : AngularJS + Phonegap **Webservice** : RESTful **Note** : Please note that I am using purely front-end technologies and this would be a hybrid app.
