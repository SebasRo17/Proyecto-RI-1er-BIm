> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Recommended books on C++ Is there a canonical book on learning programming with C++ as a first language? I have toyed with Java and Python but when my laptop broke I couldn't program anymore. That was months ago and between now and then I have decided my real first language should be C++. Now my question is what book I should read. Is there a book out there that is both a good introduction to programming for a first time programmer and recommended for learning C++ as a first language?
