I was trying to answer this question but having hard time with the correct way to write the transformation rule. Trying to write a rule to transform `Gamma[1/2 + n]` to `Sqrt[Pi] (Factorial2[2 *(n - 1/2) - 1])/2^(n - 1/2)`. Will worry about the conditions when this transformation is valid later on. I now can't even make `Simplify` use this rule. The rule is being invoked (I add a `Print` and see it there), but the final result returned by the transformation function is not being used or returned) I looked at this answer and tried what is there, but still no success. These are my attempts. The result of the `Simplify` command should return `Sqrt[Pi] (Factorial2[2 *(n - 1/2) - 1])/2^(n - 1/2)` in this example. I am not sure if it is scoping issue. Can one use an `If` or `Cases` in the transformationFunction or must it be based only on the syntax of `/. :>`? I wish help has more examples. Only 3 basic examples are shown and that is it. When an expression being used inside the tranformation function (like in this case, `Gamma[1/2 + n]` then `n` here is taken as global symbol, right? I mean it will not have a $$n or it? That what seems to be the case. So I do not see why any of these are not working.               ClearAll[n, f, e];     f = # /. Gamma[1/2 + n] :> Sqrt[Pi] (Factorial2[2*(n - 1/2) - 1])/2^(n - 1/2) &     Simplify[Gamma[1/2 + n], TransformationFunctions -> {Automatic, f}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uHxEP.png)               ClearAll[n, f, e];     f[e_] := If[MatchQ[e, Gamma[1/2 + n]], Sqrt[Pi] (Factorial2[2 *(n - 1/2) - 1])/2^(n - 1/2), e]     Simplify[Gamma[1/2 + n], TransformationFunctions -> {Automatic, f}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EcC8w.png) http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/TransformationFunctions.html
