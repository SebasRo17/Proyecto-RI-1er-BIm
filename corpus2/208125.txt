I'm currently in the process of writing a support ticket system... Let's say it's a small forum application, or something like Uservoice. Now I want my users to be able to edit their tickets, but still be able to see the old versions of them. Which route should I take in terms of Database-Design? I've thought of something like: SupportTickets   * Identifier   * Author   * Subject   * SupportTicketContentId SupportTicketContents   * Identifier   * Content   * CreatedOn Now when viewing a ticket, I'd simply query the most recent `SupportTicketContent` depending on the `CreatedOn` column... But is there a better way? Or is there a better naming of these tables?
