I am a developer who works for an in-house information communications technology (ICT) department. I am usually quite critical when looking over code that I have not written as I find time and time again that it does not follow principles like SOLID (single responsibility etc). I used to assume that it was because I worked in an in-house ICT department rather than an outsourced ICT service. However, I am now trying to integrate an internally developed app with a few third party apps developed by large software vendors. However, again the code does not seem to be very well written e.g. there are no interfaces and every method is public. I see it time and time again were developers create a bunch of classes and that's it (i.e., everything related to Sales goes in the Sales class, etc.) I don't want to sound like I am whining; I just wondered whether other developers see design principles as important. I wonder if I am too narrow minded.
