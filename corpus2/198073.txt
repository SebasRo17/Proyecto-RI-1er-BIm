I am trying to improve my knowledge and ability with graphs and graph algorithms and have noticed something curious: as far as I can tell no "mainstream" language contains support for graphs in its standard library. Trees yes, graphs no. The only language that comes even remotely close is C++ with Boost (which isn't technically a "standard library") I'm not sure exactly why this is, but it's got me wondering: are there any programming languages out there that come with solid support for graphs as part of their standard library? Edit: To clarify: by "graph" I mean a network of nodes and edges; the sort of thing you'd run Dijkstra's algorithm on, not a "graph" in the sense of "graphical display of data".
