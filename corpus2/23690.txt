Sum[Sin[n*x]*Sin[n] /. x -> 1, {n, 1, Infinity}] ==        Sum[Sin[n*x]*Sin[n], {n, 1, Infinity}] /. x -> 1      > Sum::div: Sum does not converge. >> > > Sum::div: Sum does not converge. >> > > Sum[Sin[n]^2, {n, 1, Infinity}] == 0 Can anyone explain this? I do not understand why `Sum[Sin[n*x]*Sin[n], {n, 1, Infinity}]` is automatically simplified to 0 when the series does not converge (unless `Mod[x, Pi] == 0` in which case the sum really is zero).
