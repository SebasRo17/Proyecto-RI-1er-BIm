So my friend's boss brought in four junior candidates with some work experience, she is one of them. Her manager wants them to be experts on the subject matter of tomcat in a matter of two months in order to justify them as billable to other clients as a technical trainer. My biggest concern is this, they only have a year to no experience in development but no production support experience. Is it possible to turn these greenhorns into gurus in a short amount of time with the use of text and forums? Also they don't have a proper sandbox to play with, i.e. any servers. I am helping in my spare time but I don't feel she has enough time to become a SME. What can I do to help her become an expert or what can I say to her that the position may not be a good fit?
