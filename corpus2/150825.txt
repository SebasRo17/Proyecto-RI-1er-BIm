My experience with web services is slim and I'm trying to understand this a little bit more. I have done for instance a web service using visual studio. In order to use it, I add a web service reference in my projects and this creates a proxy and the use is pretty simple. Does this use SOAP? I ask this because i will be now facing a web service that i must communicate using SOAP with attachements and i'm trying to understand the concept behind this and the difference to what i have done so far. Will the proxy still be viable or do i need to create the XML by hand and post it to the web service? This concepts still confuse and so any help is appreciated. EDIT: I'm not developing the service, i will be just using it.
