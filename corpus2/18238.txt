Let $c$ and $h$ be real values. I was using _Mathematica_ to compute the limit $(h \rightarrow \infty)$ of the following expression: $$ \frac{\left(h^2 +c^2 h^2 + \sqrt{4 h^2+\left(h^2+c^2 h^2\right)^2}\right)^2}{4\left(h^2 + \frac{1}{4}\left(h^2 +c^2 h^2 + \sqrt{4 h^2+\left(h^2+c^2 h^2\right)^2}\right)^2\right)}\text{//FullSimplify} $$ which is equal to $$=\frac{2}{4+(1+c^2)^2 h^2 - (1+c^2)\sqrt{4h^2+(1+c^2)^2 h^4}}$$ Just as the rough estimate anyone can make by counting powers of $h$ in the numerator and denominator predicts, the _Mathematica_ function `Limit[f[h], h -> âˆž]` gives $1$ in the nonsimplified case and gives $0$ in the simplified case. Now, I am a little confused about whether the correct limit is $1$ or $0$ ? And is the function `Limit` supposed to work that way as to not being able to distinguish the correct result from the wrong one ? Here is the _Mathematica_ code               a = (h^2 + c^2 h^2 + Sqrt[4 h^2 + (h^2 + c^2 h^2)^2])^2/(        4 (h^2 +            1/4 (h^2 + c^2 h^2 + Sqrt[4 h^2 + (h^2 + c^2 h^2)^2])^2)) //         FullSimplify;          Limit[a, h -> Infinity]      as you know, you can add or remove the `//FullSimplify` at the end of the definition for $a$ to switch between the two cases. **UPDATE:** As mentioned in the comments below, I have reported this as a bug to Wolfram support. They wrote back, were very polite and thankful, mentioned that this issue has been forwarded to their developer team and recommended to use `Assumptions` in order to be sure that everything goes well and additionally even speed up the computation.
