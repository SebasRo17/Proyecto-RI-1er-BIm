x = 0; Dynamic[{x, Button["+1", Pause[6]; x++]}, SynchronousUpdating -> False]      The documentation states that Dynamic and Manipulate will abort synchronous computations that take longer than 5 seconds. The stated solution to this is to set SynchronousUpdating to False. That does not seem to work here. If I pause for 5 or fewer seconds it always works, but if I pause for 6 or more seconds, x always stays at 0 no matter the setting for SynchronousUpdating.
