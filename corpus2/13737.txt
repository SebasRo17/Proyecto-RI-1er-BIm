Every once in a while I want to paste Mathematica code on my blog. When I do, I would like it to be somewhat readable, and it would be nice to have syntax highlighting. So far all my searches have turned up with nothing. There are plenty of ways to colorize pretty much every language known to man, except perhaps Mathematica code. See this site, for example. The closest I've gotten to that is using :TOhtml in vim, which is pretty awesome, but gives me a whole HTML file, with and everything, and I'm not savvy enough to figure out exactly how to use it without destroying the rest of my post.
