I am working with the following `NDSolve` expression:               sol =        NDSolve[{           (x[r] (0.9628102243099506` + (20 r^3 y''[r])/y[r]))/r^4 == (5 x''[r])/r,            1000 (2 (x'[r])^2 + 2 x[r] x''[r]) + 250 (2 (y'[r])^2 + 2 y[r] y''[r]) ==              -(17.65185212647424`/r),            x[1] == 0, y[1] == 0.25435588063893033`,            y'[1] == -0.011618552862714042`, x'[1] == 21/128,           WhenEvent[y[r] == 0, end = r; "StopIntegration"]},         {x, y}, {r, 1, 2.381047528519592`}]      I can plot `x[r]`, `y[r]`, but I get the message: > Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0. encountered. >> If I delete the `WhenEvent` expression in the original code, I can numerically solve the equation without any error message. When I look at the plots with and without the `WhenEvent` expression, the two plots are exactly the same within the region that they share. Why am I getting the error message? can I ignore it, since the plot looks perfect.
