I was recently considering that sometimes several objects depend on each other (e.g. if they contain cyclic references) and therefore it would be useful to create them as part of one atomic operation that makes sure that, after construction, the new objects fulfil some collective constraint. In order to do this one could have constructors that can create more than one object. The programmer would then put in a single constructor all the code ensuring that, once objects o1, ..., on have been created, they satisfy all required constraints (e.g. all links between the new objects are already in place). I have made up the term **collective constructors** myself because I have never heard of such a feature, but there might well exist an accepted name for this concept. So, is there any programming language supporting this kind of constructors? If not, has the idea been tried out already?
