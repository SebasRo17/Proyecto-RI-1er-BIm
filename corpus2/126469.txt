I am not much familiar with documenting/System designing stuff. I have to maintain an application written in C# - working as windows service.   However there is no documentation for this system which makes it really pathetic to find where some problem (conceptually) occurred. I would like to know the best way to design/document it (using current code) manually or preferably automatically so that I can identify the exact problems. Like I feel as if sequence diagram won't much help probably.   Also, please guide me if I am taking it on wrong side?
