My employer is happy for me to release certain work under GPL, however the standard contract has a "All IP belongs to the company" section of the contract. They are happy to amend this to something which is more GPL friendly, but we don't know the precise wording to use. Are there any online resources for such clauses? It would seem to be a sensible thing to exist. I am sure we will have to run it by a lawyer but if there was a standard template, it would simplify the process I am in the UK, so I would imagine that such a resource would have to be specific to that.
