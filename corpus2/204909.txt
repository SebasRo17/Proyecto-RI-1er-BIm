In order to submit a desktop application for the Windows 8 app store, you need to digitally sign any driver or .exe associated with the application. However, the application I was trying to submit contains several files that are redistributions of other companies' software, and some of these are not signed. My application was rejected on these grounds. Is it legal (or ethical) to sign other companies' work so that we can submit our application? I think it might be considered some form of false representation but I'm not sure.
