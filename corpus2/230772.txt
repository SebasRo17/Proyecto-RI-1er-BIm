I'm looking for an algorithm to convert a tree of data into a 2 dimensional treemap view. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping I can do all the coloring in and drawing myself, but if there was some kind of algorithm like :               xy-withweight = treemapMyData(treedata)      where xy is a list of data elements : "x" = x point of bottom right corner "y" = y point of the bottom right corner "weight" = could be used to signify colour
