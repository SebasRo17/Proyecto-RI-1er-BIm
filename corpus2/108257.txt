In agile (scrum), how should one ideally break down things into a user story. The team size is about 6 developers if that makes a difference, and iterations are 3 weeks. Is breaking a user story with points and hours considered agile, or is it ONLY user points for a given user story? Should we break a user story into tasks also? In the actual workflow for a user story, you have things like:   1. requirement gathering   2. review of the user story by managers etc.   3. qa related tasks in the user workflow  How are these things handled in a agile environment?
