How does a Scrum team account for dev/infrastructure tasks in the planning meeting? At first glance, they do not seem like user stories since they do not deliver end user value. However, attaching them as tasks to a particular user story sometimes does not make sense either. For example, say the task is: "Setup Bamboo." That task is not required to complete any user story since the team could manually build and deploy. So attaching it to a user story does not make sense since this task is not required to complete the user story. So, then, this suggests that these tasks become user stories. But then, if the team story points them, then this changes the velocity which is odd since the Product Owner wants to know the velocity against his backlog, not against his backlog with a bunch of technical user stories attached to it.
