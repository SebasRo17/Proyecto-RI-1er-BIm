In a fairly complicated web application, there are almost hundreds of redirecting to another page, or linking to another page, etc. Imagine that you have a page called `/services/users/register-new-user` and in many places you want to redirect users to this page, or you want to provide links to this page. However, if for any reason in future, you change this address to something like `/users/register`, you should update all links, otherwise they won't resolve. I'm finding myself always encountering this problem, since wherever I want to redirect or link to `/services/users/register-new-user` I hard-code the entire relative address. How can I improve this pattern?
