What are good programming competitions (or web design competitions) available for highschool students in the Northeast (I am looking for a pretty long/comprehensive list)- of the USA? The competitions must either allow you to chose what language to use or must be in PHP or C. They can either be single coder or group coding competitions. Thanks you to anyone who can help me out.
