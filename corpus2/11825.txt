I am trying to learn how to interface with WolframAlpha. When I try using the Mathematica interface I get nonsensical data. I don't know if this is a bug or if I'm doing it wrong. My goal is to extract the elevation around the Austrian Province of Upper Austria. Perhaps to assert that Upper Austria is not actually the highest Austrian province, if this doesn't work I will attempt to challenge the status of Lower Austria. My Wolfram Alpha reference query is:               http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=average+elevation+around+upper+austria+Austria      My Mathematica code is:               WolframAlpha["average elevation around Upper Austria, Austria \     (state)", {{"ElevationStatistics", 1}, "ComputableData"}]      which gives               {{"average", -(27896275/24384)}, {"lowest", -(3662500/        381)}, {"highest", 2585000/381}}      which can't be right by any measure. What's going on?
