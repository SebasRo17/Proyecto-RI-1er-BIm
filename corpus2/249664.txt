I was wondering what is the exact difference between a client-server and a standalone application, particularly in following scenario. For example lets say there is a win forms application running on a PC. So that the DBMS, SQL Server also installed on the same PC as it hosts the database too. Now this is clearly a standalone setup. Now if we introduce another PC and connect it to the first PC through a local area network and we want to run the application on this new PC too but it will use the same database which is in the first PC. Now is this application considered to be a standalone app or a thick client - server? EDIT: The application communicates with SQL server to access data and processing will happen locally. SQL server hosts the data and there are few stored procedures and views too.
