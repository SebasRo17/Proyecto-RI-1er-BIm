I am looking for a way to simply the general expression in cross product and dot product with general vectors. I got a help in How do I simplify a vector expression? but soon I find that it doesn't work in the case               FullSimplify[Cross[vec[x], 2*vec[y]] + Cross[vec[y], 2*vec[x]] ]      it doesn't give zero. It seems that _Mathematica_ doesn't know how to expand the following expression               Cross[vec[x], 2*vec[y]] -> 2*Cross[vec[x], vec[y]]
