I'm having an issue with Mathematica wherein, when trying to use ListLogPlot, the scale of the y-axis skips entire decades. Instead of 1, 10, 100, 1000, it goes more like 10^2,10^4,10^6,10^8. I need it to, well, not do this. This is more or less my code, with different numbers introduced (although same order of magnitude)               data1 = {{{1, 1.432*10^8}, {2, 4.2*10^7}, {5., 1.68*10^7}, {7.,         5.21*10^6}, {10., 1.02*10^6}, {12., 5.37*10^5.}, {15., 1.76*10^5.}, {17.,         1.40*10^5.}, {20., 7.87*10^4}}}      Then               ListLogPlot[data1, Joined -> True, PlotMarkers -> {Automatic, Tiny},       PlotStyle -> Red, PlotRange -> {{0, 20}, {1, 1000000000}},       AspectRatio -> 1, Frame -> True]      And, at least for mine, it produces a graph wherein the ticks on the vertical log axis skip decades. There should also be a large white blank space towards the bottom of the graph. This is intentional, as I have several other sets of data I need to include using the Show function, and Show seems to default to the first graph set. So if I can get this graph to work, then it should be pretty easy to graph the others, and use the Show function. Any help is greatly appreciated.
