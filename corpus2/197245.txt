I've extracted interfaces from my repository classes, like ICustomerRepository, IProductRepository and so on. The project which contains the repositories is named X.DataAccessLayer. Should I call the project with the interfaces X.DataAccessLayerInterfaces, or what is better? And I definitely have to keep the interfaces in a separate project (I have 2 projects with implementations of these interfaces).
