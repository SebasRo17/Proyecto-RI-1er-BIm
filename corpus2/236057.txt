I was just wondering what kind of protocols a software engineer would go through if they were working at home for a company developing proprietary closed source software. Would you use a third party anti-virus or would you fear they could steal your code? Can you trust web hosting services like git- hub and bit-bucket? Would you keep your source code on an encrypted partition? Would you make any configurations to ensure windows could not steal your source code through some kind of built in feature? What other kinds of security concerns would you have and how would you deal with them?
