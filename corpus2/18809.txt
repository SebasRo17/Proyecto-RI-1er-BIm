I have two functions _x = x(u,v)_ and _y = y(u,v)_. The chain rule says that for a function f(x,y), _df/dx = df/du du/dx + df/dv dv/dx_ , and similarly _df/dy = df/du du/dy + df/dv dv/dy_. How do I get _Mathematica_ to give me _df/dx_ in terms of _u_ , _v_ , and _df/du_ , _df/dv_? I should point out that _x(u,v)_ and _y(u,v)_ are **not** easily invertible to give _u(x,y)_ and _v(x,y)_.
