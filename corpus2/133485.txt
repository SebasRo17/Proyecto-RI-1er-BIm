Do you find it easier to keep a branch for each company that uses software you support/develop? Each company will want "customizations" and I am just trying to figure out the best way to handle those changes. A branch for each company makes sense in the short term but I could see how this could cause issues with upgrades when a new version is developed. Is better to have a branch for each company or to setup customizations so that they are always merged to a main branch to minimize issues with future releases?
