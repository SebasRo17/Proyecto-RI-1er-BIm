I have a code in mathematica with a loop which iterates over a variable i and calculates a list of numbers h given the start parameter f:               For[i==1,i<100,i++,     h=Append[h,f*g(i)]]      Now what I want to do is to vary the parameter f. How I would have done it in Matlab (which is the only other programming language I know - yes, I suck at programming basically) is that I would have made a nested loop, so we would have something like this:               For[j==1,j<10,j++,     f=Append[f,k(j)]     For[i==1,i<100,i++,     h=Append[h,f(j)*g(i)]]     x=Append[x,Max[h]]]      Where the last line is supposed to give me Max[h] for successive iterations over j, i.e. first one is max[h] for j=1, then for j=2 etc. But this structure does not seem to work. What are my alternatives/ how can I fix it? Ps: I would love to submit my code, but it's completely unreadable due to a heavyamount of subscripts etc. Can I attach the Mathematica file somewhere?
