I've read in _PHP Advanced and Object Oriented Programming_ by Larry Ullman that it is good programming practice to delete object immediately after use but reason is given nowhere. I am a student web developer and objects in web applications are deleted automatically as soon as the script finishes. So, there seems no good reason to delete them manually. So, my question is what are the good reasons to delete unnecessary objects after use other that blindly following a convention?
