In particular, what are the best ways to report errors about incorrect arguments to a function? Checking for the correct arguments is relatively easy using patterns, but how to report an informative error message specific to the situation is not obvious. Most built-in functions will return unevaluated when the arguments are incorrect, while printing an informative error message. Points to consider:   * easy to add to an already implemented function without changing much, easy to keep the error reporting separate from what the function actually does   * robust and maintainable   * plays well with functions that take options _Note:_ I can come up with several ways to achieve this behaviour. But instead of starting from scratch and learning from mistakes I'd like to draw on the experience and knowledge of the community to learn about some time tested methods.
