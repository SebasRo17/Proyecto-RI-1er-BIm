I have a set of PDE's that depend on parameters. They depend on many parameters, but for simplicity we can here assume that they depend only on one, say `a`. I want to solve them for many parameter sets, using something of the form `With[{a=1},NDSolve[...]]` But since I have many sets of parameters, and it is very inconvenient to enter them each time, I want to have something like               p1 = {a=1};     p2 = {a=Pi+4};     ...     With[p1,NDSolve[...]]     With[p2,NDSolve[...]]      This clearly doesn't work because evaluating `p1={a=1}` assigns a value for `a`, and I don't want that (because I want to continue doing symbolic manipulations in other parts of the notebook). `SetDelayed` and `RuleDelayed` don't seem to work neither. Any ideas? _**EDIT_** I was asked to improve the description of my problem, so I try (and, on the way, thank all the people who tried to help). The situation is this. I have a notebook that contains many formulas, which depend on many parameters. For example, I have                f[x_]:= Sin[a x^b];      g[x_]:= a/x +Exp[-b]x;      diffEq={x'[t]==f[x[t]] x[t]^2-x/g[x[t]], x[0]==123};      I want to do symbolic manipulations on the formulas, so I don't want to assign numerical values to `a,b`. At the same time, I want to to solve the differential equation `diffEq`, and for this I want numerical values, and I want to solve it for different sets of paramters `a,b`. So I want to have variables which are assignments, something like               ass1={a->1,b->3};     ass2={a->123,b->Pi};     ass3={a->-32,b->1241203853};     ...      So that I could easily do               With[ass1,NDSolve[...]]     With[ass2,NDSolve[...]]     ....      and play around with the variables. I hope this better describes what I want to do.
