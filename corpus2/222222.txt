Would simply using AWS to build an application make this application a distributed system? For example if someone uses   **RDS** for the database server,   **EC2** for the application itself and   **S3** for hosting user uploaded media,   does that make it a distributed system? If not, then what should it be called and what is this application lacking for it to be distributed? **Update**   Here is my take on the application to clarify my approach to building the system:   1. The application I'm building is a social game for Facebook.   2. I developed the application locally on a LAMP stack using Symfony2.   3. For production I used an a single EC2 Micro instance for hosting the app itself, RDS for hosting my database, S3 for the user uploaded files and CloudFront for hosting static content. I know this may sound like a naive approach, so don't be shy to express your ideas.
