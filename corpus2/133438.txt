I've been asked this question as part of an assignment. The question is a bit vague, and after searching the Internet, I cannot seem to find any particular set of steps related to this question. The best I could find are the following:   1. Design test cases   2. Prepare test data   3. Run program with test data   4. Compare results to test data Are these valid steps which can be done to create a test process? Or am I misinterpreting the question?
