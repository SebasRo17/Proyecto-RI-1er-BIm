I have an entity and I've realised that there is a group of properties that work together. So, I moved them to a value object (together with their behavior) and now I have a reference from my entity to this value object. I've read "Domain Driven Design Quickly" (PDF) and I came across the following statement when explaining Value objects: > If Customer is an entity object, then one instance of this object, > representing a specific bank client, cannot be reused for account operations > corresponding to other clients. The outcome is that such an instance has to > be created for every client. This can result in system performance > degradation when dealing with thousands of instances. But I'm still not clear exactly what this means. Is my new object a value object or should it be an entity? I am having trouble reasoning whether it should in fact be an entity. In other words, what questions should I ask in my domain to assure me that it should be a value object?
