# Background I'm relatively new to git — currently overseeing an offshore .NET-based development project on GitHub within a private business account, but little experience beyond that. I'd like to set up repos for storing my _Mathematica_ projects (including one for my dissertation work). Initial tests revealed that git will make an unusable mess out of .nb files. Searching lead me to resources mentioning that notebooks contain too much metadata to diff/merge cleanly (without some specialized logic). # Question: What git customizations are appropriate when _Mathematica_ files and projects are involved (i.e., Workbench projects)? I'm a git noob, so be as explicit as possible with any instructions/advice! Are there any specific considerations to be made when using GitHub to host my _Mathematica_ projects? * * * _Resources that might help:_   1. Pro Git Book:     * Git configuration     * Git attributes (← section on binary files seems important)   2. Are there suitable versioning systems for _Mathematica_ notebooks?
