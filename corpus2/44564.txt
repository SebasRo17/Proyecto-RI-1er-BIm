A frog is at the bottom of a 30 metre well. Each day it climbs 5 metres up the side, but it then slips back 3 metres each night. How long does it take to reach the top of the well? Is there an easier /more direct way to make an alternating sum than this?               y = 14; Flatten[Transpose[{Table[2 x + 5, {x, 0, y - 1}],      Table[2 x, {x, 1, y}]}]]      # Update Not automated, but simple and more direct than first attempt:               Accumulate[Table[If[OddQ[n], 5, -3], {n, 1, 27}]]
