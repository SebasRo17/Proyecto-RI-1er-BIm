I want to randomize certain elements of a list; Since the code               list = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g};     list[[{1, 3, 5}]] = RandomSample@list[[{1, 3, 5}]];     list      works fine, I was trying to see if I could speed up things a little bit and have only one call to `list[[{1,3,5}]]` using a pure function The code               list = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g};     (# = RandomSample@#) &[list[[{1, 3, 5}]]];     list      will trigger an infinite recursion. I know that the function evaluates the argument before passing to the function, but the infinite recursion still confuses me. Any thoughts? Thanks
