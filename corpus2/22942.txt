I would like to use RLink to access igraph, which has an R interface. I do not know R; my motivation for learning it is to be able to access igraph easily. I installed igraph using `install.packages("igraph")`. This seems to have worked fine (I'm doing this on Windows, where package installation is supported). I can load the package using `REvaluate["library(igraph)"]` Now I would like to reference some igraph functions and use them, in analogy to this:               sin = RFunction["sin"]     cos = RFunction["cos"]     sin@cos[1]      I did               fullgraph = RFunction["graph.full"]     diameter = RFunction["diameter"]      I created a graph using `g = fullgraph[5]` and I tried `diameter[g]`. The value it returns is `{0.}`. This is not the same what I get using `REvaluate["diameter(graph.full(5))"]`, which returns `{1.}`. **What am I doing wrong?** Does RLink support the kinds of objects returned by igraph, or does it only support basic built-in types? Another thing I observed is that if I try these commands several times, then `sin@cos[1]` (with the above definitions) will stop working too in the sense that it will throw error about being unable to set variables (RLink's internal state probably becomes inconsistent), but I can't reproduce this consistently.
