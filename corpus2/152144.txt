At home, I have a server that is running some software (on a LAMP stack, but only accessible internally). I have another machine and a laptop that I both use for developing said software. What is the best workflow for me? Should I have a repository on my local server, create a live branch, staging branch and development branch, then checkout the development branch from my laptop/development PC to work on, commit that back when I'm done, then merge the development branch with the staging branch for testing, before further merging to the live branch? Would I simply checkout the production branch to my /www/var/ on my server? Or am I thinking/going about this all wrong? Thanks.
