Instead of a one long flat commit history, why isn't there a hierarchy, so at the top level you might have pull requests, then you could go down a level and look at the commits in that PR. I realise that PR's are specific to github, but you get the idea. I just mean grouping a number of commits as a feature or bug-fix, for example. Surely it would make the commit history a lot easier to navigate. I'm sure there is an obvious answer this question, but I can't seem to find it.
