I am in the process of filing in the gaps in my knowledge so that I can become a better developer. I am an ASP.NET developer and I sometimes need to do pure back-end stuff too. I ahve compiled a list of things I deem as necessary to know. Please feel free to fill in any gaps:   1. WebForms   2. MVC   3. jQuery   4. HTML5   5. WPF   6. WCF   7. The Repository pattern   8. Dependency injection (Castle.Windsor)   9. NHibernate   10. Entity Framework   11. Asynchronous programming   12. SQL. As in: hardcore SQL with temp tables and groupings and variables and stuff.   13. Unit Tests
