I wanted to get your thoughts. I see build systems like scons, make, jam, ants, autotools. Why do they exist? are they something like cross platform 'project files'? Do they address another need? to me .NET has almost a standard project file (xbuild on mono can build some of my projects created by msvc) I seen makefile's in each directory and sub-directory. In your opinion is this 'wrong'? My gut says if they are a 'project' file that allows you to pass in a few parameters for a complete build it should all be in one place (even if its multiple files). More importantly why do all of these tools exist?
