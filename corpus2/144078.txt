**Background Information** I have been into programming since past 1 years professionally, my day to day work includes writing BIRT reports, designing and validating forms using JEE (struts/spring, hibernate). I don't have a comp Sci 4 year degree (Electronics), so I have very Limited experience in comp Sci. **Question** JEE frameworks (struts1/2, spring, hibernate etc) are hot nowadays, however java world have a tendency of building A4j, B4J... mayway4J kind of stuff (and I am tired of it). AFAIK, frameworks are nothing but bunch of XML config files and hundreds of classes built to cram (by developer). And sooner then later a new framework come into picture that says **I am the best among all**. So My Question is - 1.What will you do to learn a framework (many frameworks) considering that it can be obsolete till you'll be master in it (Learning frameworks can take significant amount of time)? 2.Considering early into your career, will you give a damn that how well someone knows framework (knowing frame work is important but still..) and why/how should I learn a framework knowing I have to (un)learn it in order to learn other one (plenty of of 4Js....)? I am just trying to get a big picture, that, if you're in place of me, what would be your learning/cramming strategy (Road map)? I am not intended to start a holy war between A versus B, (frameworks are more or less essential).
