Every time I define a new function, I wonder which construct I should use: true functions obtained by using `Function`, or rule-based syntax. For example, these are two ways of defining a square function:               square = Function[x, x^2]     (* Alternatively: square = #^2& *)          square2[x_] := x^2      Is there some fundamental difference (e.g. execution efficiency) between the two approaches?
