I often compare my code to others and I find their solution more efficient and shorter than mine. Although both solutions work, I can't help it but wonder if mine is not adequate enough. As a result, sometimes I get a mental block when I'm about to start a project because I keep wondering if my solution is the best way. Are there any steps one can take to code in a more efficient manner?
