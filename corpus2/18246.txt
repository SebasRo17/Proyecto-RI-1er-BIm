I'm trying to perform the following integral with Mathematica 7:               Assuming[{t>0},       Integrate[(-s^2 + 4*s*t + 2*alpha*s)^(-(1/2)*D),{s, 0, t}, {alpha, 0, Infinity}]]      If I perform the integration with just the t>0 assumption, Mathematica gives:               (1/(-2 + D))If[Re[D] < 2,       ( 2^-D t^(2 - D) (       -8 (-4 + D) Gamma[1 + D/2] Hypergeometric2F1[1 - D/2, D/2, 2 - D/2, 1/4]       + (-2 + D) D Gamma[D/2] Hypergeometric2F1[2 - D/2, D/2, 3 - D/2, 1/4]       ))/((-4 + D) (-2 + D) Gamma[1 + D/2]),       Integrate[(-s (s - 4 t))^(1 - D/2)/s, {s, 0, t}, Assumptions -> Re[D] >= 2 && t > 0]]      which indicates that D must be less than 2. If I now use the additional assumption `D<2` with `Assuming[{t>0,D<2},` Mathematica says that the integral no longer converges. (Also with exchanged places for the integration variables, the integral can no longer be calculated). Can anyone solve the mystery? Thanks, Tobias
