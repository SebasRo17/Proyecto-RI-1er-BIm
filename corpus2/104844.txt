## Some background I've started programming when I was about 10 years old and truly loved it ever since. This year I've graduated from a mediocre university with a CS degree in Eastern Europe and two months later got a job offer at Google in Mountain View as a software engineer. ## The problem The problem is with my education - when I went through any curriculum from the top 10 US universities (an a lot of my co-workers are from such universities), and watched some of the online-available video lectures from these universities and the assignments that their students had during their studies, I've noticed that my university does not even come close to their level. I just feel that I was wasting time at my university, when I see that others got incomparably better training in CS. I would say that the courses at my university covered at most 30% of what the top-10 universities did - despite having identical classes. They just have better teachers, better curriculum, harder projects, better resources and they go more in-depth. Now, I feel quite comfortable with solving algorithmic problems, with programming in general, but still - each time I look at any of the undergraduate courses in these universities I find a lot of nuances that weren't covered in my classes. Some of them are significant, other less. ## The question Now being in the US, being financially and legally able to afford paying for an undergraduate CS course - is it worth going to one of the top 10 US universities and complete a second CS bachelor degree to fill in the gaps left over my first degree?
