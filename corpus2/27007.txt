I have an image of concentric circles, I would like to find the radii of the circles (only the innermost few are important). I've had a go using what I could find in previous posts, but am a bit confused about which method I should be using - if I need MorphologicalComponents, or whether to use SelectComponents "count" or "equivalentradius", or colornegate etc. Sometimes the circles are broken (especially when I binarize), so I need to look for incomplete circles too.. So far I have:               i = Import["http://i.imgur.com/oTTM9MG.jpg"];     b = Binarize[i, {0.3, 1}];     m = MorphologicalComponents[b];     c = SelectComponents[m, {"Count", "Holes"},         1000 < #1 < 20000 && #2 > 0 &] // Colorize     ComponentMeasurements[c, {"Centroid", "EquivalentDiskRadius"}]      or, using :               i = Import["http://i.imgur.com/oTTM9MG.jpg"];     disk = ColorNegate[Binarize[i, {0.3, 1}]];     rings = ComponentMeasurements[        disk, {"Centroid", "EquivalentDiskRadius"},         450 <= #1[[1]] <= 550 && 325 <= #1[[2]] <= 375 &&           10 <= #2 <= 500 &];     Show[{disk,        Graphics[{{Red, Circle[rings[[1, 2]][[1]], rings[[1, 2]][[2]]]}}]}]      Am I making it harder than it is? Could someone bump in the right direction? both this, How to find circular objects in an image? and this, Finding the centroid of a disk in an image were helpful (but I need to expand it to multiple circles and fit partial circles). Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wAPnJ.png)
