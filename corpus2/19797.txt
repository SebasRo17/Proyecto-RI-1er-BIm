I'm trying to compute a multidimensional integral with a variable number of dimensions. The integral is as follows: $$ \int d^{3N}\\!p~e^{-\frac{\beta}{2m}\vec p^2}. $$ I have tried this               Integrate[e^(-a*{p1,p2,p3}^2),{{p1,p2,p3}^N,-Infinity,Infinity}]      but it's not working at all. I guess I have to determine the vector before, or? More generally, to what extent can _Mathematica_ compute such integrals for arbitrary $N$ and arbitrary integrands in place of $e^{-\frac{\beta}{2m}\vec p^2}$?
