I'm using _Mathematica_ to compare some constants. Before playing around with those constants, I would like to check that I didn't make any mistake in typing them. So my question is the following: "What is the command that return the expression I typed?" Just to be clear. The expression               4*Sum[Log[Gamma[k]], {k, 3, IntegerPart[n] + 2*(n - IntegerPart[n])}]      returns: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RvG3h.png) And that is what I want. On the other hand, the expression               Sum[(2*n - 2*m - 1)*Log[n*(m + 1)], {m, 0, IntegerPart[n] - 1}]      returns: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/962bs.png) and that is what I want to avoid!
