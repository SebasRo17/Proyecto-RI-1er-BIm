I love writing unit tests and agree they are an excellent way to test code, prevent regressions, etc. However, I find myself unable to write them much as the vast majority of the code I work on day-in and day-out is application code that displays a UI to the user. Is there a good way of unit testing application code? What are the best practices here? I am not looking for a specific answer such as a framework, etc. But rather, in general, how do you approach this problem?
