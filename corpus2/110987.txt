When you track down and fix a regression—i.e. a bug that caused previously working code to stop working—version control makes it entirely possible to look up who committed the change that broke it. Is it worth doing this? Is it constructive to point this out to the person that made the commit? Does the nature of the mistake (on the scale of simple inattentiveness to fundamental misunderstanding of the code they changed) change whether or not it's a good idea? If it is a good idea to tell them, what are good ways to do it without causing offense or causing them to get defensive? Assume, for the sake of argument, that the bug is sufficiently subtle that the CI server's automated tests can't pick it up.
