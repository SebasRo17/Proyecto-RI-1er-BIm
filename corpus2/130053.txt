So, I am getting some years under my belt in long term programming. I have noticed, however, when the frequency and duration started increasing in my coding sessions that when I actually went to write a paper, email, document, or anything else that required writing more than a few sentences that my writing quallity appeared to suffer. I started forgetting the basic rules and vocabulary of written English. I am now going back for my Masters and find that writing papers does not come as easy as it used to. I remember thinking to myself how my Creative Writing class back in my freshman year of college helped a great deal in writing for my other classes. Hate to say it, but it feels like I could use a refresher. Also, my hand writing has especially not got any better! I feel inclined to say it's a side-effect of long term programming but want know any if real studies have been done or just from personal experience from programmers.
