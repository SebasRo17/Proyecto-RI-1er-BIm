I need to create some Java interfaces to query some database tables and some web services for new framework I'm building. In a previous Java Spring web application, I used Java Beans to handle the results of the query. In this case, I need to write some interfaces to publish the methods that will be available to end users. I'm a little bit of a newbie in this particular aspect of Java and I was wondering: is it better to allow the end user to see and use the Java beans in JSP, or to hide them using some generic type?
