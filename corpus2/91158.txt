I have a question which I think can be best answered here. I am pretty good with `C++`, good as in I am comfortable with the language, I have read `Accelerated C++` and done almost all the exercises. However, I have a big problem. Do I need to learn `C`? I have never done `C` ever in my life. I just started with `C++` when I started with programming. Probably cause I was always interested in knowing why everyone calls the language so complex. Now though I know the answer to that question ;) I am particularly interested in knowing whether I can survive without knowing `C` in today's world. Like if I give an interview in a company, if I tell them that I don't know `C` \- will they take it as OK? The two languages I am good with is Python and C++. I am asking this cause I have heard that companies ask data structures in interviews. So if they ask me to implement it, and if I do it in C++, is it acceptable? And people who say 'how can you not know C when you C++', please don't reply :) No offense, but I fail to understand why learning C is prerequisite.
