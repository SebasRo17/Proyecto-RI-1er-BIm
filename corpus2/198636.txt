Are there any languages that support foreach over multiple lists at once? Something like this:                foreach (string a in names, string b in places, string c in colors) {           // do stuff with a, b, c      }      Sure, this can be done with a regular for loop:                for (int n = 0; n<max, n++) {           a = names[n]; b = places[n]; c = colors[n];      }      but this loses the abstraction of foreach. My meager google-fu only reveals people asking how to do multi-foreach in various languages that don't support it. I'm guessing that _some_ language uses it, I just can't figure out which one.
