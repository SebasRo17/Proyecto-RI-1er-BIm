Can somebody explain this notation to me? Using _Mathematica_ 's first example in the `NDSolve` documentation:               s = NDSolve[{y'[x] == y[x] Cos[x + y[x]], y[0] == 1}, y, {x, 0, 30}]      The output is:               {{y -> InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,30.}}, <>]}}      What do all the curly brackets and the angle signs indicate? Why is there no indication of dependence on `x`? I'm also curious why you have to use this result in what I consider to be an awkward way:               Plot[Evaluate[y[x] /. s], {x, 0, 30}, PlotRange -> All]      as opposed to simply:               Plot[s, {x, 0, 30}, PlotRange -> All]
