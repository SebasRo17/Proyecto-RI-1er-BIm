I know that it's possible to call .NET code from your VBA code, but why does VBA continue to exist? The only reason I can think about is legacy. I just had to sort a `Scripting.Dictionary` and the amount of code needed was frightening. The IDE looks like Visual Studio 2003. And there are many little details, that drive you insane (Like changing the line, and getting a warning because of some compilation error). Or, if you open more than one spreadsheet, it mixes into you "VBAProject" and this is really confusing. The whole module/classmodule/form division is actually not that bad, but I end up everytime with directly writing logic in forms, or having one huge module that handles everything. Why can't I press Alt+F11, and hack in C#?
