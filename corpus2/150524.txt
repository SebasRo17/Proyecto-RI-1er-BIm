I've heard a few times that every extra [number1] milliseconds it takes to process a web request and return a response will lose you [number2] percent of users. Is this just "conventional wisdom," or have there been actual studies on the subject? And has there been found to be a lower bound to this phenomenon, like "[number3] milliseconds is fast enough, improving further than that won't hold any more users"?
