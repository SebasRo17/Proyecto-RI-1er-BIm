`ParametricPlot3D` can be used with one or two variables to plot paths and surfaces in 3-D such as               ParametricPlot3D[{x + y, x y, Sin[x] + Cos[y]}, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      However, say I wanted to plot a 3-D solid where the x, y and z coordinates are defined in terms of 3 variables. Is there some way to use `ParametricPlot3D` or other Mathematica functions to perform this task? A simple test case could be               ParametricPlot3D[{x, y, z}, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1}]      which should output a cube.
