I was reading a blog post over at Channel 9 about the release of an open source .NET/CLR decompiler. I was wondering as to why would you want to decompile a .NET/CLR application and look at its IL code? I'm just curious. **[Edit]** And are there any use for decompilers during the development phase? **[Edit]** I'm a little perverse; I want to know when was the last time you used a decompiler for a software development project, and why?
