If I define               g[z_] := Which[       0 <= z <= 0.9,     5*(Min[0.1, z] - Max[0, z - 1]),       0.9 <= z <= 1.1,   5*(Min[0.1, z] - Max[0, z - 1]) + 5*(Min[1, z] - Max[0.9, z - 1]),       1.1 <= z <= 2,                                       5*(Min[1, z] - Max[0.9, z - 1]),       True,              0       ]      and plot using               Plot[g[z], {z, 0, 2}]      I get ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Auvv.png) while if I plot using               ListPlot[{#, g[#]} & /@ (Range[1000]/500), PlotRange -> All, Joined -> True]      I get ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EEG4F.png) which is what I expect. Why does `Plot` fail to plot my function as expected?
