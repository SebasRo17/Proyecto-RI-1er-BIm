Not talking about the recent Java/Oracle debacle here, but something I've been wondering recently. When I first started programming, Java was the big thing client-side, however these days you hardly ever see a Java applet whereas Flash and Javascript are ubiquitous. Where did Java go wrong? Did Sun decide to concentrate on the server-side and let client-side stagnate? How did Flash become dominant over Java? Flashy (no pun intended) graphics? Marketing? Never having been a Java developer, I've not followed this closely so I'm interested to hear your thoughts.
