I am novice developer. While development is going on, we come across different error issues. However for the novice of programming, it is always hard to directly understand them & solve them. I believe, errors are generally related to typing error OR data structure error OR run-time memory error - which is related to hardware OR else. How to elaborate and solve those errors very fast ?
