There are many masters degree programs in computer science online offered by reputable organizations. However, I've found very few bachelors only degree programs offered by non for-profit institutions. I am looking for a degree in computer science and also any programs for entrepreneurship/management or algorithmic trading. I've found only 2 programs so far that fit: http://www.regis.edu/regis.asp?sctn=cpcis&p1=ap&p2=cs&p3=ol http://depaul.edu Requirements: 100% online undergraduate non-profit Options: Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Arts Bonuses: accelerated recognized ABET cost effective Update: I've answered my question with a list. If anyone knows an online program that combines skills in entrepreneurship (getting capital, starting a business) or algorithmic trading with a computer program that would be ideal.. maybe too much to ask though
