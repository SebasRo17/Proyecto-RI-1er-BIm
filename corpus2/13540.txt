I have enabled comma as my decimal separator, which means that comma still acts normally and when pressing period it will be converted to a comma. In the header I would like to make a period, so I insert a period and it looks like a period, however when I view the print preview, the period is converted to a comma. How do I keep this from happening or is there a special period character that doesn't get converted to a comma? Alternatively how can I make the header plain text, as this behaviour doesn't occur in plain text mode? **Edit:** Answering @SjoerdC.deVries questions:   1. With header I mean the option you set with `File > Printing Settings > Headers and Footers...`   2. The setting to change the decimal separator was found in Mathematica under `Preferences > Appearance > Numbers > Formatting > Decimal point character`   3. The period is the normal period key, not one on the keypad, although I would think they act similar.
