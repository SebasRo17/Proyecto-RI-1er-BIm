Is it possible to create a full-screen graphics without any front end elements like cell brackets and scrollbars? The zero approximation can be               {{{z, w}, {z, h}}} = FullScreenArea /. (ScreenInformation /.           Options[$FrontEnd, ScreenInformation]);     CreateDocument[       Graphics[{EdgeForm[Green], Rectangle[{0, 0}, {w, h} - 1], Red,          AbsolutePointSize[1], Point[{100, 100}]},        PlotRange -> {{0, w - 1}, {0, h - 1}}, ImageSize -> {w, h}],       WindowSize -> Full];      As a result I expect a black screen with green border of one pixel width and one red pixel. I guess some options are missing to do the job, but there are quite many places one could try to put them to, so I expect someone more familiar with this functionality will respond.
