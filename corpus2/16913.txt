Before my current job, I was always involved in the technical aspects of a project like:   * architecture   * design   * performance   * security   * etc Now I'm team lead of a project that's a game on a web site (not mine) and somehow got involved in the business side of the project:   * what users expect   * ads showing in which pages of the site   * mechanics of the game   * etc But I quite don't agree with business people's (customer or product owner if you like) decisions of the directions of the site. Of course I raise my concerns, some of them are taken into account, most of them aren't. I continue my work as usual as I like working here but I feel like the product would be better than what it is now. I think that's because my goal is to make an interesting and challenging game, and theirs is to attract as many people and earn money as possible (it's a paid game). Have you guys ever happened to be in this kind of situation? What are your experiences?
