Often working with various jars and exploring the features specially in corner cases, I often realize and think that how is that they thought that it might be a useful scenario somewhere in future that it might be used and an API is made handy. So, how do they come to the conclusion what shall be provided and what not? Other problem I faced once was that I was in need of a certain feature and it was missing from the list which struck me with immense drawback of using API's. Shouldn't it be that if some feature is missing then programmer should be able to program it himself rather than depending entirely on APIs all the time?
