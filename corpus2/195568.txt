Been brushing up on my C++ lately, on Ubuntu QQ. I love the Qt framework for everything, especially building GUI's. I became quite familiar with it when using PyQt over the last few years. When using PyQt, I had some issues that are now more pronounced when using C++ with Qt: **Qt has many extensions to C++ that are Qt specific** \- QString being just one common example, not to mention automated garbage collection. It is possible to write Qt applications using C++ without knowing much at all about C++ and the STL. I may have to hit the job market again soon and I'd like to be able to consider C++ positions - but I'm afraid binding myself too much to Qt will limit my abilities to work with generic C++, which were once quite formidable but are now long dormant and rusty. Should I avoid Qt? Would I be better off using WxWidgets or GTK++ for building GUI's? What's the best GUI framework to use that allows/requires the most use of generic C++ and the STL? How do I make myself most marketable as a C++ programmer when it comes to GUI frameworks, etc?
