I have been frequently asked questions like "Rate yourself in java" It goes like interviewer : Rate yourself in java on the scale of 10 me: 9 interviewer : Rate yourself in J2EE me : 8 .... But really I just come up with arbitrary numbers. Sure I know Java well , but what does it mean to say "9 out of 10" . I think it is a very subjective question, that does not make sense overall. The problem is ,if I say 9 , If I am not able to answer any question , the interviewer might think , "this guy just said 9" . On the other hand If I said 6 , there is a good chance the interviewer might think "He rates himself this low...not good" How do you respond to such questions ?
