I started with PHP a little while ago. I've been doing a lot of tutorials, practice sites, etc. and it's going great. One thing I like about PHP is how easy it is to get started (downloading WAMP and voila). However, up until I learned about PEAR and MVC frameworks, I haven't put much thought in using a command line Interface for PHP development... I've not really used the command line that much and it will take me some getting used to, so a couple of questions I have are: What are the most common uses of the Command Line when developing websites and web applications with PHP? Can you run MVC frameworks such as Zend, CakePHP, etc without ever using it? Besides PEAR, are there any other PHP repositories that use the command line to work? (It seems if you want to avoid using PEAR there are countless other PHP Classes/libraries on the internet that one could download and then simply copy and paste files into your site.)
