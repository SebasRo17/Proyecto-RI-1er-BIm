I need to save the result of GraphicsRow command as a pdf or jpg file. Something like `GraphicsRow[{plt1,plt2,plt3}] -> pdf`. On clicking on the image there is not a "Save Graphics as" option that one finds on a Plot output. In the end, I need to add arrows and annotations to the whole output and save it as a single jpg or pdf file. I can add stuff but I can't get the output saved unless I issue the command `Export["test.pdf", %]`. What am I missing?
