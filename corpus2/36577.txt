Here are some of the terms and conditions set forward by my employer. Does these make sense for a job like programming? >   1. No freelancing in any way even in your free time outside company work > hours (may be okay. May be they wanted their employees to be fully > concentrating on their full time job. Also they don't want their employees > to do similar work for a competing client. Completely rational in that > sense). -> So sort of agreed. >   2. Any thing you develop like ideas, design, code etc while I'm employed > there, makes them the owner of that. Seriously? Don't you think that its bad > (for me)? If I'm to develop something in my free time (by cutting down sleep > and hard working), outside the company time and resource, is that claim > rational? I heard that Steve Wozniak had such a contract while he was > working at HP. But that sort of hardware design and also those companies pay > well, when compared to the peanuts I get. >   3. No other kind of works allowed. Means no open source stuffs. Fully > dedicated to being a puppet for the employer, though the working environment > is sort of okay. According to my assessment this place would score a 10/12 > in Joel's test. > So are these terms okay especially considering the fact that I'm underpaid with peanuts?
