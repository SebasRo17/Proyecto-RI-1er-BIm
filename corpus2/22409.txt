I'm trying to create an interface with _Mathematica_. However, I need some instructions concerning the code below. This is about 10% of what I have in mind, but first I need to know how can I create `ns` `InputField`s after `ns` is defined by the user making a choice from the popup menu.               ns : number of station     sf : sound frequency     ws : width of window      * * *               CreateWindow[       DialogNotebook[       {         TextCell["Number of Stations: "],         PopupMenu[Dynamic[ns], Range[2, 8]],              TextCell["Sound Frequency (kHz): "],         InputField[Dynamic[sf], String, FieldSize -> 7],              TextCell["Window Size (ms): "],         InputField[Dynamic[ws], String, FieldSize -> 7],              TextCell["Calculation Start relative to the Window (ms): "],         InputField[Dynamic[cs], String, FieldSize -> 7],              ChoiceButtons[{DialogReturn[{retNS = ns, retSF = sf, retWS = ws, retCS = cs}]}]       },       WindowTitle -> "Fluvial Acoustic Tomography Configuration"]];
