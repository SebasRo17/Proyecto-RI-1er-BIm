I think I have good enough reputation on SO now. Well, this may not be that much as compared to so many other users out there but I am happy with mine. So, I was thinking of adding my profile link on my résumé - just the profile link and not that "I have this much reputation on SO". Those who haven't seen, can see this question Would you put your stackoverflow profile link on your CV / Resume? How would this look like? > **Forums/Blogs/Miscellaneous others** > > No blogging as yet but active participant in Stackoverflow. My profile link > - `http://stackoverflow.com/users/userId/username` I think of putting this section after **Project Details** and **Technical Expertise** sections. Any tips/advice? **Update** MKO has made a very good point \- > do you really want a potential employer to be able to evaluate in detail > everything you've ever written on SO I thought of commenting but it would be too long -   In my questions/answers I put a lot of statements like - "AFAIK ...", "following are my assumptions so far ...", "am I correct to conclude that... ?", "I doubt if it is possible to ..." etc. when I am not sure about something and I rarely involve in fights with other users. However I do argue on topics sometimes if I feel it is necessary and if I have a valid point. I do accept my mistakes and apologize for the same. As we all know nobody is perfect. I must have written many things which may be judged as wrong by a potential employer. But what if the same employer notices that I have improved in the quality of content by comparing old content with new one? Isn't that great? I also try to go back to older questions/answers and put corrective comments etc. when I feel I was wrong or if I can improve my post. Of course there are many employers who want you (potential employees) to be correct each and every time. They immediately remove you from consideration when you say a single incorrect thing. I have personally met such an interviewer few months back. He didn't even care to listen to any good thing I had done after he found a single wrong thing. Now the question is do you really care to work with such people? Or do you like those people who give value to the fact that you are striving to improve every day. I personally prefer the latter.
