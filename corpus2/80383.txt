When you find a new open source library / project, what criteria do you look at before incorporating it into your source base.   * Are there legal questions you need to answer?   * Do you look for a certain amount of development velocity?   * Is the community buzz a good enough reason?   * Does your decision change if you are the one on the line for the project?   * Does the complexity of the domain or code change your way you think about it?
