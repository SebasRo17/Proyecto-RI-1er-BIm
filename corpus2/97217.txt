In C++ and other influenced languages there is a construct called Structure (`struct`), and another called the `class`. Both are capable of holding functions and variables. Some differences are:   1. Class is given memory in the heap and `struct` is given memory in the stack   2. Class variable are private by default and in `struct` they are public My question is: was the `struct` somehow abandoned for Class? If so, why? Other than the differences above, a `struct` can do all the same things that a class does. So why abandon it?
