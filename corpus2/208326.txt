I've looked around for a solution (preferably not hosted, something I can run locally) to do static analysis of a codebase over time for things like SLOC, Complexity, authors, commits, etc. It has to work with subversion, and I have to have some way of getting that "raw data" out in csv. Ultimately I want to write a small R app against the results to view some interesting graphs and do things with the resulting data (like overlaying commits or SLOC against deadlines or tags/releases). Does anyone know if any open source solutions exist that do this? I think really all we want is a way of extracting subversion information for the commits, and statically analyzing the code for that given commit, and being able to aggregate all that and export as .csv (for import into R). I **think** sonar does some of this, but I don't think it will do this sort of analysis or data capture across a codebase's history (ie- looking at subversion from day 1 and capturing commits per day, SLOC, complexity over time, etc). The static analysis I'll need to be done is over Java and JavaScript.
