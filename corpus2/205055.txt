I am writing a RESTful service in Java, of course it's typical HTTP based interface. I am wondering should the service provide Java interface which has same semantic to the RESTful interface? I think Java interface will ease other Java code to call the service. (Client Java code doesn't need to use HTTP client to trigger HTTP requests to invoke RESTful) The problem is it's difficult to write same semantic Java interface to a RESTful one, I mean same semantic. Any advice for the design? Thanks!
