I've recently been investigating SpecFlow and can see the value of it for writing client/stateholder specs which can show a feature's progress however I'm nervous of introducing them to a client... Imagine a feature:               Given I'm on the "MyAccount" page        And I enter "Liath" into the "Name" textbox     When I click "Save"     Then my username should be "Liath"      We write these features, show the client a set of red icons and set the developers to work. If our developer completes the happy path then the icon will go to green and the client will see that feature is complete. However our developer knows that they've still got to consider things like:   1. Checking the username to see if it's in use   2. Checking the username for profanity   3. Handle errors from the database   4. Some form of validation to ensure the username uses only valid characters Clearly if a client sees a row of green lights they will be reluctant to continue paying for the rest of the development, it will look like we're trying to stretch out the work. What is the value of these tests as a progress indicator if they indicate work is completed long before it is? What techniques would we need to use to give a more accurate example of progress?
