I have a command line that generates lists as output and is running in a loop, so generates, multiple long lists. Each list is to be exported as a .txt file. How can I automate the name generation of the output files. I intend to use the same name as the input file but with the .txt extension in output of course.               For[       i = 1,i < 3,i++,       outdata = ReadList[ test[[i]], Record, RecordSeparators -> {{">"},{" "}} ];       Print[outdata]       ]      How can I automate the export?
