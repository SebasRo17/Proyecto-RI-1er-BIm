I am a beginning programmer and I was recently working on some primitive GUI apps in Java. That's where I encountered different layout managers. I browsed the web and it says that for advanced GUI creation there are NetBeans and Qt and a lot of other stuff. My question is: Do I really need to learn all ins and outs of layout managers and try to program without advanced layout engines to understand how they work or should I start learning NetBeans right away and skipping the whole manual layout complications? Is there any use for manual layouting beyond Java in other languages? In other words, will my road be less bumpy in the future if I go learn it in detail, or should I just forget about doing manual layouts?
