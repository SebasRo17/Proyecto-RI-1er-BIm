I have a free software web application that using other free software scripts for appearance. I have trouble to decide whether should I copy source code of used scripts to my project main repository or list them as dependencies and ask user (who installs application to his server) to install them himself? Since some of scripts solving browser compatibilities issues and I'm not a good web designer (i hate to check my web site on IE to see compatibility) using the newest version of scripts is preferable and second solution works here. But it has problem with scripts aren't backward-compatible with versions I've used them for development. Maybe another method is well-known for this issues that I don't know them.
