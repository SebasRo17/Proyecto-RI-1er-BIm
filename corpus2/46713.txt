Let's consider two tables given by               T1 = Table[{i,j,f1[i,j]},{i,0,2},{j,0,3}];     T2 = Table[{i,j,f2[i,j]},{i,0,2},{j,0,3}];      The functions `f1` and `f2` are expensive to compute, so that I want to compute the tables `T1` and `T2` only one time. I now want to obtain the table `T3` defined as               T3 = Table[{i,j,f1[i,j] f2[i,j]},{i,0,2},{j,0,3}];      However, as I already know `T1` and `T2`, I want to estimate `T3` without any reevaluation of `f1` and `f2`, but using only operations on the already known tables `T1` and `T2`. How would you perform such an operation on the lists ?
