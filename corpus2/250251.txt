I am using Python. I have two columns(in separate CSVs) that contain an ID tag. Ideally, I would like to add on columns of information from one CSV to the other whenever the ID tag matches. For the most part, the tags are hand and hand, however, there might be times where one ID tag is missing, and if that happens, I would like it to just continue through. Here is an example of the data: From 1: ID   1   2   3   4   5 From 2: ID VariableX Variable Y missing......................................                     2     X1          Y1      missing........................................ 4 x4 y4                     5     x5          y5      I would like to take the values from variable x and y and add those columns onto the first file (with only the ids) whenever the IDs match from each file. Another thing to note, these IDs will show up from time to time again periodically (maybe every 3-400 times). If anybody could help with this topic, I would really appreciate it! Thank you!
