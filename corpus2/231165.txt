I am a first-time azure developer and I am taking over a single-tenant cloud system and have been tasked with converting the system to multi-tenant. What is the correct practice to separate each tenant's sql server data? Its a data collection & reporting system. Each tenant will want to build and run their own custom reports on the data. So in multi-tenant, how are tenants prevented from seeing each others data?
