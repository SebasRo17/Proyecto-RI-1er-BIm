The equation I am trying to solve is: $$q \, T_1''(x)-T_1(x)(f-b \, g+i\,w \, p)=T(f_1-b \, g_1)-g_1\tag{1}$$ My professor says that $(1)$ can be solved by using Green's function $G(x,y)$, where $G(x,y)$ is the solution of this equation: $$q\,G''(x,y)-G(x,y)\,(f-b\,g+i\,w\,p)=\mathrm{Dirac}(x-y)\tag{2}$$ The boundary conditions are: $$G(L/2,y)=0 , G(-L/2,y)=0\tag{3}$$ And I tried to solve $(2)$:               eq1 = D[g[y], {y, 2}] - a*g[y] - DiracDelta[x - y]     ans1 = DSolve[{eq1 == 0, g[-L] == 0, g[L] == 0}, g[y], y]     greenfunction1 = g[y] /. ans1[[1]]      But it does not work. However when I take out the constant $a$, it works:               eq1 = D[g[y], {y, 2}] - g[y] - DiracDelta[x - y]     ans1 = DSolve[{eq1 == 0, g[-L] == 0, g[L] == 0}, g[y], y]     greenfunction1 = g[y] /. ans1[[1]]      Why does _Mathematica_ fail to evaluate my first query? Also, when I get the Green's function, I have to into solution of equation (1)which is;               Integrate[(T[y](f_1-bg_1)-g_1)g[y],{y,-L/.2,L/.2}]      where T(x) is; T(x)= 2*C1*cosh(x*((f_0-b*g_0)/q)^0.5)+g/(f_0-b*g_0) (4) Then C1 has to be determined from boundary condition. T(+L/2)=0 T(-L/2)=0 The g_zero has to be determined from constant temperature condtion. 1/L*integral[T(x),{x-L/2,L/2}]=Tw-Tam Then I found T(x) in Matlab. When I tried to solve Green Function part, I could not do it in Matlab. I deceided to move Mathematica. Now I want to solve all parts in Mathematica. This is my Matlab code for T(x);               clc;     clear all;     Tw = 250;          Tam = 27;          resist=5.6e-8;          diameter=5e-6;          h=5700;          k=190;          f = pi()*diameter*h;          b = 0.0044;          q = 0.25*pi()*k*diameter^2;          L = 1.25e-3;          syms c x g          T = 2*c*cosh(x*((f-b*g)/q)^0.5)+g/(f-b*q);          c = solve(subs(T,'x',L/2)==0,c)          z = simplify(int(subs(T,'c',c),x,-L/2,L/2))          g = solve(z==L*(Tw-Tam),g)          T      I want to solve T and T_1 in Mathematica. Above I tried to solve Green Function code , but I could not put Green function and T into integration of T_1. Sorry about text writing. I tried a lots of time copying from Mathematica , however its format did not match with here. Thank you Yusuf
