If I plot a surface with mesh lines, they show up fine (of course). However, if the surface is even just a little transparent, they get quite rough. Compare this to setting the Opacity to 1:                 ParametricPlot3D[{4 + (3 + Cos[v]) Sin[u], 4 + (3 + Cos[v]) Cos[u],         4 + Sin[v]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 2 Pi},         PlotStyle -> Opacity[.99],        MeshStyle -> Thickness[.005],         ImageSize -> 800,        Axes -> False, Boxed -> False]      Here are the results: ![rough lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z9Fbo.jpg) ![smooth lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hfenx.jpg) How can I get proper smooth lines and use Opacity at the same time? UPDATE (Aug. 9, 2014): Wolfram tells me that "this is an issue with rendering transparent 3D objects on Linux systems using Intel graphics hardware." It has to do with "depth peeling".
