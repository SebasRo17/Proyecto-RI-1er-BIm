I am a dev who mostly uses the Microsoft stack (C#/Silverlight/WPF/ASP MVC/.net framework) Although I am adding HTML5/CSS3/shivs/jQuery when using ASP.net MVC. I have the opportunity to do some Android mobile phone work but am unsure if/how my current skillset would apply. Anyone out there made this crossover transition? What new skillset is involved? What IDE development software would I need? # UPDATE: Thanks everyone for pointing me in a good directions! As a result, I took a couple of hours to check out Eclipse & the Android sdk plugin. So far, I find many comforting similarities between android and the MS stack that I’m used to. ## These are my discoveries (maybe help some noobs like me!): \--The Eclipse+AndroidSDK development environment is complete, understandable and is very much like visual studio. \--Java is very “c#-like”. \--Android separates the code (.java) from the layout markup (.xml). \--Android’s layout markup is very much like silverlight. \--Android has built-in basic controls with basic styling. \--Android has some really useful built-in widgets! (I’m guessing it accepts custom add-in widgets also?) \--Android Activities are like c# classes: methods/local properties + class- wide properties. Create instance & use them. \--Activity lifecycles are understandable: Overrides -- onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onStop(), onRestart(), onDestroy(). \--Android connects user events with event-handlers through the use of Listeners. \--Android uses a lot of “magic string” references in both .xml and .java (Oh- noooooo!) \--Found a great YouTube series “android tutorial & lessons” by CornBoyzAndroid (more than 30 informative episodes!) \--Android does try/catch/finally for error catching similarly to c# ## I’m still exploring, and I’m sure I’ll find answers to my further questions, like: \--How does android deal with remote and local data? (database access, local storage, Linq). \--How does android do asynchronous or long-lasting work? (callbacks, polling, sockets). \--I see android exposes threading…possibly useful, but I need more info. \--Does android have frameworks like MVVM or MVC and what about unit testing? Again, thanks everyone for your help!!! -- Mark
