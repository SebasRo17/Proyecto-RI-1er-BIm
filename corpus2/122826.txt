I want to know the rules of naming (AlwaysCapitalize, _underscore, firstSmallLetter, etc...) for each of Namespaces, Classes, Interfaces, Exceptions, Data Members, Methods, Variables, etc.... also I would like to know:   * Are they standards?   * Do they differ According to the access modifiers? (public, private.....)   * What about compiler and library reserved formats?   * Also are they Language, IDE, or Framework relative? I only know that these rules exist, but don't actually know any. Any help would be appreciated. * * * **EDIT:** OK, if the question is really wide, then I have to narrow my question: What are the naming rules of Classes, Interfaces, Data Members, and Methods in C# (and Java if possible). Also, inspired by Renesis's comment, I've created a wiki to write Coding Conventions, here's the link: http://codingconventions.referata.com/
