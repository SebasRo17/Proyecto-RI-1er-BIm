Are all scripting languages dynamically typed? I am using TCL. It is a scripting language and it does not enforce or allow type delaration of variables. It is instead a dynamically-typed language with ducktyping. The type of a variable is assumed by the interpreter according to the value assigned to it. I would really like to know is there are scripting languages that are strictly/strongly typed.
