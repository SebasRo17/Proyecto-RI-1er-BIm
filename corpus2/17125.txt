While visiting family over the holiday period, I managed to have some good mother-daughter bonding over how far back I’ve managed to trace the family tree (Mom is in her 80s and doesn’t do computers). I’ve been using the usual databases like Ancestry.com, familysearch.org and asking the odd question over on genealogy.SE when I get stuck. But I’ve also been lucky that certain old church records for parts of Kent in England have been scanned and the images available online. Unfortunately some of them are in poor condition, and I thought I could use Mathematica’s image processing capabilities to clean them up a bit. Take this example:               raw = ImageRotate[Import["http://goo.gl/er4c5"], 180 Degree];      Cleaning this up with `Sharpen` and some of the filters like `MeanShiftFilter` definitely helps.               sharpened = Sharpen[raw, 3]         s2 = MeanShiftFilter[sharpened, 2, 0.03, MaxIterations -> 20]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/drdLx.png) But there are still a lot of mildew blotches on the image. I’d like to fade out the things that look like disks, and darken the things that look like handwriting, but I have not yet found the iteration of things like `MorphologicalComponents` that would do the trick. I keep getting the background of the page as the connected component, so I can’t, for example used the `"Holes"` property to select handwriting and not mildew blotches. Does anyone have any suggestions? I’m quite unfamiliar with the image processing side of Mathematica.
