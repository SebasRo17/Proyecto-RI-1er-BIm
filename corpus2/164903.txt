I have noticed that Play! Framework encompasses persistence strategy (like JPA etc...) Why would a web framework care about persistence ?! Indeed, this would be the job of the server-sides components (like EJB etc...), wouldn't this? Otherwise, client would be too coupled with server's business logic. **UPDATE: One answer would be : it's more likely used for simple application including itself the whole business logics. However, for large applications with well-designed layers(services, domain, DAO's etc..), persistence is not recommended within web client layer since there would be several different web(or not) clients.**
