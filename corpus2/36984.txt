Is there a way to run both the front end(& kernel) locally while the having Mathematica's filesystem(inode's at minimum) reference another os's filesystem? For example currently I run Mathematica in Ubuntu, but I constantly have issues with Mathematica freezing. Could I run Mathematica inside Windows while running ubuntu in a virtual machine(or remotely) so I could still effectively interface with the linux OS(read and write calls at minimum). Although this is less the ideal, I am hopeful there might be some simple configs to modify. Ideally I am looking for a way to run a Mathematica Notebook both on a virtual machine OS(linux in the case) and the host OS(Windows in this case) but have the code interact as if it was running on the hosted OS. Considering there are a lot of different types of software that allows you to create virtual machines, let's assume for this question(unless a better idea is stated) that I am using either port forwarding or a bridge adapter and shared folders in Virtualbox as a way of communication.
