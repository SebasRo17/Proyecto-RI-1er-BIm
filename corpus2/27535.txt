ε = .1; A = 0; ω0 = 1; ωf = 0;      data =        NDSolve[         {x''[t] == ε (1 - x[t]^2) x'[t] - ω0^2*x[t] + A*Cos[ωf*t], x[0] == 1, x'[0] == 0},          {t, 0, 100}];     Periodogram[data, ScalingFunctions -> "Absolute", PlotRange -> All]      How would I create a suitable Power spectrum of the frequencies that this system has. For these set of values (at the top), there should ideally be only one unique frequency (ω0) since the other one is not in play. Mathematica's example of power spectra utilizes the periodogram funcition, although I don't really understand what it does mathematically, so there is room for using another type of graph.
