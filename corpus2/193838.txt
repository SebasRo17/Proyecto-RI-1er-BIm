I started developing websites using PHP. I have read many times that PHP is free and open source which is an advantage over ASP.net. However, due to my current job requirements, I had to switch to ASP.net which is pretty good. Now after developing few applications, I am wondering how can I publish them for free. As PHP is free and opensource, it was never an issue for me. What's bothering me is this. Suppose I developed a web application using Visual Studio Express (or Professional version or any other version)   * Do I need any special permission/license from Microsoft to host my application on Internet   * If I create a desktop application and want to distribute it for free on internet, is any license required.   * If no, then what are microsoft licenses all about and how is PHP free and ASP is not free Thanks!
