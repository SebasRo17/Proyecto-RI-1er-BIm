I am looking to understand, before I publish my application on the Windows Phone Marketplace, what is the best way to monetize it. I am looking at 3 options:   * Free, ads-based (no paid version)   * Time trial, no ads + paid full version   * Free trial (not time limited), ads based + paid full version, no ads DISCLAIMER: *All the ideas below assume that the app is actually good and people use it :) The goal is to make as much money as possible. I am not a big fan of the ads- based applications but it sounds to me that having a constant cash flow from ads can bring more money, long term, than getting a lump sum once. I mean, in order to get more money from a pay-only-once application, you need more customers while the ads based only requires people to use the app; the ads based, long term, can generate more money with a smaller user base that is loyal. What do you experts think? Did others research/have experience with the actual amount of money that can be generated in each scenario?
