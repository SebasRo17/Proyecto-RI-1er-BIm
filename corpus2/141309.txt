I am a self-taught, novice programmer. The language I chose was Objective-C, so that I can write Apple applications and software. I have learned the hard way that Objective-C has a steep learning curve, but I have forced myself to look at it over and over until I get it right. I feel I am completing one major step, and that is becoming very comfortable with the syntax. Now as I enter the next big step - finding out what is possible with a computer programming language - I am thinking that all software is just developed within the confines of:   * classes   * loops   * booleans   * IF/OR statements   * variables   * etc.  Is that a true assessment? When thinking of software in my head do I just need to learn to convert it all to the above? Right? Sorry if this question sounds funny, but I am just learning how to take the language in and talk (what I think is) the language of a computer. Is there a good book or tutorial that helps illustrate how to "speak as a computer would"?
