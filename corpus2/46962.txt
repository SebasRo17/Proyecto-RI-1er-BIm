I'd like to try to convert a piece of MIDI music made with SoundNote to another tuning (not microtonal or even split-black-keys, just a slightly different tuning for each note). I searched for pitch parameters and it seems it only accepts "C" or "Db", not frequencies, and plays the piece in 12-tone equal temperament. (Am I right? Or could I somehow make a MIDI note sounding at a different frequency than those pre-defined notes?) So I'm trying to recreate piano sound with Play function. I add some harmonics to a sine wave but the more I add, the worse it sounds. Adding attack and decay shouldn't be very hard but for adding the harmonics in right amounts, I'd need to sample. I could have access to a piano and get some sound samples. In what file format should I record them so that Mathematica could run a Fourier transform on it? What functions should I use? How do I give a sound file as an input? Or, is there any way to re-tune a MIDI file with some other program after I compose it with Mathematica and export?
