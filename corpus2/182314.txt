I was reading about some development interview practices, specifically about the technical questions and tests asked at interviews and I've stumbled quite a few times over sayings of the genre "Ok you solved the problem with a while loop, now can you do it with recursion", or "everyone can solve this with a 100 lines while loop, but can they do it in a 5 lines recursive function?" etc. My question is, is recursion generally better than if/while/for constructs? I've honestly always thought that recursion is not to be preferred, because it's limited to the stack memory which is a lot smaller than the heap, also doing a great number of function/method calls is suboptimal from a performance standpoint, but I may be wrong...
