I want to read a file which contains seven columns of real numbers. Mathematica seems to have a problem with the high precision I need. My code:               solFile = OpenRead["sol_Je9"];      data = ReadList[solFile, {Real, Real, Real, Real, Real, Real, Real}];     Close[solFile];      The error messages: > General::digit: Digit at position 1 in -239.916104094628030 is too large to > be used in base 10. ReadList::readn: Invalid real number found when reading > from sol_Je9. How can I fix this?
