I am using version 8 and I have the following code:               totals4 = {{1093, "AUSTRALIA"}, {235, "BELGIUM"}, {474, "BERMUDA"}, {187, "BRAZIL"}};     BarChart[#, ChartStyle -> "Pastel",               ChartLabels -> (Placed[Rotate[Style[#, Blue], Pi/3] & /@ #2, {{.5, 0}, {1, 1}}])              ] & @@ Transpose[totals4]      Is there a way to get the labels to be the same color as their respective bar? Thank you in advance. ![bar chart](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3X0OS.jpg)
