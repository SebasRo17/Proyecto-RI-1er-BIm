As a programmer, I enjoy embarking on small personal projects and I have a load of open source scripts that I host on github. I am very much a **programmer** and not a **designer**. However, it is inevitable that sometimes I am forced to _design_. These are usually cases where there is no point in paying for a designer, but it would be nice if the page looked good. Some examples are:   * Creating personal pages, _e.g. blog, showcase_   * Landing pages for my github scripts _(gh-pages)_   * Designing personal pages for friends These are all situations that have come up and I end up creating spaghetti style css sheets. So... what tools, tips, hints, general advice do you have to offer for us programmers who have little creative imagination?
