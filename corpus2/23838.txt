Clearly optimizing cache usages is bound to improve my program efficiency. Surprisingly, I don't see too many programming languages actually having this sort of a feature. So here's my question:   1. What kind of language constructs have you seen that help improving cache usage?   2. How to innovate on cache usage since most systems won't easily reveal stuff like their L1 cache size easily? (Windows does have API or maybe /proc/cpuinfo on Linux, but I am looking for something simpler for the intermediate developer)
