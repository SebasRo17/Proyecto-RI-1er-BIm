Is there a guide of some sort to important milestones while learning Ruby on Rails? I'm self-taught so I don't have a mentor to tell me these things. I've been learning Rails for 11 months, and think I'm making good progress, but I would like some informed feedback on whether I'm progressing nicely or if I need to ramp up my efforts, so I'm searching to see if such a guide exists online. Maybe someone wrote an appendix to a book they wrote on Rails, or a blog post? Something along those lines...
