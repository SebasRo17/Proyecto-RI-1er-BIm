When do you want (on purpose) to coerce type in JavaScript? I mean, beyond comparing strings and numbers, when does it benefit something you're building? Examples of type coercion:               "The answer is " + 42      //=> "The answer is 42"          "37" - 7      //=> 30          "37" + 7      //=> "377"          var foo = [0];     console.log(foo == foo);     //=> true          console.log(foo == !foo);     //=> true
