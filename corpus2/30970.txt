I try to filter sublists of a list which match a pattern.               test = {{"String1", "a"}, {"String2", "b"}, {"String3",      "a"}, {"String4", "a"}};      The result should be:               result = {{"String1", "a"}, {"String3", "a"}, {"String4", "a"}}      That means the first entry should be any String and the second should be "a". I tried:               Select[test, (# == {_, "a"}) &]      Which evaluates to {}.
