I'm pretty bad with naming things. The only name I can every generically come up with is 'helper'. Say, if I have a header file that contains helping functions for manipulating paths, I tend to put it inside my "helper" directory and call it "path-helper.hpp" or something like that. Obviouslly, that's a bad naming convention. :) I want to have a consistent naming scheme for my folder (and namespace) which I can use to always refer to my own headers and libraries, but I have trouble finding names that are easy to type or remember (like `boost`)... so I end up calling some of them "helper" or "stdext" or whatnot, which isn't a great idea. How do you find names for your libraries that are easy to remember and easy to type, and which aren't too generic (like "helper" or "std" or "stdext" or the like)? Any suggestions on how to go about doing this?
