I've been a freelance web developer for about three years, mostly dealing with non-framework based PHP projects. I'm thinking of moving on to an employer-based job, but I'm not sure what will be expected of me or how to prepare for the transition. What technologies, concepts, and patterns should I be focusing on to ensure I don't crash and burn once I leave the life of freelancing? What can I do to prepare myself for developing as part of a team?
