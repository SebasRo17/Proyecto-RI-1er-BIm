Consider:               "\бвгд" // FullForm     "\\бвгд" // FullForm      In v.8.0.4 I get this: > >     "\\:0431\:0432\:0433\:0434" >     "\\\:0431\:0432\:0433\:0434" >   But v.10.0.0 adds redundant backslash before the first backslashed Cyrillic symbol: > >     "\\\:0431\:0432\:0433\:0434" >     "\\\\:0431\:0432\:0433\:0434" >   ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HFbKC.png) As the result it is not possible to open any file which name (or name of a directory in the path) starts from a Cyrillic symbol. Also after evaluating the above (in the case the Cyrillic symbols were typed, not pasted in the Notebook) the following bugs appear:   * When I try to cut by pressing `Ctrl+X` any `Cell` or group of cells in this Notebook I get http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ opened in my browser and nothing changed in the FrontEnd   * After some additional editing (entering backslashed Cyrillic symbols after the quote `"` but without entering the closing quote and without evaluation of the cell) an attempt to cut an input cell by pressing `Ctrl+X` results in commenting all the code in the selected input cell. Pressing `Ctrl+X` again uncomments the code. All the above manipulations with `Ctrl+X` give this result when English keyboard locale is selected. Does anyone also observe this? Is there a workaround? P.S. OS Win7 x64.
