I'm trying to render a 3D image of a path by extruding a circular cross- section along the path, creating a "snake-like" path. Here is an image I found to illustrate: ![tube](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W47t1.jpg) I can't seem to figure out if there is a way to do this? I just found the `Tube` command; now I need to find a way to turn a set of points into a `Curve`. Basically, I need to find the necessary control points for a `BezierCurve` or a `BSpline` to fit a set of {x,y} coordinates. Can the `Interpolation` with the `Spline` method be used to generate a spline from a set of points?
