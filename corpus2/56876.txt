I'm leaving my current company, and I'm looking for a better place to work. But this time I'm confused. I don't want to walk in and out in six months again. I want to find a company which I can work in long-term, and this trouble me much... There is a problem, in my city, there's a lot of small companies (30-50 employees), so finding employee's feedback on Internet is nearly impossible. So I need to find it myself. So, I want to ask that, when you walk in an interview of a completely new company, what do you look at the job description? look at the company itself? look at its current employees? what do you ask your interviewer? How do you determine a company is worth-working for or not?
