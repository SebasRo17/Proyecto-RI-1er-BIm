Struggled for a while on this problem and hopefully you can help... I have a mathematical expression that currently has a symbol where I used to have a function variable. How do I make the symbol back into a variable, so that my expression becomes a function again? My function became an expression when I saved it in a matrix, and so now I'm trying to make the different matrix elements back into functions after having constructed the matrix. Thanks in advance. > INCLUDING SOME CODE (my first time contributing on this website...) Imagine a For loop sum (I've removed a substantial amount of code that's irrelevant for now)               Pstatesalpha[λ_]=0;     RankMatrix={};     elecdipole (*some vector of numbers delem*)     SumPstatesalpha[λ_, Alpharank_]  (*a predefined function of λ, Alpharank*)          For[Alpharank = 1, Alpharank <= 3, Alpharank++,(        For[jsum = 1, jsum <=Length[elecdipole], jsum++,(     Pstatesalpha[λ_] = (delem*a0)^2*SumPstatesalpha[λ,Alpharank] + Pstatesalpha[λ];        )]     AppendTo[RankMatrix, {Alpharank,Pstatesalpha[λ]}]     )]      Note that I've saved Pstatesalpha[λ] as a function into `RankMatrix`. When I want to access (for instance)               RankMatrix[[1,2]]      Mathematica returns an expression that includes $\lambda$, but I can't use it as a function anymore.
