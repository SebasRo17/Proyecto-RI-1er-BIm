I have a data cube containing pictures of a galaxy across a thousand wavelengths. I want to take the data for the image slides in the red and blue parts of the spectrum, and have them represented in the appropriate colours. If I could then superimpose the images somehow to show the red and blue regions of the galaxy together that would be fantastic. Currently I have been working with the raw data for each slide and the pixel magnitudes. To plot the galaxy at any given wavelength I've just being using a list density plot. I don't know how to map the range of images with a gradual colour change or how to combine them?
