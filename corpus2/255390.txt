I'm trying to get a high level understanding of mocks and stubs. My language/frameworks are ruby, rails, rspec, jasmine I heard this very high level definition:   * Mocks are used to represent objects themselves   * Stubs are used for methods of instances of objects and will return a value I've heard others say, no not at all. But I haven't heard a simple, high-level definition of them that has stuck. Most of the definitions are very wordy with lots of lower level details. I'm not sure if there's a clear rationale about when to use which either. Sure use a stub if you don't want to call the actual method of an instance (or it doesn't yet exist), but when does it make sense to use a mock?
