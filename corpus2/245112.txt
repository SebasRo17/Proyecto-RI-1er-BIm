Was put on hold at stack overflow: hopefully it has value here. I want to use a BDD / TDD / ATDD approach in c++. However I really want to emphasize vertical slices of end to end functionality rather than unit tests. There are plenty of unit testing frameworks. How would you go about in c++ authoring an approach that emulates a user story based testing framework. If you can avoid reinventing the wheel great otherwise i have no idea how to go about writing one from scratch. An example from another language would be specflow. The specific question is - if someone has done it lets use their work - otherwise how would you go about writing a framework like specflow in c++?
