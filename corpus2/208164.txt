I received an email for a web company position I applied to. They are asking me to provide a 1h time slot, so that they can make me pass a coding test. They'll send the test, start the time, and 1h after, I'll have to provide them what I came up with. This will be on Python and Javascript. I'm a developer since 18 months only, as I was a Unix SA for 15 years before this. Is it a common practice? How to prepare and is there any tests examples on the net? I cannot find any. Thanks
