I'm experiencing a strange behavior with Atmosphere + Long Polling. I'd like to have a broadcaster per user, so I have registered a broadcaster on resource suspension with id : /user/. I use Atmosphere on a clustered environnement, so I have configured to use an external broadcaster that use Hazelcast. (No chance for Redis, corporate rigidity). Everything seems to work, BUT all broadcasted messages never reach the browser.               Future<Object> f = BroadcasterFactory.getDefault().lookup("/user/foo").broadcast("my lovely message");     f.get()      I can see my pending request on each browser (Chrome/ Firefox), but no resume, and no response until the socket timeout to renew the connection. My environment :   * Servlet 3.0   * JBoss AS7 7.20   * Spring 3.2 + MeteorServlet   * Atmosphere 1.1.0RC1 (same with the most stable version) + jQuery Atmosphere
