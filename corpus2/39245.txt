I want to solve the following non-linear first order difference equation: $$ k_{t+1} = (1-a) k_t^{a} $$ with $0 < a < 1$, and $k_0 = \text{const.}$ . Of course, the solution is easily found, but I want _Mathematica_ to solve it. Using               RSolve[{ k[t + 1] == (1-a) k[t]^a, k[0] == k0}, k[t], t ]      gives               {{k[t] -> E^(((-1 + a^t) (I Ï€ + Log[-1 + a]))/(-1 + a)) k0^a^t}}      The solution is much simpler when considering the restriction on $a$. How can I tell _Mathematica_ that $a$ is between $0$ and $1$ when applying the `RSolve` command? P.S. I've played around with the `Reduce` command, using assumptions, but that did not help.
