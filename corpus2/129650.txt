Let's take CodeReview page as an example. If you go here, you will see the list of the questions with their vote numbers and comment numbers Now, I am wondering if these numbers are calculated on the fly (e.g. count the total comments in db for this question), or is there an actual field in the `questions` table called `voteCount` and it's incremented by one whenever someone votes for this question? Just another question. Both VoteCount and CommentCount are just integers, what about the user information that is displayed for each question? Hope this is the correct place to ask this question.
