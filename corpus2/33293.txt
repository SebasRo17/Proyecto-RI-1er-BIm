I started writing an application for Windows Phone marketplace, at the time only making sure that the name I gave it wasn't being used by any other app on the marketplace. I just found out that the same name is being used by a, seemingly popular, SourceForge project. Is this a problem? I haven't released my app yet so I could rename it, but I really like the name and would prefer not to unless it is an issue.
