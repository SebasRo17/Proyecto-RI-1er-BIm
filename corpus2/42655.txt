My question is about how to recognise objects in a image. I would like to recognise objects of the same color. Then I want to calculate the centroid of these objects. I want to apply this calculation on the image below. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xNI6h.gif) Based on the centroid it is possibe to calculate the xy-coordinate of the soccer players on this field. The difficulty is that the soccer players can wear a shirt and socks of the same color, but I will be happy if I can get an approximation.
