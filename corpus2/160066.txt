I've been studying a bit of algorithms and have been looking at sites like SPOJ.pl TopCoder etc. I've seen that programmers prefer C or C++ usually for most algorithmic programming contests. Now I've been having some trouble lately. I know both a bit of C and Python and when trying to write a code I seem to prefer Python over C for most algorithms. Everytime I sit down to write a code in C I give up after about 15 minutes because I find it too cumbersome and tend to move over to python. Passing matrices Pointers and so on seem to be useless time wasted that I could actually be utilizing to think about the algorithm itself. Now I know and have heard from a lot of people that C is a very important language and is the bread and butter of a lot of programmers out there. What I wanted to know was whether this approach of mine has any drawbacks/consequences/Disadvantages etc. This is not a Python vs C debate; This a question about how this specific practice of preferring python over C because of the ease of use will affect me or any other programmer/computer Scientist in the long run. * * * I'd love to hear from people who've used these languages in the industry/and or to develop large software/libraries etc.
