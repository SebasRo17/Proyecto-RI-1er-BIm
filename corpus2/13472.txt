When I want to define a function that uses a pattern, how should I localize the pattern name (i.e., `x_` localizing the symbol `x`)? I have traditionally used `Module` but Workbench seems to freak out at times that I have unused symbols. Is this just a bug in Workbench, or is there a proper way of doing this? **Edit** So I have been a bit vague in exactly what I mean. To clarify, suppose I make a function in Workbench as:               test[g_, f_] :=         Module[{x},             g /. f[x_] :> x         ]     ]      I will have an error on the `Module` line stating "the local variable 'x', is not used". Please note this example is just to give the bare minimum so that I get the Workbench error, and to illustrate what kind of localization I mean. That is I want to use a symbol for use in a pattern label, not as a variable.
