I updated my _Mathematica_ recently to 9.0.1 cause the previous version was giving me freaky result especially in `FindMinimumCostFlow` and `OptimumFlowData`. But even in new version I have problems.It can not still solve the multi-source multi-sink problem even the same example of _Mathematica_ documentation such as first of basic examples:               FindMinimumCostFlow[      Graph[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, {UndirectedEdge[1, 2],         UndirectedEdge[2, 3], UndirectedEdge[3, 4], UndirectedEdge[1, 5],         UndirectedEdge[5, 6], UndirectedEdge[6, 4], UndirectedEdge[2, 5],         UndirectedEdge[3, 6]}, {ImageSize -> 110,         VertexShapeFunction -> {"Name"}}],      {1, 3, 4, -3, -4, -1}]      After evaluation it doesn't return any result. Can somebody help me on that?
