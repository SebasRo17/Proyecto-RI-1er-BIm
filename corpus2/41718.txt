Currently I am working on creating the package on Mathematica version 9 on Windows 7. Here is my code as follows:               BeginPackage["mypackage`"]          Begin["`Private`"]          getColumn[data_,branch_List]:=     Module[{pos},     pos = Position[data,#][[1,2]]&/@branch;     data[[All,pos]]     ];          RemoveMissing[data_]:=DeleteCases[data,{date_,val_}/;!NumberQ[val]];          End[]          EndPackage[]      As you can see from the above that it contains two defined functions. I saved it as mypackage.m on my working directory. To make sure my working directory is the one that contains mypackage.m, I put `SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]]` in my notebook. Then, I call the package by using               Needs["mypackage`"]      Evaluating, but it seems not to load, because when I call the function `getColumn`, the letters should turn black if it is loaded (now it's still blue). Also, I tried other ways               `Needs["mypackage`","mypackage.m"]`      and               <<mypackage`      Both are still not working. I have two questions:   1. When we save .m file, is it necessary to have the same name as we defined in the BeginPackage[""]   2. Is there anything missing so my package does not work ? any suggestions ?
