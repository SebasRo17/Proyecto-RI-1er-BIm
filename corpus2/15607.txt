I know you can hit `F1` to pop up the documentation center, and then type the name of a function and search for it. I'd like to know if there's a key that just pops up the help page of the function the cursor is in right now. For instance, when writing `Integrate[`, sometimes I forget the right syntax for it, so I just want to immediately see the help page for it without having to manually search for it.
