I've seen these 2 guidelines in coding c# standard and Iâ€™m not sure the what the 2nd one means.   1. With the exception of zero and one, never hard-code a numeric value; always declare a constant instead.   2. Use the const directive only on natural constants such as the number of days of the week. What is the definition of a natural constants and if the number is not a natural constants given the 1st rule how does one declare a constant in c# without the const directive? So how is the 2nd rule not contradicting the 1st rule for non natural constants? See http://www.scribd.com/doc/10731655/IDesign-C-Coding-Standard-232 for reference.
