Consider the code below:               variable = Sin[x];     fun = Compile[{x}, variable ];     fun[1]      When I do this I get the error:                CompiledFunction::cfse: Compiled expression Sin[x] should be a machine-size real number       CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at instruction 1; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation. >>      However, if I use:                fun = Compile[{x}, Sin[x]];      Everything is fine. I need to compile as I presented first, the one which gives error because in my case `variable` is a huge very big expression. How can I achieve this goal?
