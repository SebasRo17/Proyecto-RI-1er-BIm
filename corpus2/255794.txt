I'm developing an ASP.NET Web Api 2 RESTful web api with .NET Framework 4.5.1 and C# and I'm trying to understand how to expose resources through a Web Api: Imagine that I'm a group owner and I am the only one that can add new users to that group (I'm trying to simulate a WhatsApp group). This is my C# class for user:               public class User     {         public int UserId { get; set; }         public string UserName { get; set; }              public List<Group> Groups { get; set; }         public List<Group> GroupsOwned { get; set; }     }      And Group class:               public class Group     {         public int GroupId { get; set; }         public string GroupName { get; set; }              public User Owner { get; set; }              public List<User> Members { get; set; }     }      How do I have to expose user's groups owned members in a RESTful Web Api? I think I have to expose it this way:               "api/users/{ownerId}/groupsOwned/{groupId}/members/"      I will allow `PUT` to modify the Group to add a new member, and probably `GET` to get all members. Any advice?
