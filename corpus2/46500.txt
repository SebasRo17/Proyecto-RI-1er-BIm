I want to filter data using Butterworth filter. I am currently using Matlab and I want to know how to do it in Mathematica. I have the following data:               data1 = Table[        PDF[NormalDistribution[3.5, .8], i] +          PDF[NormalDistribution[6, 1], i], {i, -5, 15, .01}];     noise = RandomReal /@ RandomReal[{-0.2, .2}, Length[data1]];     data2 = data1 + noise;      I filtered this data using Matlab as follows:               [b,a] = butter(8,0.04);          filtfilt(b,a,data2 );      In the previous question's answer, bill s suggested to do it as follows in Mathematica:               RecurrenceFilter[      ToDiscreteTimeModel[ButterworthFilterModel[{2, 0.04}], 1], data2      ]      The result is as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9JyX7.jpg) The problem I am facing is whatever I change the filter order and frequency, I am not able to produce the same filtered data as I am getting from Matlab. Can someone suggest for me what to do and what values to use to get the same filtered data as I am getting from Matlab? Thanks
