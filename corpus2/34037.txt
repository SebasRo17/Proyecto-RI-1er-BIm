$\frac{199319989756262759279209}{5} $ = $ 3.9864\times 10^{22}$ according to _Mathematica_ , but I would like to see this number exactly in decimal form (not in scientific notation). I'm attempting to use the Euclidean Algorithm and Extended Euclidean algorithm to get a final result, and precision and accuracy both are very much needed. This number truncated would give me x and then y is simply the difference of that large number and `5 x`. Unless there's an easier way to do the Euclidean algorithm in _Mathematica_ as well that'd be nice.
