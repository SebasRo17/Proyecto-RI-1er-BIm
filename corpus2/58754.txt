If I change `$MinPrecision` before running `ListPlot[{{1, 2}}]`, there will be a warning in _Mathematica_ 10\. But there is no warning in _Mathematica_ 9\. Is there a way to avoid this warning?               $MinPrecision = 30;     ListPlot[{{1, 2}}]      > N::precsm: "Requested precision 16 is smaller than \$MinPrecision. Using > \$MinPrecision instead." Added: What I wanted to ask is not how to suppress a warning message in general. In fact, I think it is unreasonable for _Mathematica_ 10 to have this warning, because (1) _Mathematica_ 9 does not have it; (2) it is not useful. `Off[N::"precsm"]` does solve the problem, but some useful warnings may also be suppressed as well.
