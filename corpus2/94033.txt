I've been trying to understand the fundamentals of content management systems: I've looked into APress's _Pro ASP.NET 4 CMS_ , but it dives into implementation, dedicating a lot of time to technologies and not core principles. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information about content management systems? What about that book makes it special?
