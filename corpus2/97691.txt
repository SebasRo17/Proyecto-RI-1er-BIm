It seems logical to me that one could define a context for static source code analysis that included rules to produce a relative value of complexity. I know it is not like in the physical sense because souce code doesn't have "Energy" but I'm betting there have been efforts, at leat academic, to draw a parallel. Has anyone any knowledge of this and if so, to what end has it produced useful results?
