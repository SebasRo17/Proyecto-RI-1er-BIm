I just read some artical about publishing software and I am personally developing some random metero application at the moment. The artical were suggesting the software should have a publisher website. But what I have to put down in the publisher website to keep my copyright? Is it simply really just "Designed/Developed @ 2012 By King Chan" at the bottom of the site and software and is enough? Or do I have to even write a long paragraph of license/agreement said the user who download/use the software cannot copy the icon/functionality etc? (The Apple and Samsung things get me worry about CopyRight now....)
