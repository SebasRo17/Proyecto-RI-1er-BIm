Is there something like an inverse of `PowerExpand` that pulls powers to the outside of expressions: $$ x^2 y^2 \leadsto (x y)^2 \\ x^2/y^2 \leadsto (x/y)^2 $$ I am happy to assume that $x$ and $y$ are positive reals, but I do not see any of the algebraic commands that would do this even with the right assumption.
