I have an array of objects. Instead of me when performing a task asking every object If they have anything to say about that, I would rather like the following:               Perform Task          Object #4 Hey, I have something to say about that!       And If object #4 says something about that, maybe Object #17 has anything to add up with, because Object #4 did say something. Do you understand? How do I structure this?
