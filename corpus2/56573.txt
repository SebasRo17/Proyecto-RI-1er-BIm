I've been doing some image processing and have been having trouble with the `AdjacentBorder` command. I've got an image in which I have several elements that are on the borders, and I was able to use `ComponentMeasurements[image,"AdjacentBorders"]` to obtain the list of what borders these elements touch. However, when I go to use `SelectComponents`, I'm unable to select the elements that are just on one border. Is this possible, or can I only select the components that are bordering a certain amount of borders? This is the image I started with this image ![](http://i.imgur.com/AC0bvkG.png) and the code I've used since.               j := Import@"http://i.imgur.com/AC0bvkG.png"     k := Binarize[j, FindThreshold[j]]     l := SelectComponents[k, "FilledCircularity", -7]     m := ImageCrop[l]     ComponentMeasurements[m, "AdjacentBorders"]      > >     {1 -> {Top}, 2 -> {Right}, 3 -> {Left}, 4 -> {Left}, 5 -> {Right}, >      6 -> {Bottom, Right}, 7 -> {Left, Bottom}} >   I used `ComponentMeasurements` to ensure that I did have points on the borders, which I did.
