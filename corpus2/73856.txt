I'm just looking for some advice/best practice for this situation: We have a solution with a couple of web sites in it (one is a web site project, the other is a web application project). We have both of these sites set up to use our installed IIS (v7), as we have other projects that we need to access these via localhost whilst debugging. We've just moved to TFS (from GIT) - when we switch branches, I have to go and 'repoint' my virtual directories under IIS to point at the new branch, which is a bit of a nuisance. Does anybody have any advice/guidance as to what is the best way to approach this? I would note that I don't think that switching to using Cassini will suit our situation.
