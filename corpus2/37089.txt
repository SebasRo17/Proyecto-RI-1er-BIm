I have the sphere $$(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2 + (z-3)^2 = 36.$$ From the sphere, I find some points with integral coordinates. And select three points from this list so that the triangles are not right triangle. I tried               ClearAll[a, b, r];     a = 1;     b = 2;     c = 3;     r = 6;     ss = Subsets[{x, y, z} /.          Solve[{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2 == r^2, x != a, y != b,            z != c}, {x, y, z}, Integers], {3}];     Pick[ss, (FreeQ[#, \[Pi]/2] &) /@ ({VectorAngle[#2 - #1, #3 - #1],            VectorAngle[#1 - #2, #3 - #2],            VectorAngle[#1 - #3, #2 - #3]} & @@@ ss)]      Now, I want to select three points $A$, $B$, $C$ so that the circle passing through points $A$, $B$, $C$ take the point $(1,2,3)$ as its centre. How can I select them?
