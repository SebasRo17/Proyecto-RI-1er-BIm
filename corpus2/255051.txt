I'm interested in the best approach to adding auto update functionality to a web application. Currently   * The patches are downloaded from the softwares support site   * Uploaded to the host server(s)   * Extracted   * The patch process is run The patch process needs to know a few things, specifically the webroot of the application and the database host, name and user in order to run migrations between the point releases. What I would like to see happen if implement a module inside the application which using some technology similar to cURL fetches the latest package, extracts it and runs the necessary command to apply the patch. However I don't think the end user should be expected to know the specifics of the server. e.g. the location of the application, the database host, user and password. I'm thinking the best way to secure this information would be a separate database table accessed by the update module using the users existing login credentials (provided they had necessary privileges to update the installation) What other considerations do I need to take into account? Are there any factors I have overlooked?
