I have coworker who refuses to accept the reality that Turing machines (and Von Neuman machines by extension) cannot solve their own halting problem stating: > You can do anything with enough time and money. He also dislikes theoretical problems arguing that: > In our field, we'll never run into those questions. We're application > developers, not theoretical scientists. Is there a good example of a business problem that is computationally impossible that I could use to help convince him of this?
