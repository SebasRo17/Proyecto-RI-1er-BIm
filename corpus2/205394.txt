I have a .dbf file (dbase) with data of type "date" to read directly via php. I have the application result (format: dd.mm.yyyy) and the stored hex code. I can't interpret the hex data to get the same results or similar results to the application. Which alogrithm is used to get this results? Examples:               app.result=database.hex;     01.01.1000=17 3C 68;     02.01.1000=17 3C 69;     01.02.1000=17 3D 08;     01.01.2000=2E 7C 50;     01.01.1903=2C 58 6F;      Can anybody help me?
