After having read this question I was inspired to investigate how we could take an image of a plant displaying phyllotaxis and fit Vogel's model of phyllotaxis to the image. The theory is very simple. The model is this: $r = c\sqrt{n}$ $\theta = 137.508 n$ And courtesy of shrx we have the original image of the sunflower in that other question, located here. To begin with I wanted to retrieve the positions of the florets in the image, which I did using `LocatorPane`: ![locatorpane](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rm0AS.png) These are the points:               florets = {{182.4,288.},{150.,286.},{166.6,274.5},{181.4,261.},{200.6,274.},{214.6,256.},{234.2,256.},{220.6,279.5},{196.2,247.5},{220.,237.},{238.,235.},{259.2,224.5},{257.8,252.},{261.8,202.5},{284.,193.},{256.8,183.},{274.2,169.5},{257.6,148.5},{247.2,166.5},{233.4,179.},{239.2,196.},{239.4,215.},{224.4,218.5},{223.8,198.},{212.,179.},{222.,163.5},{236.4,152.},{249.4,131.},{250.2,110.5},{268.6,127.},{227.4,82.5},{233.2,102.},{231.,125.},{221.6,142.5},{213.2,123.5},{213.2,102.},{207.4,82.},{196.2,64.},{183.2,84.},{169.4,72.},{194.6,105.},{194.4,122.},{204.,139.5},{203.6,161.},{194.8,178.},{201.4,195.5},{207.2,208.5},{204.2,228.5},{186.2,232.5},{172.,244.},{155.8,258.},{136.,264.},{116.8,259.5},{96.4,252.5},{74.8,246.5},{84.,226.},{102.4,235.},{105.6,215.5},{122.4,221.5},{118.6,239.5},{138.,242.5},{155.4,235.5},{167.6,223.5},{187.8,212.5},{186.4,194.5},{171.6,208.5},{153.2,212.5},{139.8,223.5},{134.,207.},{119.,201.},{120.8,182.},{137.2,185.5},{149.6,193.5},{165.2,193.5},{177.6,178.5},{161.,180.},{165.2,164.5},{184.4,163.5},{188.6,146.5},{178.,136.5},{177.6,114.5},{169.8,97.},{150.2,85.5},{130.4,74.5},{134.2,96.5},{151.8,105.5},{162.,125.},{156.4,140.},{172.4,150.},{149.4,155.5},{145.8,173.5},{130.8,166.5},{124.8,151.},{140.6,140.5},{143.,123.},{121.8,130.},{125.8,111.5},{106.4,110.5},{113.8,89.5},{102.8,129.},{102.4,149.},{110.6,168.},{102.,190.},{91.2,172.5},{80.8,158.},{84.6,136.},{84.8,112.5},{57.4,148.},{64.4,171.5},{48.2,193.5},{65.,210.},{76.2,188.5},{89.8,203.},{123.8,284.}};      Later I will use the fact that $n = (\frac{r}{c})^2$ such that to order the list according to index n, we can use `SortBy[florets,Norm]`. In order to fit Vogel's model to this data I will try to use the following degrees of freedom:   * The constant `c`   * The origin `{x0, y0}`   * Angular offset And I will use `NMinimize`. My _Mathematica_ code for this is as follows:               phi[n_, ang_] := ang n     r[n_, c_] := c Sqrt[n]     pos[phi_, r_, {x0_, y0_}, phi0_] := {x0, y0} + {r Cos[(phi + phi0) Degree], r Sin[(phi + phi0) Degree]}          NMinimize[{       Total[        Norm[#[[2]] - #[[1]]] & /@ Partition[          Riffle[           SortBy[Array[pos[phi[#, ang], r[#, c], {x0, y0}, phi0] &, Length@florets], Norm],           SortBy[florets, Norm]           ], 2]        ],       c > 0, 137 < ang < 138       }, {ang, c, x0, y0, phi0}]      `Riffle` and the `SortBy` trick puts the corresponding points with the same index `n` next to each other. `Partition` finds these pairs and then I measure the difference between them. When the points are almost on top of each other the difference should be very small, instead I get something quite large:               {8318.44, {ang -> 137.055, c -> 1.21577, x0 -> 169.497, y0 -> 176.741,        phi0 -> 41.2544}}      Now `Mean[florets]` gives `{168.811, 178.544}` so the `{x0, y0}` is probably correct. **But why is the fit as bad as it is?** I've worked through this problem using only _Mathematica_. If the problem could be for example precision in the way that I find the positions, please suggest a different way to do it using _Mathematica_. What you see is the best I could do...
