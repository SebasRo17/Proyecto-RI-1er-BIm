Traditionally software build numbers fit into the format   * Major   * Minor   * Release   * Build Where a Major version is implemented whenever there are breaking changes, Minor when new mini features are added, Release when something is published and Build each time it's built. I find the last two digits work really well in a CI environment, each CI build increases the Build number and each release to live increments the Release number. However major waterfall work and breaking change developments are discouraged in more modern methodologies. We prefer to release little and often and so don't tend to make great breaking changes. Given this it's very difficult to determine when to create a new Major version. We try to avoid making major breaking changes and so are getting very high minor/release numbers but haven't had the excuse to move up a major version yet. What criteria should be used to determine when Major and Minor builds should be made (particularly web based applications)? I'm aware there are date style versioning but I'm interested in the Major.Minor.Build.Release only.
