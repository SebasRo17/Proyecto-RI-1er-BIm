I've been asked to run some code metrics in order to assess the quality of the code. One of the metrics was vaguely specified as "comments". I ran Sonar on my code, and while I got 10% on the "comments/loc ratio metric", I got 50% on the "documented API" metric (which gives you the number of methods/classes/instance variables with javadoc comments). I will try to convince the manager and the client that the "documented API" metric is more relevant than the first in estimating the quality of the code, especially that the metrics' goal is to assess the maintanability of the project in case another team took it. Do you have studies/opinions about which of these two metrics is more relevant to assess the quality and maintanability of the code? I could use them as persuation tools. Thank you
