As a newly self-employed software developer, my concern is that I am not getting the stream of feedback I have received in the past when working in groups. (I do have feedback (mostly positive) from my customers, and I do spend a fair amount of time on self-improvement.) What should I be doing to fill the gaps? Any other one-person software shops out there? How do you stay connected and avoid becoming too enamored of your own work? Am I worrying about this too much? Thanks for your comments.
