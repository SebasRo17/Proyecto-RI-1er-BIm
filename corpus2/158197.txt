After developing a website for a client, I've realized that the load time is too extreme, and some changes need to be made. The extreme load times are attributed to the bloated css/js frameworks that I've been using. Much of the code that was included with these frameworks is not even being used and is slowing the site load time. My plan is to get rid of the css framework and just use a bare bones responsive css framework which is only like 1kb in size, and just add only the code needed. So my question is, should I charge the client for back-stepping and fixing this mistake?
