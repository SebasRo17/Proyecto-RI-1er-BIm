Object Literal has no doubt been established in recent years as one of the essential components to best JavaScript coding practices. However, I am not very sure about what is the best way to structure my codes using Object Literal. It has been suggested earlier before that Module Pattern might be a good technique to structure your codes [1] [2], but criticisms regarding Module Pattern have begun to surface as people spent more times exploring the extent of the technique. [3] [4] So, my question is: as of summer 2011, what is the acknowledged best way to structure your codes utilizing Object Literal? Is it still Module Pattern, or has some other technique emerged already as a yet better replacement?
