Generally many programs have a menu item to raise/lower current font size. This is much more convenient than trying to root around in in internal mathematica options. I need to change ALL default fonts not just particular ones. For instance the help system font is itself too small on my laptop. I hope there is a way to do what I want without having to know about a lot of different settings. I am not interested in how uber flexible internal settings are but in having a product that is comfortably readable and useable without a lot of fooling around.
