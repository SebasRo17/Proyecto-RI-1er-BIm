I have a fair number of items in a session, and I am wondering if there are any advantages to copying the session variable to a normal php variable (in order to close the session file as quickly as possible) and then do any calls from there. Something like:               session_start();     $copiedSession = $_SESSION;     session_write_close();     if (isset($copiedSessionData['foo'])){         ...     }     ...        1. I am looking for ways to test performance on this.   2. Does it make sense to do so?   3. Is there a break-even point where it helps / doesn't help?
