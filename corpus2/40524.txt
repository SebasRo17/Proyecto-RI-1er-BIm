This is a very simple question I hope you can help me with. I am experimenting with pattern matching. I want to write a pattern for a difference between two symbols, `a-b`, that recognises cases like `{a-2,a-2b,f[x]-g[x]}` as special cases while rejecting cases like `{a,a+b,a+2b,f[x]+g[x]}`. So I started experimenting Now when I write               MatchQ[a + 2b, a_ + b_]      It returns `True` When I write               MatchQ[a - 2b, a_ - b_]      It returns `False`, which surprises me given the first code snippet returns `True`. I imagined my question could be solved by:               mypattern = a_ - _Integer. b_.       But that doesn't seem to work. Any pointers greatly appreciated.
