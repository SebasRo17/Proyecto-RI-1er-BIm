my IT boss wanted this scenario to be undertaken: First, we develop an Alumni program using PHP and deploy this in the web server which can be accessed by that school alumni in the web to update their personal data anytime. Then, using exactly that SAME program we must also deploy this locally, thru the LAN in its satellite campus which is far and have a very erratic and unreliable internet connection. The purpose is that that the latter system (in LAN) can still be used to add new alumni data even during "offline" periods, and then, once the internet signal is OK, or now being "online" to just upload these offline-generated data in MySQL to the web server hosting THE SAME software program. How do we do a seamless data transfer then of this MySQL database - from the LAN to the web server - once the online signal is now steady? Thanks for any advice...
