In technical interviews which interviews experienced programmers , the interviewers ask a lot of knowledge based questions . [eg. Like how to configure this and that in the xml] . These questions have exactly one answer and it is very likely that a good programmer may not know the answer to it (and hence get rejected) . Is there a good way to respond to these questions ? [Like politely telling the interviewer that the answer is just a google search away].
