I'm Asking you that question because you are an experts in programming , and maybe you could help me . Unfortunately in my country you can't get a job if you don't have a university certification, even if you are a great programmer , so this year i went to college and majored in Computer Science , But I'm so Confused between CS and CIS , and in what major should I spent my money on it ,, There is more than 25 subjects are mutual between us but there is some subjects are special for Computer science , also another subjects for Computer information system too , **Computer science specialization** :   1. Discrete Mathematics   2. Linear algebra And Numerical Analyses    3. Computation theory    4. Compiler Design    5. Wireless Networks security    6. Artificial Intelligence    7. Computer Organization & Architecture    8. Expert Systems  =========================================== **Computer information system specialization :** 1.Information retrieval systems   1. Management for network    2. Wireless network    3. Data base management systems    4. Information security    5. Data warehousing    6. Data mining    7. Intelligent systems
