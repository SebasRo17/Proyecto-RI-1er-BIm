I've been a computer enthusiast my entire life, but didn't first start programming (web development) until I began College. It is now four years later - I am about to graduate, have had a handful of full-time internships and part-time work, all revolving around web dev... But I still find myself more often than not seeking out help, tutorials or stackexchange answers to my questions instead of working out problems entirely on my own. I hear the term "help vampire" -- someone who asks/seeks help with their problems rather than work through issues themselves -- and while that isn't true for me a hundred percent, I find my threshold of getting "frustrated" when trying to accomplish something is quite low and it doesn't take long once I've found a problem to start searching online for a solution, as opposed to work one out myself. I am certainly able to do my work, but I want to know how I can actually learn to THINK and REMEMBER like a developer, as opposed to relying on online answers as a crutch. It's a nasty habit and I really feel like it's limiting my development potential, speed, flexibility and adaptation to new languages/environments. _TL;DR: How did you transition from seeking help (whether in the form of Q &A's, plugins, tutorials, code-inspecting, etc) to developing solutions (answering the Q&A's, writing your own plugins, creating the tutorials, etc)?_
