I want to create a rule as a function of `z` from a left and right hand side. My (non-working) code and usage is:               toRule[l_, r_] := l[x_] -> r          toRule[f, a+b]      I want the output to be:               (* => f[x_] -> a + b*)      However: when I do this with the code above I get:               (* => f[x$_] -> a + b*)      Where is the $ coming from, and how can I get rid of it?
