I gave this data as input:               Integrate[((x+z) EllipticE[-((4 Subscript[b, 1] Subscript[b, 2])/((x+z)^2+(Subscript[b,1]-Subscript[b, 2])^2))])/(Sqrt[(x+z)^2+(Subscript[b, 1]-Subscript[b, 2])^2] ((x+z)^2+(Subscript[b, 1]+Subscript[b, 2])^2)),{x,a,-a}]      However, It took forever to process the input and calculate the definite integral. After an hour or so it gave me the outpust same as input. I know it is a bit complicated bu I have no idea how to simplify the input. I also use Assuming command to help processing but it didn't change anything. It again took forever to compute the input and gave me the output same as input. What should I do? P.S:I am running Mathematica 10.0
