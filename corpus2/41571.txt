I found the behavoiur of Sign function weird in the code below. when $T=10$               T = 10;     A = 1;     Fk0 = 2;     m1 = 1;     x0[t_] = A Sin[2 Pi t];     Fk[t_] = -Fk0  Sign[x1'[t]];     sol = NDSolve[{       m1 x1''[t] == -m1 x0''[t] + Fk[t], x1'[0] == 10, x1[0] == 0},       {x0, x1}, {t, 0, T}, MaxSteps -> Infinity]     Plot[{x0''[t], x1'[t] /. sol // Evaluate}, {t, 0, T}, Frame -> True]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yEy9J.jpg) but when $T=40$ , I got   ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h5eeB.jpg)   which is how it is supposed to be. I wonder what I did wrong here.
