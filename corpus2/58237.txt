I have a 2D data to fit (the Airy type pattern from diffraction of Gaussian beam on the circular aperture). Please see the attached picture. I was going to use a function like `BesselJ[1, x]*BesselJ[1, y]/x/y` for that. But there is an error about infinity at zero. > Power::infy: "Infinite expression 1/0.^2 encountered. The problem related to the FindFit (or NonlinearModelFit) procedure trying to calculate Jacobian at this point and finding infinity there. I tried to use some tricks such as specify the method (`Method -> "PrincipalAxis"` or `"Gradient"`), but these do not help. Will appreciate any suggestions! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eUcG8.png) My code:               (* Write images as numerical 2D array, find max and min (=background) \     values for each image *)     For[k = 0, k < dim0, k++;       data02[k] = ImageData[data01[k]];       min02[k] = Min[data02[k]];       max02[k] = Max[data02[k]];       ];          (* substrack the backgound and normilize to the max value *)     (*Read each 5-th pixel on the image to speed up the program, later \     multiply by that number to get      correct value for the beam size*)     ReducPix = 5;     For[k = 0, k < dim0, k++;       data03[k] =         Table[ (data02[k][[i]][[j]][[1]] - min02[k] + 0.0001)/max02[k], {i,           1, dim01b, ReducPix}, {j, 1, dim01a, ReducPix}];            ];          Bessel3D =        a0 (BesselJ[1, a2 (x0 - a1)]*          BesselJ[1, b2 (y0 - b1)]/(a2 (x0 - a1))/(b2 (y0 - b1)))^2;          data3D[13] =       Flatten[MapIndexed[{#2[[1]], #2[[2]], #1} &, data03[13], {2}],        1]; found it here \     http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/27642/fitting-a-two-\     dimensional-gaussian-to-a-set-of-2d-pixels/27643#27643?newreg=\     2edd44e8d4d0498aa9afc19085d228f8*)          (*fit=NonlinearModelFit[data3D[13],Bessel3D,{{a0,1},{a1,75},{a2,20},{\     b1,50},{b2,20}},{x0,y0},Gradient\[Rule]"FiniteDifference"];  *)
