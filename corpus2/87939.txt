I'm more at the novice end of the software developer spectrum, but nevertheless I've had exposure to quite a few programming languages and frameworks. From all the technologies I've used, I haven't found any with an API as well-structured and user-friendly as Java's. Why is this? Why is it that robust languages such as C++, Perl and Python do not have APIs that come even close to Java's?
