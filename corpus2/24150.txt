Consider this example below for ListContourPlot.               ListContourPlot[       Table[Sin[j^2 + i], {i, 0, Pi, 0.02}, {j, 0, Pi, 0.02}],        PlotLegends -> Automatic]      I wish to make the Legend look like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iPTNc.png) I have searched the net but did not find any way of doing this. I'm sure this can be done because that legend in the link is created using _Mathematica_ but I can't figure out how. Maybe it's something very trivial but I would really appreciate if someone could help me with this because I always had a hard time dealing with legends in _Mathematica_. The example that I gave above was just for illustration. My actual function is more like this:-               ListContourPlot[     Table[Cos[Sqrt[bx^2 + by^2]], {bx, -1, 1, 0.1}, {by, -1, 1, 0.1}],      ContourLabels -> All, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",        PlotLegends -> BarLegend[Automatic, All]]      So the plot looks like this:- ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GJAtx.jpg) This legend has clear color bands which can be separated like that shown in the legend above. So my question is whatever may be the case can we make a legend that looks like the one I showed.
