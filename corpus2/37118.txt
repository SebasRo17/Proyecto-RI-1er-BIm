The following code suggests that Mathematica stores the messages in cache:               (*1*)Remove[VariationalD]     (*2*)Messages[VariationalD]     (*3*)Message[VariationalD::args, OPS]     (*4*)Messages[VariationalD]      The output of the second line is `{}` as expected for a symbol that has just been removed. The output of the third line however is not the expected "-- Message text not found --". Instead, Mathematica seems to have pulled that message from some cache. In any case, **how can I reset the message cache (without resetting the whole installation)?** * * * **Update** I apologize because my previous example did not really work. In any case, the following is a better example. This code was executed on a freshly launched kernel.               before = Messages[General]; Message[General::dummies, OPS];     after = Messages[General]; Complement[after, before]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gOhd5.png) The message `General::dummies` was not part of the original list of messages attached to `General`. Following the documentation, the next place to check would be `$NewMessage`, but `Messages[$NewMessage]` is empty. So, where did `General::dummies` come from?
