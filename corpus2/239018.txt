A brief background on this specific question: > After meeting with a client and hearing all of their requests, requirements, > and other comments about a specific software job, planning out the software > functionality, design, and basic user experience, the client comes back with > a comment regarding, "That is not what we are looking for. You can't do what > we want to do." Now, I understand the concept that not everyone understands tech, and that some people are more visual than others and may need to see things before they can be sure about something. I also understand the process of revisions and other modifications to meet specific functionality demands or requirements that may only come up after you start putting things together. I mean, if everyone got it right in version 1.0, imagine how great a world this would be! **Given** : There is no magic formula for a guaranteed success rate when a lot of the work is artistic in the sense that the same set of directions can be interpreted differently by different people. I'm aware that asking the **right** questions is important, and I have done some research about what questions others are asking in similar jobs. I also have previous experience with clients (this isn't my first job), and through it all, I have developed my own little system for getting this information-- which has had a 99% success rate up to this point. Usually if I don't get it right the first time, it's fixed during the revision and modification process. I know I'm not perfect, but I've never really had a client flat out refuse what they asked for... So **how do you get relevant and useful information out of a client in regards to job requirements and specifics?**
