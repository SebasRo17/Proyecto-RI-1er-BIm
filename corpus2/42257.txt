This simple line of code:               While[True, Pause[1]]      uses 55% of one CPU core on my computer. Are there more efficient ways to construct simple infinite loops in Mathematica? _Edit_ I'm on OS X 10.9.1 using Mathematica 10.0. Further inspection: `While[True,]` uses 100% CPU; `While[True, x]` also uses 100% CPU; `Pause[10]` uses 55% CPU for the time it is waiting, so 10 seconds in this case.
