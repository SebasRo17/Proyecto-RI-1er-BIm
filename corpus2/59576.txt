My boss is going through a certification process reggarding "Coaching", and he asked me if he could coach me. According to what I understood from him, I should have an objective on what should I be coached at and some initial questions from where the coaching process would stem from. As a software developer who likes to embrace new technologies and has lately been specially enjoying the "requirements negotiation" part of the work, I have no idea on what could I be coached or what kind of questions could I bring him. Maybe you guys here would have nice ideas?
