Given the following equation and rule, how would I `Solve` the equation for `tr`, `k` and `c`?               eq = T == tr - E^(-k * t)*c;     rule = {t -> {0, 5, 10}, T -> {2000, 1300, 1100}};      `eq /. rule` results in this, which is almost what I want:               {2000, 1300, 1100} == {tr - c, tr - c/E^(5k), tr - c/E^(10k)}      I would like to get a list of equations instead like so:               {2000 == tr - c, 1300 == tr - c/E^(5k), 1100 == tr - c/E^(10k)}      which could then be used to solve the equations (using `And` on the list).
