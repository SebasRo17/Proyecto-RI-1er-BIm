It is clearly a bad practice to incorporate several issues in a single bug. It is not convenient, hard to maintain, difficult to keep track of what is done and what is not, etc. But does all this concern bugs associated with documentation as well? By documentation, I mean only external documents (user guides, architecture overviews, etc.). I personally find it more convenient to create a single bug for multiple issues in the same document. It's easier to keep track of the updates in the document and review the document when the changes are done. What are the cons of incorporating multiple issues of a document in a single bug?
