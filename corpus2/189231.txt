I am traditionally a MsSQL or MySQL developer - I have been prototyping a new application that involves storing data from many targets. I have seen that the app appears to get slow after scaling to 10k targets after inputting around 300k results for each (64 bit ints) - especially once I start trying to average and/or graph a few targets at once. Once the app is deployed I will need to add around 1k targets a month and store one data point from each for each and every minute for approx 2 years. I have never used NoSql, but from reading, it sounds like a good fit - create a document for each target and keep adding fields for each target. So, I was just wondering, is NoSQL the way to go for this project or should I be sticking with traditional SQL - and/or can anyone offer any advice? And the second part - If NoSQL is a solution can anyone recommend a fair comparison as I am getting lost in biased reviews that seem to say each solution is superior!?
