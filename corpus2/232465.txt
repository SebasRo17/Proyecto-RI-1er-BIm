I wish to publish my program under Apache2 license. I have added the "APPENDIX" part of the license text to the top portion of my source.txt file and edited the copyright year and name. But when I add the license.txt file in the same archive with sourcecode, should I edit the copyright line wih my name and year? Or should I let the copy of license.txt intact as downloaded from apache site?
