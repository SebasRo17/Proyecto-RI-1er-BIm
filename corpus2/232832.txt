In our organization some of the resources (such as QA machines etc) are shared. Different folks get done at different times and some tests have to be run (during dev and QA) on these machines. Right now, we just skype a message to the team stating "I am going to run some destructive tests on such and such machines - let me know if anyone has an issue". This approach obviously has many issues (what happens if someone missed the message etc.) Apart from maintaining a shared google doc that needs to be constantly updated - is there an easier way that folks use for such coordination?
