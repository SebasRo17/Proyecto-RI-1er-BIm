Let's say you have a static method that looks something like this:               public static bool Foo()     {          var bar = new Bar();         //do some stuff here     }      This method as it stands can be a real headache to unit test. What is the best practice to refactor this so that it can be testable, without turning it into an instance method or changing the method signature?
