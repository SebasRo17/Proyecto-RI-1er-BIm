I have referred What is the difference between And and AndAlso in VB.net? to understand the difference between `And` and `AndAlso`. I am from C# background - and C# has `AndAlso` only - no `And`.. And I don't see any practical use/advnatage of `And`. Is there any practical use of `And` in VB.Net? **Reference**   1. Or versus OrElse   2. What is the difference between And and AndAlso in VB.net?
