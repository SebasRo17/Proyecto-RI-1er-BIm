As you may already know, _Mathematica_ is a wonderful piece of software.   However, it has a few characteristics that tend to confuse new (and sometimes not-so-new) users. That can be clearly seen from the the fact that the same questions keep being posted at this site over and over. Please help me to identify and explain those pitfalls. Suggestions for posting answers:   * One topic per answer    * Focus on non-advanced uses (it's intended to be useful for beginners and as a question closing reference)   * Include a self explanatory title in h2 style   * Explain the symptoms, the mechanism behind the scenes and all possible causes and solutions you can think of. Be sure to include a beginner's level explanation (and a more advance one too, if you're in the mood)    * Include a link to your answer by editing the **Index** below (for quick reference) ## Index   * ### Basic syntax issues   * ### Avoiding procedural loops   * ### Understand what `Set` (=) really does   * ### Understand the difference between exact and approximate (Real) numbers   * ### Understand the difference between `Set` (or `=`) and `SetDelayed` (or `:=`)   * ### Lingering Definitions: when calculations go bad   * ### Learn how to use the Documentation Center effectively   * ### Understand that semicolon (;) is not a delimiter   * ### Using the result of functions that return replacement rules   * ### Attempting to make an assignment to the argument of a function   * ### Use Consistent Naming Conventions   * ### Assuming commands will have side effects which they don't:   * ### Undo is not available in general   * ### What the @#%^&*?! do all those funny signs mean?   * ### User-defined functions, numerical approximation, and NumericQ   * ### The displayed form may substantially differ from the internal form   * ### Why is my picture upside-down?   * ### Mathematica can be much more than a scratchpad   * ### Mathematica's own programming model: functions and expressions
