I have been working with _Mathematica_ for a while and have accumulated a number of folders (not in _Workbench_ project form), each with a few files such as a .nb file, maybe a .m file, and their products (images etc.). I then acquired _Wolfram Workbench_ , and am up and running, and wish to transfer my existing folders to _Workbench_. If I try               File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Next      and select the directory that contains my folders, the information up the top of the dialogue box says, "No projects are found to import". If I simply transfer my folders to the base _Workbench_ directory, they are not visible in the Package Explorer or Navigator even after pressing F5 (Refresh). Any ideas? * * * PS $\hspace{5mm}$ After experimenting a little more, I've discovered that I can go               File -> New -> Project -> Mathematica -> Basic Project      and create a project with the same name as the folder I wish to import; then paste the contents of my folder into the project folder. This is a work- around, but what I'd really like to do is import all of my existing folders into the base workspace and have _Workbench_ recognise them as projects (and create the necessary infrastructure around them if need be), without my having to faff around creating projects manually.
