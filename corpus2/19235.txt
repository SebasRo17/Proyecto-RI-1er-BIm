Consider the evaluation of the following expression               In[20]:= Reduce[ 1000 * 1.0609^t == 1500, t]      > >     During evaluation of In[20]:= Reduce::ratnz: Reduce was unable to >     solve the system with inexact coefficients. The answer was obtained by >     solving a corresponding exact system and numericizing the result. >> >                 Out[20]= C[1] âˆˆ Integers &&        t == -16.9154 (-0.405465 + (0. + 6.28319 I) C[1])      I was expecting just `6.858618708478822` as the solution.
