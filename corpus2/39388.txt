This is partially in response to a question I posted earlier, although the problem in this case appears to be distinct from the problem there, so I am temporarily filing this as a separate question. Executing               Length[Reduce[Abs[c1] + Abs[c2] + Abs[c3] + Abs[c4] <= 19, {c1, c2, c3, c4}, Integers]]      yields 97281, which is in full agreement with the result obtained when `Reduce` is replaced by `Solve`. However, executing               Length[Reduce[Abs[c1] + Abs[c2] + Abs[c3] + Abs[c4] <= 22, {c1, c2, c3, c4}, Integers]]      yields 42736. This is obviously impossible, since the number of $\mathbb{Z}^4$ lattice points within a taxicab ball is a strictly increasing function of radius. Does anyone know what is going wrong here? I am going to temporarily solve the problem via alternate, more delicate approaches seeing as both `Solve[]` and `Reduce[]` have failed to give correct answers for $r\geq20$, but any insight as to this sudden behavioral discontinuity would be appreciated. EDIT: It may be possible that the lower than expected result from `Length` may be due to `Reduce` outputting a solution set whose expression depth was not just that of the simple `Or[...]` structure that it normally gives for smaller values of $r$. If anyone can confirm this, I'll close this question.
