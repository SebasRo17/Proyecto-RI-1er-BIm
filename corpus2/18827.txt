I would like to send a set of Mathematica expressions (i.e. not simple types that are easy to represent and temporarily store in C) in a `List` using the MathLink C API. I do not know how many there will be before I compute all of them, but I need their count to be able to call `MLPutFunction`. How can I conveniently send a `List` without needing to know the number of elements beforehand? * * * One idea I had was to put them on a loopback link while counting them, then transfer the contents of the loopback link at once. But I was hoping for a simpler solution.
