What are the common guidelines and best practices for developers who are studying for their master or doctoral degrees, while still working to earn the living in a commercial entity. Especially, if profile of the commercial entity is partially similar to the research topic. The reason for this question is because:   * Master/doctoral students have to publish their findings, therefore releasing information to public domain   * Commercial entities usually have clauses that all work items assigned to their employees, electronically, in spoken, and in written, are actually copyrighted, and the employee is transferring all ownership to a commercial entity   * Most commercial research is considered trade secrets and not to be released to a public domain, NDA, etc. So, for example, if you are employed for a company that simulates turbine parameters using server clusters, while your research topic is, for example, "Physics simulation frameworks". The thing suddenly becomes muddy. Yet, at the same time, seems that thousands of people work and publish their findings in conferences while working in the same exact field. What's the catch? How can you keep doing your research work while maintaining rights to your exact research field, and a copyright to implement the proof of concept/prototype/product after graduating if you later decide so. Seems that a lot of people do somehow.
