I am fairly new to web-application development. I just can't shake the feeling that it takes me forever to do anything of even remote complexity. In c++ and java I could write the same applications in a matter of hours. On the web debugging is painful (especially if complex json-ajax) is involved. IDEs suck. The languages let everything through without errors until it is doesn't work anymore and you are stuck looking for a bug without any error or warning to guide you (and no real good way to step through the program). Can someone guide me to reading material and/or technologies that would help me find a way to stay sane when developing complex web-applications? Perhaps the answer is to use a good framework (zend?). At work we are not really using a framework except for database models generators and basic add/update/delete page generators.
