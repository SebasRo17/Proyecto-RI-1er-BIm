By default, `NIntegrate` works with `MachinePrecision` and its `PrecisionGoal` is set to `Automatic` which is effectively a value near 6:               In[1]:= Options[NIntegrate, {WorkingPrecision, PrecisionGoal}]          Out[1]= {WorkingPrecision -> MachinePrecision, PrecisionGoal -> Automatic}      I need sufficiently higher accuracy when computing the following integral:               dpdA[i_] := NIntegrate[       Cos[φ] Cos[i*φ] Exp[Sum[-Cos[j*φ], {j, 11}]], {φ, 0, Pi},        Method -> {Automatic, "SymbolicProcessing" -> None}]      The integral cannot be taken symbolically, so `"SymbolicProcessing"` is off. The problem is that when I increase `PrecisionGoal` to 15 and consequently `WorkingPrecision` to a value higher than `MachinePrecision` I get very low performance. Is it possible to compute this integral with at least 15 significant digits with high performance?
