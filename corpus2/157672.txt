So this is the first time I am trying to work with an `Open Source Project`. I created a `Code Plex` Account browsed for a project that I thought I might become a part of. I sent a request to join the project.The project head accepted my request. I have already `downloaded` the `source code` of the project. Can some one just suggest what should I be doing next? Since I have never worked with `Open Source Projects` the best thing I think for me would be to go through the `code` and just study it and understand how it works. Apart from that I want to know what things many of you do when you are accepted as a contributor. Also the project I choose to work includes `ASP.NET MVC` and a `javascript` library `Raphael.js` which I have no prior experience with. So should I also start looking at it also? Any suggestions are welcome.
