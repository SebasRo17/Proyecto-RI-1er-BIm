As a professional Java programmer, I've been trying to understand - why the hate toward Java for modern web applications? I've noticed a trend that out of modern day web startups, a relatively small percentage of them appears to be using Java (compared to Java's overall popularity). When I've asked a few about this, I've typically received a response like, "I hate Java with a passion." But no one really seems to be able to give a definitive answer. I've also heard this same web startup community refer negatively to Java developers - more or less implying that they are slow, not creative, old. As a result, I've spent time working to pick up Ruby/Rails, basically to find out what I'm missing. But I can't help thinking to myself, "I could do this much faster if I were using Java," primarily due to my relative experience levels. But also because I haven't seen anything critical "missing" from Java, preventing me from building the same application. _Which brings me to my question(s)_ : Why is Java not being used in modern web applications?   * Is it a weakness of the language?    * Is it an unfair stereotype of Java because it's been around so long (it's been unfairly associated with its older technologies, and doesn't receive recognition for its "modern" capabilities)?    * Is the negative stereotype of Java developers too strong? (Java is just no longer "cool")   * Are applications written in other languages really faster to build, easier to maintain, and do they perform better?   * Is Java only used by big companies who are too slow to adapt to a new language?
