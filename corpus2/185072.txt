I'm working with a new plugin (flexbox), and I ran into the MS-PL license, which I had not run into before. In the past, I've used mainly MIT and Apache licensed projects, so I have no idea what the main differences are with this one. Here's a link to it: http://opensource.org/licenses/MS-PL Can anyone help explain the differences to me? I'm usually wary of Microsoft, so the fact that this product comes with this makes me nervous.
