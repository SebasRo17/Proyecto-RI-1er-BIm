I have a repo with Ruby and PHP code in it. Github says my repo is 74.8% PHP and 25.2% Ruby I do not understand how this can be. When I compare the 2 languages in my project:               # Count how many files:          # Ruby     ls | grep ".*\.rb" | wc -l     # returns 10          #PHP     ls | grep ".*\.php" | wc -l     # returns 1               # Count how many lines, words, chars:          # Ruby     cat *.rb | wc     # returns 229, 812, 5303          # PHP     cat *.php | wc     # returns 102, 473, 2760      Ruby always seems to have more. Am I missing something?
