I am looking for a tool to manage requirements or features for a software development project. It will be used by a small geographically diverse team of 5-10 people to raise, discuss and track requirements. Consequently it will need:   * Support for multiple users   * Web-based   * Support a hierarchy between requirements, e.g. parent / child relationship   * Provide a means for discussing individual requirements   * Support file uploads   * Cost effective. Ideally free or  Some of the project management tools available are overkill or focus on tasks or resource scheduling rather than features / requirements. Does anyone have a solution?
