### Setup I have a project (pynliner, a python module) on github that I never gave much thought about licensing. Today I got an email asking what license it is under because someone wants to use it in their commercial software. My first thought is that I would love to have 2 licenses one that is free for non-commercial use and one for commercial use. So I started researching software licenses... and got very dizzy. Then I realized I may not even be able to use most of them because my module uses several other modules. So I have a few questions about how licenses filter down. My module uses but does not include code under:   * **MIT License** BeautifulSoup   * **LGPL3** cssutils And my module uses and includes code under:   * **MIT License** soupselect.py This is a relatively minor project but I would like to use it as a learning process for the right way to approach licensing. ### Questions   * If I include someone else's code then any licenses I use must not break the included code's license correct?   * Does the same hold true for other software I use but don't include? _Am I limited by the MIT License on BeautifulSoup or LGPL3 on cssutils if I use them but don't include the source in my project?_ * * * ### edit Thanks for pointing out the licenses I had missed on cssutils and soupselect.py. Once these were pointed out the rest of my questions really come down to what is allowed within the MIT License since it is the only one over code I have included and whether or not the output of cssutils is free. I'm comfortable with looking these up the rest of the way. Thanks all.
