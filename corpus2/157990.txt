I have read many posts similar to this on the site: however I still am questioning what is best in my situation (also the answers are contradicting from question to question). I have a website (web-application) with a controller per section of domain logic (i.e. ProductsController, NewsController, ContactsController, etc..) and one very large very ugly admin controller which contains the logic for the Add/Edit/View/Delete functions for each section... now as you can imagine this controller is getting very out of control (whereas each function is not overly large, having dozens of functions in one controller does not sit well with me...). From what I've read the general consensus is to just lump the _admin_ functions in the 'sections' controller; however some also suggest you create a new controller for each admin section as well. so I would then have ProductsController and AdminProductsController - to me this seems a little overkill, however I have no real clue about this: any tips or readings would be appreciated - or if there is a 'industry best practise' that would be nice to know as well.
