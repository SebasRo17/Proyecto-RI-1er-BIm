I've read the article about fixing bug in this post What process do you normally use when attempting to debug a problem/issue/bug with your software?. One of the answer which I noted is "take a rest" when you have spent too long to try to fix the bug. I believe it is a good idea too. But sometime I am in a tight deadline when some mysterious bug appears. When this is happened I tend to think to rewrite the code rather than spending more time to fix the bug. My question is, when will you think it is better to rewrite the code rather than fix it? Or what criteria can we use to determine whether to keep fix the bug or rewrite the code?
