### Introduction Mathematica 9 has introduced a new predictive interface. For each output, it suggest possible actions the user might want to take. ![The predictive interface at work](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NUmoV.png) **How can this interface be extended so that it will suggest additional, possibly user-defined, actions?** * * * ### The starting point @Rojo mentioned in chat that he discovered that much of the functionality is contained in the `Predictions`` and `PredictiveInterface`` contexts. Many of the symbols have usage messages (but make sure that you trigger loading them by using the predictive interface at least once). The `Predictions`PredictionRule` symbol seems to contain the rules on which the predictions are based, as downvalues (see its usage message). The functionality seems to be defined in files found in the `$InstallationDirectory/AddOns/Applications/PredictiveInterface/` directory. The relevant part is in `.mx` files (not directly readable) and comments in the `.m` files suggest that these may be updated automatically. I posted this question as a starting point for people who want to figure out how this works, and to facilitate collaboration.
