I recorded a phenomenon using video capturing (`phen.avi`, imported into _Mathematica_ ) and simultaneous measurement of some electrical properties of that phenomenon (a list with values). For every frame, there is a corresponding value, which I would like to a) overlay directly on each frame (is it possible to convert numbers into graphics and then use `ImageCompose[]`?); and b) animate these values in an "electrocardiogram"-style, so values vs. "rolling time". This should be possible with `Animate[]`, but do I have to split this animation into single images in order to overlay it onto `phen.avi`, or is there a more direct way?
