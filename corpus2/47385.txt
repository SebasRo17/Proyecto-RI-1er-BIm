I have the pictured Histogram. It was generated by the following lines:               H = ExampleData[{"NetworkGraph", "HighEnergyTheoryCollaborations"}]     Histograms`Histogram[Length /@ ConnectedComponents[H], Histograms`HistogramRange -> {0, 25}, AspectRatio -> 2, BaseStyle -> 10]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yvKDy.png) I cut the x-axis at 25 because there is only one y(x)>0, x>25: x=5835. A better solution would be to cut x at 25, then continue x at 5834 and end it again at 5836. How can I achieve this?
