As part of another problem, I am working to evaluate hypergeometric functions such as               Hypergeometric2F1[1, 1, n, -1]      for large $n$. I am hoping to obtain at least double-precision accuracy all the way through `n = 1600`. However, starting as low as `n = 200`, I obtain precision errors:               N[Hypergeometric2F1[1, 1, 200, -1], 17]     N::meprec: Internal precision limit      Are there ways to tell _Mathematica_ it can use as much time as it wants to compute this quantity? Or are there any other workarounds?
