I am doing my masters dissertation and I have conducted a software metrics. I need to adopt my metrics on an open source tool. I have found PMD and check style on sourceforge.net but there is not adequate explanation about their codes. However, I couldn't to find their source code to customize them. I will be appreciated, if you introduce one open source tool for java which I can customize it's code.
