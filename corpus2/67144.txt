We are trying to develop a website that automate an organisation process. This company, let's called it Acme Limited, usually ask their clients to submit paper form and have the clerks to manually enter those form into the internal system. At the moment they have 60 clients across the state. Now, Acme Ltd wants their client to go to their website, that we are building, and fill in the data themselves, instead their clerks. The driver for this, is to free up their clerks, and reassign the clerks to do something else. In my understanding for this scenario - please correct me if I am wrong - the customers in an agile environment, must includes not only the users from the within the company, but also their clients. If we were to develop their system using agile, is it better to include the clients into the software development process ? Have them sit within the development area so that we can ask for their input during development ?
