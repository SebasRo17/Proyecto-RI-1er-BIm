The MATLAB FFT function, `fft(X,n)`, can be used to return the _n_ -point DFT. This effectively extends the original signal, `X`, to `n` points if `n` is larger than the dimension of `X`. But, with the `Fourier` function in _Mathematica_ , the transform always has the same dimensions as `X`. So, how can I obtain the same behaviour in _Mathematica_ as implemented in MATLAB?
