I'm building a rather large and extensive wrapper in Delphi for an email system called Mandrill. There are wrappers for this API in many other languages, but not for Delphi. So, I'm hoping to produce the first full wrapper. The problem is, I'm utilizing a third-party JSON parser called superobject. I'm afraid that if I complete this wrapper, I won't be able to provide my code for Mandrill to share, because of this third-party library. If I do complete this wrapper, is there any chance that Mandrill will be able to legally publish it on their site, based on the fact that I'm using superobject? Or would I need to parse my own JSON to be applicable? PS - I mean this question in a general concept, not necessarily for my precise scenario, but in general, if I use a third-party library, can I legally post it with my code on another third-party's site?
