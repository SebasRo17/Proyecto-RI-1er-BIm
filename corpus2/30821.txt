# How can I publish Notebooks to Github via using Mathematica? * * * I'm on windows 8.1 x64, _Mathematica_ 9. How can I upload the current notebook to Github? My function expected is: `Notebook2Github[EvaluationNotebook[]]` Now I've installed Github on Windows, and have one test page The **annoying** thing is that each time I added/modified a new file in the destination folder(`E:\Users\HyperGroups\Documents\GitHub\hypergroups.github.com`), I should open GitHub, and add something into the `uncommitted changes` fields and click the `sync` button(shown in the picture) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/10jQA.png) How can I avoid doing that and complete all such things by the function `Notebook2Github`. * * * ### My tries in Git Shell I can use the following commands in the GitShell. `git add [new file]` /`git commit` and `git push` and the new file will be updated to GitHub.
