By using `ParallelTable` and submitting my Mathematica code to a cluster, I noticed that it was enhancing the speed even when I selected a **single core** in a **single node** , comparing to the use of standard `Table`. Verifying the number of cores using `$ProcessorCount`, I got 16. For selecting the number of cores I have submitted a bash file in terminal (already logged in SSH) using               qsub -I run_inter.sh      The file "run_inter.sh" contains               #!/bin/sh     #PBS -l walltime=10:00:00          #PBS -q par32     #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1      where "par32" is a machine with 32GB of RAM. Is there any reason for Mathematica to ignore the specification of core number and use 16 anyway?
