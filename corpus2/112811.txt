I want to know what is the cost of running a Windows Application Server. I know the cost of running a Linux server with Java based Application Server is probably zero. What is the cost of running a windows based server on which all Apps are written in C#? I assume is is just the license cost of a copy of Windows Server. Is this true? Are there any other hidden cost for hosting with WIndows? I think with Cloud based hosting, these license costs can be avoided then.
