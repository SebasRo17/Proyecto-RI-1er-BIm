Title says it all. If the CSV's system delimiter was `"` (as opposed to a comma or pipe or other common alternatives), how would anything deal with it? The crux of the matter is of course that by definition, CSV will surround any values containing the delimiter with quotation marks, and will convert all quotation marks to double quotation marks. Would the result be parse-able? (Inspired by an answer in Most common "Y2K-style" bugs today?) ![System Delimiter \(which drives excel, databases, etc\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lWhbO.png)
