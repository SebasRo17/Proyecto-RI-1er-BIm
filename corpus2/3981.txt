I've got some large data sets which have been counted **but not binned** already - essentially, a list of pairs of values (not bins) and counts.* (Or, equivalently, it's been binned into too-small bins.) I want to plot histograms for them. I remember the deprecated version of Histogram from a separate package had a FrequencyData option, but that seems to have disappeared. Is there any built-in way to accomplish this now? (I'd like to still have all the fancy features of Histogram, i.e. I don't want to just rebin the data myself and plot it directly. Notably I'd like to still be able to use Histogram's automatic bin specification, or something like it.) *That is, my data is represented as `{{1, 6}, {2, 4}, {3, 2}, ...}` instead of `{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...}`. (And before anyone suggests just expanding the data to the latter form to pass to Histogram: there are over 100K values, and the total count is over 100M.) Edit: okay, let me be really explicit. The perfect thing would be to be able to take the first representation of the data (`{{1,6}, ...}`), and get _exactly_ what Histogram would have produced had I given it the second version (`{1,1,1,1,...}`), without having to actually expand it to that form. (This includes being able to specify various options and extra arguments to Histogram.) I do not want a bar chart with 100K bars. I do not want to have to decide how many bins to make every time I do this, because I may do it many times with many varieties of data.
