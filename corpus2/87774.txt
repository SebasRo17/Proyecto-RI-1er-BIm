I'm working on a project that uses a dataset produced from software informally licensed as "non-commercial use only". I'm developing an application that uses that dataset as an input to another algorithm. Our own software has a permissive free software license in which we don't restrict commercial usage. Are there legal implications of using that dataset in our own software in the sense that we are violating a copyright? **Edit** : Thanks folks, the ask a lawyer thing is the way to go, but its helpful for me to hear some opinions bounce around.
