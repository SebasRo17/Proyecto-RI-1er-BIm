_Disclaimer: I didn't know exactly where to put this question. If you feel that this question is not suitable for Programmers @ StackExchange, feel free to migrate it._ _Background:_ Broadening my last question, there is a request for tender for a software system that's open and I have decided to take it on. I am a software developer & engineer by profession and, in this tender process, I have to put on the pricing for my bid. I have been provided a documentation consisting of functional and non-functional requirements only. I have to put a project manager's cap on and think of all aspects, e.g. cost for implementation for the project, resources needed, etc. My question is: Is there a project framework that I can follow that breaks the project cycle into steps and corresponding cost aspect or how would I go about best calculating/approximating the cost for the project?
