I have a notebook in Mathematica 4. I'm trying to convert it to use in Mathematica 9. One of the problem is the long computation of definite integral in the new version of Mathematica. Here's the example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3lY6S.png) I understand that the new Mathematica produces more accurate answer, but even NIntegrate loses in speed of calculations. Is there any simple solution to make the integration work faster?
