I'm trying to solve a two point boundary value problem with a piecewise system of equations like:               dx[t_] := Piecewise[{{0, y[t] <= 0}, {x[t]^(3/4) - x[t], y[t] > 0}}]     dy[t_] := Piecewise[{{0, y[t] <= 0}, {(1 - y[t])/x[t]^(1/4) + y[t], y[t] > 0}}]          NDSolve[{x'[t] == dx[t], y'[t] == dy[t], x[0] == 1, y[10] == 2}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}]      which produces the error                NDSolve::bvdisc: NDSolve is not currently able to solve boundary value problems with discrete variables.      I tried the answers here by entering               funs = ParametricNDSolveValue[{x'[t] == dx[t], y'[t] == dy[t], x[0] == 1, y[10] == yt}, {x, y}, {t, 0, end}, yt]          FindRoot[funs[yt][end], {yt, 2}]      which yields the same error. Is there any way to solve this system? Thanks for the help.
