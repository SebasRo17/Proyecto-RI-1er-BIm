I don't know if the question trivial or not (if so I will delete it), but here is what I have: I know that               x x     (*  x^2  *)      Looking at the full form gives               FullForm[Times[x, x]]     (* Power[x, 2] *)      It is clear that the `Times` head has been changed to `Power` head. I just wonder how does this happen. Can I control this behavior to stop this conversion between heads?
