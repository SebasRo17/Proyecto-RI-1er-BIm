This is maybe a silly question, but I could not think of any logical reason why it is not simplified automatically. I was working with a big linear equation system with some constrained inequalities and noticed a lot of "1. xyz" terms. I tried `Simplify[1. x == x]` which gives `True`, but `1. x` stays `1. x`. I'm using the simple rule `Rule[1., 1]` to simplify the "1. xyz" terms in my equation system; it just looks somehow "better" (in my opinion). Function `Times` was last modified in version 3, so this behaviour should exist for a long time now. What is the logical reason behind?
