I am looking for a good analogy to help the concept of a method in ruby stick in my head. When I truly understand a concept, an image flashes in my mind that relates something physical to the abstract concepts I am trying to learn. For example, someone explained the concept of a variable to me in the following way: > A variable is like a box you can put things in. The name of the variable is > like taking a sharpie and writing a word, like "forks" on the side of the > box. Picking a good name is important. You can stick anything in the box, > but if you write 'forks' on the side of the box, you would expect forks to > be in the box. You can put anything in the box, then carry it around to > various people, and tell them "there are forks in this box." When they need > a fork, they go to the fork box and get out a fork. That's the sort of physical, image-based, concrete analogy I am looking for for a ruby method. Right now most definitions I have found are useless to me. For example, at turtorialspoint, the first result for the google search 'what is a ruby method,' has the folowing definition. > Ruby methods are very similar to functions in any other programming > language. Ruby methods are used to bundle one or more repeatable statements > into a single unit. Let me give you an example of why this definitions is useless to me. I'm going to replace every word and concept in this definition that I don't understand with the word 'blah.' > Ruby blah are very similar to blah in any other programming language. Ruby > blah are used to blah one or more blah blah into a single blah. In summary, can I get a good, physical analogy for the concept of a method in ruby?
