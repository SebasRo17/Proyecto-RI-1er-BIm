I've had some discussion with colleagues who chose to go with JRuby along the following line of argumentation: JRuby can make use of anything that is available in Java, ergo such programs are more portable bc Java is more portable. Arguably, the breadth, capability and speed of C/C++ libraries that have been wrapped for Python is still better than what is available in Java. But since this is C/C++, all the problems with portability reappear this way - or so their argument went. Have you ever had such a problem? that is, problem with portability of Python's extensions? Personally, I have never found this to be a problem, but YMMV, while theoretically and potentially this is a problem. I'm curious of your experiences.
