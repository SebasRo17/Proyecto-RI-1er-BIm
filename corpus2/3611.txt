I am writing a text that I am going to publish on-line. When I transform it from the notebook into the pdf format I get the numeration style typical for Mathematica: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2WHPE.png) I would like to edit the text following the page numeration. For example, instead of "2|Supporting Materials 3.nb" I would like to leave either simple "2" or "2|Supporting materials". My question is: is it possible to edit this?
