I have recently run into an algebra problem that goes as follows. Using the numbers 1-9               A + B + C + D = EF     E + F + G + H = CJ     B + G + J = ?D     total = B?      where each letter is a different number. I believe when it says `EF` it does not mean `E*F` but more like if answer was `15`, then `E = 1` and `F = 5`. Been working on this for hours, even attempted to write a computer program to help solve but to no avail. Any tips on how to solve (or a work through of it) would be greatly appreciated.
