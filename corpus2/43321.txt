I seem to remember reading somewhere some list of 4 "levels" of understanding multithreading. This _may_ have been in a formal publication, or it _may_ have been in an extremely informal context (even like in a Stack Overflow question, for example). Unfortunately I don't remember who referred to them or precisely what they were. I seem to recall that they were roughly like:   1. Total ignorance   2. Awareness mixed with incompetence   3. Relative competence mixed with fear   4. True understanding My intention is to refer to these levels in a blog post I'm writing, with a reference; but I can't for the life of me remember where I first encountered this list. Brief Google searches have proved unfruitful.
