I am trying to generate a list of dates that match two criteria: they have to all be the first of the month, and they have to be a particular day of the week, Sunday in my case. The code I have written is this: `Select[DayRange[{1901, 1, 1}, {2000, 12, 31}], DayName[#] == Sunday && # == {_, _, 1} &]` I.e. I want to `Select` only those days in between the `DayRange` 1 january 1901 and 31 December 2000 that match the criteria of being a `Sunday` as well as (`&&`) being the first of the month (`{_, _, 1}`). However, this function just outputs an empty list. I'm still new to Mathematica, but in as far as I can see everything here should work fine. What am I doing wrong?
