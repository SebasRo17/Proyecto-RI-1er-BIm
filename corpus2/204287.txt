If I have a variable containing a `List` it could contain objects of a lot of different types e.g. `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`. The difference between a `LinkedList` and an `ArrayList` is pretty big. The big O behavior of the methods differs greatly. For example sorting the `List` and then using it to do binary searches is perfectly ok for an `ArrayList` but would not make sense with a `LinkedList`.
