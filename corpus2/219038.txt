When Googled, many responses for this topic come up. However, I don't feel like any of them do a good job of illustrating the difference between these two features. So I'd like to try one more time, specifically... **What is something that can be done with self-types and not with inheritance, and vice-versa?** To me, there should be some quantifiable, physical difference between the two, otherwise they are just nominally different. If Trait A extends B or self-types B, don't they both illustrate that being of B is a requirement? Where is the difference?
