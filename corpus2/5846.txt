When the Wolfram Demonstrations were introduced and the Documentation-Center was redesigned, I remember it was the first time I thought someone had put some effort into creating a beautiful stylesheet. I don't like most of the other styles and in fact, I think _PrimaryColor_ is so ugly that I cannot believe it is included in the standard templates. On the other hand, I have seen some quite nice things when I spoke on a _Mathematica_ -day and we used a common stylesheet for the slides. That's why I wonder whether there are other styles out there which are worth sharing. **Question:** Does someone know resources where people shared their stylesheets? I'm especially interested in things one can use for talks.
