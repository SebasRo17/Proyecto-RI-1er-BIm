I am writing the documentation for my package using Wolfram Workbench 2. But when I open DocumentationTools under Palettes, I get this unpolished piece of junk: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LqC1p.png) The top half is a total waste of space (it appears to be some kind of warning...), and the right-half of all the buttons are cut off by the completely fixed size of the window. **Option Inspector** refuses to respond to any changes made for Window Properties for "DocumentationTools". What can I do to make this more useable?
