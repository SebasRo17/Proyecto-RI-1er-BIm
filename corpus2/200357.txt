I'm building an Online Food Ordering System with PHP and MYSQL, One of the feature of the application is to allow users to search for the restaurants by typing the area name. I would like to know using PHP for search will be more efficient or using Stored Procedure or using any third party tool. Efficient in the sense when it is to be searched among large set of data which one will be the fastest?
