I am trying to save some graphics into a file, and it seems impossible.               x1 = Round[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[325, 5], 25], 0.1];     x2 = Round[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[325.5, 2], 25], 0.1];     x3 = Round[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[327.5, 7], 25], 0.1];          h1 = Histogram[x1, 6, "Probability",         ChartLegends -> {"\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(x\), \(1\)]\)"},         ChartStyle -> {Directive[Red]},         PlotRange -> {{308, 342}, {0, 0.5}}];     h2 = Histogram[x2, 6, "Probability",         ChartLegends -> {"\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(x\), \(2\)]\)"},         ChartStyle -> {Directive[Blue]},         PlotRange -> {{308, 342}, {0, 0.5}}];     h3 = Histogram[x3, 6, "Probability",         ChartLegends -> {"\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(x\), \(3\)]\)"},         ChartStyle -> {Directive[Green]},         PlotRange -> {{308, 342}, {0, 0.5}}];        Export["C:\CompareHist.png", GraphicsColumn[{h1, h2, h3}]]      Of course I cannot use save graphics into file option as there is no such option. And by the way: why Export functions always fails? Even when trying to follow tutorial. Is it some known bug?
