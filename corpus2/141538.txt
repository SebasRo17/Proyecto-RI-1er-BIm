At the moment every javasrcipt file in our project includes closure wrapper. Before deploying all files are concatenated and minimized. And i'm asking myself, do we really need all that closures OR one closure added after concatenation will do the job. I can see only one reason not to do that - the variable we are sharing between files will get in the global namespace. But there is no conflict so is don't see any problem. The real question is what other cons may be? Or more generally what approach is better - one closure or many?
