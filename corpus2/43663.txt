I'm considering getting Mathematica Workbench 2. Looking at the videos on Workbench 2 and on "Profiling Mathematica code" @ 01:09 I see the current version nr 2 dates back to at least oktober 3 2007 i.e soon to be 7 years old. This seems a bit outdated to be software. I don't seem to find any revision history. Are there any alternatives on the market, that have similar capabilities and are more up to date ?
