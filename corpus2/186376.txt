I'm a very junior developer fresh out of college, and in my first programming job. I'm pretty unhappy with my current company-the software engineering standards here are pretty shoddy-the code base is full of uncommented, undocumented source code, with whoppers like 664 line methods (with about 40 lines of commented out code) in our production code. I mentioned it to the boss and he doesn't care, and honestly at this point I don't either-I'm looking for a new job. When I interview next, how much should I mention this to a prospective employer? That my former (current?) company has shoddy engineering standards, coded by people who seemingly got their CS degrees mail order (well, I'd be a bit more diplomatic about it). I don't think that maintaining code with 10,000+ lines of zero comments or documentation is a good way to start a career and develop good habits. The question is, how do I tell this to future prospective employers? EDIT: I should mention that I have other, totally innocent reasons I can mentioned why I left/am looking for a new job, but don't know how much of the shoddy engineering I should mention.
