I have data of the form `{x,y}` for different concentrations. Therefore I added the concentration as `z`, resulting now in `{x,y,z}`. Example data (for concentrations A:1%, B:2%, C:4%):               dataA = {{1, 20, 1}, {2, 19, 1}, {3, 18, 1}, {4, 17, 1}, {5, 16, 1}};          dataB = {{1, 20, 2}, {2, 19.5, 2}, {3, 19, 2}, {4, 19.5, 2}, {5, 16, 2}};          dataC = {{1, 20, 4}, {2, 21, 4}, {3, 20.5, 4}, {4, 19.5, 4}, {5, 16, 4}};      Now I want to make a 3D surface plot from these traces (by 2D-interpolation). How to do that? **Edit:** the real data here: dropboxlink
