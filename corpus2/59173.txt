I need to loop over a set of equations, solving for X and adding the new X value to the old X value at each step. The output I need is a list `{x1, x1 + x2, x1 + x2 + x3, etc...}` where `xn` is the solution to the n`th equation. I have tried to do this using a `For` loop but I am getting errors. Here is a simplified version of my code: > $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded. >> > > $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded. >> > > $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded. >> > > General::stop: Further output of $RecursionLimit::reclim will be suppressed > during this calculation. >> How can I get the result I want? I am using _Mathematica_ 7
