Given the following two equivalent inverse functions, why does one simplify (using inverse functions that are acceptable to me) and the other doesn't? Is there an assumption or setting I can give which will force these to use inverse functions and simplify properly?               $Assumptions = A > 0 && k < 1 && k > 0;  (* This seems irrelevant *)     InverseFunction[(#1 A^k (#1)^k) &]     InverseFunction[(#1 (A #1)^k) &]      Is the issue that the #1 isn't given an assumption? Originally came from a problem with Solve which has the same basic behavior, even seems to have consistent behavior:               $Assumptions = A > 0 && k < 1 && k > 0 && m > 0 && z > 0;     Solve[z A^k (z)^k == m, z]      Solve[z (A z)^k == m, z]
