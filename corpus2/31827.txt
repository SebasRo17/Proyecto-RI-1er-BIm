How do I create a list of tuples with an ordering imposed on them, where each element is from a generating set? Specifically, I'm trying to create a listing of tuples $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ such that $x_1 > x_2$, $x_2 \leq x_3 \leq \cdots x_n$ where each $x_i$ is in (say) $X = \{a,b,c,d\}$. The elements of $X$ are in lexicographic order. Code:               rank = 4;     weight = 3;          X = Range[rank];      bc = Tuples[X, weight];     Cases[bc, {x1_, x2_, x3_} /; x1 > x2 && x2 <= x3]      Issues 1. rank and weight are independent; they don't need to be =. 2. I'd like to say x1_, .., xrank_, but I'm not sure how to specify x_rank. Also x2 <= x3 <= ... <= xrank. (I'll loop on rank and weight, so these won't be hard- coded values.) 3. At the end, 1, 2, ..., rank should be traded for a, b, ... (whatever letter).
