I have been looking into how to document software projects more formally, and I have learned about IEEE 830-1998: Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications. However, as you can see from that link, it has been superseded. I know that 830-1998, and probably even 830-1993, are probably just fine for use. However, if nothing else, I would like to know what standard has superseded it. In this case it may not matter, but if other standards are superseded for more technical things, I think it would be a good idea to link somewhere what standard superseded another (if it is not another one in the same line (830, in this case)). It is worth mentioning that:   1. The most recent standard when searching for "Software Requirements Specifications" or "Software Requirements" on the IEEE Standards Association website is 830-1993,   2. The 2004 (current) version of SWEBOK references 830-1993 (paragraph 2.5),   3. The document's Wikipedia article doesn't mention that the standard was superseded.  TLDR: How do you find what standard superseded another, and which one took 830-1998's place?
