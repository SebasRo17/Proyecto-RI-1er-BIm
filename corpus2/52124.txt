Consider the Root objects               roots = Table[Root[-1 + 27 #1^2 - 162 #1^4 + 243 #1^6 &, i],{i,1,6}]      These can be expressed in terms trigonometric functions as follows               trig =        {-2/3 Cos[Pi/18], -2/3 Cos[5 Pi/18], -2/3 Cos[7 Pi/18],          2/3 Cos[7 Pi/18], 2/3 Cos[5 Pi/18], 2/3 Cos[Pi/18]}      This can be checked Numerically, but also exactly using the following expression:               And @@        MapThread[         PossibleZeroQ[ToNumberField[#1 - #2], Method -> "ExactAlgebraics"] &,          {roots, trig}]      > True Is there a way to have Mathematica translate between these two things? I have not been able to make FullSimplify do it. Does anyone know of something like a RootToTrig function?
