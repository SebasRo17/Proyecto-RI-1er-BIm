I want to calculate the Kronecker product of several matrices in different orders. the number of these matrices must be changeable.               sysdim = 5;(* number of matrices I want to multiply. this number must be changeable*)          id = IdentityMatrix[sysdim];          sp = (* it's a matrix. It can be anything. It's size is sysdim by sysdim*)          Do[Subscript[variable, i] = ReplacePart[KroneckerProduct[id, id, id, id, id], {i ->     sp}], {i, 1, sysdim}]      By this I can get all different Kronecker products corresponding to different orderings. However, I want to change the number of these matrices as I wish. So, I thought the solution could be something like this:               KroneckerProduct[Table[id,{i,1,sysdim}]]      The problem here is that the `Table`command returns:               {id, id, id, id, id}      which `KroneckerProduct`is not happy with. I need to get rid of the outermost braces to get the `KroneckerProduct`to work.
