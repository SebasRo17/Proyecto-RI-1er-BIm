Using pointer, I am able to modify the private value of the class in the code below. Does it violate the C++ concept that private member can only be modified by member or friend functions?               #include<iostream>     using namespace std;          class demo     {             private: int info;                  public:                      demo()                      {                              info=10;                      }                           void print_info()                      {                            cout<<info;                      }     };          int main()     {               demo ob;          int* ptr=(int*)&ob;               *ptr=20;               ob.print_info();               return 0;     }
