So, I have a web application that I need to build. The application will be done in a LAMP environment. I'm being given the resources to bring in 2 other programmers to work on my team. I have team lead and architecture experience before, so taking charge isn't a problem. The roadblock that I am experience is that I am currently living in a developing country. They have plenty of Software Engineer programs at universities, but no training/classes on really anything relating to LAMP. It is all C++/Java. So, I have a set of resumes I've culled as experience programmers that seem intelligent sitting in front of me. They come from various backgrounds, which include a couple Java developers, an old-school C++/MFC type guy, some C# devs, and a whole bunch of young out of school C++/Java developers. I'm honestly already leaning one way on which skillset I think would mold the easiest to web dev, but as I am not an application developer (exposure in school, but that was a while ago), I though I might open it up and ask you guys: Which skillset of these do you think would lead into the easiest transition to web development? I'm especially curious to hear from anyone who moved from application side over to web development.
