If you have a single property that is relevant across a full project, but you should logically have only a single representation of, how would you represent this? In my case, I am developing a simple drawing app where the user can select a colour. This colour should then be available to all the pen/shape classes in the project. Would I simple just have a static class with a static property of Color CurrentColor (C#), that each client class could then call, or is there a more effective way?
