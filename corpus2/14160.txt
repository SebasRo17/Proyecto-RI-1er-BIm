I'm trying to plot a phase portrait for the differential equation $$x'' - (1 - x^2) x' + x = 0.5 \cos(1.1 t)\,.$$ The primes are derivatives with respect to $t$. I've reduced this second order ODE to two first order ODEs of the form $ x_1' = x_2$ and $x_2' - (1 - x_1^2) x_2 + x_1 = 0.5 \cos(1.1 t)$. Now I wish to use mathematica to plot a phase portrait. Unfortunately, I'm unsure of how to do this because of the dependence of the second equation on an explicit $t$. Thanks.
