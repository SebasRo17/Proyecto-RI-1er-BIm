I've been trying to find what I'm supposed to do when I want to use code I find on GitHub. I think this post had some good information but I'm still somewhat confused. I want to use code found in this repository https://github.com/wcdolphin/python-bcrypt So according to the answer given the post, I'm to take the content in the LICENSE file of that repository and add it to the LICENSE in my project? I understand that I should give acknowledgement to the creator, how do I do that? Do I create a .txt file in the directory that holds the module that is their code and say something like "Created by wcdolphin, found at https://github.com/wcdolphin/python-bcrypt"? Also, I haven't used used libraries beyond what is included with the Python library before. I see installation instructions there, but that would only work on my machine right? Can I download and add these files into my project directory and use them as modules? I found this post but I'm not sure if I can custom install stuff on Google App Engine. I intend on hosting my project up there(I'm not going to try to homebrew encrypt super sensitive information, it's more of a demonstration) and I think, with my limited knowledge, uploading the source with my source would be the best way. Thanks
