This question applies to any package, but I encountered this problem while working with graphs. There are symbols in the `Combinatorica` package (such as `Graph`, `IncidenceMatrix`, `EdgeStyle`, and others) that have the same name as analogous symbols in `System`. If I execute `Needs[Combinatorica`]`, then I can access `Combinatorica`Graph` by the name `Graph`, but if I want to access `System`Graph`, I have to write `System`Graph`. I want to use the `Combinatorica`` prefix to access all the symbols in `Combinatorica``, and I want to access `System`` symbols without using a prefix. And I don't want to have the symbols `Graph`, `IncidenceMatrix`, and so on, in red in Mathematica because of the naming conflict. Is there a way to use the `Combinatorica`` package without introducing naming conflicts?
