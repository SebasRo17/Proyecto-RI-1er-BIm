I have been having problems wrapping my brain around how to properly utilize the modular extension for Codeigniter. From what I understand, modules should be entirely independent of one another so I can work on one module and not have to worry about what module my teammate is working on. I am building a frontend and a backend to my site, and am having confusion about how I should structure my applications. The first part of my question is should I use the app root controllers to run modules, or should users go directly to the modules by urls? IE: in my welcome.php               public function index()     {       $this->data['blog'] = Modules::run( 'blog' );       $this->data['main'] = Modules::run( 'random_image' );       $this->load->view('v_template', $this->data);     }          public function calendar()     {       $this->data['blog'] = Modules::run( 'blog' );       $this->data['main'] = Modules::run( 'calendar' );       $this->load->view('v_template', $this->data);     }      My second part of the question is should I create separate front/back end module folders               -config     -controllers       welcome.php       -admin         admin.php     -core     -helpers     -hooks     -language     -libraries     -models     -modules-back       -dashboard       -logged_in       -login       -register       -upload_images       -delete_images     -modules-front       -blog       -calendar       -random_image       -search     -views       v_template.php       -admin         av_template.php      Any help would be greatly appreciated.
