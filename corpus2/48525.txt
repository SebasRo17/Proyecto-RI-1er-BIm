a[x_, y_] := -1     b[x_, y_] := x     c[x_, y_] := x     d[x_, y_] := -(1/2)          h[x_] = c1*x^2 + c2*x^3 + O[x]^4;          h[0] = 0;          D[h[x], x] = 0 /. {x -> 0};          cz3 = Solve[ h[a[x, y]*x + b[x, h[x]]] == c[x, h[x]]*h[x] + d[x, y], {c1, c2}]      I am using Implicit Function Theorem/center Manifold to determine stability of the fixed point give me P(x*)=1. But for the above `h`, I need to determine `c1` and `c2` but my programme gives me nothing. I know I think simple but I have recently started to use _Mathematica_. Please help me! I don't know what to use in here.
