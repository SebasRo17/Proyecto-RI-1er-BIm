As far as I understand, the Crank-Nicolson method (a.k.a. trapezoidal method) can be expressed as a second order implicit Runge-Kutta method. It's Butcher tableau is:                0 |  0    0      1 | 1/2  1/2     ---|----------        | 1/2  1/2      And yes these coefficients can be found in:               NDSolve`ImplicitRungeKuttaLobattoIIIACoefficients[2, Infinity]     {{{0, 0}, {1/2, 1/2}}, {1/2, 1/2}, {0, 1}}      But when I try:               NDSolve[{y'[x] == Cos[x], y[0] == 0}, y, {x, 0, 1},       Method -> {"FixedStep", Method -> {"ImplicitRungeKutta", "DifferenceOrder" -> 2,                   "Coefficients" -> ImplicitRungeKuttaLobattoIIIACoefficients}},       StartingStepSize -> 0.1]      I get an ~~error~~ warning:               NDSolve`ImplicitRungeKutta::cmsing:       Singular coefficient matrix encountered for       NDSolve`ImplicitRungeKuttaLobattoIIIACoefficients, which is not suitable for stiff systems.      **Question:** Why this? (I have Mathematica 8. Also tested on Mathematica 9, same behavior.)
