I'm a new software developer, and in my internship my boss asked me to develop an application that allows him to manage his inventory. Something small but, for me, very enriching. The application is running, he found some bugs and problems but I fixed them. This is not the problem. My problem is that when I was working on the application, I didn't know what I was doing, so everything was in disorder. The project took me 2 months and another developer said that he could do it in a month or less. This surprised me, so I want to know: **How does a professional developer plan a project before starting development?**
