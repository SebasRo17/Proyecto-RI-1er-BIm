When dealing with complicated algorithms in languages with support for nested functions (such as Python and D) I often write huge functions (because the algorithm is complicated) but mitigate this by using nested functions to structure the complicated code. Are huge (100+ line) functions still considered evil even if they're well-structured internally via the use of nested functions? Edit: For those of you not familiar with Python or D, nested functions in these languages also allow access to the outer function scope. In D this access allows mutation of variables in the outer scope. In Python it only allows reading. In D you can explicitly disable access to the outer scope in a nested function by declaring it `static`.
