Background: consider the following snippet:                gp := Graphics      bill = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/FyojA.jpg"];      poly1 = {{1, 0}, {.5, .86}, {-.5, .86}, {-1, 0}, {-.5, -.86}, {.5, -.86}};      g1 = {Texture[bill], Polygon[poly1, VertexTextureCoordinates -> poly1]};      poly2 = {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}};      g2 = {Texture[bill], Polygon[poly2, VertexTextureCoordinates -> poly2]};      g1 // gp      g2 // gp      ![example of output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hywwS.jpg) The option `VertexTextureCoordinates` isn't entirely clear to me. I want to put an image with the correct ratios in the hexagon left. So for example on {{-.5,-.5},{.5,-.5},{.5,5},{-.5,.5}}. (I have not been able to get this to work although I have tried all sort of possibilities) However with the restriction that if I rescale the (coordinates of the) hexagon the image should be scaled accordingly. EDIT-1: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FyojA.jpg) Image as requested. EDIT-2: This nicely sums up and demonstrates the answer by Heike:                rescale1[poly_, p1_, p2_] :=        Transpose[{Rescale[poly[[All, 1]], {p1[[1]], p2[[1]]}, {0, 1}],          Rescale[poly[[All, 2]], {p1[[2]], p2[[2]]}, {0, 1}]}]      Manipulate[       g = {Texture[bill],           Polygon[poly,            VertexTextureCoordinates -> rescale1[poly, leftbot, righttop]]} //          Graphics,       {leftbot, {0, 0}, {1, 1}}, {righttop, {0, 0}, {1, 1}},        Initialization :> {righttop = {1, 1}}, ControlPlacement -> Bottom]      Key is the mapping between the image and vertextexture coordinates.
