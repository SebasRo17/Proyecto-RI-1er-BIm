If the license is GPL then point 3 would suggest that derived works must be distributed under the GPL too, which is the intention of such a 'viral' license. Taken together with point 1 though there seems to be a contradiction, as the GPL specifically restricts you from selling the software. As the OSI lists the GPL as OpenSource I must be missing something. Can anyone explain? EDIT: The FAQ section of the OSI site seems to speak to this issue but I am still unsure about their answer. I think this should mean that you can use GPL code in software that you sell as long as you also provide on request the new source code. However section 9 says: >   9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software > > > The license must not place restrictions on other software that is > distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must > not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be > open-source software. Is the distinction here that derived software must be under the same license (point 3) but 'packaged with' is ok to be under a different license? I'm not quite sure what "distributed on the same medium" means.
