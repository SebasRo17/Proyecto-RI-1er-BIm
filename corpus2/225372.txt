I don't know how a 4-bit instruction could be enough to do something so I read about the Intel 4004 and it says that it used 8-bit instructions and then I can understand how opcode and numbers has enough digits. Is it true that there never were any 4-bit instructions and that 4-bit systems use 8-bit instructions?   And that opcode and two numbers in an instruction can be done in 8 bits but not in 4 bits?
