Imagine the following scenario: You've detected that your (or someone else's) program has a bug - a function produces the wrong result when given a particular input. You examine the code and can't find anything wrong: it just seem to bog out when given this input. You can now do one of two things: you either examine the code further until you've found the actual cause; or you slap on a bandage by adding an `if` statement checking if the input is this particular input - if it is, return the expected value. To me, applying the bandage would be completely unacceptable. If the code is behaving unexpectingly on this input, what _other_ input that you've missed will it react strangely to? It just doesn't seem like a fix at all - you're just shoveling the problem under the rug. As I wouldn't even consider doing this, I'm surprised at how often the professors and books keep reminding us about how applying "bandage" fixes is not a good idea. So this makes me wonder: just how common are these kinds of "fixes"?
