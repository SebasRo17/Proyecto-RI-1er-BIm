I have about ten lists of numbers and some strings. Each list has about <= 30K lines. Each line on a list has a distinct number. I need to build an efficient way of finding all the lines in each list that has the same 'control' number (or key for dB guys) and comparing what is in their string parts. I am writing this in Java. Let me give an actual example of what I am trying to do..... I have ten lists each containing about 30K records. Each record looks like 901234(key)- 1.0987(float)-kadfnfj(Description String)-01/01/01(date) and all lists have similar records some keys may be available in some lists but not guaranteed!.. I want to find a way to search through all lists for one particular key and compare the attendant float value. Due to the size of the lists, i am worried about the memory usage and due to the number of records, I am worried about the efficiency of the data structure used. I have thought about using trees but my brain cells are about burnt now. I need some help.
