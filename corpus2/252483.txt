I have a git repository with a folder in it. The folder is listed in my .gitignore file. I cloned another repository into that ignored folder from github. I may want to work inside of the new repository but I don't see any reason for it to be a part of the original repository. Perhaps I should just keep it outside of the original repository but it seems (to me anyway) like a reasonable place for it thematically (its in a place where I would know to look for it). I guess I'm having a hard time getting my head around the concept of a submodule. My specific question is "Should I use a submodule in this situation, even when the folder is ignored?" I noticed that "git status" gives me status of my original repository even though I issue the command inside of the ignored folder
