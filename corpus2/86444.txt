This is just a question to think about. When you write technical documentation and programming comments, do you ever find yourself writing run-on sentences in order to be more precise? Is packing more technical information into one sentence better than creating many little sentences each with a little bit of technical information? I know it's better to have lots of little classes in their own little files. Perhaps this doesn't apply to writing?
