Today in class we were shown how to create an infinite limit graph (plot) given the preceding conditions. While I have a fairly terrible sketch of this graph in my notebook, I'd like to create a clean version with Mathematica to import into my notes. Here were the conditions: $$ \begin{align*} g(2)&=1\\\ g(5)&=-1\\\ \lim_{x\to4}g(x)&=-\infty\\\ \lim_{x\to-7^-}g(x)&=\infty\\\ \lim_{x\to-7^+}g(x)&=-\infty\\\ \end{align*} $$ Any help would be appreciated!
