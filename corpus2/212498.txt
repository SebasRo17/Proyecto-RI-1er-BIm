My program interacts with another application via a socket communication. The current public version of this application does not support a specific command while the newest trunk does. To be compatible with the current public release, I just need to re-write few lines of code. From the current point on, development must continue with this _changed code_ , but in the future the original code should be used again. Is it possible to make a partial change to a file temporary with Git? I could create a branch, for instance, and continue developing in this branch. However, when I merge the branch into the master, I want the _changed code_ mentioned above to be reverted to its _original code_. _Note_ : I am well aware that I could distinguish between versions of the software, however the changes have also effect on GUI resource files which I can not affect from code other than simply loading a different resource file.
