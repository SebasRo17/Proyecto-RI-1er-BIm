I'm currently working on project, which is going to demonstrate how widgets can be done with Context Framework. I will also publish the source code. In this case I want to give users as much freedom as possible, so that they can freely copy-paste, modify and also relicense whatever code they reuse. So, how do I mention that in the project? Are the some ready-made licences etc. that are suitable for this?
