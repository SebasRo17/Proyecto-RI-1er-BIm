I am using _Mathematica_ for physics research and I want to minimize a Hamiltonian equation with respect to two variables (I have also discretized the problem). I have a single constraint. When I plot the result from `NMinimize` for two variables, the end behavior for one of them is not very stable. Is there a way of making `NMinimize` more precise, so I can get a stable solution?
