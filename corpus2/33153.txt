I have a list of list as below (I show part of it)               {{1902, 0.4662}, {1903, 0.22443}, {1905, 0.02936}, {1906,        0.02702}, {1908, -0.08354}, {1909, -0.05241}, {1911,        0.02388}, {1912, 0.03738}, {1914, 0.25015}, {1915, 0.2831}, {1917,        0.4415}, {1919, 0.18315}, {1921, 0.2256}, {1923, 0.24132}, {1926,        0.21473}, {1928, 0.29596}, {1930, 0.47693}, {1933, 0.41607}, {1935,        0.22161}, {1937, 0.3322}, {1940, 0.2099}, {1942, 0.23376}, {1944,        0.44114}, {1947, 0.15876}, {1949, 0.43953}, {1951, 0.71407}, {1954,        0.9595}, {1956, 0.59436}, {2000, 0.6832}, {2004, 0.86861}, {2007,        0.48201}, {2011, 0.70796}, {2015, 0.57029}, {2020, 0.61997}, {2026,        0.79266}, {2032, 0.78726}, {2038, 0.83884}}      For example, in {1902,0.4662} "1902" represent time 19:02 and 0.4662 represent the data at time 19:02. **What I want to do is to calculate average of the data in every 5 minutes.** That is from 19:02 to 19:06, from 19:07 to 19:11. **Notice the time step is not evenly distributed.** `Histogram` can naturally count how many of the data are in each interval. I want to partition the list like `Histogram` and then I can calculate average in each interval. And notice that the data may not be in a single day. I can't figure out an elegant way to do this with built-in function. Can somebody help me? Besides I think this is a very simple statistical calculation of data. **I want to know what software could do this easily and directly.** Update: the full data sample is here http://en.textsave.org/VdL with date information
