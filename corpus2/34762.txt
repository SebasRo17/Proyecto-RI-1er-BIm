If I have a function:               y = 2a + 5b + c      It can be easily seen that `b` is the most important parameter, next `a` and last `c`. More explaination: Let`s say we have a function $f(a,b,c,\dots,z)$. It doesn't matter what is the body of the function, but we consider only basic mathematical functions.   And the question is: How fast does $f(a,b,c,\dots,z)$ grow, when $a$ argument is growing?   How fast does $f(a,b,c,\dots,z)$ grows, when $b$ argument is growing? It's easy to rate arguments when we do it manually, we know how different functions grow and we can pick the most important argument easily (in finite time). Is there any automatic method to rate it?
