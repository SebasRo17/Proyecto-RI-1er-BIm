using GraphPlot I'd like to make directed arrow connecting a vertex (node) to the middle of an edge but couldn't find a way. Is this even possible using GraphPlot or other graphics-related commands in Mathematica. Basically I'd like to plot enzyme-substrate network and so like to connect node E (enzyme) to an edge connecting substrate S to product P, and scale-up for all Enzyme-Substrate-Product combination. Any help greatly appreciated!!
