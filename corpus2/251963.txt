I am a programmer with a number of years of experience. I realized I got a certain habit. I'm not sure whether it's really a bad habit or not. I get a list of tasks to perform for a solution, even small small tasks, for example,   1. Change resources of this user control   2. Change size of another one   3. Add some HTML and coding on another user control All of these tasks are small. I mean they can be done within 10 minutes, **but I got a bad habit of making small changes and then test them again and again in a web browser**. Is this a good practice? Or should I perform them all at once and then test them together? If it is really a bad habit then how do I rectify it, since it feels like wasting time testing small changes over and over?
