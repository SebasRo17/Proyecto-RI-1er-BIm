Based on this page, I can see that only Apache License 2.0 is compatible with GPL v3. Now my question is, in layman's term, how do I make those two work together? My current situation is that I am developing an application that is made from a GPL v3 licensed programming language. I want to put some form of security on the application and figured I can achieve that via a web service. However, I don't want to expose my web service's code as GPL v3 since it is part of a larger system that I am working on which will be closed source. Is there any way to use the Apache License 2.0 in this scenario? EDIT: For clarity's sake, the programming language I am going to use is LiveCode.
