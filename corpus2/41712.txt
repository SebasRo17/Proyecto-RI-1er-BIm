I am having problems solving this differential equation:               diffeq = m x''[t] == -a E^(b*x'[t]);     sol = DSolve[{diffeq, x[0] == 0, x'[0] == v0}, x[t], t]      The output is {}, that means no solution found, however if I take the first condition out i get:               diffeq = m x''[t] == -a E^(b*x'[t]);     sol = DSolve[{diffeq, x'[0] == v0}, x[t], t]          {{x[t] -> (1/(a b^2))*E^(-b v0) (a b E^(b v0) t + a b^2 E^(b v0)C[2]-m Log[(E^(-b v0) m)/b + a t]-a b E^(b v0) t Log[b (E^(-b v0)/b + (a t)/m)])}}      So I tried to find a value for C[2] that could solve x[0]==0:               solution[y_] = ((x[t] /. sol)[[1]]) /. t -> y;     Reduce[solution[0] == 0, C[2]]          a b != 0 && C[2] == (E^(-b v0) m Log[(E^(-b v0) m)/b])/(a b^2)      I verified the result:               solution[0] /. C[2] -> (E^(-b v0) m Log[(E^(-b v0) m)/b])/(a b^2) // FullSimplify          0      My question is: why couldn't mathematica find this? it can't be because a*b!=0: for this values the solution changes completely and C[2] is easy to find.
