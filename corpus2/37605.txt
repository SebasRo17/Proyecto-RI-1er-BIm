I want to simply set some parameters with sliders and click a button to start animation. I know that I can manage this with Animate and Manipulate, but my animation is written like in this post, because I need to perform some calculations for stop condition. So the point is that I want to start loop after setting parameters and clicking button. Is it achievable? //edit Ok, lets say that in the animation from linked post is some variable m               Clear[p];     Dynamic[p]     Do[p = Plot[m Cos[a x], {x, 0, 100}, Frame -> True,          FrameLabel -> {{None, None}, {x,        Style[Column[{"doing my own animation !", Cos[a x]},          Alignment -> Center], 14]}}, GridLines -> Automatic];     If[a > 0.2, Break[]]; (*condition to stop*)     Pause[.2],     {a, 0.1, 1, .01}     ]      I'd like to start this animation with button, and before that set **m** with slider.
