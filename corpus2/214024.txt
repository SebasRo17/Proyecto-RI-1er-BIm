I own a repository on GitHub to which someone sent a pull request with one single commit. I only want to implement his solution partially, and use about half of the code changes the user made. What should I do in this situation? **Make a branch of his version, then go back and copy and paste the "old" code that I want to preserve from the original version into a second commit.** This may make the diff between commits look larger than it really is, and throw off things like `git blame`. **Copy and paste the code I want to keep from his commit into a new, different commit**. This means that he does not receive credit for his valuable contribution to the code. **Same as the above, copy some of his code into a new commit, but change the author of the commit to him instead of me**. He technically didn't write the _exact_ code that was committed, so I'm not sure if this is frowned upon. But at least he gets attribution for those lines that are used.
