Do large corporations and product companies follow any standard quality models/processes at all?   For example, I have seen that many large organizations have proprietary processes in IT and software development. Back in the days (even before Motorola's Iridium project,) I remember many IT companies scampering for SEI- CMM certification. Do any of the Fortune 500 company try to adopt these quality processes? In my limited experience I have not seen them undergoing audits for adherence to processes. Most of the audits are either financial, or issues pertaining to legalities. Am I just being ignorant, or is this true? If true, how stringently do the companies adhere to the processes?
