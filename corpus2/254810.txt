I've done an extensive amount of GUI programming in Winforms and WPF using C#, and a tiny bit in C++ using MFC. I'm building a personal project using WinAPI mainly to gain a deeper knowledge in Windows Programming. I've found myself quickly stuck on how to organize the project because making even a simple windows application in WinAPI only takes a lot of boilerplate coding in just making UI elements. This wasn't much of an issue in Winforms or WPF since the framework itself somewhat forces you to separate the view and logic, making it easier to organize the code. Are the any recommended patterns / methods on how I should organize WinAPI projects? More specifically, how should I separate the logic between the UI elements and logic in Windows Programming? I'd also love to see any resources and examples on this.
