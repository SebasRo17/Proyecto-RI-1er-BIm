If you are given the task of designing the courses leading up to a degree in computer science and are allowed just two courses on the topic of 'Algorithms', how would you structure the courses? My specific questions are:   1. Should the first course introduce some of the fundamental algorithms of Sorting and Searching without introducing the notions of time and space complexity?    2. A second course on designing algorithms. This course would cover not only time and space complexities but also generic algorithm design techniques such as Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming etc.. This is the typical profile of the students I am designing this course for:   1. Most would be new to the notion of programming though familiar with the use of computers.   2. They would be learning C programming in the same semester that they learn about algorithms.   3. They Would be taking a simultaneous course on introduction to computer science.  Most of the text books I have considered are either too voluminous or too intimidating for the student with over emphasis on the analysis of the complexity of algorithms. Any suggestions on either the appropriate text books or methodology for teaching would be appreciated!
