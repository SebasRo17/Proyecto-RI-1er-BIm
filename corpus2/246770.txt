I have been asked to re-write an old C/C++ project in C++11. The old project is multi-platform, however, in order to deploy the system on other architectures the current process is to log into a remote service which has all the available target platforms (Red Hat Linux, Umbuntu, Sco Unix et al.) and build the .exe on each platform for distribution. Is there a way that I can send the user a package that will self-compile on their architecture and build the correct .exe _without giving the source code_? I am also open to cross-compilation to get around having to log into separate servers and compile for each platform. How easy or not is it to compile a code for different architectures using a cross compiler?
