I am a third year bachelor student in a software engineering program, and I brought up the idea of reading SICP to an adviser to gain a deeper and more fundamental understanding of the principles behind all this software we engineer. He suggested not to learn Scheme to complete the book (because it's not as common as modern dialects of Lisp) but to do the exercises in Clojure instead. It's an already difficult book, if I do attempt the book's exercises in the more modern Clojure, how would that work? For example, I can't find any real solutions, the syntax they teach for Scheme is different, etc.
