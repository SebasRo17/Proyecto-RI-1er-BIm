I am a relatively new to the world of software development and I've used the Ruby on Rails framework to develop relatively simple applications before. I know that frameworks can be extremely useful in terms of getting applications up and running quite quickly. However I also know about the well documented problems that Rails had in terms scalability, and I was wondering if there were any other factors that I should be wary of before deciding to use a web frameworks in general aside from scalability, particularly when designing non-trivial business applications.
