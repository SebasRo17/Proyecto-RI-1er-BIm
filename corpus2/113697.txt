In my 2d destruction derby simulator I have a CargoTruck class and CargoTruckImpl that implement an interface called Truck. CargoTruck has a reference to CargoTruckImpl which is returned through the CargoTruckImplFactory. But then I decided to add to this chain by having CargoTruckImpl and CargoTruckMovementImpl use the interface called Movement. CargoTruckImpl has a reference to CargoTruckMovementImpl which is returned back to CargoTruck through the MovementImplFactory. CargoTruck->CargoTruckImpl->CargoTruckMovmentImpl FuelTruck->FuelTruckImpl->FuelTruckMovmentImpl Is adding to the chain like this bad? Am I violating the Separation Principle or the Open-Closed Principle by using Factory classes this way? Is there a better way of doing this?
