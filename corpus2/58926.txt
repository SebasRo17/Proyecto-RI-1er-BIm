I am new to Mathematica and this is probably a simple question, but I can't figure it out at the moment...               f[x_]:=1/(x-3)      Clearly the vertical asymptote is at `x->3`, as`1/0` is undefined. I would like some kind of function that's output is simply:               3      I need to know where the function is undefined. Some functions give me: `{{x->3}}` and things like that, but I can't work with that. Any help would be great.
