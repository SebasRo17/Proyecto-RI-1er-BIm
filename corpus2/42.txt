We've all had them, managers who have either come from sales or last looked at code 10 or more years ago but think they know how to write code. What can I do to give the impression that I'm grateful for his intervention, but keep it as short as possible so I can get on with my work? Or, should I be engaging more with the manager to educate him/her with modern coding techniques and practices? After all, a manager who understands these will be able to talk sensibly to clients and more senior management when discussing the project and its timescales.
