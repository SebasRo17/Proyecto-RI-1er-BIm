I am a student and I like to develop applications at my own level. While building an application I am the only one in my team. After analyzing the application I choose a library/api to use for the project. For example,these days I am working on a chat application based on XMPP protocol.For that I am using smack api. These third party api's are usually not very well documented nor they have good tutorials before one can start working with the api. These are unlike java api and other popular api's which are very well documented and there are very good tutorials to polish the concepts before one can actually start writing the code for the application. My point is, it takes me a lot of time to implement a simple concept when I am using api of the like of smack. For example it has been quite a time and I have been unable to make one user read another user's status ! There are still many problems. What kind of approach should I follow so that I could maximize my output ? The point is even not maximizing the output but understanding that how the api works.
