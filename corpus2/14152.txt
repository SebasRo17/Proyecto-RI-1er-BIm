I need to evaluate the efficiency of my code. Therefore I would like to evaluate the time the code need for some calculations. Mathematica gives me two possibilities for this kind of evaluation: `AbsoluteTiming[expr]` > evaluates expr, returning a list of the absolute number of seconds in real > time that have elapsed, together with the result obtained. `Timing[expr]` > evaluates expr, and returns a list of the time in seconds used, together > with the result obtained. For both functions the Mathematica Documentation does not provide the section "Properties & Relations" which normally helps to find out the differences between two or more functions. Does anyone have an idea?
