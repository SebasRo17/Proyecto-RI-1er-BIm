What I'm trying to do? I'm using gVim on Windows, and am trying to get something that looks like this. ![alt text](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IqEuN.png) See the indent lines and tab characters? _(check out the link for the big picture if this one is too small)_ I tried a lot of things already, some of them having to do with fonts, some of them having to do with encodings, some of them having to do (it seems) with the current air pressure, and wind speed. But none of them worked.
