In general, the more concise & flexible a language is the slower is the execution of programs written in this language. on the other side, the fast languages are mostly overly verbose, requiring you to write several lines just to output "hello world", which means harder development time and is more error prone. so the question is, is there any measurement of the conciseness to speed ratio?. if yes, how is it called and where can I find some information about it. thanks. **note:** one can create a language of single letter tokens, `p h` printing hello world, that's terseness. conciseness means -for our purpose- as defined here : > Giving a lot of information clearly and in a few words; brief but > comprehensive
