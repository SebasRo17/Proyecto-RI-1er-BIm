Stroustrup says that you should use structs unless you can specify an invariant for the data structure. I have to represent a physical object which holds things such as position, velocity, mass and inertia (and so on). I also want to render the object, for which I will need setup in the constructor and unloading stuff in the destructor. So I guess that's an invariant, but it feels wrong to put all this physics stuff into it that doesn't really have invariants. The drawing parts are pretty trivial, so it doesn't feel worth it to separate them from the rigid body in this case. Any advice? edit: I suppose I just realized the answer to my own question. Rigid bodies **do** have invariants, namely that it has to follow the physical laws.
