When setting a value to a variable inside of a class most of the time we are presented with two options:               private string myValue;     public string MyValue     {        get { return myValue; }        set { myValue = value; }     }      Is there a convention that determines how we should assign values to variables inside of our classes? For example if I have a method inside the same class should I assign it using the property or using the private variable. I've seen it done both ways, so I was wondering if this is a choice or performance is a factor (minor, probably).
