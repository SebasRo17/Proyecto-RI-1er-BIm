I have a list such as `list = {1,4,3,4,6,3,1,2,3,4 ... }` and a range, say, `range = Range[20000]`. I want to obtain the following output:               {{0,1}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,6}, ... {nth element of list, nth element of range}}      where `n` is basically `Range[Length[list]]`. The general question here would be how can I create a list from the $a_i$th index of list `a`, the $b_k$th index of list `b` and so on. I would have tried `MapThread` but I'm trying to use the `Histogram3D` function so I needed this "nice" list.
