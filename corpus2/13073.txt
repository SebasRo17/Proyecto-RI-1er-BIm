I want to connect a shortcut key (ctrl + c) to a `Button` in my application. To that purpose I wrote some code using `EventHandler`. When the mouse button is clicked it's working fine, but the ctrl + c key press isn't working.                EventHandler[ Button["Click"],        {          {"KeyDown", "c"} :>MessageDialog["This is button"],           "MouseClicked" :>MessageDialog["This is button"]        }      ](*EventHandler Function is closed*)
