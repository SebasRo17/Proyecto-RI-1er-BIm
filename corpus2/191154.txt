Independent of the App Store or Google Play, is there a way to track where new downloads or paying customers came from? For example, if an app advertises my app in theirs - is there a way for me to find out which users actually downloaded it? And then pay that app owner a commission? On the web this is done via a tracking URL which places a cookie on a users machine. If they signup within a designated timeframe, they are 'tracked to' whomever had their affiliate code in the URL they clicked and that person would receive commissions. How could this be done with native mobile apps, while not violating Apple/Google rules?
