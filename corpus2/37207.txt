I am new to _Mathematica_ and have recently been exploring graphical animations. So I was experimenting with simple concepts in periodic motion and hence wondered how can I draw a simple spring? Is there an easier/better way to do this? The solution I arrived at was a simple function to draw a spring between two $x$ and $y$ coordinates.               hspring[a0_, x10_, x20_] :=       Module[{a = a0, x1 = x10, x2 = x20, n = 100},       h = (x2 - x1)/n;       xvalues = Table[k, {k, x1, x2, h}];       yvalues = Table[a Sin[m Pi/2], {m, 0, n}];       Line[Transpose @ {xvalues, yvalues}]      ];          vspring[a0_, y10_, y20_] :=       Module[{a = a0, y1 = y10, y2 = y20, n = 100},       h = (y2 - y1)/n;       yvalues = Table[k, {k, y1, y2, h}];       xvalues = Table[a Sin[m Pi/2], {m, 0, n}];       Line[Transpose @ {xvalues, yvalues}]      ];          Manipulate[      Graphics[{hspring[0.2, 0, Abs[2 Sin[x]]], Red, PointSize[0.03],         Point[{Abs[2 Sin[x]], 0}]}, PlotRange -> {{0, 3}, {-1, 1}}],        {x, 0.01, 2 Pi, 0.1}]      ![Horizontal spring](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LmdOY.gif) ![Vertical Spring](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9x9xb.gif)
