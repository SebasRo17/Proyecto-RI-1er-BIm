I am using PHP Codeigniter **MVC** design pattern and I had this project with some sort of specific business processes In my application I will be dealing with 2 existing REST APIs:   1. Google    2. Trello I came up with idea to create **REST API** to act as **Business Logic Layer** (BBL) that in turns access my models directly to fetch needed data to formulate business rules and controller with communicate with BLL with REST client, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p5rMQ.png) Is that bad approach for performance ? Is it better to create **2 layers** of Models one as Data Access Layer **(DAL)** and one as Business Logic Layer **(BLL)**
