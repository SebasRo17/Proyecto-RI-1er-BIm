I love programming, particularly OOP. My school experience was mostly in Java/OOP, and I had a job for a limited time in Java, Python, and other OOP kind of languages. However, a move necessitated a change in jobs, and what I've ended up with now is a web-development and database intensive job. I may possibly hold this job for several years. My question is, will this limit my choices later on? Will I be able to find another Java / software-development kind of job, or will I be rejected because my experience will be mostly in a different area?
