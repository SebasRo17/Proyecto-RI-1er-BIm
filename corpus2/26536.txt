For example, given: `x + 2 x y - x y + y` I need to put it in this form: `x (1 + 2 y) - y (x - 1)`. But _Mathematica_ will simplify (automatically) `x + 2 x y - x y + y -> x + x y + y` and I will not be able to group this expression as I need (I need to factor `(1 + 2 y)`). The main question is how to prevent _Mathematica_ simplifying, _or_ how to factor out `x (1 + 2 y)` from this expression: `x + x y + y`? Alternatively, how to put `x + x y + y` into `x (1 + 2 y) - y (x - 1)`?
