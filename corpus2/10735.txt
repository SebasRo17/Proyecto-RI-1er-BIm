## Motivation I've been trolling through some internal code, trying to glean design practices WRI developers employ when extending Mathematica using top-level code. During my `??...`\-- type searches, I've encountered a number of contexts named either like `SomePackageDump` or with `Dump` appended as a subcontext of `SomePackage`. ## Question What is the designed purpose of these `Dump` contexts and how exactly are they employed (in the overall scheme of evaluation)? Note: I understand the use of `Private` subcontexts. :)
