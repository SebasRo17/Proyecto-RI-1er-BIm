Bugs creeping into code can be minimized, but not entirely eliminated as it is written - programmers are, although many would disagree, only humans. When we do detect an error in our code, what can we do to weed it out? How should we approach it to make most effective use of our valuable time and enable us to spend less time trying to find it and more time coding? Also, what should we avoid when debugging? Note here that we're not talking about _preventing_ bugs; we're talking about what to do when bugs _do_ appear. This is a wide field, I know, and may be highly dependent on language, platform and tools. If so, keep to encompassing answers such as mindsets and general methods.
