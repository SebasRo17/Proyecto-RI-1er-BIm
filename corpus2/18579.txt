Is there any reason to keep using Linq to SQL, or is it better to move to ORM techniques like EF, NHibernate etc. We are using Linq to SQL in a new large enterprise application that will exist for a long time. The motivation for this new enterprise application is that the application was ordinary written in Visual Basic and since Microsoft stopped the support we where forced to rewrite the application. Itâ€™s seems that we are already there but this time with our DAL (Data Access Layer). I have already read this article, but it only compare to EF's weakness.
