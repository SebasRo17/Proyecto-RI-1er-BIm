The name mangling schemes of C++ compilers vary, but they are documented publicly. Why aren't linkers made to decode a mangled symbol from an object file and attempt to find a mangled version via any of the mangling conventions across the other object files/static libraries? If linkers could do this, wouldn't it help alleviate the problem with C++ libraries that they have to be re-compiled by each compiler to have symbols that can be resolved? List of mangling documentations I found:   * MSVC++ mangling conventions   * GCC un-mangler   * MSVC++ un-mangling function documentation   * LLVM mangle class
