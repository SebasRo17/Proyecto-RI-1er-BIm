I am thinking to take the next semester a course called "Digital systems architecture", and I know that we need to program micro-controllers with several programming languages such as C, C++, verilog, and VHDL. I want to be prepared to take that course, but I need to know if I need to study deeper these languages. At this moment, I have taken one course in basic Java dealing with basic methods, data types, loop structures, vectors, matrices, and GUI programing. Must I study deeper Java and then go with C, and C++? Besides, I know basic verilog and VHDL.
