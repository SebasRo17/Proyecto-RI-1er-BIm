I currently know a working knowledge of Python and some related libraries (including the included-with-Python SQLite) for the purpose of making **desktop** applications. I would now like to start to make **"web applications"**. By this, I mean that whatever is on the desktop application will be done by visiting a website...so the web page will have all the same sorts of widgets found in desktop apps (buttons, pulldowns, textboxes, etc). I am **not** interested in making just static web sites or online magazines or things like that. All I know about anything web-related is the basics of HTML and CSS. I also get the sense that I will have to learn Javascript and find a Javascript widget toolkit for the widgets. **I'm unclear on what else I will need.** I've heard a lot of good things about the Django web framework, but I'm not sure what the role of a "web framework" is in the mix here (and I got the sense that Django was used mostly to build things like online magazines, not web applications), though I get the sense I will need one to handle the basics of routing information through the web. I'm also open to the idea of using a different programming language than Python, though I like it and would prefer to keep using it. _I'd like to start simple and make small toy apps just to get the basic ideas, and then build from there._ **EDIT FOR SPECIFIC QUESTION: What are the minimum tools/services will I need to get/learn to produce web apps (as defined above) using Python?** **EDIT 2:** I'm removing references to SaaS. Let's just call it a widget-using web app.
