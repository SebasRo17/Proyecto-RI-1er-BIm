While editing a static HTML file today, I realized, that many things I did using search and replace with regular expressions, would be much easier using JavaScript (and possibly a DOM library like jQuery) and DOM manipulation. I could, of course, load the file into a browser, type some JavaScript into the console and copy and paste the manipulated source code back to the editor. But this would be much easier if the HTML text editor supported this directly, because it could automatically load jQuery, you could store and reuse scripts, the chance that formatting gets lost is smaller, etc. Does anyone know if something like that exists? Preferably for Windows, but suggestions for other operating systems are ok, too.
