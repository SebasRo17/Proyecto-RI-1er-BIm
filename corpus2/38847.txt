I was going through some circuit analysis problem and came up with a second- order differential equation, which I decided to solve with _Mathematica_ : $$ L\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2} I}{\mathrm{d}t^{2}} + R\frac{\mathrm{d}I}{\mathrm{d}t} - \frac{I}{C} = 0. $$ I used the following syntax:               DSolve[{L i''[t] + R i'[t] - i[t]/C == 0, i[0] == 0, L i'[t] == 1}, i[t], t]      Yet _Mathematica_ returns the following error:               DSolve::overdet: There are fewer dependent variables than equations, so the system is overdetermined. >>      However, it is a second-order ODE, and so it should not be overdetermined with only two boundary conditions.
