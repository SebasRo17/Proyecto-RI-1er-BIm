Back in the day, there were a lot of academic programming languages (okay, maybe not a _lot_ , but it seems like there were more than today). I distinctly remember spending time in both high school and college learning languages like Basic, Ada, Pascal, Prolog, Haskell, Scheme, and Turing. While it's unfair to call all those languages solely academic, it's also unfair to say they are industrially equivalent to an enterprise language like Java (or even C or Smalltalk back in the day). My question is, what academic languages are still in use (and still taught today)? It seems like there's a lot of Java schools, and a rising number of Python schools, and even some that teach languages like C as the first programming language - but what would be the modern equivalent to something like Pascal?
