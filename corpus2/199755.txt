I'm securing a WCF webservice with `TransportWithMessageCredential` security that uses certificates. So I'll have to choosee between **signing** headers & body or **signing and encrypting**. Now my question is, after reading _Understanding Protection Level_ what the advantage is of just signing? The fact that WCF will notice that someone has been messing around with the message and going to reject it or am I wrong? Thanks in advance.
