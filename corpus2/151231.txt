Rob Napier, the author of iOS 5 Programming Pushing the Limits, mentioned there are several models of selling apps on the App Store:   1. Write an app and sell it   2. Publish a free and a full version   3. Ad supported by third party or by iAd   4. In App purchase Surprisingly, the author said that the most workable model is (1) in terms of sales. I would think that (2) with fairly limiting ability for the free version can bring more sales, as people without trying, might not plunge down $0.99 or $1.99 for something they haven't tried? I for one, might not have purchased Angry Birds if I didn't try their free version first. Also, I think it also depends on the situation: for example, if the app is an alarm clock, and there are already 5 alarm clocks in App Store that are free, then your app that is $0.99 might not be that eagerly purchased (or they may end up never trying your app). But if yours is also free, and users really like it out of all the other ones, then they may think, $0.99 is nothing to get a good alarm clock, and gladly pay you the $0.99 in exchange for a full version of the alarm clock, for something that they can't get with the free version. (such as the full version can let you choose a song from your Music Library for the alarm). Could (1) work only if the user definitely want it and have no substitute? How might it work the best?
