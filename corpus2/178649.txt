I have a lot of legacy CSS files from what was a Rails 2.x app that got upgraded to Rails 3.2.8, and I want to switch over to using the Rails asset pipeline for stylesheets. The issue is, the CSS stuff is messy in terms of huge lines of code, duplicate file names, and unorganized folder structure. After looking through individual pages, and trying to add individual stylesheets and folders into the asset pipeline and spending some cycles debugging, I realized there's probably a better approach. Is there a way to test to make sure the old CSS matches up with the asset pipeline CSS? What are some good tools for testing and debugging CSS?
