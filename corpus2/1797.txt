You can find the relevant file here : Text File or CSV File This is what the data looks like in Excel : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W1prV.png) Using the following code to import :               BankShadowFed =        Import[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[], "BankShadowFed.txt"}],         "Table"];      I have the following problem: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YKwoW.png) While I can Change to expression each element, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1uGUb.png) I can't get it all right including the dates... What is the right way to `Import[]` those files ? Or `Export[]` them in the first place?
