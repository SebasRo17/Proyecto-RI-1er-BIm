I'm a Laravel (PHP) developer, and new with DI, Packages (workbench) and Repositories (Pattern). I want to know about the best concept/methodology for a more flexible design; ie. the project can grow and become something very modular. For example, after watching some Jeffrey Way videos in Laracasts I decide use that pattern:   * app/   * app/config   * app/controllers   * app/database   * app/views   * app/patrickmaciel (psr-4 in composer.json)   * app/patrickmaciel/user (repositories, eloquent model, validation, etc)   * app/patrickmaciel/group    * app/patrickmaciel/post    * app/patrickmaciel/billing   * app/patrickmaciel/helpers   * app/patrickmaciel/filters But after watch more videos, and reading more about flexibility, I see developers using **packages** instead of this psr-4 alternative (composer.json):               "require": {         "patrickmaciel/group",         "patrickmaciel/user",         "patrickmaciel/post",         "patrickmaciel/billing",         "patrickmaciel/helpers",         "patrickmaciel/filters"     }      So, **what is better for more flexibility**?
