I'm editing my post by giving all the code I have until now. I'd like to write a program which "unravels" randomly and piece by piece a given image. At the moment, I'm using an image randomly created with Image[] (endImage), and I'm starting with a grey background (whitePart and beginImage). I divide the image in partNumber x partNumber parts (here 10):               partNumber = 10;     allParts = Flatten[Outer[List, Range[1, partNumber], Range[1, partNumber]], 1];     endImage = ImagePartition[        Image@RandomReal[1, {400, 400}]        ,        400/partNumber];     whitePart = Image@Table[0.5, {400/partNumber}, {400/partNumber}];     beginImage = Table[whitePart, {partNumber}, {partNumber}];      (* After that, I create a random ordering of the unraveling of the parts with *)               replaceOrdering = RandomSample[allParts];      (* Then, a short function which replaces `beginImage` part number `indexNumber` with `endImage` part `indexNumber`: *)               replacePartWithNumber[tableOfParts_, indexNumber_] :=      ReplacePart[tableOfParts,       replaceOrdering[[indexNumber]] ->         endImage[[Apply[Sequence, replaceOrdering[[indexNumber]]]]]]      (* Creation of the list with recursion: *)               stage[1] = replacePartWithNumber[ beginImage, 1];     stage[n_] := replacePartWithNumber[stage[n - 1], n]      (* which finally gives the `Animate` command: *)               Animate[      ImageAssemble@stage[n]      ,      {n, 1, Length@replaceOrdering, 1}      , DefaultDuration -> 10      , AnimationRepetitions -> 1]      This works for values of `partNumber` till ca. 25. But with `partNumber = 40` or `=50`, Mathematica crashes immediately... Any idea why this is? Any help greatly appreciated!
