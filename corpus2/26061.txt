Recently, I configured `WebMathematica` in my system. I tested with inbuilt examples, all are working fine. Basically, `Helloworld` program returns `Date[]` output. I tried with `Dynamic` wrapper around `Date[]`, the corresponding code is below.                <msp:evaluate>       Dynamic[Date[]]      </msp:evaluate>      I restarted server, it's not working. It shows `Dynamic[Date[]]` as output. In the same way I tried `Button`instead of `Date`, the corresponding code is below, it's also not working, it returns _Mathematica_ code.                <msp:evaluate>       Button[Style["Click", Black, Bold,25], (MessageDialog["This is Tested by Grandhi..."]), ImageSize -> {180, 60}, Background -> LightGray]      </msp:evaluate>      I have 3 questions. 1.How can I fix this problem ? 2.where can I get good WebMathematica examples? 3.Do all _Mathematica_ functions work in `WebMathematica`?
