The following way will put the legends on the right of the figure, and the three legends are vertically aligned.               Plot[{x, x^2, x^3}, {x, 0, 3}, Frame -> True,        PlotLegends -> {"long text 1", "long text 2", "long text 3"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BtTiT.jpg) The following way will put the legends above the figure, but the three legends are in one line, instead of three lines.               Plot[{x, x^2, x^3}, {x, 0, 3}, Frame -> True,        PlotLegends -> Placed[{"long text 1", "long text 2", "long text 3"}, Above]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bkO4v.jpg) How to get a figure such that the legends are above the figure (like the second figure), and they are vertically aligned in multiple lines (like the first figure)?
