Whenever a software license reads: `... The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.` Does this mean you have to include it with the executable (the version customers get) or just the source code (for the programmers)? Sorry if this is a silly question, but it doesn't clearly state what "the Software" is referring to, and I can see people maybe wanting credit for it. If you don't have to include the license with the executable, do you need to give credit in your executable release some other way, like some other kind of copyright notice that just says "Copyright "? Is there a specific format to that?
