How can I change the color of a `Locator` in a `Manipulate`? As an example, consider the following.               Manipulate[       Graphics[{Line[{{0,0},pt}]},         PlotRange -> 2       ], {{pt,{0,0}},{-2,-2},{2,2}, Locator}]      It's easy enough to hide the `Locator` and then add any primitives that I want:               Manipulate[       Graphics[{         Line[{{0,0},pt}],         {PointSize[Large],Red,Point[pt]}},         PlotRange -> 2       ], {{pt,{0,0}},{-2,-2},{2,2}, Locator, Appearance -> None}]      The `Locator` itself, though, seems impervious to any directives I try.
