I'm importing the NGA ASAM piracy database into Mathematica for analysis.               asamjson=Import["http://msi.nga.mil/MSI_JWS/ASAM_JSON/getJSON?typename=\     DateRange_AllRefNumbers&fromDate=19900101&toDate=20140801",       "JSON"];     Needs["GeneralUtilities`"]     asamdataset = Dataset[ToAssociations@asamjson];     piracyLocations =       Map[GeoPosition[ ToExpression@{#["lat"], #["lng"] }]   &,        asamdataset];      I can import the data fine, and get lat/longs (for some reason they're included twice in the ASAM data). I can then draw them with GeoListPlot and get map of all the piracy events.               GeoListPlot[Take[piracyLocations, 300]]      However, when I then go to make a heat map histogram things fall apart. What displayed nicely now shows up with a wildly out of skew map. It looks like I need to choose some different form of projection, but which?               dat = Map[ ToExpression@{#["lat"], #["lng"]}&,Take[asamdataset, 4000]];          histo = SmoothDensityHistogram[dat, .3,       ColorFunction -> "SunsetColors", PlotPoints -> 150, Mesh -> 20,       MeshStyle -> Opacity[.1], PlotRange -> All];          Show[histo,       Graphics[{FaceForm[], EdgeForm[Directive[White, Opacity[.7]]],       CountryData["World", "Polygon"]}]]      How do I project my heatmap of piracy events correctly onto the world? EDIT: My first problem is that Geoposition and related functions take Lat/Long pairs. Which is Y/X, whereas other Mathematica functions take X/Y pairs.
