I'm developing a web application which I started on about 2 years ago. It is an AJAX-heavy single page design and prototype solved problems where I didn't want to reinvent the wheel. I am using a couple of third-party tools that depends on prototype, namely okonet modalbox, protofish tooltips, scriptaculous, My own use of prototype is relegated to simple operations such as reading input values and creating elements. My concern started with the lack of updates for prototype and prima facie evidence on the Internet. If you search for something JScript related jquery is mentioned a lot and prototype hardly at all. Lately it seems that jquery is the toolkit of choice and prototype is stagnating. Should I make the switch to jquery?
