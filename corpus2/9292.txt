Assume $X$ is an exponential random variable with unit mean ($f_X(x)=e^{-x}$, $x>0$). I want to calculate the expected value of $\frac{1}{X}$. Since $X>0$, I am expecting that $\mathbb{E}(\frac{1}{X})>0$, but _Mathematica_ gives some negative value. I tried the following input: `Expectation[1/x, {x \\[Distributed] ExponentialDistribution[1]}]` and _Mathematica_ 's answer is: `-EulerGamma` Is it possible? Am I doing some mistakes?
