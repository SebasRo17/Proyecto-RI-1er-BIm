A simple file reading issue is baffling me here. I am reading a around **200 MB** textual file in `.dat` format. Now the file contains **many lines** but to phrase my problem I am taking here first two lines from the example file.               str = "Tue 1 Jan 2013 23 : 00 : 01; 17; {}; 32.5; 0.\nTue 2 Jan 2013 2 : 20 : 01; 47; {3,4}; 3.5; 110.";      Now I want to use `;` and newline `\n` as my `RecordSeparators` and it works as expected.               ReadList[StringToStream[str],{Record, Record, Record, Record, Record},     RecordSeparators -> {"\n", ";"}]      > {{Tue 1 Jan 2013 23 : 00 : 01, 17, {}, 32.5, 0.},{Tue 2 Jan 2013 2 : 20 : > 01, 47, {3,4}, 3.5, 110.}} But if I want to specify the `Type` of each separate `Record` using for example `{String, Number, Expression, Number, number}` above code fails to work. The error is the following. > Read::readn: Invalid real number found when reading from StringToStream[Tue > 1 Jan 2013 23 : 00 : 01; 17; {}; 32.5; 0. Tue 2 Jan 2013 2 : 20 : 01; 47; > {3,4}; 3.5; 110.]. >> Is this problem solvable or I need to change the formatting of my input .dat file in a way so that it works with `ReadList`? PS: If I need to change the file format what will be best separator to use in this context?
