When I am writing small scripts for myself, I stack my code high with comments (sometimes I comment more than I code). A lot of people I talk to say that I should be documenting these scripts, even though they are personal, so that if I ever do sell them, I would be ready. But aren't comments a form of documentation? Wouldn't this:               $foo = "bar"; # this is a comment     print $foo; # this prints "bar"      be considered documentation, especially if a developer is using my code? Or is documentation considered to be outside of the code itself?
