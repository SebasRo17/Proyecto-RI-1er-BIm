One of my colleagues recently left and I've been asked to review the code of an interviewee coming in to replace him. I have no idea what code he'll bring along with him and moreover have never been given this sort of responsibility before, so am eager to give some useful and fair input. Can anyone provide a succint list of things to look out for?    _I understand this is a very broad question, but this does equally seem like a very appropriate forum for asking it._
