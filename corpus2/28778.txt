Why does the pure function `#1@#2&` have no name? Is it due to the way _Mathematica_ works, or is it "just because"? I'm asking because I find inelegant to write expressions like               MapThread[#@#2 &, {{a, b, c}, {1, 2, 3}}]      > >     {a[1], b[2], c[3]} >   I would rather have a name form such as               MapThread[Work, {{a, b, c}, {1, 2, 3}}]       `Work` is not the best choice but I'm open on suggestions :)   * One may say that there is no name because `#1@#2&` is short enough. But `f/@{1,2,3}` is shorter than `Map[f,{1,2,3}]` and `Map` exists :)   * Then I've thought, maybe it is because `Map` gives other possibilities with 3rd argument and this is the difference. Well, it is a difference, but so what, why ther is no `Work`?
