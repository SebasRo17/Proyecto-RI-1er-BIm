I am developing an application written in ASP.NET (C#) which heavily use on Master Page and Session. As there will be enhancement in the same web application, and will be done by my teammate. is there any good approach that can enable we to work on the same solution, and delivery the change to UAT / PDN separately? the change control team of my company don't allow us to create 2 set of code in UAT and merge it into one set in PDN. any idea is welcome. Thanks.
