I am an intern for a health company (unpaid), let's call it _Company A_ and I noticed that they are using a lot of paper form for things that can be done on the computer. Excel files for things that shouldn't be in Excel. So I wanted to improve on my programming and figured that it was the best opportunity to do. I developed a couple of apps for their use. All these applications were outside company time. One application I did and they love and one of the director has a brother who has a health start up company. He wants me to give over my source code so his brother's company can further develop it and maybe sell it (I am out of the equation). I have no intention of handing over my code as I put a lot of time outside doing it but I also don't want to burn bridges with anyone in the company. I can't go to the director and tell him "I don't think so". I am fine with demoing to the brother how it works but the line is giving up my code. If they want to build something like it then they can go right ahead I have no problem with it. What is the correct way of approaching this and do they have the right to do this to me? Edit: there is no contract I never signed anything
