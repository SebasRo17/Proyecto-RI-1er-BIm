I need to write a C/C++ program and call some functions in _Mathematica_ especially those like `Solve` or `NDSolve`. The problem is that in the _Mathematica_ documentation it seems to me there is no mention about this. There are plenty of details regarding how to create a C function and then call it from within _Mathematica_ , but in my case I need the opposite. Maybe I did not read well, but can you explain me how to do this?
