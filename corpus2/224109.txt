I've been working with TDD, most patterns, mostly OO code and still not found a way of knowing if a particular piece of code confirms to modularity , without the need reviewing the code. On a recent project which had split up everything into jars specifying a "module" which still wasn't modular code. So is there any way of actually knowing or measuring if code is modular or not? Modularity is away of minimizing the ripple effect when doing changes to a system. I've been doing a post mortem on a large system and one of the biggest issues have been the inability of containing changes to a minimum. There are several reasons for this, one where the code is actually not modularized despite following best practices. As a result the belief have been that the system is actually resilient for changes but in practice it isn't. A distinct pattern have emerged and shows why the system fails being modularized and that might be a a way of actually provide metrics for how modularized you code is.
