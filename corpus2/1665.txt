Consider a list, `AK6`, that has 382 sublists of length varying from 2500 to 3000. Each "subsublist" is as such : `AK6[[1,1]]={5.5,1001}` With `AK6[[All,1]]` going from 1001 to 4001 with gaps (missing points) I now need to compute the `Mean[]` for all the sublists with equal second value. That is `Select` with `Flatten[AK6,1]` all the list with 2005 as the second value (from 350 to 384 items approx) I do this using :               ParallelTable[                  Mean[Select[Flatten[AK6s, 1], #[[2]] == gazeNo &][[All,1]]],                   {gazeNo, Range[1000, 4000, 1]}]      It does what I need but this is very slow. Is there a way to do this computation faster? * * * Download the 13 MB list as               AK6 = Uncompress@Import["http://api2.ge.tt/0/9F8d6WD/0/blob/download", "String"];
