1. Vorbis was never threatened by MPEG LA, so it is undoubtedly completely patent free.   (MPEG LA never misses a chance to spread patent FUD)   2. Windows supports mp3, so it isn’t because they want to push their crappy wma.   3. The GPL allows distribution alongside commercial products, and   4. Even if they fear to ship GPL software, they can still load it automatically, like they do with XviD So why can’t a windows customer not simply drop a ogg vorbis file into his/her music library and listen to it via WMP? PS: To counter misconceptions: They already download the GPL’d XviD codec on demand, so they already have 99% of what it takes to do the same with Vorbis. It would take me about 5 minutes to do this, if I were familiar with the WMP code base and directshow filter system. PSS: I was told to ask this here rather than on stackoverflow, so i do.
