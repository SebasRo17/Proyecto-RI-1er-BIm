I am new to _Mathematica_ and I have no idea how to make a basic for loop work. I want to loop through the elements of a list: `Range[45, 200]`. I want to select the elements (i) for which the following conditions holds: if i mod 3 and i mod 8 and i mod 12 == 1 and i mod 5 == 0 I want to print the element. How would I achieve this? I want something like this:               for i in range(45, 201):        if i%3==1 and i%8==1 and i%12==1 and i%5==0:           print i      Of course in _Mathematica_ language. Sorry if this is a dumb question but the _Mathematica_ documentation is pretty hard to understand. Thanks.
