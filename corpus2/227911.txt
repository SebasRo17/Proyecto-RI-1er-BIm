I am moving my companys source control from TFS to GIT. We have TFS currently defined as.   * Project Collection /      * / Client A        * / Product A       * / Product B       * / Product C     * / Client B        * / Product D       * / Product E       * / Product F What is the best way to do this in Git? I have thought about the following:   * Repository (Client A)      * Branch (Product A)     * Branch (Product B)     * Branch (Product C)   * Repository (Client B)      * Branch (Product D)     * Branch (Product E)     * Branch (Product F) What do you think is the best approach as the design is slightly different?
