I decided to learn about balanced search trees, so I picked 2-3-4 and splay trees. What are the examples of splay trees usage in the real world? In this Cornell: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2009fa/recitations/rec-splay.html I read that splay trees are 'A good example is a network router'. But from rest of the explanation seams like network routers use hash tables and not splay trees since the lookup time is constant instead of O(log n).
