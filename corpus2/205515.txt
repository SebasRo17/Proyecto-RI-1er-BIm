We are having a disconnect between development and business needs. Business is asking me to produce an accurate list of deliverables for a fixed date and development being difficult to predict is pushing back saying that can only produce a list 80 or 90% accurate. So my question is, how do we solve this problem? How to provide an accurate list of deliverables weeks before they are completed and fully tested?
