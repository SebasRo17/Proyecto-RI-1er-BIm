I have generated two time series, `S[t]` and `P[t]` as follows:               In[2990]:= Table[S[t], {t, 1, 50}]          Out[2990]= {0.5, 0.5, 2.253, 2.7614, 2.87762, 4.05318, 5.03183, 5.42801, 6.32663,     7.43033, 8.14412, 8.98434, 10.0983, 11.0536, 11.9744, 13.0988, 14.2194, 15.2811,     16.4588, 17.7028, 18.9201, 20.1964, 21.5544, 22.9261, 24.3338, 25.8165, 27.3415,     28.9023, 30.5282, 32.2123, 33.9413, 35.7309, 37.5859, 39.4971, 41.4699, 43.5124,     45.6209, 47.7963, 50.0454, 52.3689, 54.7668, 57.2436, 59.8024, 62.4438, 65.1712,     67.988, 70.8963, 73.8987, 76.9988, 80.1996}          In[3057]:= Table[P[t], {t, 1, 50}]          Out[3057]= {0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 2.22, 2.26635, 2.31409, 4.72832, 5.47929, 5.71359,     7.38173, 8.77145, 9.38649, 10.687, 12.2584, 13.3072, 14.5348, 16.1313, 17.5145,     18.8577, 20.4782, 22.0947, 23.6365, 25.3391, 27.1332, 28.8952, 30.7413, 32.7011,     34.6829, 36.7181, 38.8585, 41.0603, 43.3149, 45.6623, 48.0927, 50.5888, 53.1718,     55.8482, 58.6059, 61.4525, 64.3987, 67.44, 70.5779, 73.8214, 77.1718, 80.6293,     84.2004, 87.8892, 91.6969, 95.6281}      Now, these two time series are related to each other by a lag, `L[t]`. Thus, `S[t]==P[t-L[t]]`. Time series of `L[t]` is not known and I have to find it from given `S[t]` and `P[t]`. My code for this is:               Do[{Do[If[S[t] > P[i], k = i], {i, 1, t}],Print[t-k]},{t,5,50}]      The list of numbers printed out, i.e. `t-k`, is exactly what I expected. So I would like to define `L[t_] := t - k`. But if I substitute this for `Print[t-k]` in the code and `Print` the resulting list of numbers, I get a different result. Is there any way to define this function?
