I would like to know if I am expected to memorize coding in a workspace or am I allow to fall into references whenever I am unsure. In a week of non-stop self learning, I feel I can understand the basics html and CSS, but am I required to memorize every single code once I get a position in this field or is it fair to use references to provide you the edge to finish your development. I was always under the impression you had to hand- code everything but I am wondering if I'll be looked as less of a developer if I fall to references. Understanding that if I do memorize most things, it will save me the time it will take me to code something but I don't want to feel penalized if I need to refer back to a code because I need refresh myself. This Programmers question held a lot of good answers, but they don't quite fit for me. My role is as a graphic designer/illustrator not a developer, and I am still relative new with how the process works. I'll definitely like a strong input to make sure I go along the right path in my learnings Because HTML and CSS are just a starting point, I want to excel in other areas as well. Thanks for taking the time to read my post. P.S (if you have any other additional references or advice, I'll gladly appreciate it)
