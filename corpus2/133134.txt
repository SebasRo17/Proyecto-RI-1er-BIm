How to separate View and Presenter in Android, while the reactions on the user actions (Presenter part of MVP) are set into the same activities that shows GUI elements (View part of MVP). "In model view presenter just as Martin Fowler or Michael Feathers [2] say, the logic of the UI is separated into a class called presenter, that handles all the input from the user and that tells the "dumb" view what and when to display" (cited from here). Till now I thought that one of the main features of Android is the **_smart_** Activity that takes actions, reacts to them and shows the results. Is MVP scheme in contradiction with Android philosophy? Has it sense to try to realize it on Android? If yes, how could it be done?
