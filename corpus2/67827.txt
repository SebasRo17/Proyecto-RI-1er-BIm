I've been programming for the many months. What I've found is :   * My team leader illustrates to me the project.   * I start up with an empty project.   * For many common tasks (like calling webservice, showing grid etc.), I either open my evernote account or my previous project.   * I copy and paste the code and tweak it to meet my current requirement.   * For just normal things (like alertboxes, storing cookies etc.) I use intellisense.   * For anything else I go to google, I search and copy the code after reading and adjust it to my need. When I complete my project my team leader and client are happy because the task is getting done. But is it OK to google the code, store it and use it later? Remember I understand the code, I can tweak it later but I don't remember even the proper names of classes. I don't really remember the code. Am I doing it right?
