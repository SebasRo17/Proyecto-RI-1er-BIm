I want to use undefined functions in expressions to be simplified. For example. I want mathematica to simplify this input $(f^{\prime\prime}(t),g^{\prime\prime}(t))\cdot (-g^\prime(t),f^\prime(t)) $ into this output: $f'(t)g''(t)- f''(t)g'(t)$. How does one go about the "Simplify" command for that first expression in order to get the second one? How do you specify that $f$ is a function of $t$, without of course defining it, in an expression? Cheers
