Theoretically, if I were to build a program that allocated all the unused memory on a system, and continued to request more and more memory as other applications released memory that they no longer need, would it be possible to read recently released memory from another applications? Or is this somehow protected by modern operating system? I have no practical application for this, I'm just curious. I realize there are some issues with allocating "all available memory" in real-life. Edit: To clarify, I'm asking specifically about "Released" memory, not accessing memory that is currently allocated by another application.
