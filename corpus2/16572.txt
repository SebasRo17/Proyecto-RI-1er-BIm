I posted the following on the Google+ group `comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica` and had no luck with responses. I've done a Google search and, to the best of my ability, used the documentation center. The post I made was as follows: > I continue to receive "Unable to interpret unit specification m/s" (for > example, but almost anything I attempt returns this message) with input: > UnitConvert[55 mi/h,"m/s"] or UnitConvert[55 mi/h,m/s] or any other > combination of quotes, omitted quotes, etc. Even the prediction/suggestion > box, when I execute Quantity[55,"mi/hour"}, after it returns 55 mi/h, if I > type in any combination of m/s, "m"/"s", "m/s", etc. into the box that opens > when I select "Convert" in the prediction box yields the same "unable to > interpret unit specification. What am I missing? (As you may gather, I'm a _Mathematica_ novice.)
