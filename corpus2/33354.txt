How can I plot multiple plots for M = 10, 20, 50?               f[x_] = Piecewise[{{1, 0 <= x <= 1}, {-1, -1 <= x <= 0}}];          M = 50;          c = Parallelize[        Table[(2*n + 1)/2 Integrate[f[x]*LegendreP[n, x], {x, -1, 1}], {n,           1, M}]];      I would like to plot for each M at once.               Plot[{Sum[c[[n]]*LegendreP[n, x], {n, 1, M}], f[x]}, {x, -1, 1},       PlotStyle -> {{Red}, {Thick, Blue}}, GridLines -> Automatic]      How can I do this?
