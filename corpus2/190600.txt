I have been reading about traits in Scala. They are pretty amazing. I am curious how they extend a class without actually resulting in multiple inheritance. I know that the JVM doesn't support multiple inheritance, so I am wondering how these extensions work. Is the language just providing syntactic sugar for composition? Or is the code within a trait duplicated in each class that uses it?
