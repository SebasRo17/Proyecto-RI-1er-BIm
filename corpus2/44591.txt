I am seeking to revolve the are between the functions function $d(x) = Exp(x)$ and $e(x) = 4 - x^2$ around the line $x = 2$. I am using `RevolutionPlot3D`, so I thought it best to use the Y axis instead. Here is the modified code:               d[x_] := E^(x + 2)     e[x_] := 4 - (x + 2)^2          RevolutionPlot3D[{{d[x]}, {e[x]}}, {x, -1.96464 - 2, 1.05801 - 2},                      RevolutionAxis -> "Y"]      However, I find that the code does not produce the revolution that I am seeking. Is there a syntax error or an error in my methodology? Any push in the right direction would be quite helpful.
