I have a service written on .NET working on a company server. It designed to do a very simple thing, to receive a request via WCF named pipes from another service working locally on the same server, process it and send a response through named pipes back. Request an response are just a fairly small, XML formatted text. And now I need to couple it somehow with our in-house iOS application to do the same thing but with a remote connection through internet. I'm not all too experienced with an Objective-C iOS development and not sure how to proceed. I was considering adding a TCP endpoint to the same WCF service but then I'm not sure how reliable will it be plus I'll have to use some sort of encryption "manually" on both ends of the connection. I can extend or change code of both .NET server and Objective-C iOS client as much as I need but I'm not sure how to ensure reliability and most of all security of data transfer between server and client. Right now I'm considering rewriting my service part to be a web based app since it works at request-response principle anyway but what would be the best approach? Would it be possible to consume a WCF HTTPS endpoint with an iOS client effective enough?
