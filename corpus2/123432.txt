Recently, I was developing a set of coding standards for our company. (We're a new team branching out into a new language for the company.) On my first draft, I set the purpose of our coding standards as improving Readability, Maintainability, Reliability, and Performance. (I ignored writability, portability, cost, compatibility with previous standards, etc.) One of my goals while writing this document was to push through the idea of simplicity of code. The idea was that there should be only one function call or operation per line. My hope was that this would increase readability. It's an idea that I carried over from our previous language. However, I've questioned the assumption behind this push: **Does simplicity always improve readability?** Is there a case where writing simpler code decreases readability? It should be obvious, but by "simpler", I don't mean "easier to write", but less stuff going on per line.
