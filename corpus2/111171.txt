Some of my friends and I started a PHP project some weeks ago. In the beginning, I suggested we use a PHP framework such as CodeIgniter or Zend. But my friends wanted to start clean and without the overhead or extra complexity. But as time has passed, the project has become more and more complex. At first, we wrote all the code in the view files, in code blocks before the HTML output. Eventually, we changed direction and started to use controllers that did most of the work. But as you can see there is a coding difference here. At this point, we're trying to determine how to proceed before the project becomes more complex. When does it make sense to start over and use a framework? Or is it possible to formulate a simple way to introduce an MVC pattern to our existing code without having to start from scratch?
