I will be using Visual Studio only for creating C#/XAML Windows Store apps. Is there any reason for me to purchase a "Professional" SKU of VS 2012 rather than just using the Express (free) "Metro apps with C#/XAML" version? The only thing I can think of is that I won't be able to use Resharper in the Express version (which I've already purchased a license for, but I use it at work, so that won't be a waste of money if I can't use it at home) - plus, I believe that even the Express SKU of VS 2012 will have similar code quality utility built in.
