For a social network analysis I have two columns. The second column has one, two or more values. Something like this:               data = {{A, {k, l, m}}, {B, {k, l, m, n, o}}, {C, {m, n, o}}}      I would like to make a relation between te value of the first column and for each value in the second column. So I would like to get:               data1 = {A -> k, A -> l, A -> m, B -> k,  B -> l, B -> m, B -> n,      B -> o, C -> m, C -> n, C -> o}      Anyone a suggestion how to solve this?
