Does anyone have any advice for making an "attractive" software architecture diagram? My manager told me to make my current architecture diagram (which was built just using Visio and basic icons) more "attractive" for a presentation I have to give to executive level types who are non-technical. I'm guessing he meant to have something that you'd show to customers or for marketing people to use. Any specific icon sets or particular tips people have? I cannot post my current diagram for privacy reasons but to get the general idea, it's just text, lines, and server icons (http://www.227volts.com/wp- content/uploads/2009/03/exchange2007visiostencils.jpg) that is the icon set that I am using. I'm honestly confused on how to make something like that "more attractive" (hell, I think black and white are always the best color combinations to use :P) Edit: So is something like this http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/resource/linkedin- today.png still considered "professional" with all the colors and such? I asked my manager and all he said was just make it more marketable while evading questions about what I should do specifically.
