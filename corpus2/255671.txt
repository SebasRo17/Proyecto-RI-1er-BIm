Friend function/class, FriendOfX for some arbitrary class X is an implementation detail of class X. Why in C++ we have to declare them in the header file? Are there any compelling reasons to make this contract (between X and FriendOfX) explicit? I understand there could be valid reasons to make this contract explicit but in some cases I would not want my client using interface class X to know about FriendOfX since FriendOfX happens to handle certain collaboration aspects of interface class X which are implementation specific
