If I execute `MatrixPlot@IdentityMatrix@100`, the result is a good size. However, if I evaluate               Grid[{{200!}, {MatrixPlot@IdentityMatrix@100}}, ItemSize -> Automatic]      the `MatrixPlot` is much smaller, even when the page is wide. How can I make the `MatrixPlot` appear at its original size in the `Grid`? I'd prefer not to hard-code the size. ![this picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8PxEu.png) This picture shows that the second `MatrixPlot` is too small.
