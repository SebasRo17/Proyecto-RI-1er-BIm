I would like an implementation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem for polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, that is, a function               PolynomialCRT[{f_1,...,f_n},{m_1,...,m_n},x]      thet returns the polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ of smallest degree such that $$ f(x)\equiv f_i(x)\mod m_i(x), $$ where $f_i,m_i\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and the $m_i$ are pairwise coprime. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
