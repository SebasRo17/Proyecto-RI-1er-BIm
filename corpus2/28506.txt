I use Trac, a personal wiki tool. I use SVN Tortoise , the subversion tool I use Outlook, Word etc In all these pieces of software, each time I want to type an url or an email address the software turns it into a hyperlink, suddenly altering the behaviour of the text, often treating as a single entity. (i.e a single back- space deletes the whole url, text-select leaps to select the whole url instead of single letters etc ) Its as helpful to me as the Microsoft Office paper-clip. Am I the only one that gets annoyed by these things? If it is generally considered bad UI to do unexpected things. Surely its bad UI. **Update** : As Sii says below : > "Most of the time people prefer hyperlinks ... by default" I suppose that is the truism that I am doubting. Is there any research or evidence to back this up?
