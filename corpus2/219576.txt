I am creating an app where the user enters 8 characters. After he enters the string I have to see if it is an eight letter word. If not, check if contains a seven letter word etc. I am checking against a given pool of 150k+ words. I only care about the longest possible match. Is there a better way then this one:   * WordPool.Contains(word.substring(0,8))   * WordPool.Contains(word.substring(0,7)),    WordPool.Contains(word.substirng(1,7))   * WordPool.Contains(word.substring(0,6)),    WordPool.Contains(word.substirng(1,6)),   WordPool.Contains(word.substirng(2,6))   * etc... _Edit_ I forgot to add that I am checking against an english dictionary. So far I am using this:               for(i = 8; i >= 3; i--)       for(j = 0; j <= 8 - i; j++)           if(words.contains(word.substring(j, i))              //do something      **Edit 2** I have been using the approach defined above just with a minor change. I am using a few background agents which all search for a word of a certain length. They all then return a result and I just pick the one which gives the user the highest score.
