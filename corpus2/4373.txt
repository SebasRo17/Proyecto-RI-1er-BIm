What exactly is Janko Slavic's addon package AddTeX2Eps supposed to do, and exactly how does one get it to work? I do understand it's supposed to allow one to use TeX `psfrag` processing upon a Mathematica-generated graphic, but I cannot discern from the meager docs what's going on. And I can't get the supplied sample notebook `AddTeX2Eps- Example` to process correctly. When I evaluate the notebook, from the `EpsExport` command there I get a long list of errors starting with `OpenRead::noopen : canot open EpsExport.ps` (So I never get to the point of being able to use the exported file from within LaTeX where, I presume, psfrag is going to process it.)
