I have many plots (that take a long time to run) and each is saved to a variable name. For simplicity, say one was:               m = Plot[Sin[x], {x, -1, 1}, ImageSize -> 600]        If I call for the plot               m        it will be presented as it should be, with ImageSize 600. I can click and drag the corners to change the size of the plot (instantaneously, so I know mathematica is not re-computing the plot, but simply adjusting the output image size continuously). Therefore, what I wish to accomplish must be possible to do, but I don't know how to instruct mathematica to do it. What I want is a command, something similar to, say               m/.ImageSize->200        etc. that can present m with a new, prescribed size, rather than manually sliding it to a new size, and certainly without having to re-compute the code that produced the saved plot. Help?
