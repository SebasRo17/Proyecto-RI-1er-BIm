I am currently working as a software developer and am getting by ok, but feel that there is something missing from my skillset. Looking at job interview questions and processes of some of the big tech companies there is definitely an emphasis on problem solving and creativeness when tackling software problems. Some of the examples I would not have any chance at all solving. How can these skills be improved/learned? Or is this is simply a natural thing that cant be learned?
