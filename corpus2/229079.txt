I need to build a new web application and I am looking for advice on how to manage communication to my API layer. My goal is to have complete separation between the front-end and back-end code. Like most, I plan on having a front- end server to serve the views, while the back-end server will expose my API layer. I am a bit confused on how to approach pulling data from the API.   1. Should the node server handle all the calls to the API and provide that data to the views?   2. or Should the views be able to call the API directly and letting the server manage OAuth magic? I am curious what others have done to approach this. Let me know what your thoughts are, and I would be really interested if you have any good materials to read.
