I find myself repeatedly annoyed by having to teach freshmen about special language rules (like array-to-pointer decay) that have absolutely nothing to do with programming in itself.

Wouldn't such a language be the perfect teaching language? > ### Moderator Note > > We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. > Don't just list a language: please explain _why_ you think the language > answers the question.
