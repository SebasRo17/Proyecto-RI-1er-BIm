Suppose there are 2 web site: `example.com` I don't own and `example2.com` I own. I want to extend the functionality of `example.com` somehow. `example.com` doesn't have any API. I want the users of `example.com` to be able to login at `example2.com` using their logins and passwords of `example.com`. However, since `example.com` doesn't have any API, it is not easy to do, perhaps, it is even impossible. No doubt, no one would agree to enter their credentials of `example.com` at `example2.com` due to many obvious reasons. So, is there any way to authenticate the users of `example.com` at `example2.com` **(or somewhere else)** using their original credentials?
