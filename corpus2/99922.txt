I am a graduate in computing and I am on the job hunt at the moment. So I now have an MSc and a Bsc qualification in applied computing. People have been saying get a professional qualification right away while others have said "not now". I am really unsure what to think of them at the moment, someone said to me they are bad as it makes you look like you are not open to developing in other environments. For example, if I was to get a MS certification employers might think I am useless outside of a Microsoft environment. Are certifications worth the money? Should I really get them now, so soon after I graduate or wait till I have some experience in the working world?
