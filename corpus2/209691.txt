I got surprised when I visited some sites with an 'aspx' extension at the end of their URLs and when I looked at their html source I didn't see any view state like the follwing:               <input type="hidden" name="__VIEWSTATE" id="__VIEWSTATE" value="SNIKalxBOk0/lp+SgXklgi/0/IUoRXTjEjp6NrL2ColFXGht1bTDit5V+wHdkcuM3YVmVNKG1jpM6zAg+MQCnvPDvlEvK8RNwHblq8NN1Ys=" />      How did they prevent this to happen? even if you turn the view state off you'll get at least of of the above input in your HTML output. Here is one of the examples that I looked at: http://www.ada.org/index.aspx
