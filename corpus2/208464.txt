I have this script I'm working on. What it should do is generate a new div every time I press a button and I've already done that, but those are not draggable. I think that happens because of the onLoad function but alternative do I have? The second problem is that when I click one of the blue boxes, all of them must arrange in a line like you see them when you load my jsFiddle link, and if the line is full and you click the "New Square" button, instead of overflowing or add a new line, it would close the last box instead and add a new box before all of the other boxes. I'm sorry to bother you with those questions, but I am a PHP and MySQL programmer, I just started using jQuery. jsFiddle HTML:               <div id="container">         <div class="round"></div>          <div class="round"></div>         <div class="round"></div>         <div class="round"></div>     </div>     <br><br><br>     <input type="button" class="button" value="New Square">      jQuery:               $('.round').draggable();          $('.button').click(         function (){     $("#container").append("<div class='round'></div>");         });          $('.round').click (              );      I had more code in jQuery, but I removed all of the useless options because I want you to easily understand what I want to do.
