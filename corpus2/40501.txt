Quick formatting question: How can I move the animation controls for a slider from underneath it to say, on the side? For example, I have this: ![Slider Bars](http://i.imgur.com/KIlAZ6Y.jpg) But I would like all of those controls to be on the right side of each slider, instead of underneath the slider. And actually, if there is a way to just have an input field for the value of each variable, that would great too! I know you can set Appearance -> "Labeled" but this does not allow you to change the value, only observe it. Thanks!
