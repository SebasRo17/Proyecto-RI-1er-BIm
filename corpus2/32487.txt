I have a typical nonlinear least square problem and it seems very similar to the example provided in the section on parameter fitting at the Wolfram website. Unfortunately I always get some error messages. My code is as follows - could anyone help get rid of the error messages?               fitdata = {{1962, 0}, {1963, 0.9}, {1964, 2.4}, {1965, 6.2}, {1966, 11.3},                 {1967, 17.1}, {1968, 22.95}, {1969, 28.85}, {1970, 33.55}};          pfun = ParametricNDSolveValue[                { Derivative[1][x][t] == m (a (1 - x[t]) + b (1 - x[t]) x[t]^h),                   x[0] == 0},                  x, {t, 0, 10}, {a , b, h, m}];          fit = FindFit[ fitdata,                     pfun[a, b, h, m][t],                     {{a, 0.02}, {b, 0.5}, {h, 0.8}, {m, 42}}, t]
