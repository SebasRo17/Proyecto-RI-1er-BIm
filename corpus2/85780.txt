I"m currently reading _The Clean Coder_ by Robert C. Martin. It's a great book and I'm learning a lot from it. My objective is to become a "professional" programmer so I'm trying to learn the most I can when I'm not at my office. I was wondering if I should buy _Clean Code_ from the same author. Is it the natural "sequel" to _The Clean Coder_? Does it cover much the same ground to make its purchase not worthwhile?
