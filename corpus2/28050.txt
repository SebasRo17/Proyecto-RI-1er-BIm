![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F2KWJ.png) I typed three matrices, but they are not aligned well, and the `Items` in one matrix are also not aligned well and with differenct `ItemSize`. How can I adjust them into the same `ItemSize`? Better is that I can click the buttons/menus to do the thing something like `align paragraph` in `writing assistant`. And I found the matrix typed is `GridBox`, so I can adjust them by options of Grid.
