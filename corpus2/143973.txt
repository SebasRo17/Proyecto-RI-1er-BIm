**Scenario:**   * You push to production   * The push broke multiple things   * That same build did not break qa or dev   * As a developer, you don't have prod access.    * There is lots of pressure from _above_ to get things working agian. **Specifics:**   * PHP/MVC application that is API-driven in Zend.   * Deployed to a few servers. **My question:** While investigating, lets say I have a hunch that something is wrong. But, I don't know for sure. And, of course, I can't test things in production. If I have a suggested fix based on that hunch, would it be wise to try and apply it and see if it works, before understanding what the problem is?
