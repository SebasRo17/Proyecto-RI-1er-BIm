I've heard that logic programming can serve as a general-purpose alternative to other programming paradigms such as OO or functional programming. (Since Prolog is Turing-complete, this must be so!) However, I'm having trouble seeing how one would implement an interactive program, like a simple, graphical console game in Prolog or a similar language. You have facts, rules which can derive more facts, and queries which retrieve facts. It's easy to see how you can use those basic elements to create something like a sudoku solver. But how about Pac-man, or more simply, Pong? **PLEASE NOTE:** I'm not looking for low-level details, but a conceptual overview. (For example: in high-level terms, how would you handle I/O? How would you store the game state? How would you implement something like a "main loop"? How would you measure and respond to the passing of time?)
