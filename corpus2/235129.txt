Does using a web application framework, Spring, CakePHP, Django, etc., mean I do not need a plugin system for my main application, as in I don't have to build, essentially, a framework on framework? Does the framework serve as the entry points for my application, so I can use things like Dependency Injection for better testing? Does a framework provide the environment for me to do this for what I need in my application, or does the application need to build a additional plugin system? EDIT: Is this better for Stackoverflow?
