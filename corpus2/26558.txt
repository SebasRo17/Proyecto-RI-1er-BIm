I'm completely new to Mathematica and can't seem to find an answer elsewhere so hopefully I can get some help here. I'm trying to plot a recurrence relation, where a random variate is generated at each iteration of the recurrence. From looking at the output, it appears as though the RandomVariate evaluates to a constant at each iteration. I have this inside a 'manipulate' block:               ListLinePlot[        RecurrenceTable[{S[i] ==         S[i - 1]*        Exp[(r - (vol^2/2.0))*T/N +           vol*RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[μ, σ]]*           Sqrt[T/N]], S[1] == S0}, S, {i, 2, N}]]}]      Any help with what I'm trying to accomplish would be appreciated. Edit: here's the full version                Manipulate[      Column[{      Plot[{PDF[ NormalDistribution[μ, σ], x],                    PDF[ JohnsonDistribution["SU", γ, δ, μ, σ], x]}, {x, -6, 6}, Filling -> Axis],     ListLinePlot[     RecurrenceTable[{S[i] ==         S[i - 1]*         Exp[(r - (vol^2/2.0))*T/N +            vol*RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[μ, σ]]*            Sqrt[T/N]], S[1] == S0}, S, {i, 2, N}]]}],     Style["Distribution Parameters", 12, Bold],      {{μ, 0}, -5,   5},      {{σ, 1}, 0.1,  5},      {{γ, 1},    1, 10},      {{δ, 1},    1, 10} ,      Delimiter,      Style["Option Parameters", 12 , Bold],      {{N, 10}, 10, 1000},      {{T, 1/12}, 1/12, 1},      {{vol, 0.2}, 0, 1.0},      {{r, 0}, 0, 0.3},      {{q, 0}, 0, 0.3},      {{S0, 100}, 0, 1000},      ControlPlacement -> Left]
