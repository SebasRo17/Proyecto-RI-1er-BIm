I have created two functions, `inter1=Interpolation[points1]` and `inter2=Interpolation[points2]`. This creates two functions, I then created a graph `Manipulate[ListLinePlot[inter1, InterpolationOrder -> n],{n, 0, 6, 1}]`. However I need to combine these functions together. I want to be able to graph each function together and manipulate each function separately based on `InterpolationOrder`. Can someone please help? This is how far I've come               points = {{1,79},{2,181},{3,181},{4,52},{5,49},{6,8},{7,137},{8,79},{9,112},{10,164}};     inter1 = Interpolation[points];     inter2 = Interpolation[points];     Manipulate[ListLinePlot[inter1, InterpolationOrder -> n], {n,0,6,1}]      Regards New to Mathematica
