I would like to plot a vector on the unit circle, depending on an angle `Pi/k`, and the same vector rotated by an angle `d`. I try the following:               k = 0.9; d = 0.3;     pt = {Sin[Pi/k], Cos[Pi/k]};     pt2 = {pt[[1]]*Cos[d] + pt[[2]]*Sin[d],      pt[[2]]*Cos[d] - pt[[1]]*Sin[d]};          Graphics[Arrow[{{0, 0}, pt, {0, 0}, pt2}], Axes -> True,      AxesLabel -> {x, z}, PlotRange -> {{-1.1, 1.1}, {-1.1, 1.1}}]      In some cases, like when `k=0.9` and `d=0.3` as above, this almost works, except that the first vector has no arrowhead, only a line (see figure). In other cases, as when `k=1`, Only the second vector is drawn. Can anyone see what the problem is? ![The plotted vectors](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qLPxE.png)
