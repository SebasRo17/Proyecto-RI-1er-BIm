For quick prototyping I have been actively using Hibernate. Recently I came back to an old project and I wondered why I had a lot of DAOs with what I suspect is commonly named feature bloat. E.g. I have a DAOs for single entities that contains from 15 to 20 methods each. Recently I have been using Hibernate Generic D.A.O. Framework but I still think that the same problem arises when I'm trying to create custom data access logic and my code Olfaction starts to detect bad smells. Is there a guideline for this scenarios?
