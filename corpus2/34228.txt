Suppose I have some data with a step in it:               data = {{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}};      ![step](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g8K4B.png) Interpolation will complain about this and not give you an interpolation function:               Interpolation[data, InterpolationOrder -> 1]          Interpolation::inddp: The point 3 in dimension 1 is duplicated.      Is there any way to easily avoid this? Can I get Mathematica to give me `Piecewise` instead, or jiggle my points?
