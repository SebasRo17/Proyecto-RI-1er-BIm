I have produced this MatrixPlot: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OsIlG.jpg) Rows refer to countries and columns to ranks. Row 1 refers to Norway with many 1 ranks, row 15 to Greece with many 15 ranks. Other countries are inbetween. I would like to add a "Legend" to this plot, i.e. the string "Norway" should align (on the right side) with the first row etc. I have no idea how to accomplish this and any help would be appreciated.
