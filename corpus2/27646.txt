I would like to pretty print two column vectors of different lengths so that they are aligned at the top rather than centered, which seems to be the default. For example,               v1 = {a, b, c, d, 0, 0, 0}; v2 = {a, b, c, d};     Row[{MatrixForm[v1], MatrixForm[v2]}, Alignment -> {Center, Top}]      results in the pretty printing of the vectors but they are actually centered in the row rather than aligned with the horizontal position at the top. Using a GraphicsRow instead of Row does work but changes the fonts from the rest of the nb so is only a second best solution. Is there some other approach to this that I could try?
