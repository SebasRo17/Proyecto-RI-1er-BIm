I have an idea for a web app, and I want to make it a freemium service. Those who sign up will have the ability to create 3 pieces of content for free and will be required to pay a premium to obtain the ability to create further content. Provided that the two account types will have identical behaviors except for the quantity of content, what is the best way to prevent these users from circumventing my pricing plan and creating tonnes of trial accounts? Have you thought about this before? What do you do on your web app? I could monitor email addresses, IP addresses, phone numbers, etc., but all of these are easily circumventable. Thoughts?
