I've seen not so many examples of testing with automatic tools, i.e. serializing/deserializing of JSON (which was paired in the following way: `val actual = deserialize(serialize(string))`), checking that appending symbols to string was done properly (and that's imho silly, cause it extremely hard to made a mistake in such plain operations). Can you provide really useful examples/use cases for automatic testing with ScalaCheck that will unveil it advantages? Does it meant to be used mostly in paired style (straight/inverse functions like in JSON example above)?
