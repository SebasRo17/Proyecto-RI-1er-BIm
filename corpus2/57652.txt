How can I make the plane in the first image more like the plane in the second? More transparent, specially. I tried messing with the `Opacity` and `Mesh`, to no avail. Can someone help me? (you can disregard the vector completely) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qX9Ne.png) Right now, the code for the first image is:               Show[Plot3D[{Sqrt[x^2 + y^2], -Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]}, {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10},            PlotStyle -> RGBColor[0.86`, 0.86`, 0.`, .1], Mesh -> None],          Plot3D[1/5 (3 x + 4 y), {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10},            PlotStyle -> RGBColor[1.`, 0.9`, 0.14`], PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.9],            Mesh -> None],          Graphics3D[Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {-6, -8, 10}}]],         BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1}, Boxed -> False, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0}]
