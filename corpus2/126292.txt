We are currently re-evaluating the way we manage, plan and run our projects (an area that I think we can massively improve upon) so I just wanted to get some ideas as to how other development teams go about starting new a web application project. At present, following the initial client meetings we produce a simple planning document that outlines what we intend to create for them (this usually contains screen shots of the various sections of the app and some detail about what each page will do). Once we have sign-off on this, this is what is used to by the developers as a blueprint to develop from. I can't help but feel we are lacking here as the client planning document simply isn't detailed enough and doesn't really show any of the business logic decisions made in the application. Following development, the application goes to testing where the testers record bugs in an Excel spreadsheet. I feel this is also a very basic way of doing things, I have looked at web apps like Sifter and think this is how we should be doing things. We use TFS as our source control but the bug-tracking in there is overkill for what we need. So what I'd love to know from you guys is, what sort of documentation you produce for projects and what processes you follow during planning and development.
