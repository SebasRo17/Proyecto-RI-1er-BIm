I am doing arithmetic operations on really huge numbers. For example, I am given six variables, a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{21}, a_{22}, x_1, and x_2. Although the above are math terms, these six variables are each 1000-bit integers. What I want to do is to calculate (1) two numbers z_1 and z_2, and (2) the matrix inverse. (1) z_1 = a_{11}*x_1 + a_{12}*x2 and z_2 = a_{21}*x_1 + a_{22}*x2 (2) if A is a matrix defined as A=[a_{11} a_{12}; a_{21} a_{22}], want to compute A^{-1} I know how to do the above when these six variables are ordinary floating points. But my question is how to compute them in C or Python when the six variables are all of size 1000-bit?
