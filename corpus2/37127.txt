Is there a better way to enter my data into a list plot?               ListPLot[{{{1.1, 2.2}, {2.3, 4.3}, {2.9, 5.5}},               {{1.1, 2.1}, {2.3, 4.6}, {2.9, 5.9}},               {{1.1, 2}, {2.3, 4.8}, {2.9, 6.2}}}]      I think there should be a more efficient way, but cannot find it. I've read the documentation on `ListPlot` and `DataRange`.
