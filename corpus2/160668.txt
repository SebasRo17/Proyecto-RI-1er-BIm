I recently finished my C++ programming class, and I'll start school in september. There is a limited online Parking spot registration and it always gets filled very quickly. I would like to create a code that will quickly access the page and register for me. The question is, how is this feasible? I guess I could use python, or Javascript, but I have no idea how to go on from my C++ class. What should I learn/do to program this code? EDIT: I posted this question on other forums also and I've been receiving a lot of answers like this: you need to use the library ... Sorry if I'm a noob, but I've never used library and I have trouble understanding it. Is it like #include like the library will give me access to many functions by doing #inlude?
