We have a django app hosted on heroku. I had a situation:   1. A user entered an email in a form on page1. If the email existed in the database he was redirected to Login page otherwise to register page.    2. In the register page the form was filled with the same email entered on page1 using request.session that was populated previously. **I was told it was dangerous as using sessions is not recommended in cloud applications. Is this notion correct both generally, and under above scenario?**
