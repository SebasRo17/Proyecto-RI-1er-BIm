_Mathematica_ is able to calculate `InverseFunction[LogIntegral]` and `InverseFunction[RiemannR]` (and many other inverse functions). How are these calculated? (I can see how `LogIntegral` and `RiemannR` are calculated if I go to the details section of the docs, but can't find a ref. for inverse functions.) Note: I have tried looking at `Series[LogIntegral[n], {n, 2, 3}]`, and `InverseSeries[Series[LogIntegral[n], {n, 2, 3}]]`, but can't see clearly how this helps.
