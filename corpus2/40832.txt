at work now I had an argument with co-worker, because I made a page that he feels is **too generic**. The page has **3 modes** (simple, adv and special) - it has to work like this, because we don't choose how the specification is written. in each mode **the page looks different** (the changes are not big - **it shows/hides 5 text fields** in different combinations based on the mode). My co-worker think it should be **3 pages** and when you change something you should just **merge** the changes to other two modes. The fields now has code like `rendered="#{mode!=2}"`, etc. P.S. Now the difference is 5 fields, but **in the future no1 know how much it will be changed**. **EDIT:** We use Seam(JSF/Facelets), here is pseudo facelet code(to make it easier to understand). I did not put it in panelGroups to better present the problem.               <h:output rendered="mode=2" value="Name: " />     <h:input rendered="mode=2" value="bean.name" />     <h:output rendered="mode=2" value="Surename: " />     <h:input rendered="mode=2" value="bean.surname"  />          <h:output rendered="mode!=2" value="Surename: " />     <h:input rendered="mode!=2" value="bean.surname"  />     <h:output rendered="mode!=2" value="#{mode==1?'My Name':'My friends name'}" />     <h:input rendered="mode!=2" value="bean.name" />      **EDIT:** I duplicated version it would look like this(pseudo code)               <c:if test=mode=1>             <ui:include view=modeSimple.xhtml>     </c:if>     <c:if test=mode=2>             <ui:include view=modeAdv.xhtml>     </c:if>     <c:if test=mode=3>             <ui:include view=modeSpec.xhtml>     </c:if>               modeSimple.xhtml         <h:output value="Surename: " />         <h:input value="bean.surname"  />         <h:output value="My Name" />         <h:input value="bean.name" />     modeAdv.xhtml         <h:output value="Name: " />         <h:input value="bean.name" />         <h:output value="Surename: " />         <h:input value="bean.surname"  />     modeSpec.xhtml         <h:output value="Surename: " />         <h:input value="bean.surname"  />         <h:output value="My friends name" />         <h:input value="bean.name" />
