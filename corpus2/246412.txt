## Program Situation I use Spring Framework to code my Web Service, using Dependency injection to inject a DataSource bean into the DAO bean that will be used by the Web Service. I have all the database properties(Url, Password, Username, the stuff I don't want people to see) written in the DataSource Bean XML! ## Workplace Situation I have git setup to commit my entire project....(Hint: Including my DataSource Bean XML which has my password written in plain text) I thought of using the .gitignore but the Bean XML is a crucial component in my Web Service project and it shouldn't be ignored. (Right?) But I also don't want the world to see my password. **_What should I do?_**
