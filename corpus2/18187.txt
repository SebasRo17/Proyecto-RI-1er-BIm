For convenience I'm trying to add an extra property to `CountryData`               Unprotect[CountryData];     CountryData[c_String, "MyProperty"] := 0; (* actually call to another function *)     Protect[CountryData];      But when using it I get:               CountryData["Greenland", "MyProperty"]      > CountryData::notprop: "!(\"\\\"MyProperty\\\"\") is not a known property for > CountryData. Use CountryData[\"Properties\"] for a list of properties." What's the right way to do this? _There is high probability this is a duplicate, but I wasn't able to find how to do this, sorry in advance_
