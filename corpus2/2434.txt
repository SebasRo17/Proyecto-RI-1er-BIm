I recently realized that Mathematica seems incapable of comparing strings in the "normal" expected lexicographic order. Indeed, for some simulations, I need to process text directly, without fiddling with it, and I would like to have such things as               If["aaa" < "aaaab", 1, 0] (* ---> 1 *)     Min["aaaa", "deaaaf", "dfeef", "a"]   (* ---> "a" *)      and so on. However, as far as I can tell this is not possible. Am I wrong? Or is there any work-around, or way for me to use lexicographic ordering? Do I have to code it by hand? Mathematica is so good at getting stuff right out of the box I have a hard time believing it (but this would echo some other contributors comment here, that strings are "second class" citizens in Mathematica)...
