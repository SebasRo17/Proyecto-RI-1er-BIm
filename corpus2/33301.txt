I want to plot a 3D surface with the axes crossing at (0,0,0), without a bounding box. I'd also like the portions of the axes "hidden" by the surface to not show. For instance,               ContourPlot3D[     x^2 + y^2 + z^2 == 4, {x, -3.1, 3}, {y, -3.1, 3}, {z, -3.1, 3}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0},     Boxed -> False, Lighting -> "Neutral",Mesh -> 10]      creates a sphere but with the mesh, tick marks, axes, etc., the inside looks rather cluttered. I'd rather the axes disappear inside. How can this be done?
