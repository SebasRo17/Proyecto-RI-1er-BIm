I have been learning programming in C# for about a year and a half now. How should I ensure that the code that I am writing and the habits are forming are good ones?   ie. I don't want to end up having written code which only I can understand. I know that we must use the naming conventions as per language. But are there any more concrete guidelines which I must keep in mind? Any rules which various companies enforce on their programmers while writing code? Any Documentation standards ? Any books/websites would also be helpful.
