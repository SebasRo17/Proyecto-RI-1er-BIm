I wasn't sure if this was more suited to here or StackOverflow. I've always resisted doing web development because the technology stack just seemed a mess. It seems the web has become quite popular so I'm actually going to embrace web development, at least for a little project I'm thinking about. I'm a Microsoft developer, so I'm going to use ASP.NET. I'm familiar with how the web technologies work at a high level, I sort of understand what Javascript can do, I get AJAX (conceptually). CSS and HTML seem ugly but I get what they're for. As an ASP.NET developer do you find yourself working directly with Javascript or HTML? Does AJAX get abstracted away neatly or do you find yourself doing that stuff "by hand"? Are there any other technologies you use? And on a related note, I don't quite see where HTML 5 fits in with ASP.NET, yet. There seems to be a lot of noises from Microsoft that HTML 5 is actually the future of the web as opposed to Silverlight, so do any pro ASP.NET developers understand or use HTML 5 features? I appreciate that's kinda vague, I think a lot of it will become clearer as I get started, but I'd feel more secure if I had some soothing words and pointers from people who have already been through that.
