The other day someone asked me what type of work I do. I answered that I help to build web sites (Asp.net, c#, mostly). So he said "so then you must do a lot of Web 2.0 stuff, right?". I proceeded to respond by trying to define Web 2.0 as a change in the way that websites were designed 5+ years ago, incorporating more client-side scripting, ajax and standards-based approach to building web sites. I then said that almost anyone doing web design/development today who has stayed up to date with new standards and techniques over the past few years, should be using "Web 2.0-like" techniques, and it is not a really accurate statement to describe a website today as being "Web 2.0". (Person with whom I was talking was a programmer, but in a totally different domain - C++/VOIP stuff). How do you answer (well-intentioned) people who try to talk to you about programming using the catch-phrases of yesteryear? ("Web 2.0" could apply for web development, I am sure that there are similar terms in other areas as well.) Just nod and say yes? Try to explain yourself?
