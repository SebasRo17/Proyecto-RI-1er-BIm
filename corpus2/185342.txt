I understand that the model should generally consist of data manipulation and the view for data display from the model, but how do I keep my model and view layers decoupled? My simple view has a few tables that display data. Its associated model manipulates the data based on the view's type of `TableModel`. Most of its methods involve using the `TableModel` type. Should the view generally "breakdown" the data into a more generic type of integers and strings for the model? Therefore all the model handles are simple generic lists of data without needing to use `TableModel` in case the view is changed into another interface. The model should be "unaware" of the view for good programming practices, right? If I change my view to a command-line interface, the associated model should still be able to perform its functions, given the correct associated Lists of integers/strings/whatever.
