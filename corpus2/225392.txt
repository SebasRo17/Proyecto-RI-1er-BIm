What approach should I use to statically analyze a Python code base? In particular, I am looking for ways to:   * extract and display the class hierarchy,   * extract and display class relationships,   * include a cross-reference of all functions, modules and variables The specific application that I am dealing with is not well documented which is why I am looking to automate the process.
