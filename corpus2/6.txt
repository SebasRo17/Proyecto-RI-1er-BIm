A very common feature of graphs of functions used throughout textbooks are simple indications, such as open circles, of the points at which a function is undefined. Is there a way to do this in Mathematica? I understand that I can use `Epilog` (or `Prolog`, or other explicit drawing graphics functions) to "manually" draw these elements, but us there a way to automatically do this, or at least return the coordinates of such points for use as arguments to `Epilog`?
