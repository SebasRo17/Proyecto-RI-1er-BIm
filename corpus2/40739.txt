I know how to model this question on paper, but I don't know how doing it in Mathematica. Imagine , there is a university student who want to choose courses for this semester and he got the university program chart that looks like below in excel format : ![University program chart](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uKNWP.png) Lecturers Rating is out of 10 and it means which lecturer is giving a better score in the final exam and teaches better. Course Credit is a restriction, each semester each student should choose courses that total of course credit must be greater than 7 and less than 12: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vk6QW.png) It is not allowed to pick two courses with the same name. He/She wants to optimize two things :   1. He/She wants to maximize course credits that he/she could use (12)   2. He/She wants to pick up courses with better Lecturers Also He/She wants to get the result like a schedule table like this: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7MJWs.png) Here is excel File form university.
