For some demand, I am using MathMLForm for all output               SetOptions["stdout", FormatType -> MathMLForm]      But this effect the syntax error format as well.(it's hard to understand and non-meaningful sometime in MathMLForm) Then I tried bollwed, but syntax error message is still in MathMLForm               SetOptions["stdout", FormatType -> MathMLForm];     SetOptions["stderr", FormatType -> OutputForm];      So how could I change FormatType for output and Syntax error separately ? Thanks! BTW : I am using version 9 under ubuntu 14.04 (32 bit)
