I use _Mathematica_ to calculate many analytic expressions, some of them are generated by a loop process, the result can be a vector with a index, e.g., `f[i]`. Now I want to save them in a file, for example _Mathematica_ package file `"result.m"`, and other expression may also want to be added into this file. The file should looks like this:               f[1] = ;     f[2] = ;     ...     f[10] = ;          fsum = ;     gxyz = ;      This should be a simple task, but I can't figure out the solution. Does anyone know how it can be done?
