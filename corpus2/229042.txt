Does it violate REST principles for a REST API to support a batch of operations (perhaps with transactional guarantees) that can be added to a queue via a POST? This design seems outside the scope of REST architecture but not necessarily in violation of it, but I'm looking for authoritative sources here, and/or supporting explanations when/why to avoid or prefer this approach. For example, the Parse API supports a POST to create a batch of requests, each representing what could be a separate REST request, such as the following (quoting):               curl -X POST \       -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: ${APPLICATION_ID}" \       -H "X-Parse-REST-API-Key: ${REST_API_KEY}" \       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \       -d '{             "requests": [               {                 "method": "PUT",                 "path": "/1/classes/GameScore/Ed1nuqPvcm",                 "body": {                   "score": 999999                 }               },               {                 "method": "DELETE",                 "path": "/1/classes/GameScore/Cpl9lrueY5"               }             ]           }' \       https://api.parse.com/1/batch
