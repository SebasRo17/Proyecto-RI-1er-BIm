I am trying to find numerical values for $\Im\ e^{\frac{1}{2} +i\ y} = \Im\ \zeta(\frac{1}{2} +i\ y)$ for a given range. I have tried:               NSolve[Im[Exp[0.5 + I x]] == Im[Zeta[0.5 + I x]] && 0 <= x <= 20, x]      I can see that:               Plot[{Im[Exp[0.5 + I x]], Im[Zeta[0.5 + I x]]}, {x, 0, 20}]      gives: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5SRSR.gif) ... I am sure it is a problem with my syntax again, but can't seem to fix it :/
