I often have to explain technical things and technical decisions to my _extremely_ non technical manager and I'm pretty awful at it. What are good ways to essential dumb things down for the rest of the world who don't have a passion for programming? Example questions I've been asked:   * Why are you using Django instead of Java (Didn't accept that it was cheaper either)   * Asking me to rephrase things in non technical words, my sentence was "Certain HTML tags are not allowed". How can I possibly dumb that down?   * Other stuff that makes perfect sense to me, but is just _so_ basic I don't know how to explain it   * Why this, why that, why everything! Also, how do I tell my manager to look the basic stuff up on Google, like "What is Pylons?" I'm ready to rip my hair out, these questions are driving me insane!!
