In a config file for a PHP project, I have some settings that should not go out in production. Can anybody offer some specific examples or help on how to automatically check these fields and make sure their values are not the development/demo settings before the files get committed into subversion? Our IDE is JetBrains PHP Storm, and we use the latest version of subversion. Some of us develop on Linux, while others are on Windows.
