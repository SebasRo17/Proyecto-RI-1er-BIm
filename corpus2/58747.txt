Okay this is a very newbie question. I have coded a sample problem that solves the heat diffusion equation on an annulus. Here's what I have:               Dom = ImplicitRegion[x^2 + y^2 >= 1 && x^2 + y^2 <= 5, {x, y}];     C = {DirichletCondition[u[x, y] == 200., x^2 + y^2 == 1], DirichletCondition[u[x, y] == 0., x^2 + y^2 == 5]};          result = NDSolveValue[{\!\(\*SubsuperscriptBox[\(\[Del]\), \({x, y}\), \(2\)]\(u[x, y]\)\) ==  0, C}, u, {x, y} \[Element] Dom];      I can plot the data as a contour plot. All that is good. Now, say I want to get the mean of the temperature. How I do that? I imagine the data is contained in the variable 'result', but it is very opaque to me.
