What **essential questions** do you have to know the answer for, about a prospective software development candidate, before hiring him/her? I'm not seeking specific interview problems (e.g. sort this 3D array of numbers in O(1) complexity), but simply for things you need to find about, for yourself, about a new hire. (e.g. which source control systems / languages / frameworks / OS has he used?) Cross-posted to Quora
