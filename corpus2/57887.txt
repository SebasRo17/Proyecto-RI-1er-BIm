I've seen many questions regarding the connection to a Linux machine from a Windows one, but I need to do the opposite. **Situation:** I have Mathematica on my Linux laptop (`A`) and I want to run a remote kernel on my Windows desktop (`B`) (which also has Mathematica) **Current solution:** On `A` I have a kernel that opens in `LinkMode` so when I execute something it gives me a port and IP address of my machine. Then on `B` I use the `LinkConnect` function that allows me to run my computations on `B`'s kernel. **Things to improve:** I want to be able to do this automatically. One annoying part of this solution is that the numbers `N,M` that I use in the `LinkConnect` function (`LinkConnect["N@IP-address,M@IP- address",LinkProtocol->"TCPIP"`) always change, so I have to retype them every time. The other problem is that sometimes I use parallel functions e.g. `ParallelTable[]` but using this solution doesn't allow me to execute multiple kernels on `B`. **Questions:** I think Mathematica comes with a way to do this connection in the background using Remote Kernels, but I don't know how to connect `A` with `B` using that.   * Is it possible to connect from Linux to Windows using Remote Kernels? if so, how?   * Will this allow me to execute parallel kernels in `B`?
