I used automatic method for NDSolve. Then I asked myself - which method Mathemathica prefered? I got an answer for this question on this forum, that I need to use:               Select[Flatten[       Trace[NDSolve[{g[a[t]]*a''[t] + 0.5*dg[a[t]]*(a'[t])^2 + dV[a[t]] ==            0, a[0] == a0, a'[0] == -u}, a, {t, 0, t0}],         TraceInternal -> True]], ! FreeQ[#, Method | NDSolve`MethodData] &]      I got a long answer from Mathematica, from which I show you only two main unique strings:               NDSolve`InitializeMethod[NDSolve'LSODA,{Automatic, Automatic} ...     NDSolve`LSODA[NDSolve`MethodData[4, 22, {{}, False, 12, {NDSolve`Newton,{Automatic}}, None, False}]]      I understood, that Mathematica has chosen for method: LSODA and it's submethod: Newton. Whether I'm correct or this methods have another name? And what does LSODA stand for?
