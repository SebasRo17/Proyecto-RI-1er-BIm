I am an email person, but found that at my new job, co-workers use IM a lot. I have to admit that I have been largely ignoring the IM/SMS as a way of communication by thinking it is only for teenagers... The IM-style of communication is quite different from emailing. The sentences are shorter and there is less time for a response. So when I chat with someone, more often than not, I feel that I lag with the answer and then I just pick up the phone - and the conversation usually last minutes ... which plainly defeats the idea of the "instant" communication. Are there some recommendations that I can follow to improve my IM communication skills?
