========== motivation =========== Suppose, for example, I have an incoming expression like                m = (3-I)x + 4(x y)/(Cos[y])      I want to find all the symbols in the expression ("x" and "y" in this case) without a priori knowledge of what symbols may appear in m.   Perhaps then I want to do something to the symbols, for example, transform each symbol #:               # -> u*#        i.e. I want to obtain from m:               (3-I)u x + 4(u^2 x y)/(Cos[u y])        In this case, I can take this result, expand in u and unitize to get:               Series[(3-I)u x + 4(u^2 x y)/(Cos[u y]), {u,0,1}]/.u->1        a series expansion to first order in both x and y, where terms x^2, y^2, **_and x y_** are dropped. ============================================================== This is just one example though, in general, I want to know how to find the symbols in an expression and do something to them. I've tried things similar to                test = Expand[# /. Not@NumericQ :> ReplaceAll[#, z -> u z]] &;             (5-3 I)x + 2 y^2 //test        But this just returns the input unchanged, I would like it to return                (5-3 I)u x + 2 u^2 y^2        Any help?
