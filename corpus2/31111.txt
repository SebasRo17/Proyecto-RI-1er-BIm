I have an 8 core CPU and want to parallel evaluate the following nested `Table`               Table[Table[expr[i,j], {i,1,10}], {j,1,4}]      But there is a problem, the time cost of evaluating `expr[i,j]` increases with the value of variable `i`. If `expr[1,j]` takes 5min, `expr[2,j]` will take 10min and `expr[10,j]` will take 3hours. Now you see, no matter where I will put `Parallel`, in the outer `Table` or in the inner `Table`, the efficiency will not change. The best way would be to first evaluate the most time consuming terms `expr[10,1]`, `expr[10,2]`, `expr[10,3]`, `expr[10,4]` and other expressions with less time cost just throw onto the remaining core one by one. I naively tried several parallel order, for example               ParallelTable[expr[i,j], {i,10,1,-1}, {j,1,4}]      but this will not use 4 cores out of my 8 cores. The question is what is the best way to parallelize this nested table evaluation?
