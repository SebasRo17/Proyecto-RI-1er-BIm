I have list of objects:                list = {{1, 1, 0.05, 0.05}, {2, 2, 0.05, 0.05}, {13, 13, 0.05, 0.05}};           list = {{x,y,Vx,Vy},{x,y,Vx,Vy},...};      And               object = {10, 10};      I want when I change position of object the objects from the list to follow the first object. I try with this:               If[object[[1]] < #1 && #3 > 0, list = {#1,#2,-#3 ,#4}, list = {#1,#2,#3,#4}] &@@@list     If[object[[1]] > #1 && #3 < 0, list = {#1,#2,-#3 ,#4}, list = {#1,#2,#3,#4}] &@@@list     If[object[[2]] < #1 && #4 > 0, list = {#1,#2,#3 ,-#4}, list = {#1,#2,#3,#4}] &@@@list     If[object[[2]] < #1 && #4 < 0, list = {#1,#2,#3 ,-#4}, list = {#1,#2,#3,#4}] &@@@list      and works but only the first cycle. I know that I can do this with:               If[object[[1]] < list[[1, 1]] && list[[1, 3]] > 0, list[[1, 3]] *= -1]....      But is very slow and not look nice :). And doesn't work completely correct.
