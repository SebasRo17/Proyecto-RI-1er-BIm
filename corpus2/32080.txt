I'm trying to use:               NotebookWrite[nb, NotebookRead[EvaluationNotebook[]];      to copy cells from the `EvaluationNotebook[]` to a new notebook `nb`. For this, I move around in the `EvaluationNotebook[]` using different applications of `SelectionMove[nb, ...]`. Now, I would like to copy the exact same cell groupings of the current document as well, and this doesn't seem to happen. In the newly created notebook `nb`, I just see consecutive cells, without any grouping. Why is that? how can copying of groups be achieved? All help very much appreciated!
