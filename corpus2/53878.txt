This statement suggests that statically typed languages are not ideal for web sites: > Iâ€™ll contrast that with building a website. When rendering web pages, often > you have very many components interacting on a web page. You have buttons > over here and little widgets over there and there are dozens of them on a > webpage, as well as possibly dozens or hundreds of web pages on your website > that are all dynamic. With a system with a really large surface area like > that, using a statically typed language is actually quite inflexible. I > would find it painful probably to program in Scala and render a web page > with it, when I want to interactively push around buttons and what-not. If > the whole system has to be coherent, like the whole system has to type check > just to be able to move a button around, I think that can be really > inflexible.
