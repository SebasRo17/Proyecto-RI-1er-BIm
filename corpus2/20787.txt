I am trying a read a file that's arranged such that there's alternating set of rows containing data that I don't need and data that I need. So for my case the first n lines in the files are useless to me while the next m lines are data I need, and the next n lines are useless etc. Here is a sample.

I know I can combine `Skip` and `Readlist`               str = OpenRead["file"];     Skip[str, String, 7]; coord = ReadList[str, {Word, Number, Word, Word}~Join~Table[Number, {6}], 14]      How can I do this repeatedly to read say 500 such data (i.e. ATOM 1 - 14, 500 times). I will like to write a function that can accept the number of such data I want to read. This entry is related but not exactly what I want. If there's already a similar question I'll be more than happy to delete this but I couldn't find any that suits my purpose. Please note that these files are really huge ~1GB.
