Tester and blogger Lanette Creamer recently posted this question on Twitter: > If you are a professional software developer who works with testers, think > of the best testers you know. What traits do they have in common? I thought it would make an excellent question for here. My thoughts are:   * They want to remove ambiguity from requirements even if it means asking awkward questions.   * They create new features by seeing the way software "should" work, rather than just how it's documented.   * They demonstrate honesty and integrity and encourage but not demand it from those around them. In other words, they model behavior. What are the traits of the best testers you've worked with?
