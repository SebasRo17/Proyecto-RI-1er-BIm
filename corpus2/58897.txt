I want to write the numerical results of a computation to a file which is to be read in Fortran. The data looks like:               oswf0={1/(E^(25/2) \[Pi]^(1/4)), 1/(E^(81/8) \[Pi]^(1/4)), 1/( E^8 \[Pi]^(1/4)), 1/(E^(49/8) \[Pi]^(1/4)), 1/(E^(9/2) \[Pi]^(1/4))}      and I write it out with               Export["oscillatorwf_n0.dat", N[oswf0, 50]]      but the ouput file looks like               2.79918439290959673893721788332716676696872559106e-6     0.000030094068318430211211425128144825612558205505948023     0.00025197454903091461102445530088385078965019945670456     0.0016430804571573454314321054224416885379324057884235     0.008344251073246413703289360250294637268362678784284      All of them have clearly different precisions (>50). Why is mathematica not consistent here? What am I overlooking? How can I get 50 digits of precision consistently? Thanks a lot
