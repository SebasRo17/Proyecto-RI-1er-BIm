How can I plot a function with one discrete and one continuous input? Plot3D wants everything continuous while ListPlot3D and ListPointPlot3D want everything discrete. I would like be able to say something like               HybridPlot[f[dsc, cnt], {dsc , min, max step}, {cnt, min max}]      or               HybridPlot[f[dsc, cnt], {dsc, someArray}, {cnt, min max}]      I am not seeing a simple way to do this in the docs.
