Please note that this isn't meant to be a Java vs. C# argument. I'm a Java programmer with no C# experience, asking just out of curiosity. I did some reading on C#, and it seems it has much more features than Java. A number of examples:   * Type inference.   * `dynamic` keyword.   * Delegates.   * Optional parameters.   * Lambda and LINQ _(I actually have no idea what these are)._   * Properties. However Java doesn't really feature anything that C# doesn't have. My question is: why does C# have much more native features than Java? And why didn't Java add some of these throughout the years, for example Properties or type inference? Do the Java language designers take a more simplistic approach? What is the reason for this?
