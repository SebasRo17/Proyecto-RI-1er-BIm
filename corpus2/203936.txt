I have VB.Net project, with a class with a couple of abstract (mustoverride) properties, that I am thinking about moving into an interface. My question, is structurally how do I do this? Currently all of the classes that would be implementing this are derived from this base class, so it might make sense to put it in the same file. Or I could create a separate interface file and put it in the same directory as the base class. Another option, would be to create a separate directory for interfaces (of which the project currently has zero) and put the file the. After writing this up, I'm strongly inclined towards the second option. I've looked around, but haven't found any guidance on this. What would be the best option and why?
