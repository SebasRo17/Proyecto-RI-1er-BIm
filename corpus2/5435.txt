These days one only gets to hear the anti-outsourcing argument citing failed projects, lost jobs, cultural differences, communication issues and so on. The success stories, cost savings, shared cultural experiences often get conveniently ignored. What can programmers from both sides of the globe do as a community to improve the way outsourcing works and to make it more meaningful and relevant? Please suggest constructive ideas/experiences rather than letting this be another opportunity for ranting.
