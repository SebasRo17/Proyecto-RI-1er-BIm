When routes are matched to the _outbound URLs_ , the routing system will try to find values for each of the _segment variables_ in _route's URL pattern_ by also looking at the values from the _current request_. If necessary, routing system will reuse _segment variable values_ from the _incoming URL_ Excerpt is from _Pro Asp.Net MVC 4_ book: > The routing system will reuse values only for segment variables that occur > earlier in the URL pattern than any parameters that are supplied to the > Html.ActionLink method. Suppose we tried to create a link like this: > > @Html.ActionLink("Click me", "List", "Catalog", new {color="Aqua"}, null) > > We have supplied a value for color, but not for page. But color appears > before page in the URL pattern and so the routing system wonâ€™t reuse the > values from the incoming URL, and the route will not match. > > ... We strongly recommend that you do not rely on this behavior and that you > supply values for all of the segment variables in a URL pattern.

By relying > on this behavior you end up making assumptions about the order in which your > users make requests I don't understand how not supplying values for all _segment variables_ translates into making assumptions about the order in which users make _requests_?! Much appreciated
