I've simplified my code to what can reproduce my error. Basically, I have two lines:                spherePoint[x_] := Graphics3D[Sphere[{x, 0, 0}, 1]];       Manipulate[Show[spherePoint[m]], {{m, 1}, -Pi/2, Pi/2}]      This runs perfectly fine when I evaluate it in a mathematica notebook, but when I do a CDF preview (or export), it gives me the error               Show::gtype: spherePoint is not a type of graphics. >>      What gives?! Show should accept Graphics3D, and spherePoint is a graphics 3D object! (I'm not sure about the last part of that sentence, because it's a function that gives a graphics 3d object, but I don't know what that implies for the program) What am I doing wrong?
