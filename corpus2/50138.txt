I have seen this question on Quora where lots of people seem to agree that OpenID is bad, even going as far as stating that: > OpenID is the worst possible "solution" I have ever seen in my entire life > to a problem that most people don't really have Then I've seen articles and tweets referencing that question saying that OpenID has lost, and Facebook won. It's sad to read as I quite like the OpenID (or at least idea behind it). I literally hate getting yet another login/password for page (I'll forget it anyway) - it's a pretty serious issue for me and I know lots of people with the same problem. Thus I thought that OpenId is a great solution but I'm not sure anymore. So the question is should I still bother to implement OpenID or it's not worth it? What is the most robust and convenient (from the user perspective) way to identify and authenticate an user?
