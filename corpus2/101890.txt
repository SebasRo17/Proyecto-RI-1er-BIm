I am shortly going to move from a large, multinational, enterprise software house to a start up where I will be the only full time developer. I've worked in start ups and in companies where there have been only three or four devs before so I'm fairly happy with many of the differences in general company feel. But having never worked as a sole dev there a couple things I've got used to in a large company that I think will take more adjustment. And was wondering if there was any advice on how to manage them?
