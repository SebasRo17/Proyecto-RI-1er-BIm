In _open source projects_ there is typically a set of devs that have permissions to commit code - the committers -, and others that "pull request" or send patches, the "general public". I find a annoying when   1. the committer signs the commit with its own name, and writes in the commit message a "Thanks to ...".   2. the committer changes the patch before commit without asking if the original author agrees. Given this two annoyances, I'm compelled to think that I should put myself in the other side and ask how should a core committer behave. Are these two particular situations expected? I mean, is this the correct behaviour for building and maintaining an active community of "general public"? EDIT: I'm not asking if they have the right to do it or are legally obliged to do so. IMO a committer should not content himself to follow the law, but should be interested in building/maintaining the community within the project objectives constraints. That is what I'm asking for: how he should behave to accomplish this.
