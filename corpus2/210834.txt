First of all, pardon the title, as it's not very clear. I have an application I am writing that is GPLv3, and is in Java, which means that classfiles are generated and linked to for general operation. I am also using a scripting engine which, for performance, links any scripts it runs to my program's scripting libraries(which are class files) at runtime. Given that a script must be linked at runtime, can a GPLv3-incompatible script be run on the application? Can I legally force the script to be interpreted instead? Just to clarify I'm trying to involve the GPLv3 in restricting non- GPL-compatible licenses to scripts. The question is whether a technical linking operation functionally equivalent(except in performance) to parsing is actually linking in the legal sense. Clarification: Scripts will be transmitted to interacting instances of the application. Scripts are loaded from a textual representation in ECMAScript/JavaScript, tokenized and parsed for syntax and then linked. This is what is confusing me. Given the conveyance, is the script being compiled and linked? Or interpreted and the parser actually runtime linking itself?
