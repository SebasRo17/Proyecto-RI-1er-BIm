I spoke to my first potential client today and he told me about the requirements of his project - an Android app. He is a well-known designer / photographer in my country and now wants me to "convert the website into an app, custom-tailored". So the requirements, details stripped out, are as follows:   * eCommerce   * Aggregating all his content like videos, blogs, tweets, etc. into the app   * Live streaming any of his studio demos   * Augmented reality. So that people can see what his painting will look like on their wall before they buy it   * Taxi Sharing Now, for a freelance project, it seems too over-scoped. I am not saying that I cannot do it. I can. But let me be realistic:   * There is a steep learning curve when it comes to VR.   * I am not a tester. I have never white-box tested my own apps. I always black-box test.   * Since he is a renowned artist, something short of perfect _might_ harm his public image So, I asked him for 2 weeks' worth of time before I give him the final answer. Now knowing whom to consult for advise, I am posting the question here. Although interesting and personally challenging, I am split-minded about accepting a project like this. I will be **the only developer** for this. **Should one reject a project that seems to be over-scoped for one's own abilities?**
