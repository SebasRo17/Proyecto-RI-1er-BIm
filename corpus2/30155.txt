I have a matrix whose rows I want to extract based on whether the elements of one of its columns is a member of another vector (calling it the "comparison vector"). I would like to get better at using functional programming, and so I want to avoid using a loop, if it´s possible. I believe I have the right functions: `Select`and `MemberQ`. But I can´t coerce MemberQ to compare the element of the matrix to each element of the comparison vector. If there´s a duplicate answer, I´m willing to be lead to it (I´ve searched though)... Addition to my question:                mymatrix={{1, 1, -56}, {1, 2, 3.06}, {2, 0, -30.02}, {3, 1, -7.291}, {3, 2,1.93}, {4, 0, 0}, {5, 0, 0}, {5, 1, -356.4}, {6, 1, 9.945}, {7,0, -7.512}};           compvector={1,2,6,7,11,12,16,17};      I would like to extract the rows of ´mymatrix´ based on whether the values of the first column of ´mymatrix´ are in ´compvector´.
