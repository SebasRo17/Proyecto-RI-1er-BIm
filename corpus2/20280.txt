I am having problems displaying histograms exported as .eps in Word 2010. I don't have problems though displaying them in a specialized .eps viewer. (Postsript viewer from Rampant logic) I am writing histograms because there were no problems in exporting or displaying any other plot type.               plot = Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 200]]     Export["plot.eps", plot]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bWH6X.png) Could it be that .eps files for histograms are corrupted? I did not find a way to attach the .eps file, so I hope that I am not the only person with this problem, although this is kind of wicked.
