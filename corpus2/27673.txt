There is a function that I'm trying to get the inverse of. My function is a simple polynomial:               Tn[T_] := 4/9 T^3/Tc^2 + 5/9 T      Now I tried to find `T` as a function of `Tn`, for which I used Solve:               sols=Solve[Tn[x] == a, x, Reals]     {{x -> Root[-9 a Tc^2 + 5 Tc^2 #1 + 4 #1^3 &, 1]}}      Plotting it is no problem, which I did by using this:               Tc = 1;     Plot[Evaluate[x /. sols], {a, 0, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dPE8s.png) But the problem is that I have no idea what the hashtags in the result of Solve denote, and how I should write the function `T(Tn)`. What do the `#`s mean, and how exactly does `T` depend on `Tn`?
