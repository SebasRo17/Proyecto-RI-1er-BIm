After looking through these forums for answers that could work for my problem, I could not find anything. I want to make a heat map comparing values that are in a nested list. That is, I have a nested list of size n x n, and each position in the list is a rational number. How could I make a heat map comparing the greater/lesser of these numbers. The higher numbers would be one color and the lower would be another. An example first three lines of a list of Length 9 is:               {{0., 2.03181, 10.9162, 9.81852, 19.9333, 9.74689, 0.826292, 1.61575,        6.11642}, {2.52762, 0., 12.3072, 13.0194, 5.9971, 20.1544, 2.1197,        0.611078, 5.01625}, {17.5098, 6.42256, 0., 5.32809, 7.09947,        22.5269, 5.43391, 5.56034, 0.48698}}      All assistance is appreciated.
