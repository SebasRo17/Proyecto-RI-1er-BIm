I want to count references of objects, just like you would with (some) garbage collection, but all I want to do is turn this into a graph dataset that I can then analyze or visualize. What language, even a niche one, would allow this most simply? Edit: I thought this question was super-clear, but apparently I need to give an example:               var x = []     var y = x     var z = 1     x.extend(z)      resulting edges:               x -> [1]     y -> x         z -> 1
