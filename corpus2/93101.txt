Some years back I have developed a little C# class library, which is still frequently downloaded. Since I do not have the time to support the project any more, I would like to donate it. What is the best place to do so? Some remarks:   1. I will not be the owner of that project any more, I just "want to hand it over"   2. It has to be "free of charge", non commercial, ...   3. Best would be if others could make changes and also re-distribute them   4. It must not be a legal hazard for me, so no obligations etc. Have you done something before, what would you recommend...? Update: I got excellent feedback in virtually no time, **so I have to choose a license**. I am not so much in that legal stuff, also it is not my main interest. What do you recommend for this? In plain words, I only have little demands (clarifying my intentions):   1. People can use it for commercial and non commercial software   2. I do not want to be in any kind of liabilities   3. All improvements (fixes etc.) should be also available for me and the public under the same license as in 4.   4. I do not want force people to publish their whole source code when they deploy the library as part of a bigger project. But I want them to re-publish any direct improvements or bug fixes.  There are too many licenses to read them all....
