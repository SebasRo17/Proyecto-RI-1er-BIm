I am trying to display a series of 9x9 adjacency matrices which represent directed graphs on a 3x3 grid. The issue I am running up against is this (compounded by that fact that I don't really know how to do anything in Mathematica): only the connected nodes appear, and they do so with a Mathematica-decided geometry. I'd like every point in the adjacency matrix to refer to the same fixed coordinate on the 3x3 grid every time. It seemed that `VertexCoordinates` might work, but it only refers to the vertices that have degree > 0, right? Insight on how to accomplish this? Any help would be much appreciated.
