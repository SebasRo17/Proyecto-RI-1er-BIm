By default, the installer for my product copies files to the **Users\Username\AppData\local\MyProduct** directory (though the user can change this during installation, of course). I want to bundle some other files with product - documentation, sample spreadsheets (it includes an Excel add-in) etc. It doesn't seem appropriate to copy these additional files to **AppData** because it's a hidden folder that users shouldn't really muck about with. I could, of course, create a new sub-folder in the user's Documents directory and stick the files in there but as I haven't asked their permission to do this it seems impolite. So - any suggestions as to an easily accessible location to put these files in?
