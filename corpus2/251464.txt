I work for a company that, in my opinion, should be doing all of it's web development work in a fully agile manner. We have vague, competing ideas about the product at any given time. And we have strict deadlines. So, in the web arena it seems to make sense to operate in as agile a manner as possible. However, I could conceive of projects on the business apps side -- or even a complex sub-project on the web side (integrating with a pre-existent 3rd party app?) that, at least for the sake of argument, isn't at all changeable in scope. The scope of the integration piece would, for all intents and purposes, be fully specifiable up-front with zero chance for change. In general, is it acceptable to take project X in an organization that is normally attempting to achieve agility and work through it in a waterfall manner? Does it somehow compromise the agility of the organization on a whole? If the organization is truly trying to be agile, should the "rigid" project still be "managed" in an agile manner?
