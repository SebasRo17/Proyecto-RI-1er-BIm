I am not much of a JS developer, but I stumbled upon this site called Google Gravity (those who haven't used it, try doing a search there - you'll be amazed), which is a remastered Google homepage. From then on, I've been thinking and wondering about learning more on how the guy implemented it. I tried googling, but could not find a good explanation of the implementation. All the JS/CSS Gurus, can you point me to a location where I can learn more? I already know the basics of working with jQuery and AJAX. Thanks, Yati Sagade
