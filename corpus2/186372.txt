I am 20 years old and I've been doing some web development work for about 2 years or so. I have an interview for a Junior Web Developer position and the company knows that but I'll still be going through a technical interview and since I haven't been on one before I am not sure what kinds of questions I'll expect. I will be interviewed on PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What are some popular or rather important questions that I might be asked in those four language areas? I know the questions might vary greatly but just to get an idea. Eager to see some of your responses. Thanks!
