# Update OK, Please forgive the messiness of this, but I am working with something like:               d = (q = 8;     f = (lop =        Transpose[{Flatten[          Reverse[Table[             Gamma[y], {y, 1, q + 1}]] /. {ComplexInfinity -> 0}],          Flatten[Table[Binomial[n, k], {n, q, q}, {k, 0, n}]],          Flatten[Table[x^n, {n, 0, q}]]}];      {#1*#2*#3} & @@@ lop);     Flatten[f];     Total[f]);     d      which gives:               {40320 + 40320 x + 20160 x^2 + 6720 x^3 + 1680 x^4 + 336 x^5 + 56 x^6 + 8 x^7 + x^8}      I am then comparing the roots with another series, eg:               Normal[Series[E^x, {x, 0, 8}]]      which, in this case are the same. However, I have lots of different series & was wondering if I could manipulate them as stated below. _(NB - I realise there is no 'ComplexInfinity' output in the above example, but have left it in to demonstrate that I have tried several replace techniques for the subsequent questions.)_ # Original question I have several questions on list manipulation & at the risk of asking the same question multiple times, I have compiled them into the following single question: (a) Changing alternate (or some other pattern) signs / operators: From this:               1 + x + (x^2)/2! +  (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! +  (x^5)/5! ...      I would like to do get this:               1 - x + (x^2)/2! -  (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! -  (x^5)/5! ...      (b) Multiplying alternate (or some other pattern) elements by a given value (eg - I): From this:               1 + x + (x^2)/2! +  (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! +  (x^5)/5! ...      I would like to do get this:               1 - I x + (x^2)/2! -  I(x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! -  I(x^5)/5! ...      (c) Convert all Imaginary values in a list to real values (or vice versa), noting that there may be no pattern in the distribution here: From this:               1 + I x + (x^2)/2! +  (x^3)/3! + I(x^4)/4! +  I(x^5)/5! ...      I would like to do get this:               1 + x + (x^2)/2! +  (x^3)/3! + (x^4)/4! +  (x^5)/5! ...      or this:               I + I x + I(x^2)/2! +  I(x^3)/3! + I (x^4)/4! +  I(x^5)/5! ...      I have tried various select & replace methods, but have had no luck so far.
