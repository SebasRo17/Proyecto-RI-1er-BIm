I'm doing some research on the best GUI toolkit to use for future products at the company. We're talking about a fairly large organizations with quite a bit of code and a complete rewrite project in planning. Don't ask. Anyway, I'm trying to create a list relevant parameters to judge the toolkits. What would you use to drive the comparison? Here's what I've got so far:   * Maturity   * Ease of development   * Ease of prototyping   * Ease of maintenance   * Size of hiring pool   * Available knowledge at the company   * Training costs   * Community size   * Community level of expertise (how hard to find good answers to complex problems)   * Amount of expert-level books available   * Ability to interface to other technologies   * Deployment considerations   * Visual aesthetics   * Ability to access OS resources   * Multiple monitor support (something that might come in handy in our particular application)
