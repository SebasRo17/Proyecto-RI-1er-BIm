I grew up programming C++ and Java where everything was safe and beautiful. Compilers made sure to keep me in check if I ever strayed. Of course, everyone did a little Perl in college, but I didn't inhale. Kids these days are all about PHP on the backend and Javascript on the front. In trying to be hip, I do the same (for web development). The problem I keep running into is I accidentally add a dollar sign ($) in front of regular variables in Javascript and of course no one says anything because that's legal syntax often used for jQuery objects. Are there any debugging tools or dev tricks to catch this dollar sign confusion? Do you often make the same mistake, and how do you deal with it emotionally? Chrome dev tools don't always see this is a Javascript error. I use PhpStorm and Emacs for development, but those don't catch my stupidity, although I suspect Emacs does but chooses to not tell me about it out of spite. If you think this question is ridiculous, I think you are right. But we live in a world where a variable has a dollar sign in front of it. In such a world, nothing is ridiculous.
