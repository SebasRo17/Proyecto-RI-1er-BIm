I'm new at this and I was wondering if someone could suggest the most appropriate API to use to make a card game that is:   * cross-platform   * two-player   * peer-to-peer   * capable of laying out cards (png files)   * open-source   * beginner-friendly (well documented) If it helps to give a better answer, the game is based on _Set_ : http://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle_frame.htm ### Edit 1 This will be a standalone client application using C#, or any other suitable language for cross-platform GUI-based applications (e.g., Ruby, Java & Swing, Python). ### Edit 2 There are a number of toolkits listed at:   * http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/Game_Engines This helps, but which toolkit would be most suitable?
