> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Do people in non-English-speaking countries code in English? I have a development comming that is intended to be sold across Latin America (Spanish speakers), but I've heard from some partners that is a good practice to always code in English, I mean just code (methods, classes, pages names, etc), labels on GUI are going to be all in Spanish... Code will be edited in the future by developer of companies across Latin America and just maybe some from outside. What do you think?, any experience with this?
