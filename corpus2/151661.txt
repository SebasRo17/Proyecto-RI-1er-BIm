I've come across this PHP tag `<?= ?>` recently and I am reluctant to use it, but it itches so hard that I wanted to have your take on it. I know it is bad practice to use short tags `<? ?>` and that we should use full tags `<?php ?>` instead, but what about this one : `<?= ?>`? It would save some typing and it would be better for code readability, IMO. So instead of this:               <input name="someVar" value="<?php echo $someVar; ?>">      I could write it like this, which is cleaner :               <input name="someVar" value="<?= $someVar ?>">      Is using this operator frowned upon?
