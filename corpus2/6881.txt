I am having trouble getting an answer to this question...Am I missing something that anybody can see.               Simplify[Minimize[{(         x (-a + x))/(-a +           H) + (1 - (-a + x)/(-a + H)) ((y (-b + y))/(-b + H) +             H (1 - (-b + y)/(-b + H))), 0 <= a < 100, 0 <= b < 100,         a < x < 100, b < y <= 100}, {x, y}]]      My problem is: The computer (a small netbook) takes forever and I keep having to abort the evaluation. So I would like to know if it is possible to get an answer maybe on a faster machine or am I doing something wrong
