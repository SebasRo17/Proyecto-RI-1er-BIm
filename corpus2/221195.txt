I got asked to do a code review of a very simple one-route web service that when hit would simply restart an application on the system. The developer had coded this up as a POST which strikes me as odd. Now I realize that this is not really the type of thing that HTTP is all about - you can't even query state - but is there a more appropriate HTTP verb? My intuition is that since this is mostly idempotent and creates no new resources it should be a PUT.
