I have the same web application running on several different servers. Now I want a central place to administer everything in one web interface. What is the best way to do this? Should I provide a REST interface on every web application and let the admin application make all the calls? This seems like a common problem that's already been solved by smarter people than me. UPDATE: I want to change the application data per web application + see the results per web application
