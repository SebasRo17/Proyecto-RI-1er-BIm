p1 := y /. {First[Solve[x^2 + y^2 + x == 1, y, Reals]]}      > >     {ConditionalExpression[-Sqrt[1 - x - x^2], >        1/2 (-1 - Sqrt[5]) < x < 1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[5])]} >   I want to get the `-Sqrt[1 - x - x^2]` out of the conditional expression and assign it to a variable. I don't care about the conditions, I'm aware of them and need the expression for use out of the `ConditionalExpression`. How do I do that? I tried list commands combinations (`Flatten`, `First`, etc.) but they don't work with this. Am I just supposed to copy-paste?
