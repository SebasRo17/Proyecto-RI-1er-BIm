I read few articles on web to find out how Agile, XP, Scrum, pair programming are different from each other / related to each other and I derived the following line:   1. Scrum and XP are almost same. XP has shorter period of releases than Scrum   2. Pair programming is employed in both Agile and XP methodologies But I was unable to identify how Agile is different from XP. More than providing a URL, I would be happy to read your experience and thoughts on this.
