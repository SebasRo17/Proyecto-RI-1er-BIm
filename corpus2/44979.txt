I am trying to write a very simple application in Mathematica: a quiz that tests a multiplication table(let's use the 9x9 for this example). The app will display a question(e.g. 7x5), and the user has a textbox to type the answer(35 for the example). The user can simply press the enter or return key on a keyboard to proceed to another question (randomly selected). I have been using Mathematica for years, but I have no experience with constructing an application with interactive user interface since I use it for data analysis and complex mathematical tasks (I have no experience in constructing user interface in Mathematica except some simple usages of the Manipulate function). I would appreciate some guidance/help. Thanks!
