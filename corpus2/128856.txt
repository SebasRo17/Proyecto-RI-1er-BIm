I have two books geared toward learning JSP. From what I've read, one motivating feature/benefit is that it is easier for web designers (they apparently don't, as a rule, know Java) to work with dynamic pages via EL/JSTL. From what I've seen so far, learning EL/JSTL requires a basic understanding of Java. I have yet to see an example that doesn't have a Java class to reference. Since that is what I've seen, I wonder if someone can tell me that this is true or not. To make the question clear: Do web designers have to get a grasp, on a very basic level, of how a Java class works (e.g. fields, setters, getters, args, constructors...)? This question is really meant to help me decide whether or not to ask another question; it is a qualifier.
