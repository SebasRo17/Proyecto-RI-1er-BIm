I've been using `NSolve` a moderate (50-100 equations) size system of linear equations and it has been working splendidly (`Solve` on the other hand is extremely slow) and I thought I'd look up the method it is using is there anyway to: a) See which method Mathematica chooses to use for a particular set of equations? b) See what are the available methods to NSolve. The documentation for `NSolve` doesn't show anything specific under Details and Options.
