I am brand new on this site and look forward to interacting with each of you. I am graduating in June with my Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems with hopes of become a DBA in the future. I am currently taking a Database class now and studying SQL Server/T-SQL on the side. My experience in IT is limited to managing an Access database at my last employer for two years. What are the chances of landing a junior DBA position after I graduate?
