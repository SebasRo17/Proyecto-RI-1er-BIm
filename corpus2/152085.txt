I need help with a abstract factory pattern design. This question is a continuation of: Design help with parallel process I am really confused where I should be initializing all of the settings for each type of medium (ex: RS232, TCP/IP, etc). Attached is the drawing on how I am setting up the pattern: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mDfjH.png) As shown, when a medium is created, each medium imposes a **ICreateMedium** interface. I would assume that the Create() method also create the proper object, such as SerialPort serialPort = new SerialPort("COM1", baud); however, TCPIPMedium would have an issue with the interface because it wouldn't need to initialize a serial port object. I know I am doing something majorly wrong here. I just can't figure it out and have been stuck for a while. What I also get confused on show the interface **IMedium** will get access to the communication object once it is created so it can write out the appropriate byte[] packet. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. My main goal is to have the **Communicator** class spit a packet out without caring which type of medium is active.
