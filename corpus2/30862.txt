Suppose my `z = x + iy` Now, if `y=0`, then `z = x` i.e it becomes a real number So, logically `Arg[z]` should be equal to zero for this case. If I assign the numeric value for `x`, then `Arg[z]` produces zero in _Mathematica_ easily. But if I do not assign the numeric value for `x` which is of course a real number always, then how to produce `Arg[z]=0` for this case ? Because assigning or not assigning numeric value to `x` should not prevent Argument of `z` to be zero i.e `Arg[z]=0`. Actually, my computation involves variables only i.e algebraic expressions, no numeric calculations. The final _Mathematica_ output has a term `Arg[r]`. The parameter `r` , radius, is always real. So, _Mathematica_ should understand that as `r` is always real number, so `Arg[r]` should be zero. Please guide me how to achieve this.
