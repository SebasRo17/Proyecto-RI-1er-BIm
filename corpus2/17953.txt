Use of a vertical `Spacer` in justified text inside a graphic isn't working as required. The result in the green box looks right, but when this is placed in a graphic the spacing is messed up. Is there some way to fix it?               g1 = StringTake[ExampleData[{"Text", "BeowulfModern"}], {4740, 5200}];     g2 = StringTake[g1, 319] <> "\n";     g3 = StringDrop[g1, 319];     g4 = Row[{g2, Spacer[{0, 30}], g3}];          TextCell[g4, LineSpacing -> {0, 16}, TextJustification -> 1,       Background -> LightGreen]          Graphics[{       LightBlue, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {500, 140}], Black,       Inset[TextCell[g4, LineSpacing -> {0, 16}, TextJustification -> 1],        {0, 0}, {Left, Bottom}, {500, Automatic}]},      PlotRange -> {{0, 500}, {0, 140}}, ImageSize -> 500,      BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Courier New", FontSize -> 12}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4zwET.png)
