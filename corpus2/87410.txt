I'm almost three years in to a career as a web application developer. It's my first "real" programming job". We use ASP.net at my shop, but I've been making it a point to constantly strive toward mastery of client-side scripting. My primary pet peeve about web application development is the disconnect between what is happening client-side and what is happening server-side. Of course, the primary issue with web development is that for the last 20 years, we have built the web on extensions to what is essentially a text-file viewer. I have a more experienced co-worker who tells me that he used to be a non-web application developer. He says that moving from application development to web application development, his concern is to make the web application behave as much as feasibly possible as if it were a local application. I agree that my users would like this, too. I frequently learn about modern tools that I can add to my toolbox to accomplish this: jquery-ui, for example. This morning, I learned about using the new CSS position:fixed value to make elements appear static on my page as a user scrolls. I'd like to ask, what are the best tools that I can use to make my web applications more responsive and interactive; what can I use to make my web application be perceived to be like a locally running application.
