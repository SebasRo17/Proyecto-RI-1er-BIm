I have recently taken a project with another developer, and he has a certain way of initializing his references.               class Player     {         private:             Console &console;             Armor &armor1, &armor2;             Debugger &debugger;             sf::RenderWindow &window;             sf::Event &event;             public:            Player(Console &console, Armor &armor1, ...) : console(console), armor1(armor1), ... {};     }      And it's perfectly fine with me, but what if we add new stuff? Our constructor is massive, and so messy, I would like to know if there are better ways of initializing your references if you have a large project, because if we keep up with this, eventually our constructor will have more lines of code than what it actually does.
