I'm learning programming in Objective-C and I can't understand what a static method is. I know what class/instance/private/public methods are. Can someone explain what it is using an example and comparing it to the others I mentioned? And in what situation would someone use it? From what I read on Wikipedia, it sounds like a class method that can't access anything in `self`. This sounds to me like its a stand-alone function - that shouldn't be associated with any class in the first place, since it can't access `self`.
