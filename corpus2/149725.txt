I'm trying to understand how tcp retransmission queue works so I can implement it in my application that uses TCAP over SCTP. What I understood from the TCP queue is that every message is saved in retransmission queue with with a time, when the timer reaches 0 the message will be sent again. My question is how to check the time on that message, is it like a thread that constantly checks the retransmission queue or is it something else?
