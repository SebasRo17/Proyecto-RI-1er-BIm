Most (good) namespace conventions require a company name scoped namespace. **eg** `CompanyName.ComponentName.x.y.z` How well does this translate over to web applications? In many websites, the company is referred to by the website name (eg, Facebook, MySpace). Does this convolute namespaces, making them appear as if they can only apply to a single project? **For example** , let's pretend a company creates _WebsiteA_ (.com), and is henceforth referred to as ' _WebsiteA_ '. _WebsiteA_ creates a reusable authentication component for their project. They namespace it as such: `WebsiteA.Auth.x.y.z` A year later, _WebsiteA_ creates a new website, _WebsiteB_ , and decide to use their previously created `WebsiteA.Auth` component. Does this obscure the namespace? Should the company have used an alias separate from their website name as their CompanyName in their namespacing? Afterall, `WebsiteA.Auth` isn't coupled directly to _WebsiteA_.com, and `WebsiteA` is now more of a project of the company, rather than the entire company.
