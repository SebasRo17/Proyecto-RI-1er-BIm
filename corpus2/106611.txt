I've had this happen in all sorts of software products: You purchase a software product, download it, install it, and then after the install, the program immediately begins downloading an update or a patch. Ideally, I would imagine that the download package would somehow be linked to the product's repository so that stable releases could be pushed to the product site rather than having to force the user to wait through an update after install. Are there any technical reasons for the install/update process or is it just a case of poor deployment infrastructure on the part of a lot of companies?
