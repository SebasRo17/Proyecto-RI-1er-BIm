I am trying to combine 3 `ListContourPlot`s to obtain a 3 in-row panel figure in Mathematica 7, to export in one single eps file. One of the plots has also its own legend. I am using `GraphicsGrid`, as suggested in Mathematica help. The problem is that the panels in the final figure are not aligned and the actual plot area is different from panel to panel. This fact has probably something to do with Mathematica considering as dimensions of each plot the entire occupied are, including also axis labels, and aligning the plots according to them as opposed to with respect to the axis themselves. How can I get the panels to align on the axes?
