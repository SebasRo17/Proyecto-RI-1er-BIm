This is one of the things that I hate most when I see it in someone else's code. I know what it means and why some people do it this way ("what if I accidentally put '=' instead?"). For me it's very much like when a child goes down the stairs counting the steps out loud. Anyway, here are my arguments against it:   * It disrupts the natural flow of reading the program code. We, humans, say "if value is zero" and not "if zero is value".   * Modern compilers warn you when you have an assignment in your condition, or actually if your condition consists of just that assignment, which, yes, looks suspicious anyway   * You shouldn't forget to put double '=' when you are comparing values if you are a programmer. You may as well forget to put "!" when testing non-equality.
