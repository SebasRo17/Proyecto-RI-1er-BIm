I am learning from _Learn Python the hard way_ where I have come across a study drill where they want to know that whether a class can be used like an object. As I have experimented:               class A(object):         def __init__(self):             print "in here"         def cat(self,name):             print "my cat ",name      Here if I write `A.cat(A(),"Tom")`, it works and found out that its call unbound method. Now, does that mean I can assume that classes can be used like an object?
