I have very little experience working in a big project. But I did work about 3 months in a small outsourcer (a company that do the coding for a bigger foreigner web development company). This is what I saw. The foreigner company did all the user analysis & all database designs. Then a group of the Project managers in that foreigner company start to build a structure of the Application. That means they build all the basic classes that are the framework of the app. For example, in the framework they got many **undone (empty)** methods like:               int calNoOfCustomer(...){        // do the calculation here     }      My small company then starts to fill in the details of empty methods but it did not build the whole structure. I think it likes an assignment in IT school. The teacher build a structure & empty methods & ask students to complete them. So, I want to ask you that "is that the way how web development company does in real world big project?" Do the Project managers build a structure of an application (with empty methods) then give it to the other programmers for completing the app in real world Big Project?
