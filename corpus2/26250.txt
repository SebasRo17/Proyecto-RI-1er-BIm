If I am given a symbolic expression of all the matrix elements in an infinite- dimensional space, e.g., the Hamiltonian of a quantum mechanical system, is it possible to get the symbolic expression for all of the eigenvalues by Mathematica? One of the simplest case is the Harmonic Oscillator in quantum mechanics, where the elements of Hamiltonian matrix can be written as: $$ H_{mn}=(n+\frac{1}{2})\delta_{mn} $$ where we all know that the eigenvalues are: $$ E_n=n+\frac{1}{2},( n=0,1,2,3,...) $$ but Mathematica seems not having any functions to find the eigenvalues given such conditions, since the dimension of the matrix is infinity.
