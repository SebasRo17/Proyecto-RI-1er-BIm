I have an android app that fetches a list of about 100 Items.   Trying to get the server load down, I've built a filtering feature that   does everything offline, so basically instead of calling the server (and thus a MySQL query every call)   It filters on its own.   However I've noticed the app tends to lag (while the only change is the offline filtering).   Is the processing of relatively big object-lists something that should be done offline or should I live the load on the server ?
