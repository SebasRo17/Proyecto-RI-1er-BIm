After our phone screen, but before a face to face interview, I ask our candidates to complete a short programming assignment. It involves writing a small command line program in C, which should run to around 100-200 LoC and take 3-4 hours to complete. We allow the candidate 72 hours to complete the task and get it back to us. It involves a little simple file and string handling and a simple data structure (which the candidate has to select appropriately). We ask for a solution that is "reasonably efficient, concise and easy to understand" to hint that we don't expect it to be super clever or micro-optimized at the expense of readability. The task is not completely specified, so we make it clear that we'd like to see any assumptions document. **So my question is: how should I rate the solution?** I have seen a couple of solutions so far (it's early days). But I'm a bit disappointed that there have been bugs that I've found within a few minutes of hand testing or looking at the code. But what sort of standard should I expect? If anyone has any links to good general advice on the topic, it would be very much appreciated.
