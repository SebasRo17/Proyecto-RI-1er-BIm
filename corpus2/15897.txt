Hi We have a CMS application that lets people create websites under our domain. The system was built a few years ago and it used a method that transfers parameters such as website id, folder code and more using the url. this method created a giant url for every item in the website For example: My domain is www.domain.com   A users website on my domain is www.domain.com/user   and every time that a user enters his website he gets a link like this www.domain.com/page.aspx?code=blablasdsdsdsdsds&folder=blablablablablabla and more. We are trying to reduce the string size in the url. What are our options? can we show the user one url like a virtual one and still work the same with the old url? We are trying to locate a solution that wont make us rewrite our entire application. the application is built in c# and the web server is iis 6. Thanks
