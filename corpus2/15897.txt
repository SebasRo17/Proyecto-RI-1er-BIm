I am trying to find a numerical solution for an equation of the form: $$ f(t)=\int_{t_{min}}^{t} {\exp[2 (t^\prime - t)] E(t^\prime) f(t^\prime)} \+ \int_{t}^{0}{ \exp(t^\prime - t) E(t^\prime) f(t^\prime)} $$ where $E$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and $t_{min}$ can be in principle any negative integer. I have tried `NIntegrate` and some iteration but didn't get me too far... can anyone help me with a better idea? Thank you very much for your help!!!
