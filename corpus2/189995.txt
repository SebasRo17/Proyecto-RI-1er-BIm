I have some _chrome extenssions_ to publish, but when I log into my Chrome Webstore account it says: > Before you publish your first item, you must pay a one-time US$5.00 > developer registration fee. We charge this fee in order to verify developer > accounts and better protect users against fraudulent activity. As it says, this charge is to verify my account. My problem is that due to US sanctions on my country, google doesn't provide any financial trades with us, and so **I have no means to pay this 5$** , so I can not publish any extenssions :( My question is, by what other way I can verify my account? Any kind of help would be appreciated. **Edit** : My question is not about bypassing law, It is about finding a legal way. And I'm trying to develop opensource extenssions without any commercial use. **I don't want to do payments, I know this is not possible for Google.** But There must be some other way of verification.
