Keno is a popular lottery game that is available with all of the larger casino softwares. The player is given a ticket with 70 numbers on it. He picks 1 to 11 numbers on the ticket. 20 winning numbers are selected randomly. The more of the player's picks that are selected, the bigger the payout. In Sweden, my home country, _Svenska Spel_ (a state owned company) offers the following \begin{array}{c|c|c|} \text{Number of Correct Guesses}&\text{Return} &\text{Average Chance of Winning} \\ \hline 11 & 5000000 &\text{See below} \\ \hline 10 &125000 & \\ \hline9 & 3000 & \\ \hline8 & 300 & \\ \hline 7 & 30 & \\ \hline 6 & 10 & \\ \hline 5 & 5 & \\ \hline 4 & 0 & \\ \hline 3 & 0 & \\ \hline 2 &0 & \\ \hline 1 & 0 & \\ \hline 0 & 0 & \text{1 to 6.2} \end{array} > What I would like to do is to calculate the probability to obtain > $0,1,2,\dots, 11$ right guesses on Keno 11 and compare it to _Svenska spel_. > In addition, I would like to plot this result using histograms. **My Take** What I have done is to define the hypergeometric probability distribution function as:                   Urn[good_, bad_, draws_, need_] := ({{good},{need}}) ({{bad},{draws - need}})/     ({{good + bad},{draws}})      I have then used this to calculate the KenoOdds using the following code:                KenoOdds =       Table[MatrixForm[        Table[{g, k, Round[1/N[Urn[g, 70, 20, k]]] - 1}, {k, 0, g}]], {g,         4, 11}]      The problem is that the first code does not work; all I receive is this message "An unknown box name (Hold) was sent as the BoxForm for the expression. Check the format rules for the expression." H
