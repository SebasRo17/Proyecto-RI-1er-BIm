I have been waiting for _Mathematica_ to give me something for the following integral, errors welcome, but it has been "running" for almost 30 minutes now.                    h[s_] := If[1 < s, 1, 0]          Integrate[                   Abs[1/(b1^2 + b2^2)                    2 E^(-b1 s) ((a1 b1 + a2 b2) E^(                   b1 s) - (a1 b1 + a2 b2) Cos[b2 s] + (-a2 b1 + a1 b2) Sin[                    b2 s]) - h[s]],  {s, 0, Infinity}, Assumptions -> b1 > 0]      Is there a way to simplify this so that _Mathematica_ would not take this long, or is this an entirely lost case? Thank you in advance.
