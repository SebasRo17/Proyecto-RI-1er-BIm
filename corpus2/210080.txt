I'm putting together some notes for a dev team on how to write secure Perl code - especially taking into account the current OWASP top 10 web application vulnerabilities. For cross-site scripting I've included information on ensuring that all output to the browser is checked and escaped where necessary, but I'm looking for more automated mechanisms that would mean a developer doesn't have to think about every output statement and, potentially, miss one. Perl's 'taint' function sounds like it should be a help because it distrusts all user input, but it doesn't complain on tainted data being output to the browser. Apart from checking all output statements individually (probably by calling a generic sanitizing function) does anyone have any ideas on how Perl can help with this with existing libraries or techniques?
