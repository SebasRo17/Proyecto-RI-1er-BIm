I have quite a lot expressions that need to be integrated after switching the integral sign with differentation operator. The additional problem is that the bounds are dependent to one of the variables. So I need to use: $\int_{a(y)} ^{b(y)} {\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y}}=\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \int_{a(y)} ^{b(y)} f(x,y) dx- \frac{db}{dy}f(x=b,y)+\frac{da}{dy}f(x=a,y)$ How do I achieve this in Mathematica? For now Mathmatica just writes output:               Integrate[D[f[x, y], y], {x, a[y], b[y]}]      in the symbolic form. How do I workaround this? Of course I can write my own function, but I wonder iw Mathematica has some built in functionality I require. Regards
