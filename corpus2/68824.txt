I have seen some dirty code in my time. I have heard varied feedback about "dirty fixes" too: a) a dirty "fix" is not a fix b) some fixes dirtier than others but dirty fixes are not acceptable c) some fixes dirtier than others and some dirty fixes are more acceptable than others d) dirty fixes show a pragmatic use of ones time but should be discouraged e) dirty fixes show a pragmatic use of ones time and should not be discouraged f) other Which of the above would you agree with and why? How do you stop attitudes like (e) from becoming standard practice?
