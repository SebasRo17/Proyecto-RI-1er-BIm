I'm using the `CustomTicks` package, which is part of the `LevelScheme` package, for styling the `FrameTicks` in my plots. On some sides of the plot frame, I want to have `FrameTicks` without tick labels. The problem is that I get extra white space in the place where the tick labels used to be. (Here, I have produced the plots with `LightGray` background in order to highlight the cropping problem.)               Needs["CustomTicks`"]          plot = Plot[x, {x, 0, 1},       Frame -> True,        FrameTicks -> {LinTicks[0, 1, ShowTickLabels -> False],LinTicks[0, 1]},       Background -> LightGray     ]      ![Plot with unwanted white space](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wXe0y.png) I think that the problem arises because the nonlabeled ticks are created as `""`, as can be seen in `FullForm[plot]`. How can I achieve a result similar to `Plot[x,{x,0,1},Frame->True]`, i.e., a tight cropping of the plot around its frame (see below) with customized `FrameTicks`? I do not want to rasterize my plot; thus, `ImageCrop` is not an option.               Plot[x, {x, 0, 1},       Frame -> True,       Background -> LightGray     ]      ![Correct cropping but with default <code>FrameTicks</code>](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FZhmD.png)
