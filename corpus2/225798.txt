Where I work, management knows **zero** whenever it comes to programming & design. I want everyone to understand before reading the question that this is not a technical company, they are retail sales people that like the idea of custom software. I was told that they want to create a incentive structure with bonus opportunities based of what I am working on. The flip side is I need to share goals with them in detail of what I want to have completed within xx amount of time to create this reward system. I would like to set this up the correct way instead of making easily achievable goals / deadlines. As attractive as that sounds, I would like to use this as an opportunity for the company to move in the right direction whenever it comes to this department. They have had a hard time with talent fleeing in the past due to bad management, no incentives, and a poor environment. I am happy to see them trying new things for improvement down the road. We all use github for version control and offsite repositories, one developer works in rails and cakephp, I work in c# and vb. My thoughts were to base the incentives on project completions - which they wanted more detailed specifics. But they do not understand actual code, terms, etc. Example: They would think that more code is always better because it's more, instead of realizing if you lessen the code in a function it may be more efficient and easier to read. What would you do, or have you done in a similar situation?
