I find it very interesting that even people who design a particular framework still have to rely on compiling to ensure the code is correct. I don't mean for 100s of lines of code, but 2-10 lines. I say this because they mention the code they wrote might not compile/work because it's untested. But why can't we write even the most basic code without relying on compiling? Is it because of the languages or the frameworks? Or is it because we have gotten used to using IDEs too much? I am not against doing this, but just wondering the reasons.
