Suppose we have the following equation: $$ g_ma_m=r_ma_{m-1} $$ with initial condition $a_L=d$ and $L$ might be negative. The following command               RSolve[{g[m] a[m] == r[m] a[m - 1], a[-10] == d}, a, m]      gives me               {{a -> Function[{m},        d*Product[r[1 + K[1]]/g[1 + K[1]], {K[1], 0, -1 + m}]]     }}      where `K[1]` runs from 0 to $m-1$. But shouldn't `K[1]` runs from -10 to $m-1$?
