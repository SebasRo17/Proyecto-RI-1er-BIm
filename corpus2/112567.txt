I am developing a range of post filters for a wordpress site, and I have built the first 4 with a single class. The final two are different enough in scope to only share a single function (the function for producing the final links) in their classes. Is it reasonable, either in this instance or in any number of similar hypothetical instances, to extend the original class in order to have that functionality, or is there a better way?
