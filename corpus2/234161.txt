IANAL I have several private projects that I _might_ be needed to show to my prospective employers. I haven't uploaded them to any online version control system because not only do I not have the patience to filter the many many licenses available and choose the most appropriate one (as I am not yet sure how I would want my open source code to be used), I also feel the projects aren't fit enough for upload in public domain as they are not tested rigorously enough for me. I could create a private repository somewhere and allow access to the prospective employers, or I could simply take a USB stick with me, but the question still remains about licensing. So, I thought of creating an ad-hoc license to the effect of saying "this code is made available to you and no part of it shall be reproduced from memory...", which is almost like signing a NDA. I know it might sound silly, or inane, but I want to protect my IP in someway (you never know what your code could become!). What is the best way of going about this? If indeed license creation is an option, how would the creation work? Would merely writing a prologue at the beginning of every source file suffice, or is there some long winding legality involved?
