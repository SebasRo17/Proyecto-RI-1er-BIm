I'm looking at a very large (5-6 digit LOC), very complex, code-base, full of interacting bulky, interdependent, views and stored procedures (multiple 4-5 digit count silos). The source SQL has been touched many times, by many different people, and no formatting constraints have been enforced. This led to wildly differing formatting for SQL, even within single stored procedure/view definitions. The code continues to be worked on by several groups of, mostly, senior programmers, and sees a steady stream of small changes and improvements. * * * Under these conditions: a. what is a sane standard to conform to for formatting (eg, should we use all caps for keywords? seems like the small benefits from having so many programmers not have to press Shift actually add up to significant time/cost savings) b. is it worthwhile advocating for a major refactor to standardize the formatting (ie, is the cost of training a large body of programmers/changing their behaviour/ill will at enforcing a new constraint worth the benefit in the long-term?)
