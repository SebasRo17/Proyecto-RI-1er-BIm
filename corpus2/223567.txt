I am coding a Java program on my development machine. Maven packages this a `myjar.jar`, and I can run it from the command line using `java -cp myjar.jar my.FantasticClass`. It uses library `somelib.jar`. I use Maven, and the project is hosted on github. When I want to run my project on the target machine, what is the best way to go? I could package my code as a jar, grab the `somelib.jar` and move it to the target machine manually, but I suppose I could also check out the Maven project from github on the target machine, run it, and have Maven both generate the jar and get the `somelib.jar` file. Or am I simply overlooking something?
