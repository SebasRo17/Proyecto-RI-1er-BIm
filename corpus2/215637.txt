An operation in an interface is obsolete so I decided to delete it. It seems that there is no automatic support for such a "refactoring" in Eclipse. For me is a refactoring operation since the behavior of the code will be preserved since nobody (tests, client apis) will notice that the operation was removed. In Eclipse, in Java code, on an method in an interface I have the following options: rename, move, change method signature, inline, extract interface, extract superclass, use supertype when possible, pull up, push down, introduce parameter objet, introduce indirection, generate declared type. Is there any reason for which a delete method/field/function refactoring doesn't exist?
