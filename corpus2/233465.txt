how would you recommend for me to design an android app where i want it to 1) send location update every 10 minutes 2) to show push notification I want both actions be available even when the app is closed. Here i might ask for your explanation what "closed" states an app can be in? a) removed from recent tasks stack - close the whole process including its services ? b) forces closed - close the whole process including its services ? c) other? I was using 1) alarm manager that sends a pending intent to a broadcast receiver. 2) notification manager I have tried to register all manager using ApplicationContext instead of Current-Activity context. Now both actions work even after user remove the app from the "recent tasks" stack. but I'm not sure about the "closed" states so I might be missing something.
