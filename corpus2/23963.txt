I have nonlinear equations to solve parametrically;               PG = 100;          p1 = 0.8;          p2 = 0.2;          Solve[C1 - 10 + PG/2 + GC1 + GL1 == 0 &&        C2 - 15 + PG/2 + GC2 + GL2 == 0 && GL1 - fd (a1) t 10 == 0 &&        GL2 - fd (a2) t 15 == 0 &&        GC1 - (t (1 - fd) 25 - PG) ((p1)/((p1) + (p2))) == 0 &&        GC2 - (t (1 - fd) 25 - PG) ((p2)/((p1) + (p2))) ==         0 && (0.3/GL1) - (0.5/C1) - (0.3/GC1) - (0.4/PG) ==         0 && (0.3/GL2) - (0.5/C2) - (0.3/GC2) - (0.4/PG) == 0 &&        GC1 - 4 GC2 == 0, {C1, C2, GC1, GC2, GL1, GL2, fd, a1, a2, t}]      I do get 8 roots for this problem. However, for more complex solvings of this model (change numeric values - 15,10 to alpha, beta, gamma) I do get no more memory error. To avoid that I want to put some conditions on the variables since all roots are not meaningful and it takes time+memory to calculate it. Ex: a1 > 0, a2 > 0, 0 $\leq$ fd $\leq$ 1, C1 C2 takes positive values. I want to solve under these or more conditions. How to put these nonnegativity and bounding conditions for variables in the mathematica solve command? At least if I could put nonnegativity conditions I would get rid of the negative roots. Does it matter if I use Reduce instead ? I would appreciate your comments and your help.
