According to Martin Fowler classical article, there are two types of verification: state and behaviour verification. At the same time I often see people telling about implementation vs. behaviour verification. So I guess we speak about pretty same stuff here and "state" in the first classification is "behaviour" in the second; "behaviour" in the first equals to "implementation" in the second. What I don't like is that "behaviour" word appears in both namings but on contrary sides which causes a lot of confusion. Which naming do you prefer?
