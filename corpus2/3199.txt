How safe is an encoded package (using locked, etc)? If I don't specify a personal key, I understand that the encoding key must be somewhere in the Mathematica program itself, and so it is not a perfect system, but:   * can we trust it for commercial deployment?   * has someone of you ever heard of it being found?   * do you know if there are backdoor to reverse the code, like shadowing the encode/decode system...? (don't want to know them, just checking how safe it is...) If I specify a key, I understand that it becomes a stronger system, but:   * how can the client use the app without me giving back the key (without him seeing the code -> I'm supplying the app, but with closed source)?   * is there a workaround for this personal key system?   * how do you typically do it, or see it done? I heard of MX files being used, but at first glance, they look very version/system specific, and so kind of difficult to manage when the client updates his Mathematica, or player. Nevertheless:   * are they safer than encode?   * can they be mixed up with encode to become safer? On other programming languages I use USB dongles:   * do you know how it could be done with Mathematica (my program is 100% coded on Mathematica language)?   * would I need to go through the new librarylink? I know that these are lots of questions, but I cannot find a lot of info on this theme.
