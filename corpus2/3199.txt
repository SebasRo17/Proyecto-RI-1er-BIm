Are different version naming conventions suited to different projects? What do you use and why? Personally, I prefer a build number in hexadecimal (e.g 11BCF), this should be incremented very regularly. And then for customers a simple 3 digit version number, i.e. 1.1.3.               1.2.3 (11BCF) <- Build number, should correspond with a revision in source control     ^ ^ ^     | | |     | | +--- Minor bugs, spelling mistakes, etc.     | +----- Minor features, major bug fixes, etc.     +------- Major version, UX changes, file format changes, etc.
