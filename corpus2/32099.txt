Can someone help please me in solving the following stochastic master equation for the density matrix $\rho$? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/59yTx.png) where $\rho$ is the density matrix, $\sigma_i$ are the pauli matrices, $dt$ is the time, $dW$ shows the Wiener increment and ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jp1DK.png) The other parameters are constants and $[a,b]$ shows commutator of the operator $a$ and $b$
