I have always found it more logic to validate input instead of filtering it. How to appropriately filter data depends on the situation, so IMO it should be done in output or when saving to a database. But I see that some frameworks provide automatic XSS filters for incoming POST and GET data. What is the logic behind this solution? I can't see any advantages in doing this except providing a quick and easy solution to "lazy" developers. Or is there some specific security reason I don't understand?
