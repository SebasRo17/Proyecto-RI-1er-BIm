Most VMs have a "call stack" to keep track of where to return from each function that was called. This is often simply regarded as "the stack". However often a stack is needed for operations that aren't related to function calling, such as performing arithmetic. My question is: is the same stack (i.e. the call stack) used also for these kinds of operations? Or do operations such as performing arithmetic use a different stack? (I'm talking about most VMs).
