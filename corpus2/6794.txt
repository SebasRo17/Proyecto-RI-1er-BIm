As could be seen in the following code:               AbsoluteTiming[         n  = 100000;         A  = SparseArray[{              Band[{1, 120}] -> -2., Band[{950, 1}] -> -1.,               Band[{1, 1}] -> 20., Band[{1, 100}] -> 2.,               Band[{6, 800}] -> 1.1}, {n, n}, 0.];         b  = SparseArray[Table[1., {i, n}]];         DA = Diagonal[A];              (* I think constructing B is time-consuming. My ParallelTable[] does          not work or show any improvement herein! *)              B = SparseArray[Table[(1/DA[[i]]), {i, 1, n}]];         V = DiagonalMatrix[SparseArray[B]];     ]      I'm trying to extract the diagonal entries of a very large sparse matrix and to compute $1/a_{ii}$ to make my new large sparse diagonal matrix $V$. This process takes around 18 seconds, and I would like to accelerate this process.
