I'm trying to find the number of points in a matrix with the same minimal distances. Start with a MxN matrix, where M and N < 50000\. There is given a set of fixed points, with their respective coordinates.   The problem is to find the number of points in the matrix such as the minimal distance from any point in the set can be reached for at least two point in the set. The distance is measured by moving one units a time horizonatally or vertically. You can't move diagonally. An example would make things clearer.   Let's say we have 3 fixed point: (1,3), (3,1) and (3,6). Here the point (3,3) would be one point since the minimal distance is 2 units and it can be reached for the first two fixed points in the set. However, the point (4,4) doesn't satisfy the requirements. Although the distance from (1,3) and (3,1) is same, 4 units, the minimal distance is 3 units. My idea was to use any point with integer coordinates that lies on the bisector of a segment joining each par as a point that would fill our requirements. But I find a lot of false positives were a point satisfies the requirements, but doesn't lie on the perpendicular bisector. Brute-force methods won't work, because we need too check a billion of distance for each point and that one heck of a job to do. How should I go about solving this problem?
