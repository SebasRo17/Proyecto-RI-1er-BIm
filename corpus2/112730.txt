I've written a Windows Phone 7 application to display the Ordnance Survey maps that are loved so much in the UK (I am amazed that no-one else has done this yet). However I was about to shell out the £65 to pay for the app hub and get my app to the marketplace when I started investigating how you actually get paid for the apps that people buy. Apparently if you are not a US developer then you have to start sending over forms e.g. W8BEN form? and even after this the IRS takes another 30% (after MS have taken their 30% share). It also mentions VAT so maybe there is more money taken off after this as well??? Has anyone from outside the US actually got all the paperwork sorted so they got paid? Did you get tax taken off as well? What percentage of the sales do you actually end up with? Is it all worth it? I don't expect to make much from the app but I would like to think I could recoup my £65 and have enough to buy a couple of beers as well.
