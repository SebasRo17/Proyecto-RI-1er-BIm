I'm developing a PHP application and I find myself doing basically the same code for, say, creating an object based on a form filled by the user. The objects are of different classes, but the process is mostly the same: take the data from the form, apply validation, save/return error. Is there a way to automatize this process? I ask also because I intend to write a public API and use the same code to do those operations, instead of just copy/pasting. I thought of making a kind of Factory Method pattern that receives the type and the data from the form (or any array), create an instance and set the data, testing the validation afterwards (each object knows how to validate their own fields). And that for each of the other CRUD operations as well. Is that feasible/good practice? Should I just repeat the similar code? There are any other way to do it? For the record, I'm using ORM already (Doctrine). Still, I think that a lot of `create` functions with pretty much the same code (a bunch of `set*`) is something too repetitive.
