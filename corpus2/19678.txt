There is a demostration project http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/KeyboardAndComposer/ where you can compose Western music using a 97 keys simulated midi keyboard. I study eastern and ancient music and harmony. So I can not use SoundNote for this kind of music (where each note is represented as a fraction. Using middle Do as a base (i.e., `base = 260.741 Hz`), the next notes are represented by `re = 9/8 base`, `mi = 5/4 base`, `fa = 4/3 base`, `sol = 3/2 base`, `la = 3/2 9/8`, `si`=`3/2 5/4`) So my problem is to change the above keyboard so that   1. the keys have pitches defined using some fractions like the ones mentioned above   2. The user could simultaneously use his/her computer keyboard with the midi keyboard for music synthesis and polyphony. For example: While simultaneously pressing R on computer keyboard and midi button fa on the Mathematica Midi Keyboard the user could hear re + fa continuously (or at least as long as the R key and fa button are pressed.). But when R is released (and midi button fa is still pressed) only fa will be heard. Some help, please!
