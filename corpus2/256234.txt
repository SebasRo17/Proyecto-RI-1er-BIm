I've been looking all over the Internet for a page that lists **cases** for when to use each abstract data type. I expect that reading through a series of both surprising and obvious uses for each type will help readers recognize future opportunities for applying a particular ADT in their algorithms. For example: > **Trees** > >   * File System >   * HTML DOM tree >   * Family Genealogy >   * Syntactic Parsing of Strings >   * etc... > I'll provide a list of basic ADTs that should be included; feel free to add more, or to specify subtypes:               Arrays, Linked-Lists, Sets, Dictionaries/Maps, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.
