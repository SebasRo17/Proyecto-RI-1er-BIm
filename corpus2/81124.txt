Say I have an idea for a desktop application with unusual interface requirements. I need:   * Pixel-level control over the look and feel.   * Finely specified custom controls.   * Platform-independence. My typical solution in this scenario would be to use SDL (or SDL+OpenGL) as a graphics framework upon which to build the interface from scratch.   * Is it a good idea to work this way, or should I use an existing toolkit?   * If the latter, which toolkit with bindings for either C or C++ offers the cleanest and most versatile facilities for extension (creating new controls) and customisation (styling existing controls)?
