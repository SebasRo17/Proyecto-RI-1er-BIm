I'm working on a project that needs to consume a JSON stream (approximately 1MB / minute), and parse and insert objects into a database. Amazon's DynamoDB or SimpleDB seem like attractive options for this. Is there a web service that can run a very simple script to eat the data and put it in a database? I could use a worker on Heroku or Elastic Beanstalk, or even pure EC2, but I'd like to find a service that's much cheaper, due to the very low amount of bandwidth and CPU required. (Sorry for the crappy tags. I'm not even sure where to categorize this question.)
