Good day to all! The objective of my task is apply the collatz function for a number `x1` and print the exact number of iterations until `s1`. I want to create a function using `Module`:               CollatzFunction[x1_, s1_]:= Module[{.......};      Print iterations to `s1`-> "number of iterations" I barely have an idea using `Nest[]`, but I don't know how to apply `Nest` until the `s1` number is reached. Please, help in this task, it's just a step towards creating a more complicated function. Thanks.
