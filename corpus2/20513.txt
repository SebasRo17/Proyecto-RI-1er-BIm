I am absolutely desperate. I cannot get my Borg to pronounce "futile" correctly.               Speak["Resistance is futile."]      Leo pronounces "futile" as expected and there is no indication that this word is pronounced differently in the US and the UK. I have also tried various incorrect spellings but with no real success. Is it actually possible to install and use other speakers? Are there means to adapt the pronounciation of specific words or phrases? **EDIT:** Question 1: "few-tile" and "hoss-tile" as suggested below sound very good on my computer. Fact is, "futile" and "hostile" are not pronounced incorrectly but do follow the American pronounciation. We are probably spoiled by British actors (Patrick Steward) mingling in American series. Believe it or not, I watched the "Scorpion" episode (species 8472 appears for first time) of ST-TNG and yes, Data and Geordie use American pronounciation. **EDIT:** Question 2: Mathematica resorts to the default "voice" installed in the (in my case) Windows 7 set-up. Adaptions such as speaker's speed are also inherited by Mathematica.
