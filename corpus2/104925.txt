I completed some work at University for a website design. I understand that unless I request IP from the University they own full rights to the design. The clause is stated as below: > 18.1 All intellectual property rights in and to any work created by a > student during the course of his/her study will belong to and be the > absolute property of the University and the student will do all such acts > and sign all necessary deeds and documents to vest legal title in and to the > intellectual property in the University. The questions I have are:   1. Do I maintain any rights to the design?    2. Have I relinquished all rights to the work through this point?   3. Is accreditation and IP separate? I.e. do I still have the right to accreditation on the website despite not owning it? Any advice or help is much appreciated.
