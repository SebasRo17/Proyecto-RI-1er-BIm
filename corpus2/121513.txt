I am a programmer that can code. But I find that I can get thing done, but not get thing do well or like most of the open source communities do. Well, I use some of the library from git hub. I find most of the programme is well structure. Also, a read me. My question are:   1. Is that any common file structure or naming convention in the community or this is just a matter of personal taste?    2. How to become a more organized programmer, instead of writing code just work. But more organized that let other easy to get in your project?
