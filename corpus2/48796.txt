I'm trying to find the first five eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix that has the following proporties:               L = 10;     NN = 500;     ‚Ñè = 1;     a = 1;     V0 = 5;     dx = L/NN;     Clear[x]     x[n_] := -L/2 + (n - 1/2) dx     Vsw = -V0* i Piecewise[{{1, -1/2 < x < 1/2}, {0, x > 1/2}, {0, x < -1/2}}];     i = SparseArray[{{i_, i_} -> 1, {i_, j_} /; Abs[i - j] == 1 -> 0}, {500, 500}];     s = SparseArray[{{i_, i_} -> -2, {i_, j_} /; Abs[i - j] == 1 -> 1}, {500, 500}];     Hkin = 1/(dx)^2 s;     Hsw = Hkin + Vsw;      In simple English this means I have two matrices:   * one that is allmost diagonal with constant values   * another that is diagonal with a constant value, but only for a some region of definition of `x[n]` I think using piecewise is not good here, but I can't seem to find anything else that works. Also, I'm not sure if my use of `n` is OK here.
