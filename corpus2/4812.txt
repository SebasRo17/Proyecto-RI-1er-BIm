I would like to add element `a` at the start of a series of lists. For example I have a collection of lists called               LISTS1 = {{1,2,3,4,5,},{2,3,4,5,6},{3,4,5,6,7,},{4,5,6,7,8,}}      Now I want to add a `0` to the beginning of the first list, two `0`s to the second list and so on, to get:               {{0,1,2,3,4,5,},{0,0,2,3,4,5,6},{0,0,0,3,4,5,6,7,},{0,0,0,0,4,5,6,7,8,}}.      I suspect this needs to be done using the `Prepend` command in combination with something to change the numbers of elements to add for each individual list in the collection.
