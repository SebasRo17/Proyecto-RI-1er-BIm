I have been programing for about 11 months. I've learned some things,and evaded some. I know some advanced things and I don't know some basic stuff. I easily get bored with programing when I program in a programing language I know, but it's different when I program in a new language. I like to learn to program and not to make apps, but I'd like that to change. Also, I am not very consinstent. I start one thing and after a few days end with something that has nothing to do with the thing I started. I am also a loner and a shy person, so I try not to ask for help (stuborn?) and as time passes I lose my confidence and patience. When I visit sites that host open- source projects, I want to join some team, but it seems like everyone is using some language/tools I don't even know they existed. Is this lack of confidence or am I still a beginner? And as I said, I try to do stuff alone, which is very often completely demotivating. So can anyone tell me how to feel more confident, how to gain willpower to join some team? If you find this question to be misplaced, don't downvote me, just tell me how to erase it or how to send it to StackExchange.
