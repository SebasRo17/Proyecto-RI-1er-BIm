I have a class diagram that is like this:               < Order > (1) CAN HAVE (M) < products >      But therefore `Order` has the following:               Order_Id     Customer_Id     Order_date_day     Order_date_month     Order_date_yeah      But I do not know how it would handle the Products? Because, I couldn't have `ProductID` because that would mean that each item in this class would have to have a separate instance for each product (E.g. someone ordered 100 products, but only placed 1 order). Could I have an `Product` object in class `Order`? If so, how do I represent that in UML?
