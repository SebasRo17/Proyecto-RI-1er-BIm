I'm trying to figure out the right terminology for the different types of software development Right now, the only development term I know is "web development", but I've also done a lot of Java and C# development for desktop applications. Obviously this isn't web development, but I'd like to be able to group these under a single term that is widely known and accepted within the industry. Would the term for applications on the desktop be "desktop development"?
