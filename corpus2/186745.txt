I am working with a trading application (reading data from the exchange) which generates a bucket load of data on a per second basis. We have different "log- levels" but even the minimal log-level generates so much data ! This process of log creation is quite I/O intensive. Since I can write assembly using __asm__ , I was wondering if the operation of writing to the files is coded in assembly, will there be a speedup ? The rest of the code is C++. Also, what are the caveats of doing such a thing ?
