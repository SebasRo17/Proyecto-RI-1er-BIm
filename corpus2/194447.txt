I believe that in an ideal team, members should have different but complementary abilities. But is that true about software development teams? As an example we are a small team of 5. We almost have the same abilities and interests but with different levels of skills. Regarding such situation I think we don't cover our teammates' weaknesses.   * Is there any pattern to follow to manage and improve such team?   * Should I setup a team with different abilities and interests to maximize the performance and productivity? \-- EDIT -- Our current team has a specific lifetime. We work together in a per-project manner. In another word we may change the team arrangement for each project depending on the project and developers situation. Actually we've provided a sort of floating situation. In short, we are a network of developers rather than a fixed-size development team.
