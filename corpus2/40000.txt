I've got a few choices to make as I develop some business websites that will run for the next two to three years. Currently I run ASP.NET 3.5 with Visual Studio 2008. I do my development rather crudely in WebForms because that's what I learned and am most productive with. I don't use Membership or any other frameworks in my projects. I use a simple class that maintains a few session keys for each user based on basic database tables for users and roles. (I have about 3,000 users). So far I've kept the data simple, using ADO.NET against SQL Server and a data access class (Circa 2000, I know) to build my sites. My questions are as follows:   1. Under what conditions would I be better off moving to MVC?   2. Under what conditions would I find LINQ and ORM a better way to go than standard ADO.NET?   3. Would I benefit, in my current state of development, from going from Studio 2008 to Studio 2010?
