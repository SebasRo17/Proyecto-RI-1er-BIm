I wish to plot 2 functions $f$ and $g$ so that the region bounded by $f$ has color $c_f$, the region bounded by $g$ has color $c_g$, and the region bounded by both has color $c_f+c_g$. E.g. $c_f$ is red, $c_g$ is blue, $c_f+c_g$ is magenta. I tried this:               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, -π, +π}, Filling -> {1 -> {Axis, Blue}, 2 -> {Axis, Red}}]      ![bad](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N52i4.png) I found no documentation on how to do additive mixture of colors in a plot. How can I do so?
