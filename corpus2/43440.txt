Suppose I have a set represented by an array of strings, like > set = { "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F" } I would like to create a Manipulate which allows the user to build repartitions of the set. To be clear, I'd like the user to be able to build, for instance, the following repartitions:               repa1 = { {"A", "B", "C"}, {"D", "E", "F"} }      and               repa2 = { { "A" }, { "B", "C" }, { "D", "E", "F" } }      $$ $$ Is this possible? * * * Even better, I would like to be able to use labels for the manipulate command. I mean, let's say the set is > set = { {"A", 26}, {"B", 33}, {"C", 69}, {"D", 2}, {"E", 16} } then the selector should look like part1 : [ A, B, C, D, E ] part2 : [ A, B, C, D, E ] part3 : [ A, B, C, D, E ] and, supposing I choose the following combination, part1 : [ **A** , B, **C** , D, E ] part2 : [ A, **B** , C, **D** , E ] part3 : [ A, B, C, D, **E** ] the result should be > repa = { { {"A", 26}, {"C", 69} }, {{"B", 33}, {"D", 2}}, {{"E", 16}} }
