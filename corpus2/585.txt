I would like to give the built-in function `PlusMinus`, which is undefined by default, the intuitive meaning: considering all possible combinations of $+$ and $-$. For simple expressions, this can be implemented as follows:               PlusMinus[a_,b_] := Flatten[{a+b,a-b}]     a \[PlusMinus] b \[PlusMinus] c      > >     {a+b+c, a-b+c, a+b-c, a-b-c} >   However, there are of course more complicated examples, such as when $\pm$ appears in a function's argument, for example I would like to do the same thing for arbitrary (non-`listable`) functions $f(a\pm b\pm\cdots)$, which should by the same principle yield > >     {f[a+b+...], f[a-b+...], ...} >   To complicate things even further, consider   * $f(a\pm b, c)$   * $a+f(b+c\pm d,e)$   * $\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$   * ... Can this be implemented purely by giving `PlusMinus` the appropriate definitions?
