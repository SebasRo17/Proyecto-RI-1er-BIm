I am new to the cross platform application development. I came across the very similar cross platform frameworks AppMobi and PhoneGap. I want to know   * Is there any differences between apk/ipa created using Appmobi and apk/ipa created using PhoneGap?   * Is there any difference in native features that can be used ?   * What are the advantages of appmobi over phonegap or PhoneGap over Appmobi? Also other differences between these two.
