I killed this after 48 hours, it did not seem to be getting anywhere. In the best of all possible worlds it would spit out n!. If I put the summation in a function it does compute factorials (somewhat inconveniently) Mathematica 10 Linux Fedora 20 64-bit               Simplify[Sum[(1/(n - k)!) (Sum[       Sum[(-1)^(i + j) Binomial[k - 2 j, i] Binomial[k - i - 2 j + 1,           j] (n - i - 2 j)!, {i, 0, k - 3 j}], {j, 0,         k/3}] + (-1)^(k + 1) Sum[        Binomial[k - 2 j, k + 1 - 3 j] (n - k + j - 1)!, {j,          1, (k + 1)/3}]) , {k, 0, n}]]
