I have difficulties in evaluating the following expression: $$\sum_{\small n_1+...+n_{k}=m-k}\; \prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{1}{(n_i+1)(n_i+2)}$$ I have tried the function `RootSum`, but it doesn't work and gives the following warning:               RootSum[Sum[Subscript[n, j], {j, 1, k}] - m + k,                  Product[1/((Subscript[n, i] + 2) (Subscript[n, i] + 1)), {i, 1, k}]]       > "RootSum::pfn - m + k + $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{k} n_j$ is not a pure function". I will really appreciate it if someone could give me some hints. Thanks!
