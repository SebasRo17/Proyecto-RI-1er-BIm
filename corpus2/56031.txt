I use `ListPlot` for showing the results of my numeric computation. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vMyfb.jpg) I make my own ticks, so I never know before hand where the vertical center of my plot will be. I want to put the y-axis in the center (because it's a center of symmetry in my task) of the plot by default. I know about `AxesOrigin`, but it doesn't take `Center` as a value. How can I put the y-axis in the center automatically without caring about ticks? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OOOeu.jpg)
