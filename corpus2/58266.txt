I have simple diffusion equation with point source at `c(0, t) = 1` and initial condition `c(elsewhere, 0) = 0`. How should I apply `DSolve` or `NDSolve` to solve the equation ? I have tried specifying my initial conditions like this:               ic = {c[x > 0, 0] == 0, c[x < 0, 0] == 0, c[0, t] == 1, Derivative[1, 0][c][1, t] == 0}      but it fails. Any suggestions?               Diff = D[c[x, t], t] - D[c[x, t], {x, 2}] == 0;     ic = {c[x > 0, 0] == 0, c[x < 0, 0] == 0, c[0, t] == 1, Derivative[1, 0][c][1,t] == 0};     s1 = NDSolve[{Diff, ic}, {c[x, t]}, {x, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 1}];     Plot3D[c[x, t] /. s1, {x, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 1}]
