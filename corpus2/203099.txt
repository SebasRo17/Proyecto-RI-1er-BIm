Whenever I read a code like this:                 struct node       {               int x : 2;               int p : 4;        }n;      with bit fields involved, I get really confused, as to how they are represented in memory, what is `sizeof(n)` etc., how does it differ with normal members of structures? I tried referring K&R and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field but they little to remove my confusion. What concepts of bit fields am I failing to grasp?
