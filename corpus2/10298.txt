I have a very large list of numbers like               list={{a1,b1},{a2,b2},...,{ai,bi}}      where a1 ranges between 10^-9 and 10^-5 and bi varies between 0 and 100. I have generated successfully the plots and am now tweaking them with CustomTicks to look a bit better. But I'm not able to get the XX axis as I want. The YY axis should be linear and the XX axis should be Logarithmic. But the best I could get was this: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rLWha.png) Could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? I've been trying different things for so long and I can't figure this out. Here is my code:               a = {#, Random[Real, {0, 100}]} & /@               Union[     Range[1*^-9, 1*^-8, 1*^-9]                   ~Join~Range[1*^-8, 1*^-7, 1*^-8]                                     ~Join~Range[1*^-7, 1*^-6, 1*^-8]                   ~Join~Range[1*^-6, 1*^-5, 1*^-7]]          ListLogLinearPlot[a, Joined ->True, Axes -> False, FrameLabel -> {{"A", None}, {"B", None}},                 Frame -> {{True, False}, {True, False}}, LabelStyle -> {Bold, 25},                 PlotStyle -> {{Thickness[0.003], Black},                               {Thickness[0.003], Dashing[0.015], Black},                               {Thickness[0.003], Dashing[0.005], Black}},                PlotRange -> {0, 100}, ImageSize -> {800, 600},                 FrameTicks - {{LinTicks[0, 100, 20, 2], None},                               {LogTicks[E, -8, -5], None}},                FrameTicksStyle -> Directive[Thickness[0.01]]]
