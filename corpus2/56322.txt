While answering Change the inner color of markers I came across a behavior that may be a bug.   I would like to know if there is another explanation. First a basic example of normal behavior:               ListLinePlot[{Prime~Array~12, Fibonacci~Array~12},      PlotMarkers -> Graphics[{Brown, Rectangle[]}, ImageSize -> 13],      PlotLegends -> Automatic     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RZv2d.png) Note that the markers are included in the legend. But now if I `Rotate` the `Rectangle`:               ListLinePlot[{Prime~Array~12, Fibonacci~Array~12},      PlotMarkers -> Graphics[{Brown, Rectangle[] ~Rotate~ (Pi/4)}, ImageSize -> 13],      PlotLegends -> Automatic     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sEarW.png) The markers disappear from the legend. They do appear if I `Rotate` the entire `Graphics`, however the markers are not scaled as before and they clip:               ListLinePlot[{Prime~Array~12, Fibonacci~Array~12},      PlotMarkers -> Graphics[{Brown, Rectangle[]}, ImageSize -> 13] ~Rotate~ (Pi/4),      PlotLegends -> Automatic     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D8Yxl.png)   1. Is use of `Rotate` in plot markers simply unsupported or is this a bug?   2. Is there a way to use rotated primitives for markers and not break the legend?
