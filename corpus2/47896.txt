I am using this code:               L = {1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5};     R = {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10};     Y[a_, b_] = Exp[-b/a]/a;     ris = Table[{L[[i]], R[[j]],         NIntegrate[Y[Abs[x - 7.6], L[[i]]], {x, 0, R[[j]]}]}, {i,         Length[L]}, {j, Length[R]}]       to build a 3D table: the result of the numerical integration as a function of two parameters (L;R). Now I need to plot this with a scatter plot: the integral as a function of R, for different values of L, so, on the same plot, I need a different curve, one for each value of L. Doing:               A = ris[[1, All]]     B = A[[All, 3]]      I have the integral for L=1.5, with `A = ris[[2, All]]`, in B I have the integral for L=2, and so on: in this way I built 5 different list, and plotted them on the same graphic. How can I make this last part "automatic" and smarter? I tried a `Do` loop, but I cannot make the different curves on the same plot.
