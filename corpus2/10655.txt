In[32]:= SQLConnections[]          Out[32]= {SQLConnection["db", 1, "Closed", "<>"],       SQLConnection["db", 2, "Closed", "<>"],       SQLConnection["db", 3, "Open", "Catalog" -> "db",        "ReadOnly" -> True]}          In[33]:= Cases[SQLConnections[], SQLConnection[__, "Open", __]]          Out[33]= {}      doesn't work. Why it doesn't match the one open connection expression?
