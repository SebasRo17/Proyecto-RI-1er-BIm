In my current developement, I have decided to keep the command prompt open so I can see debug messages. For example, if something wasn't happening when it should, I would put a cout statement at every function to determine where the broken link is. Sometimes, I might get hundreds of the same message (like WM_MOUSEMOVE) and I need to determine whether or not the messages are still coming, so I would using a static variable, and increment it, so I might have:               ...     3> WM_MOUSEMOVE processed.     4> WM_MOUSEMOVE processed.     54> WM_CLICK processed.     5> WM_MOUSEMOVE processed.     ...      in my cmd. (Don't ask me why there would be 54 WM_CLICK and 4 WM_MOUSEMOVE) What I would like to know is your opinion. Is this a good approach to debugging? What kind of syntax would you use for consistency? Does a syntax even matter? And would you make any suggestions to how this method could be improved.
