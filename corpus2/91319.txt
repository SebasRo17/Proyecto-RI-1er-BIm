I found many things when searching, but nothing that seemed both updated and complete. In last quarter of 2010 I remember reading what were very sad news for me, as WebSockets were disabled in most (if not all? can't remember) modern browsers that supported it by default due to security concerns in the proxy protocol the WSP uses. I wonder what's the current state of the issue and if there's any known plans from the next version of browsers to start enabling WS by default. I know that in Chrome 13b I get it enabled and I don't think I enabled it myself, but the same does not happen in the other browsers I use. Also, what draft is being used in the current versions? I will be giving a presentation on HTML5 for a group of developers next month and this is the topic I think I'm the least updated on. I need to implement current protocol to at least feel certain I know what I'm talking about and have no problem answering questions :) As many technical and specific details as possible will be greatly appreciated.
