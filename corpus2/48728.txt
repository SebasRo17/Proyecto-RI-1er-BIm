I am trying to plot a graph.               Subscript[R, 0] = 1.2;      Subscript[A, Pb] = 208 ;      Subscript[A, Ca] = 40;      Subscript[A, O] = 16;      Subscript[ρ, 0] = 0.138;     R[A_] := Subscript[R, 0]*(A^(1/3))     ρ[r_, R_, a_] := Subscript[ρ, 0]/(1 + Exp[(r - R)/a])      I cannot save the following plot with its legend.               a = 0.5;     Plot[{       ρ[r, R[Subscript[A, Pb]], a],        ρ[r, R[Subscript[A, Ca]], a],        ρ[r, R[Subscript[A, O]], a]},        {r, 0, 10},        Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {"r (fm)", "ρ(r) nucleons/fm\.b3"},        PlotLegends -> Placed[{"Pb", "Ca", "O"}, Right]]      I cannot select both the plot and legends to save them. How can I deal with this?
