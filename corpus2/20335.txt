I've worked on three successful projects (freelanced) throughout my highschool career; however, they primarily involve web technologies. I know that I'm proficient in setting up LAMP stacks, working with PHP, databases, and designing with strict markup, version control, usability testing, and all that fun stuff but since I began programming, I've seen an evident gap between the complexity from hash maps to binary search trees (Java is the ultimate PL for learning no matter its condition in the industry). Although I'm attempting to pursue some multifarious career in software design, is it really necessary to push for a University education (Berkley or Stanford ideally in CS) before I fully commit myself to programming? Are three successful projects regarding web design, web development, and video streaming (and all concomitant technologies) enough to be regarded as "experienced"? Could that experience get me hired? Ultimately, when is there enough experience such that University degrees become irrelevant?
