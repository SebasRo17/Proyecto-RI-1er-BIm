> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Applying And to lists of Booleans I have two lists filled with logicals:               demondata = {True, True, False, True}     numerdata = {True, False, True, True}      I would like to find which corresponding cells positions are both `True`. The only code I could come up with is:               toInclude = MapThread[And, {demondata, numerdata}];      Is there a way to do something like:               demondata && numerdata      Not that there is something wrong with `MapThread`, it just seems more complicated than I thought it would be. In MATLAB, I can do:               list1 & list2  _or_  list1 > 10   etc ...
