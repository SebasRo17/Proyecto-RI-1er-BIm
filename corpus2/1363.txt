Just wondering if anyone knows the proper Syntax to change the Text properties in the BarChart's ChartLegend. I cannot seem to figure out how to get Style[] to apply. Here is an example:               BarChart[{1, 2, 3}, ChartStyle -> "Pastel",       ChartLegends -> Placed[{"John", "Mary", "Bob"}, Bottom]]          BarChart[{1, 2, 3}, ChartStyle -> "Pastel",       ChartLegends -> Placed[Style[{"John", "Mary", "Bob"},       FontFamily->"Courier"], Bottom]]      Any help would be greatly appreciated. t.
