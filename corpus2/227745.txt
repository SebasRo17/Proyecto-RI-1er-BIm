I need some ideas on how to protect a private API key in an application, specifically in a c# .NET application. Firstly, I understand that it is theoretically impossible to hide anything in the source code, so I came up with another idea, but I'm not sure how plausible it is. Anyway, would it be possible to somehow communicate with a web server to verify the private key and then talk back to the application to confirm that it is a legitimate handshake? I'm have two keys to work with: a public key (as the name suggests, it doesn't have to be treated with the same care as the private), and a private key, which needs to be kept secure from others. Any ideas on how I could do this would be greatly appreciated.
