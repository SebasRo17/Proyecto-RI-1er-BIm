Maybe this is a hard question, maybe not. Whoever knows the answer can help me a lot starting working on CA theory. Let's suppose I have a sequence               a[n_] := Table[f[i, j], {i, -n, n}, {j, -n, n}]      for some known function $f$. And let's make it simple: $f$ takes only the values $0$ and $1$. Is there a way to find a cellular automaton that will create the same table-- that is, to generalize the approach demonstrated by Michael E2 in his answer to the question about how to generate a certain type of nested array? For reference, the code he presented was the following:               Grid[CellularAutomaton[{     670410854876259114171370389518449844628889143930760386943729872789478228151265\     8462491554691453382697921609151728673186802143641955019044568101339107753983,     2, {1, 1}}, {{{0}}, 1}, {{{9}}}] /. 1 -> "*"]
