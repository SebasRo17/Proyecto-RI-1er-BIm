I work for an insurance company and we're getting ready to use a new vendor tool for creating insurance illustrations. The tool has a web service that accepts an ACORD XML message. We want to put a web service in front of the vendor web service to abstract it away, but the complexity of the data model makes it hard. Our first method on the custom web service will probably just pass through an ACORD XML message to the vendor service and return the result. But, I'd like to have methods on our service that are more succinct. I'm not sure if that is possible yet as we're still doing analysis. Is there a way to create simpler data models for ACORD? The ACORD message is a TXLife 111. Edit: We are a mixed shop with .NET and Java, so I need to consider that Java clients might, at some point, be requesting illustrations through our .NET web service.
