I'm pretty familiar with a B Tree, mainly having to keep the databases well fed with electricity, air conditioning, and harddrive space. I associate with a double (doubl[ie,ey]?) linked list. Today, one of the developers at lunch mentioned a R tree. I hopped on Wikipedia and started reading. It sounded an awful like a taller B tree. Unfortunately, not having a deep math background makes it tough to understand what some of my coworkers are talking about. I was hoping if someone could clarify a few differences between a B tree and a R tree. I'll probably end up asking the guys anyways, but there is no guarantee that they will answer my question. More than likely they will start rambling about God knows what. . .
