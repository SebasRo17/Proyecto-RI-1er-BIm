When I write something like this:               (Subscript[x, 0], f(Subscript[x, 0]))       I get some undesirable whitespace after each of the `Subscript[x, 0]`. The whitespace disappears or is at least significantly reduced, if I write e.g. `Subscript[x, i]` instead. This is a screen shot of the problem: ![Screen shot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BGGbU.png) I have looked around the object inspector for a solution, but I haven't found one. It appears to be a font specific problem: If I use `Times` \- the problem goes away, but for most other fonts - it is there (I use `Georgia`). The raw cell looks like this:               Cell[TextData[Cell[BoxData[      FormBox[       RowBox[{"(",         RowBox[{         SubscriptBox["x", "0"], ",",          RowBox[{"f", "(",           SubscriptBox["x", "0"], ")"}]}], ")"}], TraditionalForm]],      FormatType->"TraditionalForm"]], "Text",      CellChangeTimes->{{3.590903299361623*^9, 3.590903306745799*^9}}]
