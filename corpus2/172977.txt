I've been imparting a Java introduction course for several years. Some slides explain how to read from files and keyboard using `BufferedReaders, InputStreams, FileInputStreamReaders` etc. I'm adding slides explaining how to achieve this using newer approaches like `Scanner`. Should I leave out the old `BufferedReaders, InputStreams and FileInputStreamReaders` slides altogether, and teach only the new methods, or should I continue to teach these methods for the sake of completeness ? Will my students benefit from learning how to read from files and keyboard the old way ?
