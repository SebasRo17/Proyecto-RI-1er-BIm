I am wondering why the `Enabled` setting for the first locator (point1) overrides the `Enabled` setting for the second locator (point2). Any ideas?               Manipulate[      Graphics[{ {{Arrow[{{0, 0}, point1}]}}, {{Arrow[{{0, 0},         point2}]}}},       Axes -> True, PlotRange -> {{-4, 8}, {-4, 8}}],     {{point1, {-1, 3}}, {-4, -4}, {8, 8}, {.1, .1}, Locator, Enabled -> False},     {{point2, {5, -2}}, {-3, -3}, {6, 6}, {.1, .1}, Locator, Enabled -> True}]      One of the locators should be enabled; the other should be disabled. However, as the picture shows, they are both disabled. I realize I could work around this by using `LocatorPane`, but I'm curious why this doesn't work for individual locators. Am I overlooking something or is this a bug? ![locators](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UNiPK.png)
