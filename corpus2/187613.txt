I read that Liskov substitution principle is violated if :   1. Pre conditions are strengthened .   2. Post conditions are eased out. But I don't get fully yet how these two points would violate Liskov Substitution principle . Can some one please explain with an example. Specifically how would any one of the above conditions cause a situation where a subclass object can not be substituted for a superclass object ?
