I have microscope videos that have a timestamp overlay to them, and it would be great if I could extract this for each frame to add to my metadata. `TextRecognize` fails to accurately grab the numbers from the image that looks this (scaled by 4): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YCYUO.png) I have tried cropping in different ways, scaling, and several image processing methods (binarize, morphological operations, etc). I also tried prepending text to avoid the issue where `TextRecognize` does not detect the initial digits. I believe this to be a image quality problem. I was wondering if anyone has a recommendation on how to clean this up so `TextRecognize` can detect at least the time in images like this.
