Can anyone offer any tips or experience on developing a test plan for an Agile sprint? Most of the time our team simply creates a "Test Feature X" task and goes about writing ad-hoc test cases. There typically isn't much strategic forethought put into how features will be tested and how we'll communicate the expectations and results to the rest of the development team and our users. Is it common to just write high-level testing tasks without making the actual test cases transparent to the development team? What sort of methodologies have you used when developing a test plan and what does it look like both at the beginning of a sprint and at the end? Any advice or tips on what comprises an effective and transparent test plan as well as a means of developing the test plan would be much appreciated.
