When I'm coming to home after the work, there left about 2-3 hours to work on my own projects. Some good programmers/developers also write books/articles/etc. I'm getting angry of to little time and interested how others can do so much - work in their main job, work on own projects and write articles/books? Do you know some formula or some technique to be able do all the mentioned?
