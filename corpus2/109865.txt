re: Applications Architecture, that is, " _the science and art of ensuring the suite of applications being used by an organization to create the composite application is scalable, reliable, available and manageable._ " When looking at a range of applications in an organisation, I can see various reasons for merging apps together, but sometimes also good reasons for keeping them separate. _In general_ , what are the pros and cons of having fewer big systems versus more smaller systems (bearing in mind that many of the systems will exchange information). I'm thinking things like: fewer, bigger apps means less plumbing between apps, but more smaller apps means more flexibility for individual departments. Is there any literature on this, or has anyone got a list of pros and cons that they've discovered? edit: In my scenario, a lot of the apps might be customisable off-the-shelf ones rather than in-house developed, but feel free to consider more general scenarios.
