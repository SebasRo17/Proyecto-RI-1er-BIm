I'm currently in my second year(Computer Science and Mathematics). In two days I have an interview on campus with Microsoft. I'm a bit nervous, because this will be my first in person interview. I have done reviewed basic things like linked list and binary trees. I am not really sure what kinds of questions I'll be asked. Has anyone been to such interview? If so what's it like? What kinds of questions will I be asked? Any help/suggestions will be much appreciated! Also can someone provide me with a list of things I ought to know for the interview?
