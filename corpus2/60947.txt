I have seen few developers use a tool for designing their application where they simply dragged needed elements (classes, variables, objects) and just did magic work. Then there was a button to generate a code where the design was generated into a C# code after what developer continued to work on software manually. Anyone can give me an idea about what those are called and where I may grab one?
