I'm trying to solve a problem of the form $$ \left|a_{1,0}+a_{1,1} x_1 + a_{1,2}x_2\right| + \left|a_{2,0}+a_{2,1} x_1 + a_{2,2}x_2\right|\to\min, $$ where $a_{i,j}$ are real-valued coefficients and the $x_i$ are integers. In fact, in my real problem, their are more variables and the problem looks like this: $$ \sum_{i=1}^n\left|a_{i,0}+\sum_{j=1}^ma_{i,j}x_j\right|\to\min, $$ Is there an easy way to transform this into an linear integer programming probably suitable for Mathematica? I'm not sure how to deal with the absolute values in the objective functions, and how to convert the problem into matrix form. Thanks. **Edit:** As a concrete example, consider the function               f = (x (-9 + 6 x - 8 x^2 + 3 x^3))/(4 (-3 + 3 x - 3 x^2 + x^3)) + 0.0002 Sin[50 x] + 0.0002 Sin[100 x]      which is known on the grid $0,.01,\ldots,1$. Defining               data=Table[{x,f},{x,0,1,.01}]      the problem is to recover the coefficients of $f$ from $data$, knowing that $f$ is a perturbed rational function with integer coefficients of bounded magnitude. If $f$ was not perturbed then               << FunctionApproximations`     RationalInterpolation[f, {x, 4, 3}, {x, 0, 1}]      could be used recover the coefficients (or a variant that specifies the $x_i$) Does the a priori information that the coefficients are integers allow exact reconstruction of $f$ despite the perturbation?
