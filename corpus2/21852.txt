When I try to solve the non-homogeneous differential equation               DSolve[ y''[x] + y[x] == a Cos[2x] + b Cos[x] + c Cos[2x-3]+ d Cos[2x]^2-         6d Cos[2x]+9d + e Cos[x]^2+ fCos[x] Cos[3x]+h Cos[x]^2 Cos[2x-3] +i cos[x]^4, y[x], x]       I get a solution with squares of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$. I want to remove all the $\sin x$ terms from the solution and want to express the solution in terms of $\cos 2 x$ and $\cos 4x$. So what should be the input that will give the result that I want?
