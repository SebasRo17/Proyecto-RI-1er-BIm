The consensus seems to be that one should follow the convention of the platform they're developing for. See: Underscore or camelcase? Naming conventions: camelCase versus underscore_case? However, PHP doesn't seem to strictly follow any convention internally (no surprises there), even for methods and functions (e.g. `mysqli::set_local_infile_default`, `PDOStatement::debugDumpParams`); however, underscores seem to be dominant in function names. However, what I couldn't find was this: **what's the dominant naming convention for variables in PHP?**
