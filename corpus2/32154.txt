I'm using two web services from the same host: Earth Orientation Center I can get each one to work on a fresh kernel but I cannot get both of them to work during the same instance of the kernel. I think this is a context problem so I have tried loading each one into their own context. **The Code** Instal the service:               Needs["WebServices`"]          InstallService["http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/webservice/server_MATRICE_EOP.php?wsdl"]      Make a call:               year = 2005;     month = 12;     day = 31;     hour = 12;     minute = 34;     seconde = 34;     pm = 1;     ut = 1;     nut = 1;     tides = 1;          wservice =       MATRICEfromDate[      LaDate["theyear" -> year, "themonth" -> month, "theday" -> day,       "thehour" -> hour, "theminute" -> minute, "thesecond" -> seconde,       "thepm" -> pm, "theut" -> ut, "thenut" -> nut,        "thetides" -> tides]]      This works and I get a matrix.               complexType$2200["a11" -> 0.318954, "a12" -> 0.94777,       "a13" -> 0.000580507, "a21" -> -0.94777, "a22" -> 0.318954,       "a23" -> 0.0000409354, "a31" -> -0.000146358, "a32" -> -0.000563244,       "a33" -> 1.]      But now if I install the other web service               InstallService["http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/webservice/server_EOP2.php?wsdl"]      Then make a call:               year = 2005;     month = 12;     day = 31;          wservice =       C04fromDate[       LaDate["theyear" -> year, "themonth" -> month, "theday" -> day]]      It also works!               complexType$3424["MJD" -> 53735, "x" -> 0.053717, "y" -> 0.384245,      "UT1UTC" -> -0.661133, "LOD" -> -1.6*10^-6, "dX" -> 0.000228,      "dY" -> -0.000287, "xerr" -> 0.00014, "yerr" -> 0.000141,      "UT1UTCerr" -> 1.7*10^-6, "LODerr" -> 0.0000135, "dXerr" -> 0.000098,      "dYerr" -> 0.000091]      So what is my problem? When I go back an run the first function `MATRICEfromDate` I get:               SerializeSchemaInstance::children: Invalid children: thehour->12.      I cannot get both of them to work consistently in one kernel session. I think is has to do with the context of the `LaDate` **Edits** I have tried adding `AllowShortContext -> False` as was suggested. However, this did not work but it help open the door to a better understanding of the problem. I have now explicitly added a context:               InstallService["http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/webservice/     server_MATRICE_EOP.php?wsdl", "First`", AllowShortContext -> False]          InstallService["http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/webservice/     server_EOP2.php?wsdl", "Second`", AllowShortContext -> False]      I then call the web service with the following functions (I use the same inputs as above)               wservice =       First`MATRICEfromDate[       First`LaDate["theyear" -> year, "themonth" -> month,        "theday" -> day, "thehour" -> hour, "theminute" -> minute,        "thesecond" -> seconde, "thepm" -> pm, "theut" -> ut,        "thenut" -> nut, "thetides" -> tides]]      and...               wservice =       Second`C04fromDate[       Second`LaDate["theyear" -> year, "themonth" -> month,         "theday" -> day]]      The problem revolves to the context of `LaDate`. Here is a look at the variables in the two contexts:               ?Second`*          C04fromDate dYerr$2982 MJD$2946   themonth$2872 xerr$2967     complexType$2943 dY$2964 thedate$2939 theyear$2867 x$2949         dXerr$2979   LODerr$2976 thedate$2939$2987                           dX$2961  LOD$2958 theday$2877 UT1UTC$2955 y$2952      Notice there is no `LaDate`. Now look at the other context:               ?First`*          a11$2737 a23$2752 LaDate  thehour$2545 thesecond$2555     a12$2740 a31$2755 MATRICEfromDate theminute$2550 thetides$2575     a13$2743 a32$2758 thedate$2730 themonth$2535 theut$2565         a21$2746   a33$2761 thedate$2730$2766 thenut$2570     a22$2749 complexType$2734 theday$2540 thepm$2560        Here you will find the `LaDate`. Some how I need to get a `LaDate` into each context because they are different. Another attempt I have taken the two web servers and placed them in separate packages inside the `Begin["`Private`"];` section and then wrote a wrapper function which I exposed via `usage` and still no luck. I think I'm just going to parse old FORTRAN data files from the USNO
