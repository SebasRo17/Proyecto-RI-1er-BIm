Code first               Graphics[{Thick,       Yellow, Disk[{0, 1}],       Text[Style["abcdeffsgg", 16, Black,          Background -> Transparent], {0.85, 0.65}]       }]      Using Background->Transparent, I expect that the background color of the text is transparent so I thought it should be yellow inside the circle and nothing outside the circle. However, Mathematica does not generate the output in that way. How do I make the text's background inherently transparent?
