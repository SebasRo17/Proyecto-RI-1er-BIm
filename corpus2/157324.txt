I'm implementing a machine learning structure to try and predict fraud on financial systems like banks, etc... This means that there is a lot of different data that can be used to train the model eg. card number, card holder name, amount, country, etc... I'm having trouble deciding which structure is the best for this problem. I have some experience with decision trees but currently I have started to question if a neural network would be better for this kind of problem. Also if any other method would be best please feel free to enlighten me. Which are the pros and cons of each structure and which structure would be the best for this problem? Also I'm not sure about this fact but I think decision trees have a great advantage over neural networks in terms of execution speed. This is important because speed is also a key factor in this project.
