When I'm using C# to write some code and I define an interface using Visual Studio 2010, it always includes a number of "using" statements (as shown in the example)               using System;     using System.Collections.Generic;     using System.Linq;     using System.Text;          namespace TestEngine.TestNameSpace     {         interface ITest1         {             bool testMethod(int xyz);         }     }       I wonder what these are for and if they are really necessary. Can I leave these out? Are they only necessary when I'm using those parts in my interface description?
