I was recently experimenting in _Mathematica_ and was combining graphics and a contour plot and discovered the order of elements in show matters. Why would the order matter here?               Remove[g,c];     g = Graphics [Arrow[{{0,0},{1,1}}],PlotRange->{{-5,5},{-5,5}}];     c = ContourPlot[x^2+y^2,{x,-5,5},{y,-5,5}];     {Show[g,c],Show[c,g]}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vrRt2.gif) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xm3Fj.gif)
