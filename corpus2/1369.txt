according to the documentation at `ref/InitializationCell`, > When you first save a notebook that contains initialization cells, you have > the option to make a parallel auto-generated .m package that contains only > the contents of the initialization cells. The package is by default > automatically updated whenever the initialization cells in the notebook are > changed and saved again. This would be a REALLY NICE feature, because it would give me a beautiful way to document a package in a notebook (instead of just textual code)! To test it out, I took the documentation a bit literally and created a new notebook with a single initialization cell (with the little vertical-hook cell-bracket initialization-cell giveaway highlighted in yellow and circled in red in the screenshot, here: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m3DCh.png) The cell after the initialization cell is supposed to be just a reference to the initialization cell, and, when I evaluate the notebook, voila, there is the expected value. However, when I now save the notebook, I don't get the advertised "option to make a parallel auto-generated .m package." Ok, so I make one manually (Save As.../Save As Type.../Mathematica Package .m), no problem, as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H12EV.png) But, of course, this one is not "automatically updated whenever the initialization cells in the notebook are changed and saved again." Here's the updated notebook: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CH6FQ.png) but the .m file is not automatically updated. I would use this feature daily if I could get it to work. As always, I'll be very grateful for advice, guidance, clues.
