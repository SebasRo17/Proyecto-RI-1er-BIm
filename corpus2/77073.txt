I am a working software engineer in the state of Pennsylvania with ~5 years experience. I have a BS in Computer Engineering, however I feel that I need to obtain either a PE License or IEEE CSDP Certification to solidify my status as a professional. Does anyone have an opinion on this matter? PE License (Computer Engineering) IEEE CSDP Certification
