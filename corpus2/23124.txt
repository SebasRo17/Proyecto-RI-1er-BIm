The common problem in my theretical work is a need to import some experimental data to work with. This means that my notebook depends on some external files which makes it difficult to share it with others and inconvenient when I return to it after time. These data are generally very much smaller than the notebook I get after analysing it. What I wish is to have a way to store the data inside the notebook in collapsable cells in order to have an ability to view the data in tablular form and to re-import the data file manually if I change it. Generally, the data inside of the notebook should look as on the sceenshot: ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IuKM8.png) The output cells are regenerated by pressing Shift + Enter when the data files change. What I need is a way to retrieve the data sets from the output cells in the section `"The data cells"`. Something like this:               dataSet1 = getData["Data set 1"];     dataSet2 = getData["Data set 2"];      where `"Data set 1"` and `"Data set 2"` are the text strings in the `Subsubsection` cells from the section `"The data cells"`. How to achieve this?
