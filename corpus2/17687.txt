NumberForm can be used to print Quantities to a specified precision. For example,               x=Quantity[5.123456789,"Meters"];     5.12346 m     Print[NumberForm[x,{4,2}]]     5.12 m      This does exactly what I want, but it has an undesirable effect for units with exponents. For example,               y=Quantity[5.123456789,"Meters"/"Seconds"^2];     5.12346 m/s^2     Print[NumberForm[y,{4,2}]]     5.12 m/s^2.00      I'd like the precision specification to apply to the quantity, not to the units. Is there a way to do that?
