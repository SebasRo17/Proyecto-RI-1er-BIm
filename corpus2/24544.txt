Mathematica has lots of functions for working with graphs, but this functionality is not yet as mature as the igraph library. It is useful to have access to igraph from Mathematica, both for accessing functionality that Mathematica does not have and for verification. Calling igraph through its C interface is possible, but not convenient. How can we use RLink to call it more conveniently?
