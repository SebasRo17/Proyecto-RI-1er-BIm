I know this is obviously not true for some games, minesweeper, card games, etc. But what about any game involving simulating the real world environment. Obviously these games have some form of a physics engineer powering the graphics. For someone like me who personally did not enjoy physics but loves video games, do I have a chance at ever getting involved in the development cycle of a video game such as this while disliking physics?
