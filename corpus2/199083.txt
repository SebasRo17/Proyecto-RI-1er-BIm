I have a search function on my site and it is taking data from 6 different 3rd party resources. The problem is, it takes too long requesting the data over and over again on the results page. I've read for questions like this on SO about session not being a good choice but for me **'memcache'** is not an option, because the server doesn't have memcached installed and I have no way to install it now. Is there any other approach to do this? Storing in the database seem inappropriate because the data depends on the search terms requested. What I've been thinking is writing a file on the server that would act as a cache for this file but I don't know how I would know when to delete it after.
