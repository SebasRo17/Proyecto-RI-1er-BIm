Currently I work with ColdFusion 9+ and some Java in a Windows environment. Prior to ColdFusion, my background was in Java and JSP. I'm considering a move towards Ruby on Rails, as I think it would be a real challenge, keep things fresh, and provide more job opportunities. In order to get into it, I started to build my personal website in Rails 3.0. But what else can I do to make this transition from what I know now to Ruby and Rails? Are there specific or idiomatic aspects of Ruby or Rails I should keep in mind when switching over from a ColdFusion and Java mindset?
