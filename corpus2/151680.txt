I have been working on this project for more than a year now, and we are close to release, the project manager wants the product to be perfect and working in every single aspect. I like that and I love working under the perfection idea, but it seems he is delaying the launch too much because of compatibility issues, he wants the product to work in every single installation, every single configuration possible, and in most cases, the product just works without issues when it's on the hands of the client. * * * UPDATE : yes the product doesn't work properly when there are conflicts, for example, other products that don't use guidelines nor standards to load libraries (causes double library load which leads to failure), cache is another example and so on..... but we warn the clients about the conflict before purchasing and help them fixing it after purchasing * * * I've tried to explain it by giving some examples on major products, he understands the situation, but can not believe that it is near impossible (if it is not impossible) to do what he wants. Hope it is clarified enough for the community to answer.
