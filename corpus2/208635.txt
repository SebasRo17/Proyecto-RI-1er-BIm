I do PHP Development on WAMP but sometime it don't work properly when I upload the files to a Linux server, its involve a lot of testing and annoying. I am looking for a solution to do PHP Development on Windows but the files will be sync with Linux Server. I do not want to use SFTP/SSH clients like WinSCP to view or edit files. I was told to look at vagrant, is there any other solution?
