How to make a function that splits list elements by odd and even positions? Shortest implementation wins. I myself came up with:               splitOdds[x_] :=       Extract[x, {#}\[Transpose]] & /@ GatherBy[Range@Length@x, OddQ]      And:               splitOdds[x_] := Flatten[Partition[#, 1, 2]] & /@ {x, Rest@x}          splitOdds[{a, b, c, d, e, f}]     (*{{a, c, e}, {b, d, f}}*)
