I hear a lot that you should not write functions larger than one screen size, that you should extract things into functions if you call things very often and all these coding guidelines. One of them is also keep your indentation level low. Some people told me even I should max indent 4 times. But in every day programming it keeps happening that I need O(n^2) or O(n^3) loops with some flow control, which creates out of nowhere 7 or 8 layers of indentation... Are there any good ways to avoid that? One problem is, if you try to avoid complex if/else statement nesting I tend to do this in one row which can look very terrible and be unreadable and not very easy to maintain.
