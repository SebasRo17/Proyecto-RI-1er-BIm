I have a 2D dataset like this one: `{{x1,y1}, {x2,y2},...}` I need to smooth/histogram the data in such a way that binning is over the x-coordinate, while counting/height is over the y-coordinate. Let me explain. Given the following input, bin-width=0.2 and height-function=Mean[].               data = {{0.1,1.0}, {0.2,2.0}, {0.3,3.0}, {0.35,3.5}, {0.4,4.0}, {0.5,5.0}};      The output would be:               {(1 + 2)/2, (3 + 3.5 + 4)/3, 5/1}      The average of y-values from the first two data points goes into the first bin, the following three points form the second bin etc...
