I am using the general form of a second-degree plane curve: $$Ax^2+2Bxy + Cy^2+2Dx + 2Ey + F = 0$$ I want to randomly generate plane curves of this form, so I am using `RandomReal[{-1,1},6]` to   generate the coefficients. I made the above equation into a function:               SecondDegreeCurve[{a_, b_, c_, d_, e_, f_}, x_, y_] :=         a x^2 + 2 b x y + c y^2 + 2 d x + 2 e y + f == 0      However, when I try to plug the composition               ContourPlot[      SecondDegreeCurve[RandomReal[{5}, 6], x, y],       {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]      into `ContourPlot`, the image comes back blank. When I run `SecondDegreeCurve[RandomReal[{5}, 6], x, y]`, I get something like the following output:               1.4557 + 5.20582 x + 1.29609 x^2 + 9.37565 y + 6.73248 x y + 1.84528 y^2 == 0      and when I plug this into `ContourPlot`, the curve is displayed. My question is, what is it about the initial composed expression that doesn't display the curve?
