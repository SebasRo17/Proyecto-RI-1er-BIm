I see more and more articles about logging in JSON. You can also find one on NodeJS blog. Why does everyone like it so much? I can only see more operations getting involved:   * A couple new objects being created.   * Stringifying objects, which either involves calculating string length or multiple string allocations.   * GCing all the crap that was created. Is there any test on performance when using JSON logging and regular string logging? Do people use JSON (for logging) in enterprise projects?
