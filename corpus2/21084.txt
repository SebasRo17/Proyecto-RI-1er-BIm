I'm an Object Oriented Programming fanatic. I have always believed in modelling solutions in terms of objects. It is something that comes to me naturally. I work with a services start up that essentially works on application development using OOP languages. So I tend to test understanding of OOP in the candidate being interviewed. To my shock, I found very very few developers who really understood OOP. Most candidates brainlessly spit out definitions they mugged up from some academic book on object oriented programming but they don't know squat about what they are saying. Needless to say I reject these candidates. However, over the course of time, I ended up rejecting almost 98% of the candidates. Now this gets me thinking if I'm being over critical about their OOP skills. I still believe OOP is fundamental and every programmer MUST GET it. Language knowledge and experience is secondary. Do you think I'm being over critical or do I just get to interview bad programmers unfortunately? **EDIT:** I usually interview programmers with 2 to 5 years of experience. The position that I usually interview for is Ruby/Ruby on Rails application developer.
