Our business is considering writing a line of business application for tablets to enable road warriors and executives access our data. This will be primarily used for dashboards, reports and some form filling input: quite typical scenario. Our other apps being built in .Net (WinForms) with lots of related class libraries DLLs (for data access layer, business logic, etc), it seems natural to want to use Windows 8 for this. I am a rather put off by Windows RT as it doesn't implement the whole .Net Framework and seems quite limitating, so we are rather considering the Windows 8 Pro tablets than WinRT ones. However, we want a smooth and pleasant tablet experience and I don't think WinForms would be great for this as not built for touch support. My question is would WPF be good for this? I see there are UI vendors selling touch controls kits but I wonder whether the "touch" experience in WPF is equivalent to the one found WinRT/Metro apps? Probably this could be answered by playing around with the tablet but I unfortunately do not have one at the moment and can't get the budget to buy one until I have settled this.
