I, like others before me, am struggling with `FindFit`. So, I tried a simple example.               data2 = Table[{x, x^2}, {x, -2, 2, 0.1}]          ListPlot[data2]          FindFit[data2, a x^d, {a, d}, x]      Which then produces the error: > >     "FindFit::nrjnum: The Jacobian is not a matrix of real numbers at {a,d} > = {1.,1.}" >   The plot looks good, but the error message doesn't mean anything to me. Where the bottom of the range of `x` is greater than zero, FindFit `enter code here`works okay, and gives the right result. When the bottom of the range is zero or less, the error message comes back. Two questions please. What does the error message mean, and how can I avoid running into it?
