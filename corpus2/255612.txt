Scenario: Two virtual machines produce logs. I want these logs to be sent to a central server for processing (as soon as a line of these logs is generated-->streaming ). The condition here is that I want the server to know from which virtual machine the log line came from. In the server, we should observe a file containing something like: action 1 happended in VM1 action 2 happended in VM1 action 1 happended in VM2 action 3 happended in VM1 action 2 happended in VM2 Question: How can such a thing be implemented in an efficient way? How can streaming to a central server be done? I hope the question is clear..
