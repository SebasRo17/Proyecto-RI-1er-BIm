I want to add 1 to all second elements but I am running into a "level" problem I believe here is my code:               list2 = {{{5, 1}}, {{2, 1}, {3, 1}}, {{7, 1}}, {{2, 3}}}          r1pow = Map[(# + {{0, 1}}) &, list2]      the result I got is:               {{{5, 2}}, {{0, 1}} + {{2, 1}, {3, 1}}, {{7, 2}}, {{2, 4}}}      my desired result is:               {{{5, 2}}, {{2, 2}, {3, 2}}, {{7, 2}}, {{2, 4}}}      as you can see it is giving a problem for my second element {{2, 1}, {3, 1}}, how can i fix this problem?
