I found this question and accepted answer on StackOverflow. It's related to the slow JSON parser in the standard Scala library. The consensus as it were, is that the build-in JSON library is slow, and, in the words of DMC: "it's like that, and that's the way it is" Maybe I'm just being naive here, but that sounds like a bad approach to grow the language. Shouldn't the _built-in_ libraries be perfect? They don't have to be everything for everyone, and I accept that Scala is extendable. But, if there is a built-in library, then surely it should be rock solid and as fast as the language have to offer. I'm lodging a complaint with Star Command ;-) Does anyone know where or how a normal guy like me can voice my opinion on this, i.e. where we can go to help shape the Scala language? Update: This question was not intended in any negative way. Scala, it's creators and the Scala community is choc-full off goodness. I was simply surprised to see that something like the built-in JSON parser was far from optimal (according to the question in the link provided)
