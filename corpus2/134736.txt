Concurrent programming in Python is very colorful (and confusing too). There's just too many options with each having it's pros and cons...   * Thread based (`threading` module)   * Process based ( `multiprocessing` module)   * Co-routines (`greenlet`, `gevent`, `eventlet`)   * Async (`Twisted`, `Tornado`)   * Inter-process communication (`subprocess` module)   * Message queue based (`Ã˜MQ`, `PyCom`, `mpi4py`)   * Others (`Pyro`, `execnet`, `Parallel Python`) I know some of these and can write programs using them. But, I just don't feel I know them pretty well -- I can't decide what to use when. I don't know how to put these into perspective. So, my simple question is -- what are some open source projects that employ these techniques so that I can see them in action in real program.
