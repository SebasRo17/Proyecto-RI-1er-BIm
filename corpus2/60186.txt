I have a question to ask and maybe some of you will think it's lame, but I hope someone will get me on the right track. So I've been programming for quite some time now. I started programming when I was about 13 or so on Delphi, but when I was about 17 or so I switched to C# and now I really like to program with it, mostly because it's syntax is very appealing to me, plus managed code is very good. So it all was good and fun but then I had some job openings that I of course took, but the problem with them is that they all are about web programming. And I had to learn PHP and MVC fundamentals. And I somewhat did while building applications using CI and Kohana framework. But I want to build websites using ASP.NET because I like C# much, much more than PHP. **TL;DR** I want to know ASP.NET MVC but I don't know where to start. What I want to start with is build some simple like CMS. But I don't know where to start. Do I use same logic as PHP? What do I use for DB connections? And also, if I plan to host something that is build with ASP.NET MVC3 on a hosting provider do I need to buy some kind of license?
