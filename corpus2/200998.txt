This probably been asked for but I can't google "How to make a compiler in C++" because I will just get "How to compile C++" as the results. Anyway, for my question, I'd like to make a simple programming language in C++. Now I understand basic file IO stuff but what I don't get is how to build a EXE. The problem here is I don't know how EXEs exactly are "planned out", granted that most people don't. I was going to simply parse the language into assembly and assemble it using an assembler. But I don't want to do that, I want to actually compile it directly into a EXE. Does anyone know how this would be done? PS: To all you people who say making a compiler is virtually impossible, it's a fairly fast process, it's just implementing OOP features that's hard
