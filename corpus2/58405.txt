I'm considering doing some contract work on the side of my normal job. I know that it will kill my free time, but I figure I can control when I'm doing projects and then get a little extra money or even eventually make it my full time job. But as I've never done this before, I'm wondering what issues people face to do this kind of work. For instance: how do you find customers? What difficulties do you normally face on a project? How do you deal with projects that are too large for one programmer to effectively complete? What about projects that need other skill sets (for instance web design for a web app?)
