This question was inspired by Vladimir Reshetnikov's question (How to find a recurrence relation for a sequence?): Given a finite sequence of numbers, how can we find in MMA a recurrence relation obeyed by this sequence? To be more specific, assume that the numbers are rationals and the recurrence relation is of a simple type, say linear. This problem is similar to FindFit for the function "behind" the sequence but now we are interested in a recurrence relation of a given form containing some Parameters. Also there is a similarity to DifferenceRootReduce where MMA tries to find the recurrence relation for a given formula for the elements of a sequence. Now the formula is replaced by the numerical sequence. As an Option we would specify a class of recurrence relation, e.g. linear. Let's consider the example of Vladimir, and take this sequnce               seq = Table[{n, -2^-n (2^(1 + n) LerchPhi[2, 2, 1 + n] - PolyLog[2, 2])}, {n, 1, 20}] // Simplify      $\left\\{\\{1,1\\},\left\\{2,\frac{3}{4}\right\\},\left\\{3,\frac{35}{72}\right\\},\left\\{4,\frac{11}{36}\right\\},\left\\{5,\frac{347}{1800}\right\\},\left\\{6,\frac{149}{1200}\right\\},\left\\{7,\frac{9701}{117600}\right\\},\left\\{8,\frac{209}{3675}\right\\},\left\\{9,\frac{8093}{198450}\right\\},\left\\{10,\frac{6031}{198450}\right\\},\left\\{11,\frac{1126651}{48024900}\right\\},\left\\{12,\frac{3587327}{192099600}\right\\},\left\\{13,\frac{990457463}{64929664800}\right\\},\left\\{14,\frac{1653005063}{129859329600}\right\\},\left\\{15,\frac{561462043}{51943731840}\right\\},\left\\{16,\frac{3778408}{405810405}\right\\},\left\\{17,\frac{951790361}{117279207045}\right\\},\left\\{18,\frac{1117157389}{156372276060}\right\\},\left\\{19,\frac{716038369549}{112900783315320}\right\\},\left\\{20,\frac{1600677857657}{282251958288300}\right\\}\right\\}$ Now let make an "educated guess" and assume a recurrence relation of the form $f(n) = a f(n-1) + \frac{b}{n^2}$ How do we determine the two parameters $a$ and $b$? (In this example the solution is well known: $a = \frac{1}{2}$, $b=1$) I tried to first RSolve the recurrence relation and then use FindFit to determine the parameters. It didn't work, too many error message and no result. Can you do better?
