Given a (intersecting) polygon, I'd like find out which tiles are being covered by the polygon. **Example** : ![example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xpNvv.png) **Details** :   * Tiles are square, 1 unit wide/high   * The grid begins in (0,0)   * The corners of the polygon can have floating point coordinates (i.e. 3.433, 5.234)   * In general, an edge of the polygon might be as long as 1000 - 10000 tiles I tried to iterate over all tiles and check whether they are in the polygon, however as I have to iterate over 10000Â² tiles it takes a quite a long time. I'm interested in a solution which allows me to quickly answer "Is tile (x,y) covered by the polygon?" without recomputing everything from scratch for each question. Any solution/approach/pseudo-code/hint which leads me to a correct solution will be accepted.
