Statistical model analysis package has a few fitting functions. Their arguments are data points, fitting model and parameters in the fit. The result is a set of best values for parameters, which represent the `"BestFit"` to the data. However, one can also specify the `ConfidenceLevel` and obtain `"ConfidenceInterval"` for every parameter, or the total `"ParameterConfidenceRegion"` for all parameters. This region will be an **_n_** -dimensional ellipsoid, for the fit with **_n_** parameters. If you are not interested in one of parameters you could marginalize it, e.g. integrate the likelihood function over all values of that parameter, ending up with **_n-1_** parameters. If you could do this for all but one parameter you would reach to the same `"ConfidenceInterval"` that Mathematica has calculated for that parameter. But if one could do this for only **_p_** parameters, one would end up with **_n-p_** parameters and the `"ParameterConfidenceRegion"` would be **_n-p_** dimensional ellipsoid. Marginalization in terms of `"CovarianceMatrix"` is very simple - remove row and column that correspond to the parameter you want to marginalize. Now I don't know how to get `"ParameterConfidenceRegion"` from this modified `"CovarianceMatrix"` and I don't know if Mathematica has something for parametric marginalization implemented.
