I am trying to write a program using the _Mathematica_ function `IsotopeData`, but am finding the code troublesome. Due to my (relative) familiarity with Python, I am puzzled as to how _Mathematica_ works, as they are very different. $\require{mhchem}$ What I am trying to do, is to find the elements in a decay chain which end with either $\ce{^{191}_{77}Ir}$ or $\ce{^{193}_{77}Ir}$. In Python syntax, what I'm trying to do would look a bit like this:               #A would be the Atomic Mass and Z the Atomic Number     #DaughterNuclide(Z,A) would return the Daughter Nuclides of the isotope          def IsoCheck(z,a):         try:             x = DaughterNuclide(z,a)             if x in Isotopes:                  return [z,a]             else:                  return [0,0]         except:             return [0,0]          L=[]     Isotopes = [[76,191],[78,191]]     for a in xrange(1,295):         for z in xrange(1,119):             if IsoCheck(z,a) != [0,0]:                 L.append(IsoCheck(z,a))          repeat = 1     #Then, repeat until all chains are over     while repeat == 1:          repeat = 0          for x in L:              if IsoCheck(x) != [0,0] #Lets just pretend it isn't a list                  L.append(x)                  repeat = 1      Now, my question is this: what would the equivalent code to perform this task in _Mathematica_ look like?
