I'm fan of onion architecture but looking for some relaxing solutions in some areas. First of all I was thinking about communicating directly from UI (from controller in mvc) to data on the read side. As everyone can see UI should not be referenced to any assembly except Core. When I want to display list of countries on page to select one, that I really need to do this through my Core? I see two solutions:   * UI has reference to NHibernate and talks directly   * add a very thin abstraction layer where I define IFinder<> (only to read data) which will be implemented in infrastructure Thoughts?
