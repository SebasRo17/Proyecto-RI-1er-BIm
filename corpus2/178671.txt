I'm looking for info on creating a remote management interface for our software. This is not anything illicit. Our software is for live TV production and once they go on-air we can't access the PC (usually through LogMeIn). I would like to be able to upload/download files and issue commands to our software. The commands would be software specific like "load this file" or "run this script" or "return this value" etc. A socket connection is preferred but the problem is most of our PCs are behind firewalls and NAT servers. I'm not sure where to start. I think HTTP tunneling is the way to go but am wondering if there are other options or recommendations. Also, assume our clients are not willing to open up ports for security reasons. Thanks.
