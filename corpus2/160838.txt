I have an excel file with many sheets and relations between theme (ie, formulas that relates sheets to each other). I wanna create the user interface for this excel file.in other words I wanna create desktop application that has many tabs and menus and user by selecting tabs or menus,sees corresponding sheet from excel file in the form (in the application interface) and can data entries and see the results in other tabs from other sheets.also I wanna create cool ui for the application. How I can do this? Note: I am using Eclipse-jee-indigo for java and Microsoft visual studio 2010 for C#. Microsoft visual studio has also toolbox to create GUI for C# applications. and also there are many GUI designer like jgoodies as eclipse plugin and dotnetbar for C#.
