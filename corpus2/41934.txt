I want to develop a project on my own (if it is sucessful more people might start working on it too). Also I want to apply some proper software engineering from the first until the last day. On one hand just to try it out and compare results with previous projects that were just about writing code quick and dirty, and on the other hand to learn! I know the proper answer to this question is "It depends very much on the project...", "There is no single correct answer...". But I just need someplace to start, somewhere where every step is written down and tells me what to do. If I'm not happy next time I'll try something else. So, how/where should I start? I would love to hear some book suggestions cause I'm all about books :-D. EDIT: Answering a few of the questions that popped up: **Customer** : There is kind of a customer/friend. No real pressure.   **Version Control** : I have used subversion in the past and want to try mercurial.   **Bug tracking** : I was under the impression that for s single developer a checklist was enough (am I wrong there?)   **Testing** : I want to try Lime (because I use Symfony) and Selenium.   On the whole I will try out a lot of stuff I haven't used before but as I said one of the main points is learning. The Pomodoro Technique keeps popping up wherever I look, so maybe I should have a look at that...
