I am trying to use the Combinatorica package in a Mathematica version 9 in the following code :               graph = {{0, 1, 0, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1,          0, 1}, {1, 0, 0, 1, 0}};         Needs["Combinatorica`"]        ChromaticNumber[AdjacencyGraph[graph]]      The output for this code is               ChromaticNumber[<graph>]      I think Mathematica does not recognize the function ChromaticNumber. The compatibility guide here does not list the function too. How do I use this function ?
