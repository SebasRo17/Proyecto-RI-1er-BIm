I am trying to solve the following nontrivial equation:                   fun[z_] := (Log[Gamma[n]] + n Log[Gamma[z + 1]] + z n Log[n] - Log[Gamma[n (z + 1)]])/n         fun[z] /. n -> 8         m = Table[i, {i, -1, 1, 0.1}]          sols = Table[FindRoot[fun'[z] + 0.5 == m[[i]], {z, 1}], {i, Length[m]}]         sols2 = Table[FindRoot[fun'[z] + 0.5 == m[[i]], {z, sols[[j]]}], {i, Length[m]},              {j,   Length[sols]}]      Basically, I get roots from the equation that are stored in `sols`. However, I also need all values from `sols` as starting values for the next iteration that will be executed in `sols2`. However, this doesn't work and produce the following errors:                   {{FindRoot[\!\(\*SuperscriptBox["fun", "\[Prime]",MultilineFunction->None]\)[z] +0.5 == m[[i]], {z, sols[[j]]}],          FindRoot[\!\(\*SuperscriptBox["fun", "\[Prime]",MultilineFunction->None]\)[z] + 0.5 == m[[i]], {z, sols[[j]]}],          FindRoot[\!\(\*SuperscriptBox["fun", "\[Prime]", MultilineFunction->None]\)[z] + 0.5 == m[[i]], {z, sols[[j]]}],          ....      Any suggestion on how to fix this?
