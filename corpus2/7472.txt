Let's say a large corporation is planning to replace it's existing version control system. Let's say it is only considering systems from major vendors that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars because they have "support." Does version control in an enterprisey environment have to be expensive? Does your medium/large corporation use a FOSS VCS such as SVN/Git/Mercurial? What has the experience been? I have to think it doesn't need to be expensive since there are so many free options, and there are probably companies that provide paid support for FOSS VCS if that is the main concern. I don't intend this question to compare VCS or decide which is best, rather just understand experiences with VCS in a corporate IT environment.
