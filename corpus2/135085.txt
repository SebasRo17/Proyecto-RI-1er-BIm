I am developing an application which is based on the quiz contest for competetive exams. The user can give different categories of tests, which will contain different types of questions of following types:   1. Single select,   2. Multiple select,   3. Match making,   4. Comprehension (the quetion will be a paragraph and on the basis of that there will be questions),   5. Free text (the user will have to type the answer),   6. Range (the user have to select a number from 1 to 10). My concern is that while creating questions from admin site, how can I manage the database for above type of questions? I have one answer column in the question table but there are six type of questions so what should be the convenient way for saving answers in the databse so that when user will give answer, I can easily check if the answer matches? I am thinking of saving the answer in the form of XML tags. Will this be a good approach?
