I'm working on a collaborative group project at university which involves writing a Swing application, an Android application and some Java data models and a JDBC connection. We've been taught to use NetBeans but will need to use Eclipse to write the Android application. I find NetBeans to have nicer GUI builders than Eclipse's Visual Editor plugin and the other group members want to use NetBeans as they are familiar with it. I can already foresee clashes as JFrame forms created in Eclipse won't open the interface builder in NetBeans. Does anyone have advice on using both of these programs together on a group project? At the moment the issues I'm seeing are:   * Lots of meta-files from each IDE (which I'm currently ignoring via .gitignore, is this a good idea?) cluttering the repository and potentially being out of sync with each other.   * The mentioned GUI problem, what does NetBeans look for when looking to show the Design view?   * Different templates being shown. I'm probably just going to stick with NetBeans until we get to the Android part but if there are ways to make them play friendly I'd love to hear them.
