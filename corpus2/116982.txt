I understand the difference between syntax and semantics - **syntax** - how the symbols are combined to form a valid expression or statement.   **semantics** - the meaning of those symbols that form an expression or statement. But what is the grammar? for example: Sometimes I hear people say that some construct is "grammatically incorrect but syntactically it is correct" what does it mean?
