I have a math problem about Mathematica, I am looking help from you. I hope that you could help me. The Math Problem:               list= { {0,0,1},{1,0,0},{0,1,0} ,{1,2,3}};      as you know that list is a List, and the first three elements of the list is list[[1]]、list[[2]]、list[[3]]. but the three elements of list[[1]]、list[[2]]、list[[3]] are all the same, that is 1,0,0. the only difference is their order. So I need a function to deal with the List: The Results must been `p={{0,0,1} ,{1,2,3}}` (also can been p={{1,0,0} ,{1,2,3}},etc). I know two functions can do that: (1)               p = DeleteDuplicates [ list, Sort[#1] == Sort[#2] & ];      (2)               p = Union[list,  SameTest -> (SameQ[Sort[#1], Sort[#2]] &) ]      when List has 100,000 elements (Length[list]=100,000) , the speeds of these two functions are too slow(It takes me a day, but has no results). eg               list={};     For[i=1,i<=100000,i++,     list=Append[list,{0,0,Random[Integer,{1,5}]}]     ];     p = DeleteDuplicates [ list, Sort[#1] == Sort[#2] & ];      Could you help me or give some suggestions ?
