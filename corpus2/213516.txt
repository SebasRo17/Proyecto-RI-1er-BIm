I'm playing with `pluralize` at the command line, and it's beginning to scare me. Multiples of _leaf_ is _leafs_ (not _leaves_ ) Multiples of _cactus_ is _cactus_ \- not _cacti_ , or even _cactuses_. _Radius_ becomes _radius_ instead of _radii_ Yet it correctly gets _women_ , _octopi_ , _knives_ , and _errata_ (the finer things in life). As I understand it, ActiveRecord uses the same pluralize method that I'm using. And from my tests, it seems that if made enough tables without thinking, you would eventually run into a problem where you couldn't locate the proper table because you were expecting the plural to be different. Is the conventional recommendation to just test all plurals in the command line, and make a note of what the table will be called? Or do most developers just label something as `uncountable` when it gets fuzzy? Side note- no `ActiveRecord` tag??
