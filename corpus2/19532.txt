I tried to construct a small sheet with text and equations presented in a convenient publishing form, using Column:               Column[{        Row[{"An integral:"}],        Row[{Integrate[f[x], x]}]     }] // TraditionalForm      But every time the integral sign appears in one of expressions inside the Column, Mathematica reduces its size in the output. In this particular case the output looks like ![Integral sign size is reduced in Column](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QVoY5.png) Without the Column (or Grid, which seems to have the same effect) wrapper, the integral sign looks convenient:               Row[{Integrate[f[x], x]}] // TraditionalForm      ![The integral sign has the appropriate size when it does not appear as the content of Column or Grid](http://i.stack.imgur.com/K5kXX.png) I tried to add `Pane` wrapper to the `Column` contents, and played with `ItemSize` option too, with no effect. Actually, I can't even figure out what exactly happens within the Column (or Grid) function that reduces the `\[Integral]` size. So, the question is: what causes the shrinking in Column and Grid, and is there a way to control it? I was thinking of using `GraphicsGrid` instead, but it seems look more like a hack than a proper solutionâ€”if it would help at all. Notes:   1. You can notice the same effect in a Standard Form too, it is just more clear in the Traditional output.   2. I'm using Mathematica 8 on Windows 7 Basic.
