I want create file with some text (and numbers). This is my code.               str=OpenWrite["f:\\1.txt",PageWidth->Infinity, FormatType->StandardForm,NumberMarks->True];     Write[str, "a = ", 0.123456789];     Close[str]      The problem is there is rounded number (0.123457) in the output file. but I actually want file with text               a = 0.123456789      **Explaining** : I want parse a test suite files (*.mt) with data for check. Rows looks like               dataAcc = {{1.865987700, 1.920469000, 1.811506300, ...},...}     Get[childTestLocation<>"nameOfChildTest.mt"]      I have a numbers for dataAcc list. But when i create testfile numbers becomes rounded.
