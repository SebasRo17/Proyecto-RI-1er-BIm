Assume we have a few projects, _each_ containing some web resources (e.g., html pages).               parent.pom      +- web           (war)      +- web-plugin-1  (jar)      +- web-plugin-2  (jar)      ...      Let's say `web` is the deployable `war` project which depends on the known, but selectable, set of plugins. What is a good way to setup this using `Spring` and `maven`?   1. Let the plugins be `war` projects and use mavens **poor** support for importing other `war` projects   2. Put all web-resource for all plugins in the `web` project   3. Add all web-resources to the classpath of all `jar` `web-plugin-*` dependencie and let spring read files from respective classpath?   4. Other? I've previously come from using `#1`, but the `copy-paste` semantics of `war` dependencies in maven is horrible.
