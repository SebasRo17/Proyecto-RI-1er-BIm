I want to make an extensive use of tags and it would add some clarity if CellGroups could display a tag if all of the cells it has have it. Once the cell group is tagged, the individual cells wouldn't need to display their common cell tag. Why do I need it? I'm trying to make a selective notebook embedding function that inserts cells from a notebook x with cell tag y. Is it doable or should I consider using some other mechanism?
