I'm working on a rails application, and so far I've focused on the api and the functionality. But now I'm more and more reaching a point where I will want to add static content, descriptions of the software and help information. Information that is generally in a CMS system. How do I in the best way structure this so I can still work with the application. Yet maintaining the look and feel of the rails application? Do write a CMS in my app? That seems a bit far fetched. Are there any Gems that do this? What is the de facto standard for architecting this scenario?
