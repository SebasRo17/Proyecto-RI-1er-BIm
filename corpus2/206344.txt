We have a Javascript codebase that we want to open-source in an incremental fashion. That is, we want to release the full code to some of our core modules first, keeping the rest of the "application" code in minified format. Eventually, we will also release the whole application code in full (although that may take a few months to happen). We have determined that the GPL (v3) is the best license for our software project. However, we're concerned that it cannot be used in the way that I've described. Specifically, since our application code depends on the aforementioned core modules to function, it would become bound by the GPL the moment these modules are released under the GPL. If I understand correctly, this means that we would have to release a non-minified version of the application code from day one. Is my understanding correct? And if so, is there a "next best" license that we could use for our core modules, which would provide us with similar protection against non-free derivatives, without the requirement that we release the whole application code in full from the start?
