I have a sequence diagram for the following operation. The Activity class uses method present in ActivityBL class. The method is: GetActivities(ActivitySearch objt) The result message is a collection of Activity objects. (Colletion in C#). How do we represent the return message in the sequence diagram? At present, I am listing it as message containing only one Activity object. How to represent it as a collection? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Sja7.gif)
