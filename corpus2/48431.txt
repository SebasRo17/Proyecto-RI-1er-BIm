Say a have the function `foo`:               foo[x_] := x + 2      Like the `Evalution` `->` `Evaluate in place`, I would like to have a keyboard shortcut that replaces the current selection with the result of applying `foo` to the selection. For example if I have selected `1+3` in a cell with the following contents:               2*1+3-5      By pressing a keyboard combination, I want Mathematica to replace it with the result of `foo[1+3]` (`6`):               2*6-5
