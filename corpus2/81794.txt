I'm about to begin a big PHP project with a friend. It's my first time using PHP and I've been wondering wether I should try developing on Linux since it's so popular.   I've had some past experience with Linux and the choice of an editor won't be hard since I know vim (though I've looked at VS.PHP and it's putting me back from the change).   Does using Linux when developing PHP (or any web language) give me an advantage?
