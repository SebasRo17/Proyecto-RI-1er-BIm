I am working on a web application implemented in C#, that follows MVC conventions. This application contains a page that allows me to create or update a Wingding. The view passes a complete Wingding Model back to the controller for me to create or update. The problem is that the page also has a checkbox that allows me to create identical Wingdings for _all_ users. The current code adds a variable to the _Winding Model_ to capture that data, so it can be passed back from the view. It seems obvious to me that the page should have a _Wingding Page Form_ object that is passed back from the view to the controller, instead of adding extra variables to the Model that won't get saved to the DB. I know that this counts as separation of concerns, but is there a more specific design pattern that describes the separation of a From from a Model?
