I am a lead developer in a larger software projects. From time to time its getting hard to handle the complexity within this project. E. g.   * Have the whole big picture in mind all the time   * Keeping track of the teammates work results   * Doing Code Reviews   * Supply management with information etc. Are there best practices/ time management techniques to handle these tasks? Are there any tools to support you having an overview?
