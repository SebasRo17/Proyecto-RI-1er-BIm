I have the following code:               Subscript[f, i_][x_] := Block[{a},       Subscript[a, i] = 3 x;       Subscript[a, 1]     ]      If I evaluate for example `Subscript[f,1][2]`, it evaluates to `6`. After that asking what `Subscript[a,1]` is also gives me six. However, I want `a` to be a local variable. My question: how can I define a local variable while using indices...? **Note** : the original post mentioned that evaluating `Subscript[f,1][2] = 6` would lead to the described behaviour, which just isn't true. A reasonable guess is that this was ment to mean that `Subscript[f,1][2]` was to be evaluated and it would evaluate to `6` (which it does). After that `Subscript[a,1]` will evaluate to `6` as reported.
