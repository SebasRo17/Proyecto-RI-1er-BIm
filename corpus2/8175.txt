I want to visually illustrate substitution in a mathematical expression. This is an example:               Graphics[Text[       Style[3 x^2 + 2 (1 + y) // TraditionalForm, FontFamily -> "Arial",         24], {0, 0}], PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-.2, .2}}]      I would like to replace the `y` by `15`, then replace `1 + 15` by `16`, each time moving the characters in the text box to have proper typographical spacing. (Eventually I want to make the parentheses vanish as well, but never mind that now.) What I want to do is manipulate the spacing by operating on the text box, not by evaluating `3x^3 +2(1+15)`. This would seem to require accessing the location in the text box of each character. I can't find anything in the documentation that shows how to do this. If you use `ToBoxes` on something generated by `TreeForm` you CAN see the locations of the nodes (although they are buried in a big mess of detail), but `ToBoxes` doesn't do that in the case of formulas as text.
