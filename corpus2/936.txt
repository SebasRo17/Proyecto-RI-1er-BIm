I noticed that TraditionalForm does not display as nice in the Manipulate output as in normal notebook. Is there a way to make it look the same? Here is an example,               Manipulate[     TraditionalForm[-Derivative[2, 0][u][x, y]-Derivative[0, 2][u][x, y] == f[x, y]],      {z, None}     ]      and compare the output above to the same command, but without the Manipulate wrapper:               TraditionalForm[-Derivative[2, 0][u][x, y]-Derivative[0, 2][u][x, y] == f[x, y]]      Here is the output, side by side. (left side is the Manipulate output). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pdxGl.png) There might be an option to correct this inside Manipulate? Will keep looking. But meanwhile, any one knows why that is? btw, I found that by Rasterizing it, it looks close to the notebook, but need to work on the resolution little:               Manipulate[      Rasterize@       TraditionalForm[-Derivative[2, 0][u][x, y] -           Derivative[0, 2][u][x, y] == f[x, y]],      {z, None}      ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PzMG8.png) thanks
