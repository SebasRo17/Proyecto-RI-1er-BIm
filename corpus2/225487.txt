I have a value between 0 and 8000 and I want this number to resolve to another number between 0 and 2000. I could just divide it by 4 but I have a special need here. For values above 4000 I want the mapped value to be biased towards the 2000. But for values lower than 4000 I want the mapped value to be biased towards 0. This is actually for a game where you are given bonus points between 0 and 2000 depending on how quickly you complete the task. So if you are very fast and do it in 7500 milliseconds you should get 1875 points (exactly 7500 / 4). If you do it in 6000 milliseconds you would get 1450 points (a little under 6000 / 4). If you are slow and do it in 1000 milliseconds you would get 50 milliseconds (well under 1000 / 4). The idea is to reward fast players more than slow players but still let slow players feel like they've achieved something. I feel an "eased-out" value mapping would achieve this. I hope this makes sense. Can you help me figure out some code that achieves this?
