First post. Hope it's not ignorant. I am trying to label several data points so I can label them properly on a `ListLinePlot`. I know I can label plots if I am generating data, but I am dealing with experimental data. The end goal is to be able to graph the points, and have everything labeled properly. I am trying to figure out how not to do this the "dumb" way. Here's what I want to label:               litValues =        {"Literature Values (kcal/mol)",         123.34, 214.97, 191.35, 259.66, 335.15, 314.03, 401.75, 497.27};     plot =        ListLinePlot[{Delete[litValues, 1]},          AxesLabel -> {"Atomic number", "Ionization Energy (kj/mol)"}]      If my tone is wonky, excuse me -- I am very tired.
