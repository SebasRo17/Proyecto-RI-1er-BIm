So, we've got a product, written in Perl. Mind you, it's _good_ Perl, pretty well object-oriented, with a strong functional-programming influence, extensive test suites, and it's an agile environment doing Extreme Programming with elements of Scrum. We also have about 4 open headcount that we're trying to fill sooner rather than later, and we've historically had trouble filling even just one or two. I've been taking a look at the sort of candidates that our existing postings seem to be attracting, and they're not particularly impressive. Most of them have a background in QA automation or something similar. We know that we can take good OO software engineers who know Python or Ruby or even just C++/Java and bring them up to speed quickly enough. We're pretty good at being able to pitch the actual job itself to qualified candidates if we have their ear. What we're not good at, it seems, is attracting these people to our postings in the first place.   * What sort of things can we do to market ourselves to these engineers?   * What sort of things should we be careful to avoid in job postings and the like? (The posting is omitted since I don't want to get in any trouble by doing an end-run around the job-board. Also, our current in-house recruiter isn't helping much.... rumors are his days are numbered and I'm not at all surprised...)
