I would like to use **Mathematica 9** for to acquire data from a _Measurement Computing_ (MC) USB-201 analog to digital (and other) device for classroom demonstration. I do not have a budget to buy _LabView_ and link Mathematica with it to accomplish what I would like to. Within Mathematica I have tried using `Manipulate` to see if I can detect a signal (anything) from this board (excited artificially with a variable 0-5V source). So far, I do not see any changes indicating I am communicating with this equipment. Has anyone done something like this? Do I need a driver, and if so, where do I get it? Clearly, I am **not** a DAQ expert. I need someone to speak slowly and distinctly so I can understand them. Thank you.
