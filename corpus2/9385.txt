My job is roughly a "9-5"ish type programming job (I'm occasionally there later when I need to finish something), and over the weekend I'm not in the office. When I get back to the office on Monday, I typically have to spend a lot of time getting myself back "into the groove" as well as figuring out where I was when I left, especially if I had to leave in the middle of something. Occasionally I will leave myself some written notes on a pad by my desk, but I find that sometimes (like today) it's insufficient. What are some creative ways that you use to remind yourself where you left off? I could use any help I could get because I really would like to reduce the lack of productivity that I suffer on Monday mornings. Thanks!
