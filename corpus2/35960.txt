New Question Version: I've got the opportunity to spend 3 months getting good at something, its going to be either a NoSQL technology like Cassandra or optimising relational database systems. I slightly prefer trying the 'flavour of the month' cassandra but would also love to improve my relational database skills which would be very practical. This isn't about which is better, its about my employment prospects and where I am going to get work. I know there is going to be more work in relational databases, but are we going to see a bump in the level of jobs wanting/requiring NoSQL experience? Thanks guys, I'm really impressed with the amount of advice people have given so far. Old version: I'm half way through my MSc and am thinking about my dissertation which I get 3 months to work on full time. Im very comfortable with the traditional Relational Database, the question is should I work on a project where I get a good understanding of something like Cassandra, or should I really push my RDMS knowledge to the limit. Getting great at something like MySQL is a solid safe option, will there really be much work for me with Cassandra in my tool belt? I would love to do either.... Thanks for your opinions and advice.
