So I'm a relatively junior programmer, been doing it for a couple years now and have been recently working on a redo of the company's website, and have ran into some frustrations and was just wondering if that's the way it goes or if I'm missing something. I am by no means a designer, I focus on the code and don't pay much attention to how pretty it looks, that's someone else's job as far as I'm concerned. That being said, I have been working on getting some things to work and the cross Browser problems have made me hate Web Development. I try to get html5 videos and no go, put in a flash backup and only works on half. Throw a Google api in and it looks like crap in ie and opera. The actual code behind doesn't work in ie7. It just seems like one thing after another. As I said I'm new to Web Development. Is this just the way it is? Throw some basic code in, then take all day/week to make it work everywhere? I've cooled off since my initial frustration but I'm just wondering if this is normal practice or how typical web programming goes, because it seems pretty lousy to be right about now. Thanks!
