Yesterday I asked a question about the **non converging integral**. Woods told me that it is due to the function which has a singularity along a line which passes through the integration region. (Why does this numeric integral fail to converge?) Now the question is that how can I find a correct answer for this integral? Should I eliminate these singularities from the integral bound? How can I understand it is integrable singularity and gives convergent value or not? I read **singularity handling** in documentation center, but I couldn't solve the problem using **Exclusions**.(http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/NIntegrateIntegrationStrategies.html#122144792) function:                Msq2[w1_,         w2_] := (12.8228 + 10.518/(0.948338 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) -           6.69841/(1.72935 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) -           57.4434/(2.01348 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) -           13.4997/(3.45415 - 2.0134 w1 - 2.0134 w2) +           9.50782 (1/(-0.110612 + 2.0134 w1) +              1/(-0.110612 + 2.0134 w2)) -           82.5202 (1/(1.14046 + 2.0134 w1) + 1/(1.14046 + 2.0134 w2)))^2;      The region of the integral:               rpp = RegionPlot[        Re[r2] < mphy - w1 - w2 < Re[r1], {w1, .11, .4}, {w2, .11, .4},          BoundaryStyle -> Blue, FrameLabel -> {"w1", "w2"},         PlotRangePadding -> 0];      Where:               r1 = Sqrt[0.283 + (Sqrt[-0.018769 + w1^2] + Sqrt[-0.018769 + w2^2])^2];     r2 = Sqrt[0.283 + (Sqrt[-0.018769 + w1^2] - Sqrt[-0.018769 + w2^2])^2];     mphy = 1.007;      Integration:               NIntegrate[       Boole[Re[r2] < mphy - w1 - w2 < Re[r1]] 1/(64*Pi^3*mphy)*        Msq2[w1, w2], {w1, w1min, w1max}, {w2, w2min, w2max},        AccuracyGoal -> 14] // Chop      Where:                w1min = w2min = Min@rpp[[1, 1, All, 1]];      w1max = w2max = Max@rpp[[1, 1, All, 1]];      The green line is the singular curve which a part of it is in the integration region:               With[{sing = Solve[1/Msq2[w1, w2] == 0, {w1, w2}] /.
