With the following code I can get the value of the "Sudden Motion Sensor", which is build into MacBooks:               Dynamic@ControllerState[{"X", "Y", "Z"}, ControllerPath -> {"Sudden Motion Sensor"}]      I want to use the values to control some variables in a `Manipulate` statement, however this doesn't seems to work:               Manipulate[x,"X" -> {x, -1, 1}, ControllerPath -> "Sudden Motion Sensor"]
