I have been working on some software application and I update them every 6 months. Currently, the way I track the date is by extracting the date from the system when the user installs the application, encrypt it and store it in a file locally. Whenever the application is started, it checks if 6 months have passed, then it works or it doesn't, in which case it shows an error message telling the user to update. If the user finds the encrypted date in the file they can simply replace it with one from a more recent install. I am wondering if there's a more secure way to do this?
