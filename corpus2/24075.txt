I'd like to disable the 5 second time limit in the manipulate construct. I read about setting                   SynchronousUpdating -> False      But for some reason this does not apply to Evaluations within controls:                   Manipulate[Plot[Sin[a*x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}], {{a, 1}, Button["set a", Pause[6]; a = 2;] &}, SynchronousUpdating -> False]      In the above example a is not set to 2 when pressing the button. When the Pause timespan is set to 5 or below, a is actually set to 2. Does anybody know how to fix that, i.e. how to disable the time limit for evaluations in controls?
