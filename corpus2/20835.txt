I like to use terminals (e.g. `gnome-terminal`) where you can use the up key to copy the last command into the current input 'field'. For example, to repeat the last command you just have to press `up`, `enter`. Or, to modify the last input and re-run, it is just `up`, modify, `enter`. As beginner I often make mistakes, or experiment by slightly changing previous inputs. Is there any way in which I can obtain this convenient input behavior in the _Mathematica_ front end?
