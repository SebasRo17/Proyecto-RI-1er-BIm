I have started to learn Javascript. From book http://eloquentjavascript.net: > There is one more arithmetic operator which is probably less familiar to > you. The `%` symbol is used to represent the remainder operation. `X % Y` is > the remainder of dividing `X` by `Y`. For example `314 % 100` is `14`, `10 % > 3` is `1`, and `144 % 12` is `0`. Remainder has the same precedence as > multiplication and division. I don't understand, why it multiply the remainder fraction by divisor (after division). It is more complicated or less accurate.   10 / 3 = 3.3333 (a recurring decimal number). 10 % 3 = 1 (0.333 * 3 = 0.999 (not 1 ) What is purpose of this strange remainders ? Thanks
