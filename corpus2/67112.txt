I'm currently in the process of developing a REST service that will be consumed by an iPhone app. Basically, the service wraps existing business logic. This business logic is written in c# and I'm writing the service in c#. From a purely curious point of view (not this project) my questions are: What other languages and frameworks exist to build REST services? If the technology choice was open which one would you choose and why? Can you wrap c# assemblies using non Microsoft languages? Would you ever do it? (If the development team was able to support it)
