I'm building a medium-sized "single-page" JavaScript application using jQuery. If you include all possible functionality of the application, there are 134 `click` bindings. Since most of the content is dynamically loaded, I can't just do this: `$(element).click(function() { ... });` Instead, I'm doing this: `$(document).on('click', selector, function() { ... });` Currently, I'm binding all of these on `$(document).ready`. But is that bad practice? Is this a speed issue? The alternative would be to bind the event listeners every time the content is loaded, for example:               $('#content').html(...);     $('#newcontent').click(function() { ... });      The problem with that is it's difficult to organize. What advice can you give me?
