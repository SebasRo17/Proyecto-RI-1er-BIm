Suppose, I want to solve a equation and want to obtain it's first root. In this case I've used               In[1]=:Solve[b^2 + b*z + 1 == 0, b][[1]]      This gives               Out[2]={b -> 1/2 (-z - Sqrt[-4 + z^2])}      Now I want use this result directly in Plot command. My code for this is               In[3]:Plot[Out[2], {z, -1000, 1000}, PlotRange -> All]      But I'm not getting the plot. If I use               In[4]:Plot[1/2 (-z - Sqrt[-4 + z^2]), {z, -1000, 1000}, PlotRange -> All]      I'm getting the plot correctly. I guess in In[3], `Out[2]` contains `b->`, that's why it's unable to plot. How to handle this situation? p.s. This is a prototype of my actual problem. I want to solve this in this way because my output is too large to copy and paste in the `Plot` command.
