Consider the following list:               data={4078, 256, -1266, -388, 1290, 1368, 1446, 1524, 2};      I would like to split any kind of such list always, when figures turn form negative to positive. In the case of `data` the result would be:               {{4078, 256, -1266, -388},{ 1290, 1368, 1446, 1524, 2}}      I tried it with               Split[%, #2>0 && #1<0 &]      but I got:               {{4078}, {256}, {-1266}, {-388, 1290}, {1368}, {1446}, {1524}, {2}}
