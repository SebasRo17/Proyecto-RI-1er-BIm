This is an important question because "apply for a job/internship" isn't a solution for everyone especially during economic stress periods when constant rejection can push good programmers into depression. Can people with experience briefly comment on other ways to get programming revenue:   * Creating "free for non-commercial" software   * Turning an idea into a startup with near-zero resources and **not flopping**   * Turning an idea into a startup with near-zero resources and coming out **employed**   * Using outsourcing sites and **actually** getting paid   * Making freeware and getting sponsors/advertisers (I know we all hate installer spam, but still)
