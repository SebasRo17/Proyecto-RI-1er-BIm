I recently came across an article where if you enter               data:text/html,%20<html contenteditable>      into the address bar of a browser that supports HTML5, you can type in the window.   I managed to figure out that with this you can basically write html in the address bar (it would be rather cumbersome) but I do not understand how or why it works. What are the other functionalities of this command?
