This is how the curve looks like:               img = ContourPlot[                       1/x + 3/4 (((y - 1/Sqrt[3])/x)^2 + 1) Exp[                       ArcTan[(y - 1/Sqrt[3])/x] - Pi/6] == 0,                {x, -3, 1},                 {y, -(1/5), 4},            PlotPoints -> 70 ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jQPH3.jpg) @xzczd comes up with a (kinka hacky!) solution, which extract the coordinates forming that curve:               Total[EuclideanDistance @@@        Partition[First@Cases[Normal@img,                              Line[a_] :> a, Infinity], 2, 1]           ]            (* 9.85614 *)      Is there any better way to do this?
