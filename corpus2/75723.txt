I'm currently writing an application which I am thinking of open sourcing once I'm out of beta. However, I would like to maintain ownership of the icons and other graphics (they're actually the work of someone else that I'm paying to do). Does the GPL allow this kind of mixed licencing? Or is it all or nothing? Are there alternative licences which allow the source code to be released while not allowing images to be modified or reused?
