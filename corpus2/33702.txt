The code that I have written has an unintended consequence that I'm not sure how to get around. I want 3 rotation transforms to be applied simultaneously to 1 graphics object. Instead, I get 3 separate separate copies of the graphics object, one per transformation. The documentation does state that this will be the outcome of using multiple transformations on a graphics object. > GeometricTransformation[g, {t1, t2, ...}]   >  **_represents multiple copies_** of g transformed by a collection of > transformations. My question is: how is it possible to achieve the the outcome that I described instead of getting multiple copies? Here is the code I am executing:               Manipulate[       Graphics3D[{         EdgeForm[None],          GeometricTransformation[Cylinder[],            {RotationTransform[a Pi, {1, 0, 0}],             RotationTransform[b Pi, {0, 1, 0}],             RotationTransform[c Pi, {0, 0, 1}]}]}],        {{a, 0}, -1, 1},        {{b, 0}, -1, 1},        {{c, 0}, -1, 1},        SaveDefinitions -> True]      If anyone could show me a way to accomplish this, I'd appreciate it.
