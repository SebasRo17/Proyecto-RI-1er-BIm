When naming a model, should the name be as generic as possible-- even if that won't be the name displayed to users? For example let's imagine a Django model for liking another user's posts. Does it make sense to name the model 'Like' even if I plan on displaying it as Kudos, Endorsements, Ups, etc? Does it make sense to make the name as generic as possible, even if the name won't be the one displayed to the user?
