I'm making a drawing program as my first open-source program merely to get a taste of the open-source community. To make said program, I am using Python 2.7. I'm using the following modules:   1. EasyGUI 0.96 - Under the 3-clause BSD license   2. Pygame 1.9.1 - Under the LGPL 2.1 license All I intend to do is create a program using these modules which depend on it, and upload it to a public GitHub repository for others to freely modify and distribute. _If_ using my code is allowed in closed source software, or profits to be made by others, I do not want it. I do not wish to modify Pygame or EasyGUI themselves, either. They just need to be simply provided to run the software. Is this possible with the two licenses mentioned above? If I were to do this, what license would I have to issue my program under and why? Are some better choices than others? Is it also possible release my drawing program code under a reciprocal license so the people contributing send their bug fixes in my script back?
