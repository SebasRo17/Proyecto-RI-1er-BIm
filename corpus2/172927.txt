I started as the analyst, talking to the client and jotting down requirements and all that jazz. Ended as the sole developer of the project. The schedule is OK, but not OK for someone that don't know nothing about how to develop a WPF application, IMHO. What can I do about it, tell program manager that she made a huge mistake by choosing someone with no skills(she had no choice, I was the only one not allocated), or slit my wrists? Do I have other choices? P.S.: Really trying to learn it, can't get how to structure the project MVVM, IoC, Logging. The concept count is too damn high.
