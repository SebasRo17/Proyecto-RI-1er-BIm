I've got a group of very talented, yet new, developers on my team. I've fully embraced the SOLID principles in the projects I'm working on, and my fellow developers have seen the wisdom of the ways - but I am not an experienced teacher (nor am I an experienced student - everything I've learned I've learned on my own or from blog posts). I've been given leeway to hold teaching sessions with these guys, but I need to come up with some sort of lesson plan or else I'll probably just confuse and frustrate them and myself. There are plenty of resources on the web that describe or introduce the SOLID principles, but I haven't seen many that go in depth with them, and I've seen none at all that discuss how to _teach_ them. Am I missing some resource that's already out there for this? We're .NET developers, a mix of C# and VB.NET, so while I'll take examples in any language, .NET examples will be the best help as I won't have to translate them before showing them to my team. I should mention that we don't have a budget for books. Feel free to mention them, but bear in mind that if they're not cheap, they'll need to be _really_ compelling for me to consider. I won't be reimbursed in any case.
