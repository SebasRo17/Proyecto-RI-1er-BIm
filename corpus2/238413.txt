Our team consits of junior and senior developers. Problem I am facing is with the code written by seniors. They are not following MINIMUM coding standards. I am also still learning but I wouldn't declare the inline style or give improper names for variables and controls. I tried to mention it indirectly but they were like we can take it up later and since its agile, we should move on. But my problem is when I start working on my task, it makes me feel bad and I would focus more on refactor rather than on my task. I am not sure how to deal with this situation. PS: I am sure this question has been asked many times. But any advise is much appreciated.
