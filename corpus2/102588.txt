The common styles of pseudocode are largely intelligible, and it is more or less clear how to write pseudocode for sequential programs. But if parallelism is not hidden behind a full library and is regarded as a regular part of programming, then it should be treated as the same way in regards to pseudo-code. Is there a consistent and widely used style of pseudocode for parallel algorithms? Are there good, practical examples of this?
