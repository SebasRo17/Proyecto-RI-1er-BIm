I have created the following simple GUI:               {num10, num20, path0, date0} =       DialogInput[        {num1 = 100, num2 = 10, path = "a path", date = "11/11/2012"},        Column[{          "First number", InputField[Dynamic[num1], Number],          "Second number", InputField[Dynamic[num2], Number],          "Path of InputData", InputField[Dynamic[path], String],          "Type in a date (DD/MM/YYYY)",           InputField[Dynamic[date], String],          Button["Proceed", DialogReturn[res = {num1, num2, path, date}],            ImageSize -> Automatic]}]];      After filling in the required information and clicking the "Proceed"-button a simple code/calculation follows:               {num10 + num20, path0, AbsoluteTime[{date0, {"Day", "/", "Month", "/", "Year"}}]}      Here is what I would like to do:   1. **Displaying only GUI** : I would like to create a file "MyProgram" which - when opened - pops up immediately the GUI (the notebook will be opened in the background for further calculations but not displayed to the user).   2. **Drag & Drop:** In the third field I ask for a path for input data. Is it possible to insert the path by dragging the file (in this case a xls-file) and drop it into the field inserting its path?   3. **Displaying results in GUI:** After clicking the button "Proceed" I would like to display the results in the same GUI, below the input fields.   4. **Info button** For the fourth field I added information on the format of the date. It would look much nicer when this information would pop up when clicking on a "?"-button. How can I implement this button?
