I have a list with measured data. There are multiple measurements in the list, but each measurement requires some time to find its equilibrium. I'd like to know the positions of the equilibria, but because of errors (during the measurement and in the behaviour of the measured quantity), I'd like to get five consecutive values from each equilibrium, so I can take the average (or at least compare them). Here is the graph of the data:   ![picture of data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CVmja.png)   The useful data can be extracted at the positions used by               data[[450;; ;; 500]]      I know the following will work               Tranpose@Table[data[[445+i;; ;;500]],{i,0,10}]      But I expected the following to work (which it does not sadly)               data[[Range[445,455];; ;;500]]      Can this be done without using `Table` (or similar constructs)?
