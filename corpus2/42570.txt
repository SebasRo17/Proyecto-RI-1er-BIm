I read some descriptions of similar problems but I cannot make them work in my example, I don't know why. I have list of 3 dim values to plot: `x`, `y` and a control variable `z`. I want to plot `x` against `y`, and condition on `z` should determine the colour. The list is:               data = {{1/5, -17.9919, 12}, {1/5, 17.9925, 12}, {1/5, -17.9878, 12}, {1/5, 17.9884, 12},             {2/5, 25.7781, 12}, {2/5, -25.7775, 12}, {2/5, 25.7722, 12}, {2/5, -25.7716, 12},             {3/5, 31.7075, 14}, {3/5, -31.7069, 14}, {3/5, 31.7002, 15}, {3/5, -31.6996, 15},              {4/5, 36.6911, 14}, {4/5, -36.6905, 14}, {4/5, 36.6827, 14}, {4/5, -36.6821, 14},             {1, 41.0745, 14}, {1, -41.0739, 14}, {1, 41.0651, 14}, {1, -41.0645, 14}}      Out of all similar problems I found               nC = 0;     ListPlot[data[[All, {1, 2}]],        PlotStyle -> Directive[PointSize[Large]], Joined -> True,        ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y}, If[data[[++nC, 3]]==12,Red,Black]]] /.       Line[a__] :> Point[a]      But it seems no to recognise any colours so all the points are similar. Can you suggest a solution?
