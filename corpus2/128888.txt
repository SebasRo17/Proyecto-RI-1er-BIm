When I began to use parser combinators my first reaction was a sense of liberation from what felt like an artificial distinction between parsing and lexing. All of a sudden everything was just parsing! However, I recently came across this posting on codereview.stackexchange illustrating someone reinstating this distinction. At first I thought this was very silly of them, but then the fact that functions exist in Parsec to support this behavior leads me to question myself. What are the advantages/disadvantages to parsing over an already lexed stream in parser combinators?
