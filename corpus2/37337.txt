I've got this function:               E0[x0_, y0_, z_]:=          A/w[z]*Exp[-(x0^2 + y0^2)/(w[z]*w[z])]*Exp[(I*2*Pi*(x0^2 + y0^2))/(λ*2*R[z])]*Exp[I*ϕ[z]];      Where the `w[z], R[z]` and `Phi[z]` are given as presented here. Second function is as follows:               Transmission1[x0_, y0_] := 2*(1 + Cos[((2*Pi)/λ)*x0 - 2*ArcTan[(y0/x0)]]);      I want to perform an two dimensional NIntegration:               f1[x2_, y2_]:=         NIntegrate[E0[x0,y0,z]*Transmission1[x0, y0]*Exp[I*(kx1*x0 + ky1*y0)],             {y0,-0.00001,0.00001},{x0, -0.00001, 0.00001}];      where:               kx1 = ((2*Pi)/(λ*z))*x2;     ky1 = ((2*Pi)/(λ*z))*y2;      For any `{x2,y2}` values I get an error which states:               NIntegrate::inumr: "The integrand 2\ E^(I\((20000000 π x0 x2)/633+(20000000 π y0 y2)/633))\ (1+Cos[(2000000000\π\x0)/633-2\ ArcTan[Power[<<2>>]\ y0]])     has evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{-0.00001,0.00001},{-0.00001,0.00001}}"      How can I manage to solve this issue?
