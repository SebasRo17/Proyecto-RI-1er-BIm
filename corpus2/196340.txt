I want to start using BDD in our company. The best place to keep stories from my point of view is the Atlassian Wiki pages. Obviously I expected some existing techniques for retrieving stories from pages, but found only an advice to use `pageUrl?decorator=printable` to get the page in printable form and parse it afterwards. And that is it, no plugins nothing... **Question** : What is the best way to retrieve stories from Atlassian Wiki? Are there any well known alternatives? I can definitely keep them in the SVN folder where business analysts could have access to, but this is far much less comfortable for them. All other technical documentation is kept on wiki and I do not want to split it.
