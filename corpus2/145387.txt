I had an argument yesterday with one of my colleagues. He (a business-analyst, previously a programmer) thinks that he should be aware of the technology used to implement the system, so he can take better design decisions. In my opinion (I am a programmer), an analysis should not be coupled in any way to the technology and I believe that a good analyst can make a great design without worrying about the implementation details. Am I right to think that way? Are there any reasons why a business analyst would need to know the technology used to implement the system? EDIT : I believe that I used the wrong term when saying `business analyst`. Maybe I meant architect, or system analyst. I am not used to these terms. I meant something like architect or system analyst if you prefer. Thank you everyone for your awesome answers! I am not very experienced yet and I am glad you opened my eyes on this.
