I'm trying to make a demonstration of how rounding to different numbers of digits affects things but I can't find a way to round numbers to a specified number of digits. The `Round`function only round to the nearest whole integer, and that is not what I always want. Other ways seems to only change the way the numbers are displayed, not how they are internally stored. I want to throw away precision, but it seems Mathematica doesn't want to allow me to do this. As an example: I would like to round 3.4647 to just 3.5 or 3.46. There must be some way to do this, but I can't for the life of me find it.
