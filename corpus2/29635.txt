I've been working for a contractor who brings in some good projects, but they are all fixed-price and often fixed-time. As a result he always has me making a quote over loose requirements, which never fails to bring a lot of tension due to feature creep. He claims he'd never get a contract if he couldn't agree on a price with his clients first, but as far as I'm concerned I don't wanna go through another project under these terms. Is there any argument I could make to have him pay me by the hour, or should I just suck less at estimating ?
