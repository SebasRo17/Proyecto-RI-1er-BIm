I am working with a lot of daily weather files in the `txt` format. I need to calculate a daily quantity from each of them, e.g., daily light intensity, which involves a simple summation of the light intensity column in Excel. As I am working with over three years of data, it is not possible to do this manually. How can I automate this in _Mathematica_? Currently I import all the files using the following method. (Example shown is for Jan 1 to Jan 31)               filenames = FileNames[];       TestList = Flatten[Table[Files[[j, i]], {j, 1, 31}, {i, 2, 1437}], 1];       LightIntensity = TestList[[1 ;;, 5]];       DailyLightIntensity = Partition[LightIntensity, 1436];       DailySummation = Table[Total[DailyLightIntensity[[i]]],  {i, 1, 31}]      The method above only works assuming all the `txt` files contain rows from 2 to 1436, so I can use `Partition`, but I also need to handle cases with missing data. I want to automate this process with _Mathematica_ , import each `txt` file separately, perform the necessary calculations, and store the answer. How can this be done? The naming convention of the txt is given below: > [112] 2012-01-01   >  [112] 2012-01-02   >  [112] 2012-01-03   >  [112] 2012-01-04   >  ...   >  [112] 2012-12-31
