I quite often would like to draw graphics in my $\LaTeX$ documents using Mathematica. I have encountered three problems. I would like to know if there are any workarounds to these problems I would like to make my graphics homogeneous with my document. That means that I would like to use the same font in the graphics (labels for axis etc) as the main text. Mathematica does not support Computer Modern. I found a workaround using PSFrag, saving graphics as EPS. It is possible using PSfrag to rename the text in the graphic into $\LaTeX$ code. A big downside is that this method does not allow me to use pdflatex. Many other packages (hyperlink) therefore do not work. `Graphics3D` objects are extremely big. If I save it using a bitmap, the picture usually becomes horrible. I often would like to use transparency. If I use `Opacity` to make some part of the graphic transparent, the exported file in Mathematica is horrible.
