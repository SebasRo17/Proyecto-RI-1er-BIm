This is really trivial and I appologise in advance if I have made a stupid error somewhere. I have been chasing down some strange results when using `NIntegrate` with integrands involving `Max` and `PDF`. A simple example follows.               f[x1_, x2_] := PDF[MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0}, {{1, .5}, {.5, 1}}], {x1, x2}];     NIntegrate[Max[Exp[x1] + Exp[x2] - 3, 0] f[x1, x2],      {x2, -Infinity, Infinity}, {x1, -Infinity, Infinity}]      This gave the answer 0.804628. However, when I tried MATLAB I got 1.2255. So I then used Monte Carlo.               Block[{rho = 0.5, data, rv1, rv2, paths = 1000000, sum, sumSquared, mean, var, stdError},      data = Table[        rv1 = Random[NormalDistribution[0, 1]];        rv2 = rho rv1 + Sqrt[1 - rho^2] Random[NormalDistribution[0, 1]];        Max[Exp[rv1] + Exp[rv2] - 3, 0], {i, paths}];      sum = Total[data];      sumSquared = Total[data^2];      mean = sum/paths;      var = (sumSquared/paths - mean^2) paths/(paths - 1);      stdError = Sqrt[var/paths];      {mean, stdError}     ]      One run of this gave {1.22509, 0.0031105}, agreeing with the MATLAB result. I have also noticed that if I replace `Max[Exp[rv1] + Exp[rv2] - 3, 0]` with `Exp[rv1] + Exp[rv2] - 3` the issue does not arise. Any idea what is going on here?
