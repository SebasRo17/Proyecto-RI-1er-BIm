So we run a site where there are elements of the interface that could potentially be changed at any moment in the backend. Specifically we run a web service where certain functions are loaded dynamically. However, there are times where we remove certian functions and we want the experience to be as seamless for the user as possible. Now we've considered a few methods of solving this   1. Ping the server every few seconds. If the functions are outdated/no longer available refresh the users page. While this would work the best, I feel like having that much IO can't be too good   2. When the user clicks a function, if it's outdated/no longer available, alert them in the response and refresh the page. This would also work fairly well. I guess I'm more wondering how web apps like Google Docs work where you have content that has to be synced up across multiple users and that isn't more than a few seconds outdated Sorry if this isn't the best place to ask this. I figured this was more of a site architecture question and that this might be the place to ask it over SO.
