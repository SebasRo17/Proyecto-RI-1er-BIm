Last night I was discussing with another programmer that even though something may be O(1), an operation which is O(n) may outperform it if there are is a large constant in the O(1) algorithm. He disagreed, so I've brought it here. Are there examples of algorithms which greatly outperform those in the class below it? For example, O(n) being faster than O(1) or O(n2) being faster than O(n). Mathematically this can be demonstrated for a function with an asymptotic upper bounds, when you disregard constant factors, but do such algorithms exist in the wild? And where would I find examples of them? What types of situations are they used for?
