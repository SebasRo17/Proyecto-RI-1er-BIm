I have three tables: `L, S` and `U`. In first table I have values from range `(0,1)`, in second from `(0,2*10^27)` and in the third one from `(0,50)`. No I want to plot all this three tables (tables have the same domain) together. But because of a very different range, I see for example only values for `U`, and rest are just like a small points very near to axes x. I was trying to use `ImageCompose`, because I have mathematica 7, so I can't use `Overlay`, but this functions are only for two plots. Is any other solution how can I plot this three functions together and make the plot more legible?
