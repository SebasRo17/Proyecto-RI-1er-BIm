I am a programmer, I am developing software expected to be between 50k to 100k line of code. I'd like to hire a company to develop an interface to my tool with other software by writing a plugin. This company has done it successfully in the past and I was recommended to use them. However I have never negotiated before and I don't know how its done. I heard in retail one side gets lawyers to put in as much things as possible and the other removes as much as possible. In a different industry I heard distributors or publishers will promise large % of royalties however you'll never see them even if the product has done well. How do I negotiate with a software company on pricing and possibly timeline of this plugin? What do they suspect I'll do? What should I expect them to do?
