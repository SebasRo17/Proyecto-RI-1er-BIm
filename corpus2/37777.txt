I have found that multidimensional `Reverse` is ~10 times slower than exact `-1 ;; 1 ;; -1`:               n = 1000;     mat = RandomReal[1, {n, n}];          mat2 = Reverse[mat, 2]; // AbsoluteTiming     mat3 = mat[[All, -1 ;; 1 ;; -1]]; // AbsoluteTiming     (* {0.088234, Null} *)     (* {0.006836, Null} *)          mat2 == mat3     (* True *)      Why? Is it a bug? Both produced arrays are packed. I use _Mathematica_ 9.0.1 on Linux. _Mathematica_ 8 has the same problem. * * * Reply from the Wolfram Technical Support: > Thank you for your message. > > I could reproduce this performance issue on Mathematica 9. > > I have filed a report on this to our database and thank you for bringing > this issue to our attention. * * * **Edit:** _Mathematica_ 10.0.0 has the same problem...
