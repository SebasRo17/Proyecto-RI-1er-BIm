I am doing some research on the ScalableColor descriptor in MPEG-7 and I came across this passage: > The descriptor extractions starts with the computation of the colour > historgam with 25 bins in the HSV colour space with the Hue (H) component > quantised to 16 bins, and Saturation (S) and Value (V) quantised to 4 bins > each. My statistics is a little rusty so could someone please explain (hopefully with an example) how the bins are quantised?
