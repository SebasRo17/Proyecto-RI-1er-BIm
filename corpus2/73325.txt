There's a lot of good idioms promoted in modern C++. These include RAII and elegant use of boost or STL or a `std::algorithm` to solve a given problem. Just like you can write C in any language, you can certainly write C in C++. However you can write really good modern C++ code with the right subset of features. When someone does something really cool with an STL or boost construct I always get the urge to call it "pythonic" in the sense that its the canocical elegant way to do something. Is there a term like how "pythonic" is used in python to refer to C++ code written in the modern style with modern idioms?
