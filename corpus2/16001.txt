I was trying to find all the numbers $n$ for which $2^n=n\mod 10^k$ using _Mathematica_. My first try:               Reduce[2^n == n, n, Modulus -> 100]      However, I receive the following error:               Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Reduce. >>      using $n^2$ instead of $2^n$ works just fine, where is the problem with $2^n\;$? On top of that, how do I keep the modulus $10^k$ variable and therefore, receive a solution dependent on $k\;$?
