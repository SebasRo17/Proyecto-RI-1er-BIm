I have a `baseClass` where I do not want public setters. I have a `load($id)` method that will retrieve the data for that object from the db. I have been using static class methods like `getBy($property,$values)` to return multiple class objects using a single database call. But some people say that static methods are not OOP. So now I'm trying to create a `baseClassCollection` that can do the same thing. But it can't, because it cannot access protected setters. I don't want everyone to be able to set the object's data. But it seems that it is an all- or-nothing proposition. I cannot give just the collection class access to the setters. I've seen a solution using `debug_backtrace()` but that seems inelegant. I'm moving toward just making the setters public. Are there any other solutions? Or should I even be looking for other solutions?
