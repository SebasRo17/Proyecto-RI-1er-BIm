We are writing a program that does a standard "auto update software on startup". If the software finds an update ready, it will start the update process and then exit (and not run the program). We have two different designs on how to write the logic of the update. Design 1: Let our AutoUpdate class handle everything, including exiting the program if required. Design 2: AutoUpdate does most of the logic, and if it wants the program to exit, it returns a value indicating this, and the Main() takes care of exiting. code wise, the main function would look like: Design 1 (AutoUpdate exits internally if required)               Main()     {         AutoUpdate.DoAutoUpdate();         RunMainProgram();     }      Design 2 (AutoUpdate returns true if it needs to exit, Main handles the exit)               Main()     {         if (AutoUpdate.DoAutoUpdate() == false)         {             RunMainProgram();         }     }
