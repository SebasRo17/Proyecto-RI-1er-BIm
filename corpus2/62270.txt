Interesting post by Seth Grodin by increasing productivity by specifying one device for work and one for everything else. Would you be more productive if you only programmed on one machine and forced yourself to surf, chat, email, and play games on another device or would it hinder productivity? If your boss saw you on your phone or tablet for an hour, it would raise a red flag. Could be a problem if you mix work and personal email. Obviously doesn't work if you don't have another device. EDIT: maybe the advantage would be for a developer to have more than one computer instead of just a faster computer and more monitors?
