I'm working in an organisation with limited funds. They can't afford a business account on Dropbox. However, they would find it useful to have all their files synchronized on local machines. I've recently looked at Python Sockets and it looks as though a custom script could achieve what they're looking for. I'm concerned that it may be too low- level because a library may exist that provides a lot of functionality and it would be a waste of resources to start from scratch. Is there a Python library/module that would provide what I'm looking for?
