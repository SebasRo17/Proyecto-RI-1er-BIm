Since Javascript is an interpreted language, entire functions can be changed during runtime. I have recently been contemplating a framework that would allow for dynamic code changes (such as UI plugins) to take effect without having to reload the page, while still providing enough information to undo the change if desired. I have begun to test this concept with small examples with success, but have not had the chance to test the idea for anything useful. Is there any common adverse side effects to changing code during runtime or is it considered bad practice?
