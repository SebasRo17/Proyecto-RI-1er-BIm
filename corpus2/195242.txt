I have a large XML file (about 75,000 lines) where I have to build a catalogue (houses) from. Building the lists works fine, but now I have a problem. The catalogue should have a detailed presentation page of one house. One house (`<item id="123">`) has about 800-1200 lines of data, based on the house type. **Which is the best way, as referring to making the script faster and saving lines of code, to read these data and present them?** Some houses, for example, have a sauna, and when these data are in the XML file, the presentation page should contain a section sauna. I tried before to read the whole XML content with a recursive function into arrays and with a lot of `foreache`s (maximum depth of children is three) with SimpleXML, but it was really ugly slow, and the recursion did not work at all, because my computer could not handle so much input. **Is there any other way to build this data except to query every variable with`if`?**
