I have a doubt to confirm. Let there is a list                 f = {{l}, {c}, {d}, {e}, {1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}}      And I expect it to be traversed as a normal list which I can do by,               Table[f[[i, k]], {i, Length[f]}, {k, Length[f[[i]]]}]      But if the list is               a = {b, c, d, e, {1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}}      Than I get the following output                  {{}, {}, {}, {}, {1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}}      Is it must that there shall be list of sublists and no single element can be kept without sublist or I am accessing it wrong way. Doesn't Mathematica automatically consider it to be sublist for obvious reason.
