As the titel says I want to transpose a matrix containing rows of unequal length, to be able to transport them to excel (in row form, there are too many datapoint to write them in a cell. In another topic if found to use flatten : Transpose uneven lists However, this does not give me the right result: Example:               list = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4,5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}};     Flatten[list, {{2},{1}}]      Results into:               {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}, {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}, {4, 4, 4, 4}, {5, 5}}      But the result I want is:               {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}, {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}, {4, 4,"" , "" , 4, 4}{,"" , "" , "" , "" , 5, 5}}      So I want to keep the rows together as they are, but only print them into columns. Is this possible?
