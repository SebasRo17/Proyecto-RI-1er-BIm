The question Is it illegal to rewrite every line of an open source project in a slightly different way, and use it in a closed source project? makes me wonder what would be considered a _clean-room implementation_ in the era of open source projects. Hypothetically, if I were to develop a library which duplicates the _publicly documented_ interface of an open-source library, without ever looking at the source code for that library, could that code ever be considered a derivative work? Obviously it would need the same _class hierarchy_ and _method signatures_ , so that it could be a drop-in replacement - could that in itself, be enough to provoke a copyright claim? What about if I used the test suite of the open source project to verify whether my _clean_ implementation behaved in the same way as the original library? Would using the test suite be enough to _dirty_ my _clean_ code? As should be expected from a question like this, I am not looking for specific legal advice, but looking to document experiences people may have had with this sort of issue.
