Is it possible to harmoniously label a graph in _Mathematica_? I would like a function, that when given a graph, would return a harmonious labeling. If not, is there other software that can do it? A _Mathematica_ program that can do it for me would be great. Maybe use heruistics to do it. Consider all labelings and find one/several harmonious labelings? I dont think I have the programming chops to do it myself.
