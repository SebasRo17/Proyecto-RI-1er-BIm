I try to explain better using an example:   * I create the class Product with attibutes like that:              private string _ProductCode = "";     [DisplayName("ProductCode")]     public String ProductCode     {        get { return _ProductCode; }        set { _ProductCode = value; OnPropertyChanged("ProductCode"); }     }        * the class Product implements the interfaces: INotifyPropertyChanged, IEditableObject   * I create the class ProductList that has the following property:              public List<Product> Products { get; set; }        * I bind the class Product in a DataGridView control using the DataSource property              MyGridView.DataSource = ProductList.Products;        * I have the table **ProductListTable** on db SqlServer that has more column than the class **Product**   * When I push the button "Save" on my form I'd would like to save the ProductList on ProductListTable I'm really confusing about the way to follow ... I have to use Link 2 Sql, Entity Framework? I'm searching for something simple for a small project, but using POCO classes for rapresenting the data layer. Now how I should proceed for linking class to DB table?
