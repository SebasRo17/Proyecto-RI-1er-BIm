Do you send out a "request for comment" when establishing a new company guideline or standard? Companies need to establish consistent guidelines on things like development process, version control, release procedures, etc. Is it worth the effort to solicit feedback prior to publishing the final guidelines? What do you need to watch out for? In certain cases, such as when you have experienced engineers who can draft the guidelines, or where guidelines can be revised over time, I think the answer could be "No". Benefits   * Resolve corner cases or ambiguities prior to publication   * Better acceptance/adoption because the people that will use the guidelines were involved Drawbacks   * Takes time   * May not get useful feedback
