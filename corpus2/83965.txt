From what I know, learning a programming language consists of : 1- Learning the syntax 2- Learning how does the language handle\use\implement its "abilities" (Classes, delegates, structs, polymorphism.... etc) And What from what I found while researching a couple of programming languages, is that the "major" languages share almost all of these capabilities (OOP,delegation,polymorphism, and so on) I am learning C# at the moment, and as a "major" language , it offers all of the said capabilities and more. after learning C#, I should be able to learn other languages relatively easier, for example Objective-C ( for iOS development ) and java (for android development) the problem here, the Framework. for windows there is (.net), for Mac (Cocoa) for iOS (Cocoa Touch) how does one go about USING these frameworks, I am not looking for tutorials for a specific api, I can use google for that ;) I am talking about "understanding" the general idea of how one would easily use a framework ( even if its previously unknown to the programmer) to build an application. For example, we all heard of the Playstation Vita, the new handheld device of Playstation... now this device offers alot of new features not found in the PSP ... so the game developers for this device will need to get the API from sony and work their way through it to build a game for the PS Vita . How does that work? is there something you need to know besides the programming language used for the API (eg. C# for .NET and Objective-C for Cocoa) ? I know that there are books covering each major API out there, But again I am trying to get a general understanding not a tutorial. On a forum for game developers, someone said (once you know programming, the language is just a tool) That's what I want to achieve... Sorry for such a long post, And I would be grateful for your experience on the subject.
