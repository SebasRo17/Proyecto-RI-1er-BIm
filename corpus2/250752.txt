For example, there is a model of an event with certain attributes that can be adjusted by existing processes: maybe one that looks at a geo-location stamp and determines a nearby city; another that looks at the number of registrations and applies rounding; another that calculates local popularity based on attendees vs. nearby events. The important piece is having a way to **dynamically order the operations** \--the filters/transformations/processing tasks--so that you can pass the events to a processing object that arranges the tasks in the correct order for the configuration/situation, and then passes the models through to apply them. I can think of some ugly ways to make this happen, but want to know if there is a SOLID pattern that would allow for better, more-testable code.
