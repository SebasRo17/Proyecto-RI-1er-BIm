Recently I read a lot about noSQL DBMSs. I understand CAP theorem, ACID rules, BASE rules and the basic theory. But didn't find any resources on why is noSQL scalable more easily than RDBMS (e.g. in case of a system that requires lots of DB servers)? I guess that keeping constraints and foreign keys cost resources and when a DBMS is distributed, it is a lot more complicated. But I expect there's a lot more than this. Can someone please explain how noSQL/SQL affects scalability?
