I'm creating random graphs with suitable properties and exporting them in the DIMACS format. Already, for rather small graphs with, say, ~60k vertices and ~240k edges, `Export` takes several minutes on a high-end machine. My hope is to export much larger graphs in a reasonable time. Here's how I'm doing it now,               g = RandomGraph[DegreeGraphDistribution[Table[8, {60000}]]];     Export["graph.col", g]      The output file is a plaintext file with roughly $e$ lines, where $e$ is the number of edges in the graph. Why does `Export` run so slow? Is there a way I can speed `Export` up, or is there another way to do this faster? I can't imagine what makes _Mathematica_ _so_ slow at extracting the edgelist of the graph and writing it to a file.
