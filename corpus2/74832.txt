Just read a presentation about using Python for Scientific Computing. I am currently using MATLAB (student license FTW, which will expire when I graduate soon). So I was wondering **how matured SciPy and NumPy are with respect to relying on them for all the Scientific Computing** I need to do. The advantage is that it's free. I am mainly focused on Signal Processing, Audio, Acoustics kind of computing. I can imagine that the NumPy and SciPy projects are evolving with respect to the support for more complex techniques. So, **how fast are they evolving** , are there large communities behind them? Finally, **are there other solutions**?
