I am reading the book Object-Oriented Analysis and Design written by Grady Booch and others. In the Section : I Concepts in a subsection Bringing Order to Chaos authors suggest to separate between a _Method_ and a _Methodology_ : According to the book: **A method** is a disciplined procedure for generating a set of models that describe various aspects of a software system under development, using some well-defined notation. **A methodology** is a collection of methods applied across the software development lifecycle and unified by process, practices, and some general, philosophical approach. I understood that a _Method_ is used to built system models and a _Methodology_ is a set of such methods that are applied across software development lifecycle. To my knowledge, a software development lifecycle includes but is not limited to analysis, design, implementation and testing phases. How it can be that a _Method_ that is used to built system models is also applied in implementation or testing phase?
