When I try to use model files generated by `FeynRules` in `FeynArts`, I always get errors of this form > Coupling definition in model file for `C[S[5],S[1,{e2x1}],-V[3]]` is \ > incompatible to generic coupling structure. Coupling is not a vector \ of > length 1. (when I use the `InsertField` function, `InsertFields[t11, {S[7], -S[7]} -> {S[2], S[2]}, Model -> "NMSSM"]`, etc.) I have tried using the `SM` and `NMSSM` models included with `FeynRules`, and my own models and I get the same error. When I tried using the `SM` model file that's included with `FeynArts`, there's no problem. So it seems there's a problem with the `FeynArts` model files generated by `FeynRules`? I'm using `FeynRules` 2.0.3 and `FeynArts` 3.9.
