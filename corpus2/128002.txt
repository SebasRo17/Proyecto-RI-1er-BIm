I am a grade 11 student and have Computer Science... I just love the subject.. We are doing C++ ... I have loadsss of interest in this subject ... I am kind of able to do the programs but would like to master C++ before college itself... It would be kind enough if someone can tell me some sites where there are source codes of some good programs (specially library systems)...Also, can anyone recommend any books! Moreover, to have a profession as a C++ programmer, what is required? I mean what type of courses in college should I apply to? Do I need to do Computer Engineering for this?
