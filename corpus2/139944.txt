I, perhaps, made a _wrong_ choice of going with a `Component-based Framework` like JSF for an internet facing, high traffic web application. Development with JSF has although been easier but what I fear now is whether JSF would allow me that scalability & performance with all it fundamental problems & issues. State saving in a high traffic web app, does that make sense at all!? How do I tune up my JSF app now to make it perform better under heavy load? I am already trying to reduce the state / component tree by reducing the no of components on page. What are other things I can tune up to make JSF app perform better ?
