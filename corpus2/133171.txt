When I get a design from a designer, I get it as a PSD (Photoshop) file. I always expect proper layer and folder names, basically a clean and managed PSD. From this desigbn I develop HTML, CSS and JavaScript and deliver it to the back-end developers. To make it easy for them to understand, I   * write semantic code,   * keep JavaScript and CSS in external files,   * add useful comments in HTML, CSS and JS files,   * use CSS sprites (though developers don't like it),   * use HTML5 boiler plate,   * use jQuery for JavaScript,   * try to use new HTML5 tags and CSS3 whenever possible and   * sent a Zip file containing the HTML, CSS, JS and images. I expect that if small changes will need to be made to the layout, the developers can handle that. I would like to hear from back-end developers and other CSS ninjas what more one could do in terms of organization of files and mark-up to make the integration with back-end systems easier (i.e. back-end technologies, PHP, .NET, Ruby etc.) Different client uses different systems.
