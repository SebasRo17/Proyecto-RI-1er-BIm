In version 10, Mathematica not only added `Inactive` / `Activate` but also highlighted this change in the "New in 10" page (in Core Language Enhancements). Thus, I suppose it should be something useful. However, I didn't understand in which sense it is better than the good old `Hold` (`HoldForm`) / `ReleaseHold` mechanism. I noticed a few differences, but all of those are minor: (1) `Inactive` objects are printed in a lighter color. `HoldForm` objects are printed in normal color. (2) There is an `IgnoringInactive` function to include inactive objects into pattern matching. It would be nice to hear if there are more important differences.
