I'm storing some phone numbers in the database which should kept totally secret (they're supposed to access via web). BTW, because of the position of these people, I need to prevent any chance for leak of their numbers. So, the only solution I could thinking of is Encryption. As the database could contains bunch of data, I won't encrypt the database entirely. Also, I actually prefer to use different key for each person to encrypt their phone numbers, so in the case of leaking one key, the other phone numbers should be safe at least. The problem is that other people also need to send SMS messages via the application through a web-interface and also some more privileged persons need to see these numbers, so I also need to make these numbers visible to the other privileged persons by the way. I'm wondering of something like a public-key/private-key structure, but it's too much for just encrypting a phone number per person, and also there would be a problem for new users, because the previous numbers didn't encrypted with their public-keys. So, is there any solution you might recommend to me? maybe I should to revise or update the structure of how I'm trying to do that, huh?
