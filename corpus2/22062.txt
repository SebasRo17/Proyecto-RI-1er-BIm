I have a nested list like               matrix = {{1.2345664, 2.38673956, 3.567846}, {0.00034554, 124.4554654,     6.34543}, {0.0000233, 244.34454, 2}}      and I want to apply `MatrixForm`, but also `NumberForm[,{5,4}]`, because I want that in every element of the matrix the numbers are properly padded. Is this possible in some way? Interestingly perhaps, I want eventually write the resulting output list in a file. P.S.: Now I write with `Export["my_file.dat",Flatten[matrix]]`, and after I obtain the proper padding using a C program. But there must be a clever way...
