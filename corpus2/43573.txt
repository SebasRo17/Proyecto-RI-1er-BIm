I found a partial answer in the documentation centre, but would like to expand on it and know how can I fit multiple sets of data and extract the parameters from them. It is an eigenvalue problem - We have a 3x3 matrix               {{E(θ)-E, V1, V2}, {V1, E1-E, 0}, {V2, 0, E2-E}}      We set `Det(matrix)=0` to get the $E$ eigenvalues, though the `E[θ] = E0*(1-(Sin[θ]/neff)^2)^(-0.5)`. So the eigenvalues will change with angle. Now I have 3 data sets to fit the 3 solutions of my problem and have to extract the free parameters $V1,\,V2,\,E0,\,neff$ that best fit my data. Any suggestions ?
