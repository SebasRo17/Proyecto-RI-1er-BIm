How much do you need to know for computer science? When you get out of a PhD program in computer science at most schools how much math do you come out knowing? I'm guessing beyong the high school precalc stuff, you have to know what's called discrete math that there's usually one course for at most schools and it covers all the concepts required for compiuter science (combinatorics, probability & statistics, number theory, proofs, formal languages, etc.) And I'm guessing you need to know linear algebra, and calculus (both single and multivariable). I don't think you need to know differential equations, abstract algebra, higher analysis, non-euclidean geometry, and stuff like that - typically, a math major learns those.
