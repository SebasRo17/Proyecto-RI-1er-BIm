I am releasing software developed in a university under the Apache 2.0 license. I would like advice on who to list as the license owner. Would I list only my boss who co-authored the software and maintains the code base, or both my boss and the institution, or just the institution? I'm inclined to put my bosses name and institution, but I wanted to find out of that was an acceptable practice. Also do you know if multiple individuals are ever listed as license owners?
