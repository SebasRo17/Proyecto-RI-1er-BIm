In the 5/15 minute scrum meeting the 3 questions are asked. For the last question "what impediments are getting in your way" If a dev has problems - the xyz is going to have problems, this is likely going to draw the meeting out past 15 mins and could go into a hour long discussion. Is it the scrum masters job to help this user, is there something to stop this from going on more than 15 mins. Thoughts?
