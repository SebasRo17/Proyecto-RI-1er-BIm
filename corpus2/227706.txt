I have read some posts regarding learning different programming languages or not. Most of the answers indicate that learning more than one programming language increase our horizon as a programmer and we can learn different ways of solving similar problems. However, some also suggest that learning more than one languages of same type doesn't help much. My question is that does it then mean that we should learn different languages but of different categories as well? Should we learn one or all great languages of each category to increase our programming knowhow?
