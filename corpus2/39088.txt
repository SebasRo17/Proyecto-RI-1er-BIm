I have a Response Surface Equation (RSE) that I'm trying to extract coefficients from. It has a form similar to:               g = a*x + b*y + c*x*y;      I want to be able to extract the coefficient from `x`, `y`, and `x*y`. However, when I use               Coefficient[g, x, 1]      I get `(a + c y)`, which is not what I want (I want just `a`). Is there any way to extract `a`, `b`, and `c` directly?
