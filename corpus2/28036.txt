I'm a novice with _Mathematica_ , but you guys have been very helpful to me in the past. I have a binary array [100, J repetitions] consisting of zeroes and ones. I'd like to extract a histogram of the number of contiguous ones in these individual columns. Assuming I have some variable `f[i, j]` containing these data what I have is:               Do[       bhist = SparseArray[{1, 1} -> 0, {1, 100}, 0];        index = 1;        Do[If[f[[j, i]] == 1, index++, bhist[[index]] + 1; index = 1],          {i, 1, 100}];        bhista[j] = bhist;,        {j, 1, rep}];      where `bhist` will record the number of contiguous 1s and how many times that ensemble occurs. This will loop over all j repetitions of the monte carlo. The problem is that I seem to only be generating zeroes despite the fact that my simulation does generate contiguous 1s. Is my `If` expression setting the index to 1 before it records the value in my `bhist` variable? Or is something else going on? Furthermore, if I wanted to then extract a histogram from `bhista`, is there a more efficient way of doing this than flattening it and bin counting?
