In a single directory with a Git root folder, I have a bunch of files. I am working on one of those files, X.py, with my friend Alice. The other files I am working on with other people. I want Alice (and everyone else) to have access to X.py. I want Alice to only have access to X.py though. How can I achieve this with Git? Is there a way I can split a directory into two repos? That sounds rather cumbersome. Maybe I could add a remote repo that Alice can access containing X.py?
