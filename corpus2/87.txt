How does one generate custom symbols? For example, the physicist notation for the rotation is "nabla cross function". In this case however, Mathematica complains that the `[esc]del[esc]` symbol evaluates to the unary operator `Del[]`, which of course cannot take a cross (`[esc]*[esc]`) after it, since a bracket is expected. Although a correctly looking output is generated by               Prefix[f[a], "\[Del]\[Times]"]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2vco3.png) the result cannot simply be assigned to an operation (`Prefix[...] := ...`) you can type in using the nicely readable [esc] commands I mentioned above. Is there some way of doing this, i.e. invoking completely custom functionality to (combinations of) existing symbols?
