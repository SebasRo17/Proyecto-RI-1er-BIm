I've been a Rails developer for a year now (originally self taught), and am at the point where I want to improve. I've been reading books on how to improve the quality of my Ruby code (I read Design Patterns and Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby). I'm trying to improve the quality of my code and to add to my portfolio, but I'm having trouble thinking of anything motivating to do with just Ruby since in my head it feels cooler or more usable to have a Sinatra app (I'm thinking about learning Sinatra) and a browser to interact with the app than having to run a pure ruby app through the console with `$ ruby my_app.rb` and have it spit out some info. I know the results are really similar, but still. My question is, do employers think lesser of projects that use frameworks than projects (Rails, Sinatra, etc) that are built from complete scratch (just the programming language itself)?
