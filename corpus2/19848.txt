I have a _Mathematica_ notebook file called "my.nb". It was prepared using _Mathematica_ 7.0 on my local machine running the Linux OS. Now, I want to evaluate it on the remote machine, which also has _Mathematica_ 7.0 running on Linux, but this is a separate licence. I log into the remote machine using ssh. I also want to be able to log out immediately after starting evaluation. I know I can use _Mathematica_ in the text mode, typing `nohup math < my_commands.m &`, but then I have to prepare a text file "my_commands.m". This is very irritating, because .nb file is much more clear and easy to modify than the text file. Is there any way to perform a long-running evaluation of "my.nb" on the remote machine (in text mode or in GUI)? By long evaluation I mean that it runs without me being logged in while the evaluation runs to completion.
