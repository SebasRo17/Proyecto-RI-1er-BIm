For a list `list = {{"a", "b", "c"}, {"d", "e"}};` Table heading lines do not show up               TableForm[list, TableHeadings -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tSSKJ.png) But it works if the list `list = {{"a", "b", "c"}, {"d", "e", "f"}};`               TableForm[list, TableHeadings -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wjcq4.png) It seems the lines appear only for rectangular list. Is this a bug or i am missing something? I use v9.0.1 Thank you.
