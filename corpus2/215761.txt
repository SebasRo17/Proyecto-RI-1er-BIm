I have a software that has a car model that will be used in different views (listing, ads, detail page, carousel, up sell widget,etc).               class CarModel extends DbModel{          }      I look for a "nice way" (a combination of flexible, easy to maintain,etc) to have this used in views. I'm thinking at two different ways   1. Having object views for each context              CarViewBase{         var car;// of type CarModel         function constructor(args){             //will instantienta internal variable car based on args         }              function getThumb(){         }              function getTitle(){              }      }          CarListingView extends CarViewBase{         function getListing(){         }     }          CarAdsView extends CarViewBase{     //the busines rule changes for ads widget         function getThumb(){         }     }        2. Extending directly the CarModel The challenges comes when My Car Model might need an abstract factory. Let's say I have a field on my car object that states the type of the car : a truck, or a bike, or van. How would affect that my object view? Let's say that getTitle() rule would be different for each type of it. How would you do it?
