I have a dataset composed of points specified in {Latitude,Longitude} format. Call it `latlong` for the purposes of this question. It displays properly with               Graphics[{Point /@         Map[GeoGridPosition[GeoPosition[#],             "Mercator"][[1]] &, {latlong}, {2}]}]      I also have a shape file that contains the boundaries of the counties in which the `latlong` points reside. If I query `Import[demo.shp", "CoordinateSystemInformation"]`, I get               "GEOGCS" -> {"GCS_North_American_1983",        "DATUM" -> {"North_American_Datum_1983",          "SPHEROID" -> {"GRS_1980", 6.37814*10^6, 298.257}},        "PRIMEM" -> {"Greenwich", 0.}, "UNIT" -> {"Degree", 0.0174533}}      and if I just `Import` the shape file, it displays correctly on screen. I would like to display the points from `latlong` within the county borders from `demo.shp`. I have not been able to figure out how. I appreciate that this is as much a GIS question as it is a Mathematica question, but I hope somebody here can help.
