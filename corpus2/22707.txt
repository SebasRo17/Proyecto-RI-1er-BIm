The function               StringReplace["y\\/G", {"|<" -> "K", "\/" -> "V", "]" -> "J",        "><" -> "X", "_" -> "", "." -> "", "," -> "", "'" -> ""}]      fails to provide the expected answer `"y\VG"` and instead returns `"y\/G"` due to the unusual (to me) way Mathematica handles strings in order to allow for symbols and images in strings. How would one do a string replace where the symbols are literally replaced, in the order the string is shown?
