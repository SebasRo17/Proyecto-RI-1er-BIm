I have set of coordinates. I want to make clusters in which every point is within 1.5 distance unit of it's neighbor. ex of point coordinates:               {{-12.945, 20.6509, 12.5901}, {-13.4452, 20.307, 111.626},      {-12.9731, 22.8458, 12.4215}, {-13.2381, 24.8167, 10.7147},      {-11.3668, 23.3908,11.8499}, {-11.6828, 23.7311, 10.8839},      {-13.3929, 21.1835, 9.86324}, {-11.5016, 21.3324, 10.1392},      {-12.3079, 22.096, 8.57246}, {-12.5268, 20.9679, 10.5444},      {-12.1951, 24.5423, 10.1807}, {-11.8887, 22.3883, 10.0751},      {-14.2529, 20.4808, 9.81084}, {-11.9876, 21.8094, 11.0478},      {-12.3718, 23.6176, 11.8266}, {-11.6179, 20.8324, 11.2154},      {-12.5927, 21.7492, 12.5087}, {-12.1665, 24.6649, 11.2909},      {-12.3854, 21.5571, 9.51876}, {-12.2237, 23.4278, 9.9787}}      what is the quickest way in `Mathematica` for this (for large data sets). I tried this to find all points that are within mentioned distance:               Table[Select[List, EuclideanDistance[List[[i]], #] < 1.5 &], {i, 1, Length[[List]]}]      but now I have troubles to join all sets that have common elements.
