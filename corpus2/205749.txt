I have a set of questions that bothering me, hopefully someone will be able to answer them here:   * What should be an optimal team (in terms of roles) to write a big enterprise nice-quality framework?   * What big frameworks could act as a good references in terms of documentation, architecture, quality of implementation etc?    * What is your assumptions about size of teams that developed this frameworks? Looking forward for answers. Thanks!
