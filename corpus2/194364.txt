How do I go about managing projects when there are two fundamental relationships that need to be maintained? The most obvious example that I can think of would be a firm doing some kind of location-based consulting. I've been wracking my brain on how to explain this, in essence, this is the bullet point version:   * Each client that has multiple locations   * There are several projects that relate to specific client locations   * There are deliverables for these projects      * Each deliverable my only relate to a few locations the project is linked to The system seems to break down when you overlay these two main relationships; a client with multiple locations which have projects assigned to them, and deliverables that link back to individual locations. You just end up with too many many-to-many relationships that are difficult to manage. The problem is then visualizing this in a system. You have a client record with location sub-records. Each location record has many project records associated with it. Each Project record has deliverable records, and then those deliverables relate to specific loations. I realize that this seems a bit estoeric, but is there a way to simplify this so that it is visually understandable?
