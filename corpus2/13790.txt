I'm using `SparseArray` in a notebook in which I am doing complex conjugation manually, i.e. writing $\sqrt{-1}$ as `i` and applying `/.{i->-i}` to perform complex conjugation. I noticed that `ReplaceAll` or `/.` doesn't seem to work on `SparseArrays`, e.g.               m = SparseArray[{2, 2} -> i];     m /. {i -> -i}      just returns `m`. Any clues on how to get around this quickly?
