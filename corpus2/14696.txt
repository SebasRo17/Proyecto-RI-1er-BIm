Working with trig functions, period, amplitude, etc. I found a worksheet at a calculus website, with some nice questions related to interpreting trig functions, at least, they provide some "fun" context. It has to do with a couple, different phases in their relationship, etc. See http://math.arizona.edu/~calc/m124/Denise&Chad.pdf Anyway, my Mathematica question, is related to filling between two curves. In the worksheet, consider that "happy" means positive. A couple is “happy” when they both like each other. A couple is unhappy when they both dislike each other. Here are the two curves as given in the worksheet.               Plot[{Sin[9 \[Pi] t/10], 2 Sin[7 \[Pi] t/10]}, {t, 0, 20},       AspectRatio -> 0.2, AxesLabel -> {"weeks", "affection"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XpLb0.png) Is there a clever Mathematica way to fill in just those portions of the curve where the couple are happy, I.E. both are positive? Is there a nice way to visualize this?
