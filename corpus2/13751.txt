This is the sets of data I want to put into a form which will allow me to plot error bars from the min and max data.               avg = {{10, 0.662}, {20, 0.96}, {30, 0.916}, {40, 0.787}, {50,0.621}, {60, 0.453}}     min = {{0.55`}, {0.91`}, {0.85`}, {0.72`}, {0.58`}, {0.42`}}     max = {{0.76`}, {1.02`}, {0.99`}, {0.85`}, {0.68`}, {0.51`}}      This following code worked with n=1, creating one point on the graph. How do I make it loop to n=Length[avg] to plot all the points?               errmin = min[[n]] - avg[[n, 2]]     errmax = max[[n]] - avg[[n, 2]]     err = Flatten[{errmin, errmax}]     data = {{avg[[n]], ErrorBar[err]}}          ylabel = "Voltage (V \[PlusMinus] 0.05)"     xlabel = "Blade Angle (\[Degree] \[PlusMinus] 3)"     title = "Preliminary - Altering Blade Angle"     Needs["ErrorBarPlots`"]     ErrorListPlot[data, Joined -> True, InterpolationOrder -> 2,       Mesh -> Full, PlotMarkers -> Automatic,       AxesLabel -> {xlabel, ylabel}, GridLines -> Automatic,       GridLinesStyle -> Dotted, PlotLabel -> Style[title, Bold],       LabelStyle -> (FontFamily -> "Helvetica")]      I should point out I'm new to Mathematica today so please don't be too technical.
