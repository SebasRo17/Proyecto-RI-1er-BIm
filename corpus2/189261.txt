I store large quantities of GPS data in storage tables. Each partition can reach up to 1 million entities. Each GPS entity that is inserted into the table is actually sequential to the previous data inserted, so order matters. Sometimes I need to perform the following query: > _**Get the previous/next 3 GPS entities from the current entity (within the > same partition)._** Options for RowKey design:   1. **Create an incrementing integer.** But how do I track what the current size of the table is? There is no way to get table row count, or to get the last inserted row.   2. **Use DateTime Ticks.** But how do get the previous/next entity using ticks? I'm using the SDK version 2.0 in C#.
