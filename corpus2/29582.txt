I have a function, whose domain is [0,1]. The function is               f = Piecewise[{{Exp[-β * (-Log[#])^α], 0 < # <= 1}}, #]&      with `β > 0` and `α > 0` (side note: is this the best way of defining the function such that it's `Exp[-β * (-Log[#])^α]` on (0,1] and 0 at 0?) I would now like to use the inverse of this function, which I'm pretty sure exists (and is `E^(-(-1)^((1/α)) β^(-1/α) Log[w]^(1/α))`). However,               InverseFunction[f]      simply returns the call and not the actual inverse. At this point I'm not sure whether it's my lousy _Mathematica_ skills that keep me from getting the correct inverse or whether there's something in the math that I've neglected to consider. What am I doing wrong? How do I tell _Mathematica_ to just find the inverse on [0,1] and how do I tell it that both parameters are positive?
