I use SQLyog Community edition and like many other SQL applications out there it puts a 1000 result limit on queries that do not have a limit provided. I am wondering why MySQL doesn't have an _explicit_ `NO LIMIT` option when it comes to writing queries. I'm sure that i'm not the only developer that ends up sticking a large limit on the end (within reason) to get a full display view of the records in the table. Providing the records in the table is sensible i'd like to be able to do: `SELECT * FROM course NO LIMIT;` instead of `SELECT * FROM COURSE LIMIT 2500;`
