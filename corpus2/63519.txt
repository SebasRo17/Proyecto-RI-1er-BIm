I have an idea that I would like to develop as an app. I have no programming skills though. -Can someone point to some resources on how I can hire a reputable company to do the job for me.   * What are important factors I should consider when choosing?   * Any warning signs or red flags that I should be aware of when choosing?   * Can anyone provide cost estimates? I do not have a large amount of capital to invest. Are there companies that would build and come in for a percentage of the app if they feel it would be successful? Thank you all for your time.
