I've written the following code to create a multiple choice button that takes an arbitrary number of answer options and will assign a variable true/false depending on whether or not the correct choice is selected:               mchoice[question_, answers_, correct_, var_] :=      DynamicModule[{x},       Column[{Dynamic[var = (x == correct);], (*problem line *)         Dynamic@          ActionMenu[question,            MapThread[#1 :> (x = #2) &, {answers, Range@Length@answers}]],         PaneSelector[          MapThread[#1 -> #2 &, {Range@Length@answers, answers}],           Dynamic[x]]         }]       ]      The code is executed as below and gives the button:               Clear[avar]     mchoice["argon", {"solid", "liquid", "gas"}, 3, avar]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1PUmc.png) The correctness of the selection is stored in `avar` which I can evaluate at the end of the notebook to "grade" the quiz, if you will. The problem is the presence of `Null` above the button. With the code as written, I cannot seem to create a button that both updates the value of avar and doesn't print the answer. For example, if I substitute `Dynamic[var = (x == correct)]` for the problem line, then the student will know if the chosen answer is correct. If I use `Dynamic[var = (x == correct)];` then the result is visually correct but `avar` will not update when the student selects an answer. I _can_ get the desired result by using `Dynamic[var = (x == correct);] /. {Null ->""}` but that feels like I'm cheating (yes, I'm getting the desired result, but no, I'm not using `Dynamic` correctly). I'm interested in either of the following:   1. A better solution to my (* problem line *)   2. Alternative methods for creating a multiple choice button.
