I read that a lot of people seem to favor the journal, or diary, form to keep notes on their work related activities. I've had a more structured approach myself, which involves outlines and categorization.   While this has its advantages for information retrieval, I find it can become an hindrance when it comes to entries of a broad, subjective or reflective nature. I've been thinking about using a more diary-like format for this purpose, but since I've never held one before, I wonder about what sort of information it would contain. Can anyone give an example of their typical journal/diary entry's content ?   What do you keep notes of, and how do you structure it ?
