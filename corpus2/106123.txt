I recently attended an interview for an IT company. Though the interview process itself was decent, I was shocked by the rather poor working conditions and interior of the office. A few things stood out:   1. The building is located in a shady area of an otherwise bustling mega-city.   2. The interiors are not well furnished. No false roofing with AC ducts, wires and pipelines randomly scattered overhead, no cubicles/desks/partitions, no proper meeting rooms.   3. The workplace had an unpleasant odour.   4. The interview itself was conducted in a makeshift room - almost looked like the safe locker of a bank to me. When I asked if they were in the process of renovating the premises, I was told, "No, that's how it's always been". In fact if I believe my ears, he mentioned that the building used to be a barn before the IT company occupied it. Should I really be worrying about all these aspects of my next employer? Doesn't it clearly hint that they don't have enough funds and interest for the betterment of their own workplace?
