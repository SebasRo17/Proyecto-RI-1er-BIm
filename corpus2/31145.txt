From my Statistics lectures I know the term confidence and prediction interval, whereas the confidence interval is smaller than the prediction interval. If I plot the mean and single prediction bands with the same confidence level in _Mathematica_ , than the mean prediction band is smaller than the single prediction band interval. Anyone who can explain me what are the differences between the `“SinglePredictionBands”` and `“MeanPredictionBands”` which are standard properties from `NonlinearModelFit`?   Or is it just a different terminology for confidence and prediction interval used by _Mathematica_? If no it would be useful if someone can tell me which properties I have to apply for the confidence and the prediction interval.
