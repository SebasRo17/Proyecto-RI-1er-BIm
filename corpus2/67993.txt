Can anyone share any software/techniques they use when showing clients graphical elements, storyboards, elements, etc. for the web project being worked on? I would like to have a way that the client can log in and see updates to what is going on and see the elements that have been created over time of the project. This could be status updates, creative elements, links to prototypes, wireframes, etc. Thank you in advance for any ideas that have worked best for you.
