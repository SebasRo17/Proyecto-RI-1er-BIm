I have a project to develop an inventory system for a medical shop. Till date, I confronted simple requirements which were fulfilled with XML as the backend db. My interaction knowledge with XML is pretty-good and I can make almost anything with XML using LINQ-TO-XML. Since, this is an inventory system, I am bit confused as to which database should I use. Can i stick with XML or proceed with SQL Server 2008. In case I use SQL Server, will I need to install the SQL Server on Client Machine as well. This is important information because SQL Server is a commercial product, hence i need to include this in my project estimation cost.
