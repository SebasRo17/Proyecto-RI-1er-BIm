In our CI environment we build all the cs projects and then build the deployment projects. The deployment projects do an extra step of compiling the aspx & ascx files and often catch errors that would normally be caught at run time. 1) Is there a name for this step or process?   2) Can I get it in the regular project builds?   3) Where can I learn about the various steps of building specifically to msbuild?      Reading the logs in verbose I'd like to have a better understanding of what is actually happening. Thank you.
