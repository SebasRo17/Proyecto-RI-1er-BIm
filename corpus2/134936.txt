To debug my programs I mainly use the following methods:   1. Use printf (or equivalent in other languages) to check the value of a variable after a particular statement or to check whether the program enters a conditional statement or a loop.   2. Use watch/breakpoints when using IDEs. I am able to solve the problems using the above methods. But I have noticed that there are two kinds of builds - debug and release. From the name I can understand that debug build would be helpful in debugging. Also I have read that debug build stores something called symbol table information and stuff. How can I use the debug build for debugging? Are there any other debugging techniques which I should learn?
