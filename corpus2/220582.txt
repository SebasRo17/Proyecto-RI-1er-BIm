I know so little about this that I'm having trouble formulating the question. Apparently due to technical limitations, nastaleeq style of writing Urdu is very difficult, perhaps impossible, given current standards used on the web. I'd like to do a deep dive into why this is so (the technical aspects, at least). My, very rough, understanding is this: Unicode is the standard right now, but it doesn't define how characters look, it only define the names of characters and a numbering system to represent them. "Fonts," such as Halvetica or Times New Roman, actually define the look of characters. What is True Type then, and how is it different from Open Type or Postscript or LaTex? If a language requires that shapes of characters, _and how the connect to each other_ (think cursive), change, based on their location in text...how is that handled? If Unicode is only a representation system and fonts only concern themselves with single characters, where do these location based algorithms go? Is the current set of standards too limited to handle complex cursive style typography? If so, can HTML's canvas be used to create an alternative/experimental "font system?" If I do need to "roll my own" is Knuth's work on digital typography still relevant or are there more modern references?
