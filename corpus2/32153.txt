I'm making C++ program, and in my program I need a rotation matrix around any vector. I wanted to extract `RotationMatrix[fi,{x,y,z}]` output and put it in my program. Unfortunately _Mathematica_ thinks I operate with imaginary components (x,y,z). Because of that the output that I get is in epic dimensions xD. I tried to fix this problem with `RotationMatrix[fi,{Re[x],Re[y],Re[z]}]` but no luck there. Apparently _Mathematica_ doesn't track what type of variable the user defined (real/imaginary). Is there a way to fix this?
