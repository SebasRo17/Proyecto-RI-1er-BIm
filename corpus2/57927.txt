I have a function `c[x]` whose domain and range are both [0,1]. And I have a picture with width `W`, height `H`. Now I want the picture to be compressed horizontally, with `c[x]` being the compression ratio for the part of the picture whose x-coordinate is `x.W`. To achieve this I have to discretize `c[x]`, which could be fussy and problematic. Besides since it's compression, it's hard to decide which row of pixels should be abandoned. So is there any good way to do this?
