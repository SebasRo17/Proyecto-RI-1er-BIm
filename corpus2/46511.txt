I have some questions regarding relations between aggregations, compositions, references (arrow) and simple link (nothing) relations within UML2 ?   1. If A -> B -> C each have composition relationship. Are the root responsable of creation and destruction of the object B and C ?   2. What aggregations have that the simple link or references doesn't ? What make them different ? Thanks. Edit: The question was a bit unclear and not objective. I edited it.
