I'm diving into web development after ten years of desktop development and I have an idea for a Rails website that will rely on users posting short videos (5 -15 mins) they've recorded. The website will be ad-supported and probably won't generate enough revenue to support hosting video based on how expensive I understand it to be, so the idea I had was to allow users to specify a link to the video they recorded and have posted on Youtube. This way, YouTube funds all the resources (storage, bandwidth, etc.) needed for the videos and I simply embed them in my website. My questions are...   1. Is it worth the poor design choice to separate the user's content service provider (in this case, YouTube) from my website in order to save the money it would cost me to host the videos myself?   2. Is there an inexpensive way for me to host the videos myself if the answer to my first question is "No!"?   3. If it's not a bad idea, do you see any other potential problems with this approach? I apologize if this question is absurd in any way, I'm still getting familiar with the workings of web businesses. Thanks so much in advance for your wisdom, I'm going to continue researching my questions right now.
