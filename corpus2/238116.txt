I am currently developing a web application for my thesis.I was asked by my professor to make diagrams to describe the business logic. Since I don't have a prior experience, I am pretty confused with all the terminology. I managed to clarify,I think, what business rules and business logic are, but I can't find out how you describe the business logic. Is it something particular or is it something more general? Do I need to learn UML? Does the fact that I use MVC affects the way I'll describe it?
