I'm building online examination system. I have designed to table, `Question` and `GeneralExam`. The table `GeneralExam` contains info about the exam like name, description, duration,... Now I would like to design table `GeneralQuestion`, it will contain the ids of questions belongs to a general exam. Currently, I have two ideas to design GeneralQuestion table:   1. It will have two columns: general_exam_id, question_id.   2. It will have two columns: general_exam_id,   list_question_ids (string/text). I would like to know which designing is better, or pros and cons of each designing. I'm using Postgresql database.
