For artistic reasons, I want to draw an extremely dense `StreamPlot` with something like a thousand streamlines. I tried setting `StreamPoints -> {Automatic, d}` where $d$ is a small value specifying the minimum distance between streamlines, but after a point reducing the value of $d$ stops having an effect.               GraphicsColumn[      StreamPlot[{-1 - x^2 + y, 1 + x - y^2}, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3},          StreamPoints -> {Automatic, #}, ImageSize -> Medium] & /@ {1, 0.3,         0.1, 0.03, 0.01}]      (click for image) The same thing happens when setting `StreamPoints -> n` for increasing values of $n$, or when manually seeding hundreds of seed points; Mathematica silently refuses to plot any more streamlines. How can I get around this? Is it possible to plot arbitrarily closely spaced streamlines using `StreamPlot`? **Update:** To clarify, I want to keep the style of the fully-automatic default `StreamPlot`, which attempts to maintain a uniform spacing between streamlines, and just make it denser. So I don't want to get rid of the minimum distance entirely; I just want to lower it. To save everyone some time, here is what I find unsatisfactory about all the documented settings for `StreamPoints`.   * `None`: Obviously no good.   * $n$: Stops having an effect somewhere between 50 and 100.   * `Automatic`, `Coarse`, and `Fine`: Not dense enough.   * `{p1, p2, ...}` and `{{p1, g1}, ...}`: See `n`.   * `{spec, d}`: `d` stops having an effect somewhere between 0.2 and 0.1.   * `{spec, {dStart, dEnd}}`: Strangely, increasing `dEnd` plots _more_ streamlines. Compare `{Automatic, {0.5, 10}}` with `{Automatic, 0.5}` and `{Automatic, {0.5, 0.5}}`. I don't understand this setting at all.   * `{spec, d, len}`: When `spec` is `Automatic`, `len` has no effect as far as I can tell. On the other hand, when `spec` is `{p1, p2, ...}`, `len` causes `d` to be ignored completely.
