My personal experience has always been with web applications and lots of "back-end stuff" but recently I've been poking around for some personal projects to widen my knowledge. An obvious thing to look at as I'm in the .net world is WPF but now I read this: WPF has no product manager And from the same guy's blog (he is a former Silverlight Product Manager): > WPF has no investment, it’s kept together by a skeleton crew and its > evangelism / community efforts have little to no funding attached to it. > It’s dead, the question now is how is the corpse going to be buried and no > amount of cheer leading will change that outcome in the near future. Although it won't change my short term plans - should this affect the amount of effort I put into learning WPF? What are my alternatives to look at if I want some up-to-date winapp gui knowledge?
