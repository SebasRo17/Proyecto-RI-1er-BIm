When I want a numerical value with a precision of 50 digits...               N[1.15/(1 - E^-0.2)^2, 50]      Why is Mathematica not able to provide the desired solution? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TnBIo.jpg) And I know that this is irrational and the given solution is not precise and besides Mathematica would provide more digits even if the solution is already precise in other cases. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PIGUS.jpg) So what is the problem here and how can I get more digits?
