Since my son started going to school, I've been noticing a very serious lack of organizations to encourage kids to program or at least letting them know how to get involved in programming. Are there any groups that you know of to help kids out this area?? And I'm not referring to tools to help kids learn, I'm referring to groups that will help in getting kids interested in programming. Here are a few that I know of:   * Dreamspark   * Lego First Robotics   * Imagine Cup Are there anymore out there? And are there any that work at the elementary - high school levels?? Also are there any other parents that have noticed the same thing, or is this local to my area?? Edit: Also I'm looking for groups that encourage kids who don't have programmers for parents. I've got no problem teaching my own son, I'm more worried about the other kids.
