I'm only going on what I've read on SO, so forgive me, but all I read says that one major advantage of Git over Subversion is that Git gives all the source code to the developer locally, not having to do anything on the server. With my limited using of SVN and TortoiseSVN, I had all the source code, or at least I thought I did. For example, I have a website. I upload it to SVN. I am still running my website locally, aren't I? If someone submits a change and I'm not connected, it wouldn't matter if I had Git or not, until I reconnect to the server. I do not understand. I'm not asking for a rehash of one vs. the other except this one point.
