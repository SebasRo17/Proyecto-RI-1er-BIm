I've created my own stylesheet and I would like to install it in the CDF 9 directory, so when I apply it to a new _Mathematica_ notebook and save it as CDF file, it will show it correctly. I used this path in my computer: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Wolfram Research\Wolfram CDF\Player\9.0\SystemFiles\FrontEnd\StyleSheets` but it doesn't seem to work. I tried the same thing with CDF 8 and it works.
