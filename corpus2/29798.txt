I am trying to get a loop structure using `While` to repeatedly evaluate another cell referred to in its body (using a cell tag).               "this is the while construct";     x = 2;     y = 5;     While[x < y,       NotebookLocate["code"];       FrontEndTokenExecute["EvaluateCells"];       x       y     ]      and this is the cell called "code"               "this cell contains the code i want to run";     x = x + 0.1;     y = y - 0.1;      My code seems to enter an endless loop. What I expected was when the two numbers, x and y, became equal, the loop would stop. What am I doing wrong?
