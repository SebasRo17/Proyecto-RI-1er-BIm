Suppose I have a list               mydata = {3, 14, 15, 92, 65}      and in some cases I want to manipulate it as a list, like for reading from and writing to a file, or for operations to be applied to all members.   But I also want to access each member individually, and I like to name the first member `alice` instead of `mydata[[1]]`, and the second `bob` instead of `mydata[[2]]`, and so on. Something like `union` in C. Can _Mathematica_ do this? **edit** (attempt to clarify, on request) In the example I need a way to redefine mydata as               mydata = {alice, bob, cindy, dan, elise}      so that I can access members as               a = mydata[[1]]   (* assigns 3 to a *)     b = bob           (* assigns 14 to b *)      and               mydata[[2]] = 42       elise = 100             results in               mydata == (3, 42, 15, 92, 100}
