> **Possible Duplicates:**   >  When is a BIG Rewrite the answer?   >  Have you ever been involved in a BIG Rewrite? I am at a customer where I have been tasked to fix a number of issues they have in their existing systems. These systems are all quite old and was built in older technologies to really low development standards. All of this makes it quite difficult and frustrating to properly maintain these systems, because of the two thoughts that often come to mind while working on this:   * A. It would have been so much easier / quicker to do this in one of the newer technologies.    * B. I would not have coded this feature like this. There are many better ways to design this application to make it more maintainable and better performing. (examples are bad OO design, code is often repeated, settings are hard coded, etc.. the list is long).  So under the circumstances I try to make the best of it and fix everything to the best of my ability without complaining too much, but my question is now: How do you decide when it is time to rebuild a system with newer technology, versus keeping on plugging holes in an old one? And how do you make a case for rebuilding? How can you persuade the powers-that-be it is necessary to rebuild the system?
