> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to find programming mentor? I've been programming for a while. I've read several books, have tried out several languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, C++, .NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL), and have taken tons of advice and I feel like I have greatly progressed, fast. But I feel like I would've learned more if I had a mentor. Well... not a tmentor. More of someone that can guide me, and somebody that I can ask if I had a problem. Yes, StackOverflow is great, Programmers-SE is amazing, and there are huge community's for languages, but it isn't the same as having a "mentor". So, where can I find one? Like I said, I'm not looking for someone who will teach me everything, or somebody who I will have to meet once a week. Just emails here-and-there. Nothing major. Of course I would _like_ it to be free. But where and who? Is there a website or organization that can help me? Somebody you know? Thanks so much!
