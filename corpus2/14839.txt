So I just started a new position at a great company that is pretty much a dream to work for. The only problem is that there's a steep learning curve for the type of data I will be working with, and my boss/training lead **is never there.** I think he is, after 10 years, experiencing burnout. He's here probably 3-10 hours out of the week, and even then its not a guarantee he's checked-in. I can still contribute in some fashion (I don't need training on programming, per say), but I'm two months in and I still don't feel comfortable in my position due to the lack of one on one time. I can contribute to some projects which I volunteer for, but they're a little outside the scope of my primary responsibilities. I'm worried that the higher ups might view me as slow to adjust. Any suggestions to change this situation? edit: So I took the suggestion in the multiple answers to schedule face time. I did, and it took us about 20 minutes to accomplish a task that should have taken about 5. The reason it took so long? **He was talking about his kid.** FML
