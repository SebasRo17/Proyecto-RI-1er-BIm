I have been programming for a while and I often find myself writing my thoughts down because I've found that it helps me to focus on the solution. It feels like I am wasting a lot of paper. On the other hand, I feel insecure about getting a white board installed in my personal cube because it feels like a whiteboard is more specifically used to discuss solutions with other developers. What is your experience with note taking? Is a whiteboard useful outside of collaborative situations?
