I encounter the following quirk in the Notation package: consider the following ==> and <== declarations               Notation[      ParsedBoxWrapper[RowBox["\[DoubleStruckOne]"]]         \[DoubleLongRightArrow]      ParsedBoxWrapper[RowBox[{"Blade", "[", RowBox[{"{", "}"}], "]"}]]     ]      and               Notation[      ParsedBoxWrapper[RowBox[{"\[DoubleStruckOne]"}]]       \[DoubleLongLeftArrow]      ParsedBoxWrapper[RowBox[{"Blade", "[", RowBox[{"{", "}"}], "]"}]]     ]      the only difference is the Braces in the left hand side `RowBox`. It _only_ works this way. If I use either line with a two-way arrow <==>, it will fail in one direction or the other. Why is that? Do I have to use another Wrapper/Box?
