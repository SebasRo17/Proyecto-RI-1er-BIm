What are the best python programming patterns and practices you are using every day? I don't mean only design patterns (there are lot of OO design patterns that can be used in python), I mean pure coding patterns and practices like:   * the best way to organize modules   * the best way for data parsing (performance wise)   * usage of private functions (does this make sense, because you can access private functions outside the class)   * what are the best modules for GUI, database etc.  Are there any new books or other kind of literature on this matter (2010/2011)? Of course question can not be answered in one answer or one book, I thought of this question like a discussion on this matter because there is not really much written about python programming patterns and it is a very powerful language.
