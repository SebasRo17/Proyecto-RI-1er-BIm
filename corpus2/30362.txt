I am trying to tally and sort the number of consecutive occurrences in a list above a certain value. For instance:               data={55.5, 65.3, 100.3, 100.1, 100.5, 98.7, 75.2, 101.3, 102.1}      The totals for this data set would be {3,2} if the tally criteria were all values greater than 100. As I have worked on this problem, I found the following code:               a = RandomInteger[1, {100}];     Cases[Split[a], {1, ___}] // Tally // Sort      Which is very close to what I am trying to do. In this case, the code provides a sorted list of consecutive integers equal to one. However, I can't seem to modify the decision criteria to only tally values above a certain criteria. How might I go about this?
