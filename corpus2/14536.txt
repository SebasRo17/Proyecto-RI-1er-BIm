I'd like to change the font that _Mathematica_ uses for output by setting the font of the corresponding style in my stylesheet; bit simply overriding the default `Output` style with               Cell[StyleData["Output"],FontFamily->"Open Sans",FontSize->12]      seems to have no effect. Is there a way to do this that I'm missing? Is the style used for output something different? * * * Note that this is not a duplicate of "Set default font for Output", despite the title.
