With _Mathematica_ 7:               LinearProgramming[{1, 1}, {{0, 0}, {1, 1}}, {1, 1}, Automatic, Integers]      gives wrong result `{0,1}`. But               LinearProgramming[{1, 1}, {{0, 0}, {1, 1}}, {1, 1}, Automatic, Reals]      gives correct error: > LinearProgramming::lpsnf: No solution can be found that satisfies the > constraints. From my point of view this is a buggy behaviour, or did I miss something? Can someone confirm this for newer _Mathematica_ versions?
