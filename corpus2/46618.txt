I am trying to solve a linear second order ODE using `DSolve` which involves an arbitrary integer `m`. `DSolve` gives me a solution when I set `m` to a particular integer (I have tried several, including negative/positive, even/odd, and `0`). When I try to use the assumption `m ∈ Integers` and ask `DSolve` to solve this ODE for an arbitrary integer `m`, it does not work. Here is the input:               $Assumptions = m ∈ Integers     testk =        0 == -16 c m^2 Cos[x] k[x] - c (-7 Sin[x] + Sin[3x]) k'[x]             + Cos[x] Sin[x]^2 (m^2 (3 + 4 m Cos[x] + Cos[2 x]) Tan[x/2]^(2 m) + 4 c k''[x])          DSolve[ testk, k[x], x]      > >     DSolve[ 0 == -16 c m^2 Cos[x] k[x] - c (-7 Sin[x] + Sin[3 x]) k'[x] >                   + Cos[x] Sin[x]^2 (m^2 (3 + 4 m Cos[x] + Cos[2 x]) > Tan[x/2]^(2 m) >                   + 4 c k''[x], k[x], x] >   Update: I have realized that the problem is that `DSolve` does not apply any of the global assumptions. Does anyone know how I can make `DSolve` apply the assumption that `m ∈ Integers`? I have tried using `Assuming[,]` to set the assumptions locally but that did not work either.
