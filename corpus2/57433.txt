I'm preparing for MySQL certification, nowadays officially titled:               Oracle Certified Professional, MySQL 5.0 Developer certification      After looking through MySQL forum it looks like most people recommended this book:               http://www.amazon.com/MySQL-5-0-Certification-Study-Guide/dp/0672328127/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1299972594&sr=8-1       Which as far as I learned was the official preparation source at the time when MySQL was controlled by MySQL AB and Sun. Now, however - Oracle officially doesn't recommend this book. To be precise, I don't know what they recommend. I could only find this "value package": http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=532 Can someone who got MySQL certification confirm that this book is what they have used? Also, if there is any other moderately priced study materials out there - please let me know. **Update** I passed second one Monday March 28th. I have to say second exam was more complicated. So I have two exams now and waiting for my package from Oracle. Took me approximately 2.5 week total to prepare for both exams. With 0.5 weeks for 1st and 2 weeks for 2nd. Also - to everyone who wants to take it: read the book thoroughly and go through all questions on the CD that comes with that book! This helps immensely. Questions on the exam are very similar to those on the CD.
