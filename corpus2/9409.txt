I seem to be getting an error whenever I try running this piece of code.                Matrix12[n_] := {{1, 0}, {0, {\[Kappa]1[n]}/{\[Kappa]2[n]}}}      I've already defined the n dependent functions kappa1 and kappa2 but it still doesn't work. I keep getting a 'Tag list in...... is protected'. Is it that this functionality is not supported by the program itself or is my code wrong in how it's written?
