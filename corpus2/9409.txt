As a programmer, you have to interact with your users/customers in some way to both develop and support the software they pay for. > What was the worst experience you've gotten from those interactions? What did you learn from that experience? Why did this situation happen? How can you to avoid it in the future? I'm also interested in best experiences you have, and why they were different from the worst. and how you can reproduce them.
