I have a matrix and am trying to find the normalised eigenvectors of it. I am using the Eigensystem command and am getting a result. There is a normalize command, but as far as I can see this involves applying it to each vector individually. Is there by any chance an option that anyone has come across so that Mathematica does this automatically? Many thanks!
