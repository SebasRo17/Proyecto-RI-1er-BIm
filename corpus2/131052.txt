> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  When do you rebuild an application or keep on fixing the existing one I am currently working on a project that has been in development for the last few years used throughout the organization but the way the project has been coded the maintainability of it is completely shot. Reading the code presents with pages and pages of Anti-Patterns and trying to identify the path of a business workflow takes on occasion days. At this point I would probably classify the software in its current state as "Working by accident" rather then as intended. So I am looking for some wisdom as to the following: At what point would you consider simply dumping the project into an abandonware pile and starting from scratch? P.S. I understand that in a lot of cases organization would consider it cheaper to maintain the existing project.
