Consider the following code to produce the sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_{n+1}$ where $x_i=11\cdots1$ ($i$ digits 1). Is there an easier way to do this?               n = 7     X = Table[Sum[10^i, {i, 0, k - 1}], {k, 1, n + 1}]     R = Table[Mod[X[[k]], n], {k, 1, n + 1}]     X      R      Also, the code defines the list `R` of remainders on division of $x_i$ by $n$. The output of `R` is `{1, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 1, 4}`. **I'd like to do the following:** determine the indexes producing the first two equal elements of `R` (for example, since `R[[1]]=R[[7]]` I'd like to do some math with `X[[1]]` and `X[[7]]`).
