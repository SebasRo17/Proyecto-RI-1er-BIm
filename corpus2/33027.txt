I have a large expression containing many terms like this:               Sin[1/2 ArcTan[(2 Log[5])/(Log[5]^2 - 2)]]      ![Sin\[1/2 ArcTan\[\(2 Log\[5\]\)/\(Log\[5\]^2 - 2\)\]\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mkXBD.png) where a trig function is invoked on a rational multiple of an inverse trig function. I want to expand trig functions such that this term turns into:               Sqrt[1/2 (1 - Sqrt[1 - (4 Log[5]^2)/(4 + Log[5]^4)])]      ![Sqrt\[1/2 \(1 - Sqrt\[1 - \(4 Log\[5\]^2\)/\(4 + Log\[5\]^4\)\]\)\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ScF59.png) It is tedious to manually convert all such terms, so I am looking for a function that is able to do this automatically. Could you help me with it?
