I'm an electrical engineer that was kind of thrust into the digital world and learning as I go. I'm programming a TI processor to do a PID (proportional- integral-derivative) loop, illustrated by this diagram: ![PID loop image from Wikipedia](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g7Rsk.png) I'll also describe it: Negative feedback op-amp, with non-inverting terminal grounded. Input through negative terminal. The feedback loop is an RE series circuit in parallel with a resistor and all that in parallel with a cap. Anyone have any idea how to convert this circuit to C code? I'm a bit out of my element on this and could use the help.
