I have a long expression involving matrices that I derived using the NCAlgebra package. Can I simplify the trace of the expression? For example, say `b` is a scalar (commutes with all) and `x` and `y` are matrices (non-commutative). Can I simplify `Tr[b x.y.y + b y.x.y]` to `2b Tr[x.y.y]` using the properties of the trace? * * * Thanks, that is what I am going for (although I don't quite understand the code) but I only have version 8. The expression is given below, where `e` and `r` are scalars, `q` and `v` are matrices and the double star (`**`) denotes products of non-commutative elements. I've done it by hand, but I want to be able to simplify the trace of this with _Mathematica_ (and others which are much longer).               e^2 q ** q - e r q ** v - e r v ** q + r^2 v ** v -       1/12 e^3 r q ** q ** q ** v + 1/12 e^3 r q ** q ** v ** q +       1/24 e^2 r^2 q ** q ** v ** v + 1/12 e^3 r q ** v ** q ** q -       1/12 e^2 r^2 q ** v ** q ** v - 1/12 e^2 r^2 q ** v ** v ** q +       1/24 e r^3 q ** v ** v ** v - 1/12 e^3 r v ** q ** q ** q +       1/6 e^2 r^2 v ** q ** q ** v - 1/12 e^2 r^2 v ** q ** v ** q -       1/24 e r^3 v ** q ** v ** v + 1/24 e^2 r^2 v ** v ** q ** q -       1/24 e r^3 v ** v ** q ** v + 1/24 e r^3 v ** v ** v ** q
