I need to write a unit test which validates the serialization of two attributes of an XML(size ~ 30 KB) file. What is the best way to provide an input for this test? Here are the options I have considered:   1. Add the file to the project and use a file reader   2. Pass the contents of the XML as a string   3. Create the XML through a program and pass it Which is my best option and why? If there is another way which you think is better, I would love to hear it.
