I'm starting a new project in my head. It will be an events calendar. It will get info from openData sources the local goverment provides and will allow registered users to add aditional events to the calendar. The project is a personal one, and will be used also as a learning tool for me. In the Web side I just know HTML+CSS+PHP, but have never used PHP frameworks like Zend or Symfony, or any CMS systems like Alfresco or LifeRay. Which will a reasonable technology for this one? I know I just can code plain php, but like to learn some new technology, even if the project size seems not to justify the use of a complex tools more apropiate for bigger projects. It's hard to figure where to start just reading and not diggin into the subject, but I will be pleased to hear your opinions.
