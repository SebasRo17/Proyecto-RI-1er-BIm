I'm interested in learning the theory behind facial recognition software so that I can hopefully implement it in the future. Not just face tracking, but being able to recognize individuals. What papers, books, libraries, or source is available so that I can learn more about the subject? I have found libface which seems to use eigenfaces for recognition. If there are any practitioners out there, please share any information that you can. Edit: I found a good post on the subject here.
