I'm trying to digitize some documents, and I came across a very cool app called camscanner app which performs parallax transform and ocr very nicely, now I'm implementing it in mathematica... ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rhjjc.jpg) Given a picture of a business card (taken perhaps at an angle) I'd like to read off the information. I'm trying to solve it in two steps:   1. Calculate the parallax using locators and PerspectiveTransformation[]   2. Clean up the image and OCR with TextRecognize[] Here are sample images to work with: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H2Ksg.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yj5YB.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8fhYT.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VXe2R.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OEcrB.jpg)
