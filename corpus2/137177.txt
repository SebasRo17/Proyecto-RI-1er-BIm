Commented Code > > “Comments are a code smell” > > Best practices in comment writing and documentation Is commenting code useful, or just a waste of time? It seems so trivial but I've partaken in several quite heated discussions on this topic as well as it being a long-standing point of contention between my own learned philosophies and those of our local university. After reading Bob Martin's Clean Code I chugged the "self commenting code" kool-aid and subsequently flew in the face of everything I was taught in my undergrad years regarding commenting my code. Does anyone find thoroughly commenting code good for anything other than obligatorily fulfilling your development group's coding standards? I'm very curious to hear everyone's take on this, from both sides. :)
