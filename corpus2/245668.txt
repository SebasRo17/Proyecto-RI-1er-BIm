So I understand that `thiscall` doesn't really exist in x64 programming. However, I can't really find any definitive explanation as to _where_ the `this` pointer is put to be passed to the callee. Is a x64 `thiscall` like a true `cdecl` call, where `this` is put on to the 'stack' last (on both GCC and MSVC compilers)? **EDIT:** Running through GDB, it appears so. `rdi` held the `this` pointer and `rsi` held the one parameter that particular method had. Is this how it always works?
