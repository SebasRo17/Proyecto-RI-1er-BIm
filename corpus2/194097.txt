One colleague in our team has multiple jobs to do, but he don't focus on the job that is currently the most important. In our team we always discuss the next steps, but he still don't focus on one thing. He always has a reason why he's NOT doing the right thing.   He's with us for 9 month, so we thought this is common with guys newly from university. But the problem gets bigger every week. But we want to give him a chance. How can we motivate him?   What would you guys do with him?
