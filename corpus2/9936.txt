My mathematica script is as follows:               #!/usr/local/bin/MathematicaScript -script          $HistoryLength=0;         $pwf=FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[],FileBaseName[NotebookFileName[]]}];     $parameterfile=StringJoin[$pwf,".dat"];      Export["testcase.dat", {0.333, 100,0, 0, 35.1, 7.02, 0, 2, 1, 5, 10000}];     Export[$parameterfile, {0.333, 100, 0, 0, 35.1, 7.02, 0, 2, 1, 5, 10000}];      * * * ## It is also uploaded **here** All it does is creates a file name from the `NotebookDirectory` and `NotebookFileName` and saves a bunch of data `{0.333, 100,0, 0, 35.1, 7.02, 0, 2, 1, 5, 10000}` to file with generated filename. It runs fine with the front end. However, it doesn't run from a unix terminal which defeats the purpose of having this script. The error that I get is:               > FrontEndObject::notavail: A front end is not available; certain     > operations require a front end.     >      > FrontEndObject::notavail: A front end is not available; certain     > operations require a front end.     >      > StringJoin::string: String expected at position 1 in     > FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[$Failed],         > FileBaseName[NotebookFileName[$Failed]]}]<>.dat.     >      > Export::chtype: First argument     > FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[$Failed],         > FileBaseName[NotebookFileName[$Failed]]}]<>.dat is not a valid file     > specification.      Am I to understand that I will HAVE to use the front end for when I have `StringJoin` operations? The reason I find `StringJoin` useful is that I have 150 different cases varying in parameters and easily identified by file name. If I can have a script to run all these mathematica cases, it would save a lot of trouble. Any help would be appreciated.
