I'm working on an assembly project and I need to write code to switch from text to VGA mode. This is fairly complex and requires setting up a lot of data, so I'd rather not write it myself. Fortunately I found a snippet of code on the internet that does exactly what I want. Unfortunately it does have a copyright notice, but no license is anywhere to be found. I've currently written my own code with the snippet as a reference, but in the end it's basically the same code with different variable names and comments. Then again, with assembly there's only so many ways you can introduce variation in your code. Is it okay if I publish my code with for example a notice that it was inspired by that snippet? Or am I not allowed to do this at all?
