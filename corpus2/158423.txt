I am trying to begin planning of a system that would be both client management, and document management, with tools built in to do analysis on all of the transactions, etc. I'm wondering what are the considerations I need to be mindful of at the beginning stages so that when I need to scale up I haven't shot myself in the foot in the beginning. I also need to make sure that it is mobile accessible and not just traditional web accessible. I've never done a large scale system like this and I have ample time to plan so any suggestions are much appreciated. **Edit** I also need to make sure that the handling of data would be secure because it would be sensitive client data.
