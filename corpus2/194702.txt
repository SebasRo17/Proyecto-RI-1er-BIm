I have a company intranet that utilizes a similar set of data across many different pages and many different methods. Speaking in generalities, is it closer to "best practice" to retrieve a large dataset and filter it for each specific page or method or retrieve many smaller specific sets of data to use? I cannot really test both approaches, as I would like to pick a design approach from the beginning and use it throughout. This is for a redesign. Thanks.
