It would seem to me that the cost of having a team of developers build and maintain all the components necessary to provide routing, workflow orchestration, durability, security and the other features provided by a commercial ESB would be equivalent to, or even more than, licensing a commercial ESB. Other than up front licensing costs and perhaps architectural preference, what are important factors to consider when designing an integration architecture around building a message bus using SOAP services over licensing message bus software from a commercial vendor and integrating your business components with it?
