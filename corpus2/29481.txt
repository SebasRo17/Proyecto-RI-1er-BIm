I have a three-element list which contains inverses of a function `u`, like so:               CEs = {(u^(-1))[0.448165 u[10]+0.551835 u[30]],(u^(-1))[0.296264 u[10]+0.703736 u[30]],30}      I would now like to obtain the ranking of the elements of this list under the assumption that `u` is strictly increasing but struggle even to understand the output of               Ordering@Ordering@CEs      , which gives               {2, 3, 1}      without Mathematica knowing anything about `u`. Could someone explain to me how this ranking comes about and how I might be able to teach Mathematica that `u` is strictly increasing and to order elements under this assumption? In the current case the ordering should be               {1, 2, 3}
