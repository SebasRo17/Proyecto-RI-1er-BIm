First, my regards to all programmers out there who have put their endless efforts in learning and becoming expert, wise, efficient and best. Let me describe my situation. I have just graduated from Electronics and Communication Stream. Though I have more interest in software development and hence I have opted to become a software developer rather than Electronics engg.   1. I have learned C++ and wish to wish to go more deep.   2. I have started to learn OpenGL. Guide me in the following:   1. Is OpenGL good to learn and is it job oriented?   2. Should I learn some other language rather then OpenGL after C++?
