This probably sounds like a funny question from the graybeards out there, but I seriously don't know what I'm supposed to do without the Google to offer help. Long story short, I'm planning on being pulled away for a deployment overseas. Things I can expect from this:   * lots of downtime   * effectively no internet   * probably electricity I will be bringing a laptop with me, but I'm making an assumption that what little internet access I do have will probably be spent talking to my kids and family via Skype and IM. To add to that, the internet overseas is controlled tightly, so no USB sticks, external HD, or connecting my laptop up. What I can see on the screen will be probably all I can take away from it (when or if I have it at all). * * * I'm looking for ideas on things I can download on my laptop for a lengthy time away from the internet. I'm not too concerned which platform, language, or kit I download, since I will have alot of time to get proficient at anything. I really just want a fairly self-contained, well-documented and rich environment that I could download the whole thing and not feel the internet is even necessary to code in it. Am I asking too much in this always-on Internet connected world?
