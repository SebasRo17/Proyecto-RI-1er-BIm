I have html stored in database received from text editors and because of some mistakes in the code the html is not valid, it is missing some closing tags. and due to this I am not able to process this html for some other operations like generating pdfs. So I need to write some code in c# that can check for tags that are missing closing tags and insert a closing tag at the correct place.
