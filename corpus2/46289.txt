I want to plot a 2-dimensional region with constraint $x+y\le N$, i.e., I want to plot a sub-region inside a 2-simplex. As an example:               Module[{n = 300, p = 0.5},     RegionPlot[{y > (1/2)*(n - x) && y + x <= n && y > p/(1 - p)*x},      {x, 0, n}, {y, 0, n}, FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"},      PlotStyle -> {Yellow, Opacity[0.5]}]]      What should I do to transform the region to a 2-simplex? **Edit 1 & 2 & 3** The command above will give you the following plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LhfN1.png) which clearly satisfies the $x+y\le N$ constraint. So I want a coordinate transform that changes the shape of the yellow area into the shape of the red area in the plot below (it is from Matlab): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pMGxD.png)
