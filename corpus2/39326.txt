How can I plot a complex valued function of one real variable, $f(t)$, as $$x=-\Re f(t),\ z=\Im\ f(t),\ y=t \space?$$ My aim is a 3-dimensional path, treating the complex valued function as if it was a two real components vector valued function. For example $e^{it}$ can be visualized as a helix in $\mathbb R^3$, in which, for example, the "east-west" axis ($y$) represents the single real variable: $t$, the "north-south" axis ($x$) represents $-\Re f(t)$, and the "top-down" axis ($z$) represents $\Im\ f(t)$.
