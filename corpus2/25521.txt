I have an expression assigned to a variable. For example:               exp1 = a*x+b      Now I would like to plot it using something like this               Manipulate[      Plot[Evaluate[ex99], {x, 0, 1}],      {a, 0, 1},      {b, 0, 1}]      I can see 'a' and 'b' being properly substituted by 'Evaluate', but Plot does not work as expected. I suspect it has something to do with 'x' substitution. How can I fix that? Thanks!
