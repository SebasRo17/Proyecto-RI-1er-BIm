I need a tool (for in house usage) that will format SQL code (SQL Server/MySQL).   There are various 3rd party tools and online web sites that do it but no exactly how I need it. So I want to write my own tool that will fit my needs. First question is there any standard or a convention for how the SQL code should be formatted? (the tools that I tried format it differently) The second question, how should I approach this task? Should at first convert the sql query into some data structure like a Tree?
