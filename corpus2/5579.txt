How would I perform a chi-square goodness of fit test? I have tried the following, where my data consists of the observed values whilst the data pair contains the correct values. Then I use the `DistributionFitTest` on the data and the data pair.               data = {115, 188, 97};     datapair = {100, 200, 100};     DistributionFitTest[datapair, data]          (* Out= 0.248213 *)      However the result I get is `0.248` and should be `0.216`. Am I doing something wrong? And how would I measure the $\chi^2$ value?
