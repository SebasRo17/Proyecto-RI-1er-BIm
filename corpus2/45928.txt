For some reason when you run Math.exe form windows command line, Mathematica disables the AltGr key. This is _a bit_ annoying since my keyboard locale has the keys [, ], {, }, @, $, \, | located under this key. This makes Mathematica unusable for many novice users. Is there a way to workaround this problem other than switching the keyboard locale? I can switch to US keyboard but my students can not since they have hard enough time finding characters that are typed on the keyboard. Is it possible to get AltGr key to work in Math.exe?
