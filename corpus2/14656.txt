I have a *.dat file in which the contents are basically one giant list:               {1,2,3,4} {5,6,7,8} {9,10,11,12}      and so on. I'd like to read in the first 500 members { } .... { } in to do some computations. The problem is that the file is about 1.5 GB. How does one deal with large files of this type in _Mathematica_?
