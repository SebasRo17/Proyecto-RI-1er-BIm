This is primarily a lein question about setting up a major project and its sub-projects, and is not intended to be a discussion question. Instead, I am interested in either a pointer to documentation or to a Clojure/lein best practices link. I have a municipal property assessments application that splits two master flies into different subset files, depending on whether a billing transfer is taking place or we want to batch update new accounts, rather than making our assessment department enter new accounts once in their system and then again in the tax collection system. My application is going to be large enough, that I can see a common library lein project with support functions, like splitting apart the files, and then individual lein projects that use the common library. Should the lein projects be set up at the same level and support included through the project.clj/core.clj files? Is there an advantage to creating `lein new` projects underneath a major project? Is there a problem with combing all functions in one project? I can probably make my one core.clj contain all flavors of the program, but coming from a C/C++ and Python background, I would prefer to have a lot of little projects.
