I have a question about hashmaps. If you have this hashmap with m slots, and need to map n items to it, and n > m. There will be collisions for sure. But assuming there is simple uniform hashing assumption, this means that the maximum amount of collisions in any spot is the load factor right? The load factor is n/m. But the load factor is probably going to be a decimal, does this mean its a ceiling of the n/m? So if n=6 and m=5, then load factor is 1.2, and the ceiling is 2, so that means the maximum collisions in one spot is 2. Is this right?
