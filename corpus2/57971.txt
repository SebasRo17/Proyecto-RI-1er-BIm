Assume that this built-in function is called `func`. What I want is               func[{f,g},{a,b,c}]      will return the following result:               {{f[a],f[b],f[c]},{g[a],g[b],g[c]}}      I can achieve this by defining a function myself:               myfunc[functions_List, data_] :=          Table[Map[fn, data], {fn, functions}];      But is there some built-in function to achieve the same result? (I have to admit that, after months intermittent reading of `The Mathematica Book` my knowledge is still very limited compared with what exist unknown in the sea.)
