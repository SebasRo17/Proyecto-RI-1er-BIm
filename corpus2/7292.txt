We know about Google's 20% projects, whereby a developer can spend up to 20% of their time on a personal project which interests them. If your employer let you spend 20% of your time on a project that wasn't part of your day-to-day work, would you make use of it? I can think of a couple of reasons why not:   * It would make your normal work take 20% longer (extended deadline)   * You might want to keep your personal idea "personal."
