It was funny for me, and I'm interesting the reaction for this question of the community. It was interview for C++/Qt developer, and question was asked **"What is virtual function"**. Not something like "how polymorphism in C++ works" or "how virtual functions works" but what is. My first thought was to answer "Virtual functions(methods) are methods that have word "virtual" before it's signature", but I explained about how they works =) What do you think, is this a proper formed question? And what will you ask for that question? PS: I hope that this part of stackexchange are proper for this question
