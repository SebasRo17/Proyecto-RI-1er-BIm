Due to the requirement of a project we had to develop a data interchange format with a built in data types. The format served the purpose well in the scope of that project. But I was thinking that does it have any advantages of having a built-in type system (int, long, bool, string etc.) in a more general scope of data interchanging? Take XML as an example. It has been serving the purpose very well, but if XML would have a built-in data type system (forget about dtd/xml schema), would that be of any extra advantage than its currently having? e.g, we generally use xml for serialization, during the operation if we would be able to store the datatype along with the data, would that be more helpful?
