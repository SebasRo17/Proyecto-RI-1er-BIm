I am using `NMaximize` as following code.               NMinimize[{x[1] + x[1]^RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[1, 30]] +      x[2] + x[3] + x[4] + x[5] +      RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[5, 3]] x[5],      RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[5, 3]]*x[1] + x[2] > 3 &&      x[3] > 1 && x[4] > 0 && x[5] > 0 && x[1] <= 1 && x[2] <= 8 &&      x[3] <= 1 && x[4] <= 1 && x[5] <= 2}, {x[1], x[2], x[3], x[4],      x[5]}]      I want to variate random variables for 100 times and capture the optimized data including the maximized function values and all variables for each time.What will be the best way to capture them? of course the situation there is no answer and also unboundedness have to be taken into the account.
