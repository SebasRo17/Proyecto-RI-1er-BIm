Are there any common strategies or design patterns for designing applications that have either the ability to add custom fields to data objects, or for creating your own custom definition of objects. For example, I am thinking of products such as SalesForce, where you can have your own types of information,frameworks such as Expression Engine and the way it handles channels and channel field groups (Example), or How CMSes Like wordpress have the ability to add fields to custom post types.
