I used to think the execution order of `Animate` is the same as `For` until I find:               Animate[var++,{n,0,10,1}];       the var increases while `n` not. But               Animate[var=n,{n,0,10,1}];       the `n` keeps increasing. Why would this happen? If I want a expression which don't contain n to be executed only once in every step, what should I do? (Actually, I want to embed a code in my website using `CDF`. It will be OK if there are other solutions without using `Animate`.)
