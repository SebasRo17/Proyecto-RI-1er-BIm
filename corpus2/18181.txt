I am primarily a web developer and I have a couple of personal projects which I want to kick off. One thing that is bugging me is database design. I have gone through in school db normalization and stuff like that but it has been a couple of years ago and I have never had experience with relational database design except for school. So how you do you approach database from a web app perspective? How do you begin and what do you look out for? What are flags for caution?
