During development, should developers each have their own copy of the database to work on ? Or should there be a common shared development database ? The former will give developers more flexibility. For ex., they can run their own regression tests during development and unit testing without worrying about corrupting the data for other developers. However, it is difficult to maintain for database adminstrators. The latter is easier to maintain (less integration overheads as everyone's working on the same schema) but requires more effort to ensure data sanctity (developers should be careful and not make changes that will impact others).
