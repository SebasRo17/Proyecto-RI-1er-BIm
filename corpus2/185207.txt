I would like to propose a solution to our companies problem with building consistent installers for different environments. Our current process is to build an installer for test, perform testing, update app config, build installer for production. Unfortunately this has lead to issues in the past where the installer was not properly updated etc. What can I suggest as a best practice to mitigate this problem?
