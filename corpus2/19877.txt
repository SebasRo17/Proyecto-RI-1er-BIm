I have plotted the overlapping area of the UnitBox and the triangle function as:               Plot[Evaluate[       Integrate[            Piecewise[{{1, -0.5 <= x < 0.5}, {0, Not[-0.5 <= x < 0.5]}}]             Piecewise[{{x + 1 - a, -1 + a <= x <= 0 + a}, {-x + 1 + a, 0 + a <= x <= 1 + a}}],        {x, -Infinity, +Infinity}]],      {a, -2, 2}, PlotRange -> All]      However, the result has gaps as you can see in the plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/t1wCz.jpg) Why is this happening if the function is continuous? Thanks for your time.
