I am using a very primitive Java that doesn't have Generics, and also I can't use reflection. I want to create a generic list so it would be typed safe (i.e. I only have a list that contains Objects and I want to create a list that contains specific object and not a mix). On the other hand I also don't want to create a different class for each possible list. Is there any other way to do that without the use of Generics?
