I'm currently writing unit tests to test behavior of a method and would like to partially mock the methods calling injected properties. For example:               public void doSomething() {       int complicatedInt = 1 + 1;       if(getProperty().someBooleanReturn()) {         ... etc. ...        }     }      So obviously I want to mock the `getProperty()` method in order to expect the `someBooleanReturn()`. My question is, since I don't want the getter to be visible to other classes, but visible to unit tests, I've currently been making these methods package-private (default scope). Is there a standard for these types of operations? Thanks!
