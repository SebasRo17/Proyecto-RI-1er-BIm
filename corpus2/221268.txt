int *itPins = pins;     for(int i = 0; i < count; i++)     {         ConfigureGpifPinAsGpioOutput(itPins);         itPins++;     }      I have the impression that doing two things in one line is bad practice. This is why I am advancing the iterator outside of the only statement, using it. However, I feel blindly following a rule.   * Is this code less error-prone than if the `++` is inside the function invocation?   * Why?   * Does this rule apply to such ultra-simple cases or is it meaningful only for more complex program structures?
