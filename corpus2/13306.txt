I have a loop which computes a table, `tab`, of results at each iteration. This table is usually very large and I would like to use `PutAppend`or anything of the sort to save the data in a file and therefore saving memory. An example would look like the following:               Put["test.csv"];          Do[tab=RandomReal[{0,1},10];PutAppend[tab, "test.csv"],{5}]      When I import the data in `test.csv` for later use I do this via `data=Flatten[Import[".../test.csv","Data"],1]`. However, the list `data` is not ready to use because typical elements look e.g. like               In[45]:= data[[1]]          Out[45]= "{0.3105121460958056"          In[43]:= data[[2]]          Out[43]= 0.0657094          In[44]:= data[[4]]          Out[44]= " "      Which is a mixture of strings and reals. So my question is: how can I append the table `tab` at each iteration of the loop to a file which later is ready to use as a list of rank two of reals? Thanks for your help.
