I am trying to plot a function that uses the values of a transcendental equation as its input values:               y = Tanh[(2 y + x)/2.5]     z = 2.5 * Log[2*Cosh[(2 y + x)/2.5]]      for $x = [-1.5, 1.5]$. I am a relative newbie to _Mathematica_ , so I am at a complete loss as to how to go about this. I have successfully plotted the transcendental equation itself using `ContourPlot`, and mathematically I know what to do - but I can't for the life of it figure out how to make _Mathematica_ solve these two equations and plot the result. I find the _Mathematica_ notation to be somewhat cryptic, but I really love the results, so I want to get good at it. Can somebody help?
