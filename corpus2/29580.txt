Mathematica 9 on Ubuntu 12 renders fonts very poorly. Text is readable, but it makes it very hard to concentrate on programming. Since smoothing on Ubuntu on low DPI screens isn't very good either, I turned it off and have been using fonts that are friendly without smoothing (e.g. Courier New). Mathematica completely ignores this fact and smoothes them anyway (in some proprietary way that seems to be different from the way how ubuntu smoothes them (when smoothing is system-wide enabled)). Is there any option how to modify/disable this behavior ?
