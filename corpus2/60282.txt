Programming languages are formal languages, but unlike many formalisms, they also have certain inherent _meaning_ defined by their operational semantics, or, in the case of markup languages, presentation semantics. And programming languages, though indeed formal, are very similar to natural languages, in terms of the communication they allow. While the development of programming languages is artificial, the natural- language processes of evolution, borrowing, intermixing, and mutation all have fairly clear artificial counterparts. So I'm wondering: has there ever been any large-scale, in-depth research into the evolution and behaviour of programming languages _from a linguist's perspective_ ?
