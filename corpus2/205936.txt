Normally TCP/IP Sequence and Acknowledge numbers are 32 bit. However, I need a way to shorten them to be 24 bit (it's an experiment in deep inspection firewalls). Question: Is it possible to shorten the bit resolution of the Seq/Ack numbers in windows without the knowledge of the application? (which in this case is IIS) I want to use those top 8 bits to store some session information.
