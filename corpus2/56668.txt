I have to make a matrix which contains elements in an ellipse shaped region, but I need to make ellipse region in such a way that larger axis of ellipse is inclined with angle Î¸ with horizontal. With `Colorize` the matrix should look like this: ![](http://i.imgur.com/sYh3nHw.png) I have employed two ways so far for this:   * Use `Graphics`, followed by `MorphologicalComponents` and then use `Position` to get a list and then convert it into matrix.   * Write the equation of an inclined ellipse as `f[x,y] = 0` and then use condition `f[x,y] <= 0` and run it on matrix coordinates to get the list and then finally convert it into matrix. However, these two methods are a bit slow and I would like to use something like `DiskMatrix` or any other way to make it faster.
