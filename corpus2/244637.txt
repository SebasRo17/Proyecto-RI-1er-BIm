I am working in sprint. At the end of sprint I need to send a defect report per sprint. Considering the below scenario please let me know your views. Two teams(A & B) are working at different locations in Sprint-2 and I am a tester from Team-A and report the defects for the items developed by Team-A in each sprint **Question**   1\. I reported few defects in Sprint-2 for the functionality developed by Team-B in previous sprint. Do I have to consider this as observation or defect and report to Team-A?    2\. I reported 5 defects of Sprint-2 for the functionality developed by team-A. All the defects are fixed and closed by me in the same sprint. Before the end of sprint I observed 2 defects got reopened for some reason. Now the defect count should be 5 or 7(5+2) should be considered for this sprint? Thanks   Khan
