I have three coupled second order ODE's given as below      $x''[t] = -c_1*y'[t]-c_2*z[t]-c_3$   $y''[t] = -c_4*x'[t]$   $z''[t] = \frac{c_5}{c_6}*x[t]-c_6$   where $c_i$'s are know constants. The boundary conditions are      $x[-1]=x[1]=y[-1]=y[1]=z'[-1]=z'[1]=0$. I followed the example given here How do I solve coupled ordinary differential equations?               {x, y, z} = {x, y, z} /.              Dsolve[{x''[t] == -c1*y'[t] - c2*z[t] - c3, y''[t] == -c4*x'[t],                z''[t] == -c5 + c5*x[t]/c6, x[-1] == 0, x[1] == 0, y[-1] == 0,                y[1] == 0, z'[-1] == 0, z'[1] == 0}, {x, y, z}, t] //             FullySimplify // First      I get the following output      > >     ReplaceAll::reps: {Dsolve[{x''[t] == -c3 - c2 z[t] - c1 y'[t], <<8>>}, > {x, y, z}, t]} >      is neither a list of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and >      so cannot be used for replacing. >   >     Set::shape: Lists {x, y, z} and {x, y, z} /.
