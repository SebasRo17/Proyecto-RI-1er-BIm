I saw a job opening where the requirement was for a developer to develop CAD tools using C++ and OpenGl libraries. I am a civil engineer and want to be part of such a projects so I thought to learn C++ and some libraries which could help me to move forward for such job opportunities. I know a bit of C++ but I am quite unfamiliar with these libraries(qt, openGL). Can somebody tell me/guide me which is the most suitable library and most required library to develop such applications?
