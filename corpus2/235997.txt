I'm working on website for the game of bridge and I am process to designing the table to store the bidding. Shortly about the bidding. 4 people at a table will bid clockwise until 3 players has passed so it could be many rotations of bidding with a one of the four to start the bidding like this:               North East South West     Pass  1H   Pass  1NT     Pass  3H   Pass  3NT     Pass  Pass Pass          North East South West                      1C     1S    Pass 3S    Pass     4S    Pass Pass  Pass      So obviously I need save each bid in sequence but I have a few options how to design this. Could have a table like this and just keep adding an entry per round needed: Round, NorthBid, EastBid, SouthBid, WestBid Or: Sequence Number, Who, Bid Might be some other alternatives but I would like to get some input on the best approach designing the table structure for data like this.
