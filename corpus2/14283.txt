I want to solve following linear equations: \begin{align*} 3 x - y &= 0\\\ y + 2 z &= -1\\\ x + y + z &= 3 \end{align*} The output will be `{x == 7/5, y == 21/5, z == -(13/5)}` I don't know the way of solve this. What function can be used. How can I solve this? Also it will be very thankful if you let me know the ways as many as possible. Also especially, is there any specific way that using 'LU decomposition' to solve this equation??
