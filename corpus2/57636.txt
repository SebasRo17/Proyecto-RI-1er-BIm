The original system of equations reads: $\begin{cases} f'(r) + f(r) \left(a(r) - \frac{1}{r}\right) = 0,\\ f^2(r) + a'(r) + \frac{a(r)}{r} - 1 = 0\,, \end{cases}$ with boundary conditions $f(0) = 0\,,\,\, f(\infty) = 1\,.$ I know that it allows non-divergent nontrivial solutions $\left(0 \leq f(r) \leq 1\,,\,\, f(r \to 0) \sim r\right.,$ and approaching exponentially to $1$ at large $r$$\left. \right)$. Due to the boundary condition at infinity I tried the following change of variables: $r = \frac{1}{x} - 1$, which transforms it to the following system: $\begin{cases} -x^2 f'(x) + f(x) \left(a(x) - \frac{x}{1 - x}\right) = 0,\\ f^2(x) - x^2 a'(x) + a(x) \frac{x}{1 - x} - 1 = 0\,, \end{cases}$ with boundary conditions $f(0) = 1\,,\,\, f(1) = 0\,,$ which Matematica (NDSolve) can't solve:               NDSolve[{-x^2 f'[x] + f[x] (a[x] - x/(1 - x)) == 0, f[x]^2 - x^2 a'[x] + a[x] x/(1 - x) == 1,             f[0] == 1, f[1] == 0}, {f,a}, {x, 0, 1}]      One can eliminate $a(x)$ to obtain a 2nd-order differential equation for $f(x)$: $f^2(x) + x^4\left( \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)^2 - x^4 \frac{f''(x)}{f(x)} +x^3\left( \frac{1}{1 - x} - 2\right)\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} - 1 = 0\,,$ for which NDSolve again has no answer:               NDSolve[{f[x]^2 + x^4 (f'[x]/f[x])^2 - x^4 f''[x]/f[x] + x^3 (1/(1 - x) - 2) f'[x]/f[x] - 1 == 0,           f[0] == 1, f[1] == 0}, f, {r, 0, 1}]      Any suggestions how to solve this problem in Mathematica (and not Matlab)?
