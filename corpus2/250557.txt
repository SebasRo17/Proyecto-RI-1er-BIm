I'm not quite sure how easy it is to fetch the binary composition of a file, but suppose we have some file with this representation: 010011 We could make 2 arrays. One which stores the position of the 0s: ['x', '', 'x', 'x', '', ''] And another which stores the position of the 1s (which is simply the opposite of the previous array): ['', 'x', '', '', 'x', 'x'] Then we can persist these two arrays into a file, and voila? I don't know, is there something i'm not realizing? I'm not an expert in compression, was just wondering if this would work.
