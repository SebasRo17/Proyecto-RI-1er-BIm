I use Mathematica 8 and am working with DynamicModule. I'm trying to enter a function in an InputField then later apply it to two values entered in subsequent Input Fields. The function just does not seem to be dynamically applying to the new values I input. The issue probably lies in my definition of the function.                    DynamicModule[{dydx = Null, xi = Null, yi = Null},            Deploy[            Panel[             Grid[Transpose[{{"Differential equation: (dy/dx)=", "x:", "y:",              "slope:"}, {InputField[Dynamic[dydx]], InputField[Dynamic[xi]],             InputField[Dynamic[yi]],              InputField[               Dynamic[Function[{x, y}, Dynamic[dydx]][Dynamic[xi],                 Dynamic[yi]]], Enabled -> False]}}]]]]]
