Im wondering how can I formulate a function which receives input in the string format `"day.month.year hours: minutes: seconds"` (for example, `"10.12.2012 3:25:05"`) and returns the time in the form of `{year, month, day, hour, min, sec}`. I guess a start is                datelist[{"10.12.2012 03:25:05", {"Day", "Month", "Year", "Hour", "Minute", "Second"}}]      but how do I continue?
