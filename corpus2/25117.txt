`Integrate[m^2/((x - m^2)^2 + y^2), m]` mathematica gives me a complex-valued reuslt, but maple 17 gives me what I want. ![maple result](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TXAz5.png) I tried using assumptions, but it doesn't work. In MMA, is there a general way to do integrations in real domains, just like maple. Can this wrap bulit-in command proposed by Todd Gayley (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4198961/what-is-in-your-mathematica-tool- bag ) do the trick?               Message[args___] := Block[{$inMsg = True, result},         "some code here";         result = Message[args];         "some code here";         result] /; ! TrueQ[$inMsg]      Perhaps the reason for the complex-valude result is the invovled power calculation during the integration, so maybe what I really need is a general way to do symbolic power calculation in real domains? ComplexExpand doesn't work as in the post integration on real domain only!. thanks :)
