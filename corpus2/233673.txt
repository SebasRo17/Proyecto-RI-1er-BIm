If Java is a general purpose language, and building a program is something that can be described using the Java language, why isn't this the best way to write build files and instead we use tools like Ant, Maven, and Gradle? Wouldn't that be more straightforward, and also remove the need to learn yet another programming language? (BTW - this question can also be applied to other languages, like C#)
