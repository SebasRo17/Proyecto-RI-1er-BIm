I have a transient problem of pressure disipation. I want to plot severals 3D plot but I have a problem with colours. **Case:** One of my `ListPlot3D` presents pressure at time 200 day and the maximum pressure is about 200 kPa in the center of the plot. The secound plot presents pressure at time 1000 day and the maximum pressure is about 1 kPa in the center of the plot. But in the first and in the second plot the maximum value is red. **Question:** How do I set the coulour scale so that it will be always the same i.e. the range of red colour will be about 200 kPa and purple about 0 kPa. Because now in the first plot red colour is 200 kPa and in the secound plot red is 1 kPa.
