I've a web application uses `MongoDB` as primary database. This is the first project I do with a NoSql db, I'm trying to create the application model but I'm confused. I know NoSql are non-normalized and it is normal to replicate data avoiding joins (that are not supported) but I'm now thinking at this scenario: I have the `User` class containing email address and the user can change it in the profile page. This email address is displayed in few pages in different environments and I think the right choice is to embed this property in few class documents (ex.: product subscription, invoice, shopping cart, ... ). What if the user change his email address? Have I to trigger multiple updates to change every collection, every document embeds this property?
