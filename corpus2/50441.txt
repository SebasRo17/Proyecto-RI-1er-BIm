here is the silly question of mine, if `mathematica` takes `3` seconds to evaluate the function `f[3]` then I plug the this value `f[3]` into a new function `g[f[3],f[3]]`, Let's ignore the evaluation time for the new function `g`, how long does it take for `g[f[3],f[3]]`, 3 seconds or 6 seconds? if it is 6 seconds, how can I make `mathematica` temporarily to remember the value of `f[3]` thanks
