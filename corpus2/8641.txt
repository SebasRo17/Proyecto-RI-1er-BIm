I usually export graphics from Mathematica as PDFs which I tweak with Adobe Illustrator. When most plots are exported from Mathematica as PDFs they contain a large number of mostly useless clipping masks. See:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}]      ![Mathematica graphic](http://i.imgur.com/iyZnY.png) https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3730003/pi.pdf All the clipping masks can be removed from this PDF with no effect on the look of the plot. Is there a way to have the PDF exported without clipping masks or somehow remove them automatically after export, ideally with _Mathematica_? Note: in some cases (see below) the clipping masks are needed but I don't need a smart solution, if I can get it of all the clipping masks, useless and useful thats fine.               Plot[Sin[x], {x, -2 Pi, 2 Pi}, PlotRange -> {{-Pi, Pi}, All}]
