Consider an USB device that is receiving data over a wireless network and an application running on the PC is reading this data. Now, on many languages (consider C# DataReceived), we have event handling mechanisms to detect if Data has arrived or not. My question is, how is this event detecting mechanism implemented? Is it like, a running timer which periodically checks to inspect arrival of data, or is this something the hardware has to support? In general, how are these changes in hardware state events implemented?
