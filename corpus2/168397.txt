I work alone in some iOS projects in a local environment. I have been thinking in a way to be able to share my development environment between my Mac Mini and my MacBook. I mostly work at home in the Mini but sometimes I need to do a demo or work outside and I would like to have the development environment mirrored in both. I have think in using a virtual machine (via VirtualBox) with just my development tools installed. Then I could synchronize that VM with some software between both computers so I will always have the exact environment no matter what computer I use. Is there any good reason not do do this way? I have not used virtualization too much so I have no background on the subject. ¿What about licenses?¿Is there need to have duplicated licenses in both VMs? This are my requirements: -Don't need to setup two environments. Just setup one and have the job done in the other(installing or updating apps, change settings, etc). -Don't depend on having a connection when working away from my home. My basic setup will be:   * Mac Mini: i7 dual Core, 8Gb. OSX Mountain Lion Host OS:   * MacBook: 2.4 Core 2 Duo. 4Gb. OSX Lion Host OS.   * Virtual Box with Mountain Lion guest OS in both machines.   * XCode5, Simulator, Texwrangler, MAMP, etc.
