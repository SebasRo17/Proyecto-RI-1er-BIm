I'm trying to figure out a way to capture the system audio of an Android and/or Windows Phone. The idea is to provide a stream based on the music I'm currently playing on my phone. What I'm not sure about is what the best approach would be for sending the audio. Preferably I'd like to capture all the device audio (same as when connected to a bluetooth device). But I'm not sure whether this is possible with Android or Windows Phone. For Android I found this article http://xzpeter.org/?p=254, he states this is'nt possible without making your own Android build. Which isn't an option for me. For Windows Phone I can only find ways to capture audio from the mic. Not directly from the system. The only alternative I can come up with is to let the app provide all the audio, meaning I would have to build all the basic mediaplayer functionality into the app. But this would mean I have to put much more work into the app, and I wouldn't be able to use other apps like Winamp and YouTube to provide audio. Did I maybe overlook a way to capture all the audio of the device? Or maybe there's a way to capture audio from specific applications? **Edit** After doing some more research, I really doubt I can capture all system audio. Or maybe it's possible to simulate an bluetooth audio device? For the Windows Phone I was going for the alternative solution: selecting songs which would then be streamed to the server. But it seems that for Windows Phone it's not even possible to get physical access to the songs: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16251400/stream-a-xna-framework-media-song- to-a-server
