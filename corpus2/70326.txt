I am planning to do a Ph.D in software security. My school is giving a full scholarship for "Detecting security vulnerabilities from source code and binary code" project. Is is worth taking it? I feel software security is a bit saturated field, I mean there are already lots of software vulnerability detection tools available in the market. Is this still a viable research field? Is software security a solved problem?
