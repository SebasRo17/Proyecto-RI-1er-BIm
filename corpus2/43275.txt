I have set of statements               sol[ξ_] := NDSolve[{D[f[η], {η, 3}] + f[η] f''[η] + β (1 - (f'[η])^2) == 0,         f[0] == 0, f'[0] == 0, f''[0] == ξ}, {f[η]}, {η, 0, 5}]          β = 0;          DFEnd[ξ_?NumericQ] := D[f[η] /. sol[ξ], {η, 1}] /. η -> 5          SOL1 = FindRoot[DFEnd[ξ] == 1, {ξ, 0.5}]          plt1 = Plot[Evaluate[D[f[η] /. sol[ξ /. SOL1], {η, 1}]], {η, 0, 5},        PlotStyle -> {Red, Thick}, PlotRange -> All];      This is working fine, but what I want is to have a For loop in which my Beta starts from lets say 0 and i increase it to 0.25 everytime till 1 and block of code is executed. Then I can use Show[plt[1],plt[2],plt[3]...] command to add up every graph. is this can be done?
