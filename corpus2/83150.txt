If you deprecate something, are you guaranteeing you will get rid of it in the next major release? Is it reasonable to take two or three releases before you get rid of it completely? Update: Thanks for the answers. Java is a good standard for how to do this - any others? Any examples from Microsoft's APIs? Update2: It seems like in "Microsoft-ese," deprecation means "it's going away in the next release." Which was part of my confusion; others don't endow the word with this meaning.
