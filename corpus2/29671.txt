I have been contracted to modify an application for a software company and the source code is quite frankly, a mess. It's not commented much and the author is inconsistent with coding conventions. The guy seems experienced , but his style isn't great. What do you suggest doing to get the project done properly and to make thing easier? **Edit** I didn't mean to say _rewrite_ , I've been hired to modify the the UI in a certain part of an app. I don't think that the client cares so much abut what I do to the source code , so long as it works and so long as it's decent quality code. That said, I've expanded some > if(condition) ? TrueResult : FalseResult; for readability. While I don't think those particularly make bad code, there is an inconsistency in the style throughout the code and a few "left over" constants that don't seem to be used anywhere. There are also some arbitrary numbers where constants would Have been wise for readability's sake. It's not as bad as I initially had thought, but I still have some questions for the original developer.
