I am working on improving my architect / senior engineer skills. In particular, I want to focus on "getting lost in the weeds" - spending a lot of time on a problem while a better solution could have been achieved and "not seeing the forest for the trees" - missing the big picture and only providing part of the functionality - issues. What is some recommended reading/source material that can help me along?
