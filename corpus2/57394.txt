I'd like to create a list of triplets $(x,y,z)$ which satisfy the following properties: $$0<x<1/2 \\\ 0<y<1/2-x \\\ -1<z<-2(x+y)$$ Basically I would like to uniformly generate random points inside a pyramid which is what these inequalities represent. I'm not sure how to place these restrictions on the RandomReal command or how to tell _Mathematica_ to exclude points that do not satisfy these conditions. Any help? Thank you.
