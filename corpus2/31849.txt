How can I produce a fill (in a plot) that extends between two given abscissa values, and "infinitely" in the ordinate direction? (Of course, here "infinitely" just means "up to the top and bottom boundaries of the plot, _whatever those may be_ ".) I thought that `RegionPlot` would do the trick, but no: `RegionPlot` requires that the extent of regions be fully specified in both directions; e.g. it does not understand a third parameter having a form anything like `{y, -Infinity, Infinity}`. EDIT: Let me clarify the question. _Just as an example_ , imagine that I have a random bunch of `Graphics` objects displayed together: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JzKKK.png) OK, now, I want to show a vertical shaded band between `x=-1` and `x=1`. Conceptually, this is a very simple, commonplace idea, but to do it with _Mathematica_ one must suffer a little... Note that for the desired modification only two parameters are relevant: the abscissas of the edges of the region of interest. _Any_ $y$-dimension information is completely extraneous to the problem, and can only complicate or sharply reduce the generality of the original figure. I was not able to find any way to do what I want to do that did not require specifying extraneous, irrelevant parameters. For example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/smZzc.png) Why did the aspect ratio change? Who knows. More importantly, notice that for `RegionPlot` I had to specify the _irrelevant_ range parameters `{x, -5, 5}` and `{y, -1, 6}`. These parameters are, in fact, worse than irrelevant: they actually mess up what was there before. For example, now the content-agnostic `All` spec in the pre-existing `PlotRange->{{-5, 5}, All}` parameter, and the also content-agnostic `PlotRangePadding->0.5` specification, no longer work. I have to replace the first one with a fragile, hard-coded vertical range specification, and fuss with the second one: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hQilm.png) My hope is to find a way to achieve the same effect that is less disruptive, and that it does not force me to specify irrelevant or excessively specific parameters.
