I am working on a very small project and my design would be using technologies such as JSP, servlets, and POJOs. I'm considering a workflow where a JSP page will receive input data, then submit it to a servlet. The servlet would then have a lot of helper POJOs in it that would do all the real work. One thing I've noticed with this approach very early on is that it grew into a huge number of if-then-else statements. Is there a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do without having to resort to a framework?
