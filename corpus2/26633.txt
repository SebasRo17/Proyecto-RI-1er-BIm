I'd like to evaluate the following numerical integration using _Mathematica_ $$ \ \int_0^T\int_0^\infty xe^{-0.04 s}g(x,s) dxds\ $$ where g(x,s) is a Gaussian copula function with say, marginal exponential distributions with parameter A and parameter B (i.e. X~exp(A) and S~exp(B)). In the following MMA attempt, the g(x,s) is defined by GE[Theta,A,B]. This is what I've tried so far:               GE[Theta_, A_, B_] := CopulaDistribution[{"Binormal", Theta}, {ExponentialDistribution[A],ExponentialDistribution[B]}];          Delta = 0.04; A = 0.10; B = 10; Theta = 0.9; T=5;     GExpExp[x_,s_] := PDF[GE[Theta, A, B], {x, s}]          NIntegrate[Exp[-Delta*s]*x GExpExp, {x, 0, Infinity}, {s, 0, T}]       and the following is the error I obtain: * _NIntegrate::inumr: The integrand 1.1547 E^(-10 s-0.1 x-s [Delta]+2 InverseErfc[2 \ Plus[ <<2>>]]^2-1.33333 (0.707107 InverseErfc[<<1>>]-Power[<<2>>] \ InverseErfc[<<1>>])^2)_ x has evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{0.05`,36},{0.5`,1}}. >>* I then try to integrate the expression with respect to only one variable, in this case I chose variable x, so that I'd end up with a univariate expression (and hence I might be able to work on a simpler problem from then on)                 Integrate[Exp[-Delta*s]*GExpExp1[x, s], {x, 0, Infinity}]            (* 11.547 E^(-10.04 s + 1.33333 InverseErfc[4 - 4 E^(-10 s)]^2) *)      It seems that eventually I still have to deal with the Inverse[NormalDistribution] function, which I think is the source of this issue. I then continued with the following:                 T = 5;        Assuming[s > 0, LaplaceTransform[NIntegrate[11.547005383792516` E^(-10.04` s + 1.3333333333333337` InverseErfc[4 - 4 E^(-10 s)]^2), {s, 0, T}], s, T]]            (* NIntegrate::inumr: The integrand 11.547 E^(-10.04 s+1.33333 InverseErfc[4+Times[<<2>>]]^2) has evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{1.,2}}. >>  *)      It could be because the function does not converge, but even after reducing the limit interval from [0,T] to [2,3] (and of course changing T to 5 instead of 2) I still can't obtain a number. Does anyone know the correct syntax that I should use so that I can obtain a numerical answer eventually? Your assistance is much appreciated.
