Working on a problem that uses the percent change formula:               percent change =  100 * [(new value - old value) / old value]      How would I explain the difference if `new value or old value = NULL`, rather than `0` to someone who might not be a programmer? My boss is wondering why there is an empty string in the TextBox rather than a value, because we have the old value, but not the new value.
