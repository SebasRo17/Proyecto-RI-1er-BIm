Imagine the following scenario: user A is developing a project with documentation in workbench. She wants to share her (unfinished) work with a small group (4-5) of users (B,C,D,E) , so that all users can work on the project simultaneously. The users might have different operating systems and work in different places, connected on internet. The users have heard that WB supports CVS technology, but they know next to nothing about it, assuming that it is the right thing to use. The users have Workbench (not Eclipse + WB plugin or other fancy setting) and would like to stay that way. So what is the best way to accomplish all this with Workbench? Please assume that the users only know Mathematica and Workbench and little else in this field, and that they would prefer to use WRI tools only. There is a similar question here in MMA.SE, but it looks to me more like a high level discussion between experts and does not seem to be very helpful for absolute beginners in this area
