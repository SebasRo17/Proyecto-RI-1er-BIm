I am curious as to how dynamic web applications play with content delivery networks such as cloudflare, amazon cloudfront, etc. I understand the concept of a cdn obtaining a cache of your static pages and then serving those pages from their various servers relative to where the request is coming from. However when it comes to applications that are database heavy that require user sessions, allow for searches, and other user interaction is a cdn still useful? If the answer is yes, does the cdn crawl your server and create caches of all of the pages that could be created dynamically? If this is true then how is sensitive data handled? (For example if your application is pulling profile information specific to a user that only that user should have access to.)
