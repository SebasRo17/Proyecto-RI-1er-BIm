If I have:               Graphics[       {Red, EdgeForm[Directive[White, Thick]],        Inset[Style[Text@"Hi!", 44], {0, 0}]}, Background -> Black     ]        I unfortunately get:   ![hi](http://s13.postimage.org/63ji6ifh3/temp.jpg)   Which as you can see does not have a thick white outline. Is there a way to get around this since `EdgeForm` clearly does not work? By the way, I would rather NOT delve into making a larger, white `"Hi"` and then putting the red one on top. That's just not elegant. MMA 8.0.1 for students   OS Windows 7 64-bit
