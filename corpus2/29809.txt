I recently got a trial version of both Mathematica 9 and MATLAB 13a for Windows. I was stunned by the performance difference in the Windows and the Mac version. It was a simple test in matrix multiplication. Here's the code:               a = RandomReal[{0,1},{1000,2000}];     b = RandomReal[{0,1},{2000,3000}];     Timing[a.b;]      On Windows, **running on VMWare Fusion** , the above code takes 0.17 second to complete, more or less same as MATLAB. But on the Mac, it takes 1.8 seconds, or 10 times longer to complete the calculation. Something is terribly wrong here. What can be the explanation for this discrepancy? (I have 12GB free RAM on my 2012 Mac Mini so we can rule out memory shortage). **Edit:** here some benchmarking information. Windows is running in Bootcamp in the benchmark, not from VMWare Fusion:                                               Mac        Windows                                     -------    -------     Data Fitting                    0.666      0.468     Digits of Pi                    0.711      0.733     Discrete Fourier Transform      1.082      0.874     Eigenvalues of a Matrix         0.737      0.608     Elementary Function             1.072      0.780     Gamma Function                  0.532      0.655     Large Integer Multiplication    0.518      0.608     Matrix Arithmetic               1.         1.108     Matrix Multiplication           0.841      0.562     Matrix Transpose                0.889      0.842     Numerical Integration           1.083      0.764     Polynomial Expansion            0.118      0.094     Random Number Sort              1.459      1.061     Singular Value Decomposition    0.751      0.671     Solving a Linear System         0.767      0.655     ------------------------------------------------     Total Time                     12.226     10.483     Benchmark Result                1.132      1.320      Mathematica on Mac seems to be a good 20% slower than on Windows.
