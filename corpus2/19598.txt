I have two independent ODE systems.               A = NDsolve[..., {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}];     B = NDsolve[..., {a, b}, {t, 0, 10}];      I can draw a `ParametricPlot` from one ODE. That is,               ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{x[t], y[t]} /. A], {t, 0, 10}]      I wonder if I can draw a `ParametricPlot` from the two independent ODE systems. That is a `ParametricPlot` of `x[t]` taken from A and `a[t]` taken from B.
