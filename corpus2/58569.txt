I can generate an fBm process:               tlow = 0;     thigh = 1;     len = Sqrt[thigh];     tinc = 0.01;     hurst = 0.4;     DataZ = RandomFunction[        FractionalBrownianMotionProcess[hurst], {tlow, thigh, tinc}, 1];     dataz = Flatten[DataZ[[2, 1]]];      In the following post: Computing the Hurst exponent or fractal dimension of fractional Brownian motion it is described that you can use FindProcessParameters to estimate the Hurst exponent:               FindProcessParameters[dataz, FractionalBrownianMotionProcess[h]]      The documentation says that you can use the ProcessEstimator options... but it does not say which one you can use... I am guessing that such options would be similar to Box counting, Takens estimator, etc. What are the ProcessEstimator options that can be used with FractionalBrownianMotionProcess?
