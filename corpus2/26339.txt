I am trying to parallelize my script. Here is a MWE of how I have done it:               LaunchKernels[2];          container = {};     SetSharedVariable[container];          fun[x_] := 2*x;     container = ParallelTable[{i, fun[i]}, {i, 1, 3}];      I am unsure if this is done correctly. There are mainly two things I am concerned about when using `ParallelTable`:   1. Is it necessary to parallelize the expression to be looped, i.e. `fun`?   2. Is it necessary to make the `container` with the `ParallelTable`-results a shared variable?
