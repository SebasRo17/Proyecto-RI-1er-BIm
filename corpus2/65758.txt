Well, the questions said itself. In my workplace those cases happen, but also, many Agile books promote working in the same workplace and being concentrated in the current project to become faster in the pace of work. Maybe i'm not that informed about the topic, maybe is not that strict but, that's why I wanted to know what does Agile proposes in cases like those. Anybody?
