Hi I had today my first interview for a position of android developer.In my portfolio I had a php e-commerce application that has a catalog , ajax powered shopping cart , and administrator functionality. Because my Android knowledge is prety limited , I only started learning about 3 weeks ago , I was asked to migrate my current PHP web appplication to Java Web until April 19th when the second stage of the interview will take place , so they can asses how fast I can learn a new technology. I have no experience with Java working on the web so I do no know where to start. After a bit of research I found that for developing website with Java usually you use JSP, Spring or Struts. I would like a recommendation on witch one should I learn to quickly get started on migrating the web application to Java and some resources that do not get into to mutch details just enought to get started.
