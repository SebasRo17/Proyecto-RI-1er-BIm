I have the following class with the following members:               public class RegistrationPresenter : EPiPresenter<IRegistrationView, LoginPage>, IDisposable     {         private readonly static string[] DefaultUserRoles = { AppRoles.RegisteredRole, AppRoles.EveryoneRole, AppRoles.ManagerUserRole };              private readonly INavigator navigator;         private readonly ISpanishProvincesHelper spanishProvincesHelper;         private readonly IContentHelper contentHelper;         private readonly IUserDataHelper userDataHelper;              public RegistrationPresenter(IRegistrationView view, LoginPage page, INavigator navigator,              ISpanishProvincesHelper spanishProvincesHelper, IContentHelper contentHelper, IUserDataHelper userDataHelper)             : base(view, page)         {     ....      }      I'm successfully able to Bind all the readonly members with an IoC container (Ninject in my case), except for the static string[], which I don't know how to do it. Which approach should I choose or how could I apply IoC to the DefaultUserRoles values, so I'm able to mock it when Unit testing?
