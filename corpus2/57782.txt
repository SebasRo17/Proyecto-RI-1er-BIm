I've been a software developer for 8 years. I've worked on about 20 projects, some smaller, some bigger. I know how to help myself by using google magic, msdn, youttube, tutorials, how-to's etc. I'm playing around with the idea to get a friend of mine (who has been a software-developer for 5 years) and start my own software-developer-company. What do you think are the preconditions to get myself from a freelancer to owning my own little company with 2-3 employees?
