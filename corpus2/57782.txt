Mathematica won't change a number's BaseForm recursively:               63969 // BaseForm[#, 16] & // BaseForm[#, 8] & // BaseForm[#, 2] &      Well, I inspected former answers, most of them treated formatting problems, but none of the anwers given treated the nestable aspect. Maybe I'm wrong, and I risk a duplicate. (1) I would like to have a nestable function which allows constructs of the form               63969 // base@16 // base@8 // base@2      This feature might be adopted advantageously within iterative functions : NestList, FoldList, ... * * * ## Edit1 To explain my interest for seamless changes of baseforms               2 ArcCot[GoldenRatio^2^^1111] == ArcCot[2^^1010101010]     2^^1010101010 // BaseForm[#, 4] &      ![curiousSinCosMindmap](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b70Ms.gif) * * * ## Edit2 I tried myself another approch, but it has an disadvantage: `HoldForm` isn't respected               ClearAll@base     base[b_] := Function[# // ReplaceAll[#, BaseForm[x_, _] :> BaseForm[x, 10]] & //           ToString // ToExpression // BaseForm[#, b] &]          testsuite = {5555, BaseForm[5555, 8], HoldForm@Plus[5000, 555],5*BaseForm[1111, 2]}     base@10 /@ testsuite
