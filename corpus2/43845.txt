I'm trying to do a Fourier Transform of the following Data, but I'm completely stuck. Here's what I've done so far:               data = Drop[data, 1];     dat = data /. {x_, y_, z_, w_} -> {x + y/12., 10 z};     ListLinePlot[Abs[Fourier[dat]], PlotRange -> {Automatic, {0, 40}}]      I don't understand why it keeps displaying this weird plot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i28k4.jpg) Anyone have any clue what I'm doing wrong? I'm just learning this Fourier thing so I'm real lost.
