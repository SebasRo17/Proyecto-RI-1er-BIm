The Clojure docs regarding `(reduce f val coll)` state: > If val is supplied, returns the result of applying f to val and the first > item in coll, then applying f to that result and the 2nd item, etc. So I tried:               (reduce str ["s1" "s2"] "s3")      Which leads to:               "[\"s1\" \"s2\"]s3"      However, when I try               (apply str ["s1" "s2"])      I get:               "s1s2"      So why does the vector get converted into its string representation?
