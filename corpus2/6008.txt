Consider the following snippet                 pts = RandomReal[1, {3, 2}]       g = Graphics[{Polygon[Dynamic[pts]]}, PlotRegion -> {{0, 0}, {2, 2}}];       Panel[LocatorPane[Dynamic[pts], g]]      I would like to be able to drag the triangle as a whole. I found none and assume this has to be added via code, i.e. `EventHandler` but found no examples of this. **Question: How can I select, and act upon multiple locators, i.e. drag, scale, apply a transformation to the points?**
