I have created a utility library and open sourced it on Github, and I'd like to document the HTTP utilities. I created this around some apps I've developed, but none of the APIs I use are for public consumption. I want to use a well known public API in my documentation so that code samples will work and be really easy to understand for the user, but I don't work with any such API so I'm not familiar with any...looking for suggestions.
