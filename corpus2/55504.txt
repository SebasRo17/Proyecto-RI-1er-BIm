I want to solve the following equation               2 x == Sinh[x]      _Mathematica_ is unable to do so               In[1]:= Solve[2 x == Sinh[x], x]     During evaluation of In[20]:= Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Solve. >>     Out[1]= Solve[2 x == Sinh[x], x]      However, Wolfram|Alpha can successfully solve the equation ![Wolfram|Alpha query](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i87NA.png) How can I achieve the same in _Mathematica_?
