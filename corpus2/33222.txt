Consider a complex path expressed in one real parameter, such as $$f(\alpha)=\frac{1}{e^{i \alpha} + 1},$$ which is a MÃ¶bius transformation of the unit circle. I know I can expand it all out and use the parametric plot, but it is cumbersome and not very easy (sometimes practically impossible) to do so. Therefore, I want to know if there is some plotting function specifically designed for this. (I searched for it in the documentation but did not find it; sorry if it's all obvious.)
