I have the following data               data = {{0, 0}, {-0.0385, 0.0667}, {-0.0566, 0.1283}, {0.0966,          0.0441}, {-0.1166,          0.0038}, {-0.2046, -0.0673}, {-0.2536, -0.21}, {-0.5485, \     -0.2643}, {-0.3702, -0.1148}, {-0.4201, -0.2319}, {-0.5558, -0.2748}, \     {-0.693, -0.3272}, {-0.6276, -0.3844}, {-0.6305, -0.3448}, {-0.671, \     -0.4833}, {-0.6809, -0.3441}, {-0.7082, -0.2548}, {-0.5978, -0.3126}, \     {-0.4337, -0.3588}, {-0.2542, -0.4139}, {-0.3318, -0.3318}, {-0.4991, \     -0.2123}, {-0.4195, -0.1966}, {-0.4797, 0.0285}, {-0.2198,          0.0965}, {-0.1914, 0.1604}, {-0.0854, 0.1668}, {0.0715,          0.3025}, {0.0847, 0.3116}, {0.175, 0.3152}, {0.0123,          0.4577}, {0.0941, 0.4445}, {0.083, 0.3729}, {0.1251,          0.1414}, {0.0239, 0.3119}, {-0.0665, 0.3748}, {-0.0171,          0.4261}, {0.0781, 0.4031}, {-0.0945, 0.315}, {-0.2497,          0.3892}, {-0.285, 0.3823}, {-0.2873, 0.4343}, {-0.196,          0.4628}, {-0.2812, 0.5166}, {-0.186, 0.2917}, {-0.3101,          0.3047}, {-0.4103, 0.2439}, {-0.4335, 0.2251}, {-0.5113,          0.4149}, {-0.6487, 0.4662}, {-0.5045, 0.1807}}; which represents movement of some particle in time 0,...,50. Using `ColorFunction` is possible to get rainbow color according to axis $y$ as               ListLinePlot[data,ColorFunction->Function[{x,y},ColorData["Rainbow"][y]],PlotStyle->Thick] or axis $x$ as               ListLinePlot[data,ColorFunction->Function[{x,y},ColorData["Rainbow"][x]],PlotStyle->Thick] Is it possible to use `ColorFunction` according to time 0,...,50 and to get rainbow according to its movement in this time?
