I have been working with a code being maintained for years. We're using clear- case as version control. To submit the code for review and get the code count (for project metrics) are usually painful. What's the best way to conduct code review for maintenance software? How effective we can share the code for peer review (I understand it's tightly coupled with the version controls we're using). Any known standards or best practices? How can I get metrics like code count etc.?
