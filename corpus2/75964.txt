I seem to remember reading/hearing that an exam will drop off your transcript after a year if you haven't taken further exams to complete a particular certificate. If it matters, the test in question is **70-536** : Microsoft .NET Framework - Application Development Foundation **Edit** : In case it isn't clear, The exam I've had drop off in the past was an older exam - for .Net 1.0 or 1.1. I now have the 70-536 exam on my transcript - just wanted to make sure I had plenty of time to find the motivation to finish up a cert.
