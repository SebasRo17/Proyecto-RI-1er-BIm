Just started working as System Developer and dislikes the labeling of a home made exception: `HumanErrorException`. In my view, there is no such thing as a human error in a computer based system - just users who don't do as developer expected. So the real label for the exception would be `DeveloperNotTakingUserBehaviourSeriouslyException`, but I thing there will be a fight when i relabel :) Have you ever seen a wrong labeled exception (type, class or method) around? If you did, what did you do with it?
