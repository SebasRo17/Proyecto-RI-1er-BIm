I obtained the latest version 10 of Mathematica however, when I start the installation the process aborts and a pop up window explains that "The program requires Windows NT version 6.0 or later". As far as I know, this means that version 10 is compatible only with Vista and all later versions of windows, am I right? In my PC I still have Windows XP SP3. So, is there a way to install version 10 in this OS? Currently, I have version 9 and runs like a charm. I refuse to believe that Wolfram made in purpose version 10 incompatible with XP.
