In SICP, the authors state (Section 1.1) that there are three basic "mechanisms" of programming languages: >   * **primitive expressions** , which represent the simplest entities the > language is concerned with > >   * **means of combination** , by which compound elements are built from > simpler ones > >   * **means of abstraction** , by which compound elements can be named and > manipulated as units > > How can I analyze a mainstream programming language (Java, for example) in terms of these elements or mechanisms?
