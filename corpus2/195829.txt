I want some suggestions about the project concepts/ideas on HTML5 PhoneGap mobile app development. I want to develop some app that can be a learning curve to get to know about these technologies. Any specific app concepts wherein I can get myself accustomed with using features like camera, geolocation, accelerometer, etc and implement those as a coherent part of the project work? Apologies if this might not be appropriate forum to ask such question. But I could not find any relevant stackexchange site for this.
