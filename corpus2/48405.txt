With               ListLinePlot [      {13, 6, 2, 2, 3},      AxesOrigin -> {1, 0},Background -> GrayLevel@0.95,      GridLines -> None, ImageSize -> 300,      ImageMargins -> 0, PlotLabel -> "XYZ",      Filling -> Bottom, PlotMarkers -> Automatic, Frame -> True]      I obtained: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8zcxS.jpg)   1.
