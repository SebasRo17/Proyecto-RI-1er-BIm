I've been looking at a lot of code samples recently, and I keep noticing the use of...               if( expression == true )         // do something...      and...               x = ( expression == true ) ? x : y;      I've tended to always use...               x = ( expression ) ? x : y;      and...               if( expression )         // do something...      Where `== true` is implicit (and obvious?) Is this just a habit of mine, and I'm being picky about the explicit use of `== true`, or is it simply bad practice?
