> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  find subsequences of constant increase Given an arbitrarily long list of integers (let's say they are sorted), how would one determine if any 3 (or more) of those integers make up an arithmetic sequence? (an arithmetic sequence is where the difference between consecutive terms is the same) Also how would one determine all such sequences in a given list? For instance, I'd like this function to return               In[] = FindArithmSeq[{2,5,6,8,10,12}]     Out[]= {{2,5,8}, {2,6,10}, {6,8,10}, {8,10,12}, {6,8,10,12}}      Thanks in advance!
