I have a list `{(IC,s,FK)}`, which I use to generate a 3d-plot with the help of the command `ListPlot3D`. `IC` and `s` go from `0` to `1`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jorUf.jpg) There is an area (lets say `0.11 < IC < 0.3, 0.1 < s < 0.4`) which is specially important, because this is the physical range. For some reason I want to plot the whole parameter space, but highlight (for example with a red rectangle) this physical range. It would be great to frame the physical range with a red rectangle on the surface of the 3d-Plot. (In the end, this 2d-rectangle should look similar to these mesh lines, but it should frame the range, defined above). Do you have any idea?
