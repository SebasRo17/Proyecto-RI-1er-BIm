Whenever I do a check-in, I always check in from the **root** of the project... i.e. check in **all** the files in my working copy, so after the check-in the source control repo contains exactly the same set of files that I just finished testing in my local copy. I also make sure my source control is set to flag local files that are **not** under source control. In general, there are **none** of these files... if there are, I either add them to source control or mark them as "ignored". I also check in all my changes together in one check-in. A lot of colleagues check in much differently. They carefully select each file to check in, as if they are a master jeweler selecting only the very best gemstones to set into the royal crown, and they check in each one as a separate check-in. They rely only on their memory to figure out which files need to be checked in, or especially **added** to source control. The results are quite predictable... frequent broken builds because they forget to add their new files to source control or forget to check in a changed file (especially changed project files). I have mentioned this to them and they never seem to change. When I mentioned it to the team lead he said, "this is just a different way of working". To which I may respond: What if I want to drive my car with my eyes closed? Is that just "a different way of driving"? Am I right in being bothered by this practice?
