I am trying to change the value of one key in an association based on the value of another key in that association. So if my association starts as:               x=<|"firstValue" -> True, "isFirstValueTrue" -> False|>      I want to change it to:               <|"firstValue" -> True, "isFirstValueTrue" -> True|>      So I wrote the function:               f[x_] := If[x[["firstValue"]], x[["isFirstValueTrue"]] = True, x[["isFirstValueTrue"]] = False]      I got an error, but based on this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12875913/setsetps-in-the-part-assignment- is-not-a-symbol I was to correct it by using`SetAttributes[f, HoldAll]` But let's say I want to do this to a list of associations:                   x={<|"firstValue" -> True, "isFirstValueTrue" -> False|>,          <|"firstValue" -> True, "isFirstValueTrue" -> True|>,          <|"firstValue" -> False, "isFirstValueTrue" -> False|>,          <|"firstValue" -> False, "isFirstValueTrue" -> True|>}      so I wrote               Map[f[#] &, x]      However, the "in the part assignment is not a symbol." error appears again and you can't `SetAttributes[Map, HoldAll]`. I realize I can make a copy of the list and make changes to that, but the actual list I'm working with is much larger so I do not want to do that. The third solution in the link above is able to be mapped, but it doesn't seem like you can replace in an association. Any suggestions?
