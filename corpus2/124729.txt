For a time now I have been wanting to make my own programming language. I'm 17 and the only language I know is Color BASIC. I know that compared to today's complicated languages, it's pretty weak. But I was wondering if it would be hard to create a language that is kinda like color BASIC/BASIC and how would I start it? What to do or what do I need to do to learn how to make my own programming language?
