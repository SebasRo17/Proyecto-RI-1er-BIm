I tried to modify the `KeyEventTranslations.tr` file in order to always place a closed bracket instead of an open bracket once I press `[`. However once I press `[` after the modification nothing happens (the cursor just stays at the same position and not even a `[` is placed).               Item[KeyEvent["["],             FrontEndExecute[{                 FrontEnd`NotebookWrite[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],                     "[", After],                 FrontEnd`NotebookWrite[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],                     "]", Before]             }]],       the Code is a slight modification of what i found regarding double brackets: Automating Esc [[ Esc formatting? (There is a comment below the top answer, which also mentions Problems regarding `[` and German keyboard language). If I use a different character like `/` to trigger the `KeyEvent`, which does not have to be typed using the AltGr-key               Item[KeyEvent["/"],             FrontEndExecute[{                 FrontEnd`NotebookWrite[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],                     "[", After],                 FrontEnd`NotebookWrite[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],                     "]", Before]             }]],       the closed bracket will be placed as expected. Other keys like `{` using `AltGr` do not work either. I tried renaming the `term.dll` files as suggested here: Is it possible to get AltGr key to work in Math.exe? unfortunately this did not fix the Problem. Additional Information: I'm using Win7 and my keyboard language is set to German. (And I would like to keep it set to German). If there is any other way circumventing the `KeyEventTranslations.tr` to automaticaly place `[]` with the cursor placed between the brackets once I press `[`, it would be fine as well. Thanks in advance if anyone tries to answer my question :)
