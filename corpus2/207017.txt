Given the following code:               public interface IUserDataProvider {                 ICollection<SomeClass> getSomeClassRecordsForUser(int idUser);     }      Is it possible to define (via documentation) an expectation that any implementing class returns null instead of an empty collection (or vice versa) when no records are found? I realize interfaces do not have explicit control over how they are implemented, but considering that interfaces are said to define a contract, I'm wondering how far the jurisdiction of that contract can rightfully extend. Thanks in advance for your responses.
