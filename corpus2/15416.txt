I am trying to compute the integral               Integrate[(g^(u^(g - 1)))/(1 + u^g), {u, 0, t}]      but as an answer I get my input expression. There must be something wrong with parameters but even if I give values to `t` or `g` mathematica'a answer is the same: it just gives me back my input expression... My output is ![](http://i.imgur.com/5lACY.jpg) How can I compute this integral?
