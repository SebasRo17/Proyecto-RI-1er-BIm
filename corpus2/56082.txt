Suppose I have a nested list such as,               {{{A, B}, {A, D}}, {{C, D}, {A, A}, {H, A}}, {{A, H}}}      Where the elements of interest are, > >     {{A, B}, {A, D}} >   >     {{C, D}, {A, A}, {H, A}} >   >     {{A, H}} >   How would I use select to pick up only elements that contain two or more `A`s in the first part of their sub-elements. In this example I would want the following as an output, > >     {{A,B},{A,D}} >
