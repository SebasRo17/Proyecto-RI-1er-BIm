Should I use               <?php         if(!$user->is_logged_in()){             echo '<p id="login">Click <a href="login">here</a> to log in</p>';         }     ?>      or               <?php         if(!$user->is_logged_in()){     ?>         <p id="login">Click <a href="login">here</a> to login.</p>     <?php         }     ?>      ? Why? The first one will not have the HTML tags coloured so is less readable in code editors, but with the second one, it seems like it would be bad to take up three lines just to add a curly brace. Which should I be using?
