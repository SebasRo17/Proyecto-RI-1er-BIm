I have a friend who is starting graduate studies in a psychology. Part of what he is learning is building testing apps for trials. He purchased a book that was supposed to be vb for psychologists after reading though it I found that it was not a very good programming book and espoused what I think of as bad practices. I instructed him to buy a standard learning vb.net book from a known publisher. So the question is there any good reason why standard methodologies of programming shouldn't be applied to certain disciplines.
