One thing that I've learnt in my short dev career is that there are best practices (like TDD) and then there are actual practices that occur under pressure, or through budgetary/time constraints. I'm working in a small PHP dev team on a project using Zend framework. The project has the potential to demand a lot of scalability, and so we are trying to establish a good development environment to promote ease of development long term. Architectural patterns/practices aside, I'm looking at trying to automate deployment, checking code quality through svn hooks, possibly even setting up a CI environment. So I'm interested in hearing people's experience of deployment practices. I've checked other examples as they pertain to other languages - but I'm ideally looking to hear from people who have worked in a PHP/Zend environment To make the question less vague: What are people's experiences of using deployment systems like phpUnderControl and rSync?
