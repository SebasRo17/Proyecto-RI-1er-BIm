This question is asked in regards to gstreamer but it could apply to any add- on based architecture. I have a Gstreamer based application that can ship as proprietary because I use unmodified Gstreamer in it with all LGPL parts. I may, however, also need to issue a version where one Gstreamer plugin is GPL. As far as I can tell that would contaminate the whole program. If instead of including the Gstreamer pipeline specification in the program, I publish it with the ability to read a pipeline spec from an external file (coded per some set of instructions - i.e. as a GstParseLaunch()-able specification) can I release the program as proprietary and the pipe-spec files as GPL? How far apart would I need to publish those items, that is, would the program be in one distribution and the specs separately released in another? What if the program is never truly released but is instead an embedded application sold inside an appliance and the appliance is sold preloaded with both the proprietary part and tghe non-proprietary part?
