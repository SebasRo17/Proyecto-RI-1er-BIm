I have a set of curves that take on large values when approaching 1. I'm trying to create a straight line with certain slope and then truncate the plot for any curve that goes above that line for any value of x. This is my current code:               lm := Sqrt[M^2 - 1]     C1 := 2/lm     C2 := ((1.4 + 1)*M^4 - 4 M^2 + 4)/(2*lm^4)                pr1[o_, M_] := (C1*(o*Pi/180) + C2*(o*Pi/180)^2)*1.4*M^2/2 + 1;          Plot[Table[pr1[o, M], {o, {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}}] // Release, {M, 1, 3},         AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OmLbV.png)
