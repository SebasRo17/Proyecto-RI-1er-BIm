We're trying to write a custom scripting language. There has been a suggestion to make the language forgiving by providing **case insensitive** keywords. I personally do not like the idea, but there are few people in my team leaning towards it, saying it will make the end user happy! Examples of languages like FORTRAN, BASIC, SQL are given saying that these are case insensitive. Is this a good idea?
