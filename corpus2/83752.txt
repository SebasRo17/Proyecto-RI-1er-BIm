I've created my own iPhone app which is presently in the App Store. What is the maximum period that should pass without a new version update? What is the average time span between version releases? I'm asking this because I want to make sure that I'm giving the impression that my app is not being neglected. I'm currently working on an update, but as it is a one man show this could take a bit.
