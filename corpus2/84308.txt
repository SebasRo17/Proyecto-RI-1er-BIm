We have a software product has a lot of usability features, and we're constantly changing it. We have issues with things like persisting scroll position which seem to get fixed, but then are broken again when we release. We have good testers, but we seem to miss things like this because there are just so many features in the application it's hard to perform thorough regression testing. How is this problem best solved? I'd love to have automated UI tests, but those are fragile. I'd love to have our testers test every feature every time we implement a new feature, but that would take forever, and seems impractical. I wanted to gauge how other software shops do this and how they avoid recurring bugs.
