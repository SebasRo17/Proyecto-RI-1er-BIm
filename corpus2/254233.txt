Why do we need to include both the `.h` and `.cpp` files , while we can make it works with making just a `.cpp` file and then including it . For example, Creating a `file.h` containing declarations, then creating a `file.cpp` containing definitions and including both on the `main.cpp`. Or, creating a `file.cpp` containing declaration/definitions ( no prototypes ) Including it on the `main.cpp`. Both worked for me , but still can't the difference since i do not have a background on the compiling and linking process .
