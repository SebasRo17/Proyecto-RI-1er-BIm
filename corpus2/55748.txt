As part of some data anaylsis, I am using the function Trace to give me the name of an array of data, which I then use to label my plots. eg. my data array is called r1 so I run:               ToString@((Trace[r1])[[1]])      which simply returns the string "r1". All fine and dandy. The problem arises when I try to do this for a list of data arrays, I write:               Trace[#]&/@{r1,r2}      which I expect to give me the list {"r1","r2"}. Instead I get {{},{}}. What am I doing wrong? Any help will be much appreciated!
