I've been introduced to _Mathematica_ very recently. Basically, I haven't actually "solved" anything in my Mathematica lifetime, but I've done some simulations. With my fractional knowledge, I tried simulating a toggle mechanism today. Here's what I did...               ω0 = .02; ω = .02; r = 2; r1 = 6; r0 = 1.5;     rA[θ_, r_] := r*{Cos[θ], Sin[θ]};     rAy[θ_, r_] := r*Sin[θ];     rAx[θ_, r_] := r*Cos[θ];     rC[θ0_, r0_] := r0*{Cos[θ0] + 1/r0, Sin[θ0] + 3/r0};     rCy[θ0_, r0_] := r0*Sin[θ0] + 3;     rCx[θ0_, r0_] := r0*Cos[θ0] + 1;     xB[θ_, r_] := r*Cos[θ] + Sqrt[(r1^2 - (r*Sin[θ])^2)];     rB[θ_, r_] := {xB[θ, r], 0};     rBx[θ_, r_] := xB[θ, r];     rBy[θ_, r_] := 0;     Manipulate[θ = ω*t; θ0 = ω0*t;       rAO = rA[θ, r]; rBO = rB[θ, r]; rDC = rC[θ0, r0];      Graphics[{{Thick, Darker[Green], Dashed, Circle[{0, 0}, r]}, {Thick,          Dashed, Blue, Circle[{1, 3}, r0]},        {Red, EdgeForm[{Thick, Black}], White,          Rectangle[{rBO[[1]] - 0.5, rBO[[2]] - 0.5}, {rBO[[1]] + 1,            rBO[[2]] + 0.5}]},        {Thick, Darker[Red], Line[{{0, 0}, rAO, rBO}]}, {Thick,          Darker[Red], Line[{{1, 3}, rDC, rAO}]},        {Black, Disk[{0, 0}, 0.1], Disk[{1, 3}, 0.1],          Disk[{rAO[[1]], rAO[[2]]}, 0.1], Disk[{rDC[[1]], rDC[[2]]}, 0.1],          Disk[{rBO[[1]], rBO[[2]]}, 0.1]}},       PlotRange -> {{-3, 9}, {-3, 5}},        ImageSize -> {600, 250}], {{t, 20, "Motion"}, 20, N[205*Pi],        N[Pi/16]}]      I think you can figure out that there's a big issue, due to my enormous expectation from the "visualizing" without even thinking of "solving"... ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mcHuZ.gif) Both the cranks have the same angular velocity. Because, that's the way I've defined. I've got no other choice. But, the mechanism should begin with the top crank. That crank makes the bottom one to rotate, by transferring power through the connecting rod. Given a connecting rod of constant length (especially, less than the sum of radii of the cranks), the bottom crank cannot complete one full rotation. It can go only halfway, and then turn back. The slider motion remains the same, but the crank is causing a big trouble to the mechanism due to the ridiculous "elastic behavior" of the connecting rod. I don't want to analyze this mechanism. So, I'm cool with any answer that essentially simulates the actual mechanism (even if that's a modification of mine) as I just need the simulation only for a video (at least, for now). At the same time, I'll be very happy with "solving" the equations with constraints, because I guess those solutions may help me in the future for other mechanisms.
