This question is inspired by these questions (here and here). I do mostly numerical work, and I usually use C++, Fortran, and occasionally Numpy. I'm trying to broaden my horizons, and I'm looking for programming languages that are good for numerical work (have bindings for BLAS/LAPACK; fast, lightweight, multidimensional arrays; etc.) but are a little bit outside the mainstream. Which "unusual" languages are good for getting new ideas about numerical programming?
