What's your preferred way to implement/use vector operations?   * vec1.dot(vec2)      * allows to reuse vec1 but is hard to read for longer equations   * dot(vec1, vec2)      * A friend of mine prefers this as "dot" isn't a property of vector   * vec1 * vec2      * probably looks best, but not possible in all languages (e.g. Java)
