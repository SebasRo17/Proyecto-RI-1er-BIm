We are writing a B2B application that uses OAuth 2.0. Before a token expires we want to refresh it since it faster to refresh a token, than request a new one. However, we want to build in some resilience in the system to clock skew so we want to consider a token expired a few seconds/minutes before it would actually expire. How many seconds/minutes is it reseasonable to expect two servers connected to the internet, in different locations, to be?
