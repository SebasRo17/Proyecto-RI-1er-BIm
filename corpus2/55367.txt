I'm looking to reproduce the types of graph layout that are possible in D3 (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607999) in Mathematica. Since Mathematica doesn't explicitly support force directed edge bundling, but does seem to support HierarchicalEdgeBundling (at least it's referred to once in the documentation) I wondered if anyone has had any success in doing something similar to the D3 visualisation linked above.
