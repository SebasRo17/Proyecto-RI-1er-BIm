its been some time that i've been thinking about creating something that could help the web community and leave some mark, but the problem that there are no ideas poping out of my head. So 2 questions comes to my mind: First, how did projects like Twitter, Google or any other big project that had changed our way of living in the internet get started? Secondly, do we have to force it or just keep doing what we do best and wait to that idea that could change things? While writting this question, one quote come to mind: > Imagination is more important than knowledge > > **Albert Einstein**
