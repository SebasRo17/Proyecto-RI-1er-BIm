AFAIK the lowest priority has the highest number in scheduling and in my system all priorities must be different. But isn't other policies thinkable? For instance, how about a policy where priorities are not numbers but say that a task's priority would be defined only in term of another task's priority, and that other task would be the closest in priority to the task whose priority we are setting. Then we would never use actual numbers for priorities, but we would keep a data structure sorting the tasks in priorities and when a task comes as new or is getting a different priority assigned, then this structure is rebalanced. Would this priority mechanism be feasible or do you not agree that it's a working idea?
