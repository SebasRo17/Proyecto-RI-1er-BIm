I started programming in PHP sometime before last Christmas. Before that, I had done some development with Access/VBA (1-2 years). I have a BA in Art History and a masters in Music Composition. I've been studying up on OOP with PHP 5.3, Zend Framework and some design pattern textbooks, and I'm starting to feel comfortable, conversant. I work for a bank, unfortunately. I say unfortunately simply because I'm not really in a bona fide technical role at the bank (although my manager really supports my development work, probably b/c I work for peanuts), and most of the job openings here I would apply for are for .Net or Java. I'm really enjoying myself, though, and I'm finishing up my first complete ZF application here at work. But I'm at a point where I'd love to start learning something different and new. I want to be excited about it, but I also want to be realistic/strategic about this, because I haven't been able to land a "real" developer job, and that is my goal (I don't care what language, or even what working environment at this point--I don't have any real experience with working as a developer yet to know what I like best, honestly. I just know I need to be part of a team now--no more working alone in the dark). I've heard people say that it's best to learn several languages vs. sticking to the same one (especially if it's PHP, for some reason). But I've also heard the opposite. My question then has to do with that: what best complements a 0+ years professional experience PHP developer who wants to learn something new, but aim for being marketable? Should I learn other PHP tools like Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress? Or should I learn a different scripting language, such as Groovy, Python or Ruby? Or should I go for a language more like Java or C# (or even Objective-C)? I'll have fun either way, I just want to be sure I'm not diversifying too much (or not enough), impeding my chances for a first real gig. How should I go about making myself marketable?
