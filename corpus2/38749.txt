I have three variables like this,               r1 = 4;     r2 = 3;     r3 = 1;      and I want to insert them into a function use them in a function definition like so:               f[n_] := r[n] + r[n-1]      So I need to have a function that just duplicates the variable, something like:               r[1] = r1 = 4;     r[2] = r2 = 3;     r[3] = r3 = 1;      Firstly, I thought of doing               r[n_] := r[n]      but that doesn't make much sense. * * * I was wondering if there is some nice way to do this?
