I understand the concepts of deadlock well enough, but when I'm given a problem like the one below I'm not sure how to go about solving it. I can draw a resource allocation graph, but I'm not sure how to solve it from there. Is there a better more formal way of solving this?               Consider  a  system  with  five  processes,  P1  through P5,  and  five      resources, R1 through R5. Resource ownership is as follows.           •  P1 holds R1 and wants R3      •  P2 holds R2 and wants R1      •  P3 holds R3 and wants R5      •  P4 holds R5 and wants R2      •  P5 holds R4 and wants R2           Is this system deadlocked? Justify your answer. If  the system is deadlocked, list      the involved processes.
