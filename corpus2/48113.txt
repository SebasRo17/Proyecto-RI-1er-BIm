I found _Mathematica_ provides me a wrong answer for a relatively simple analytically solvable integral:               Integrate[Exp[-I θ]/(1 + b Cos[θ]), {θ, 0, 2 π},           Assumptions -> b < 1 && b > -1]      Provides as a result `(2π)/b`, which is incorrect. The integral can be computed easily writing the integrand as a geometric series. Additionally, you can compute it numerically               NIntegrate[Exp[-I θ]/(1 + b Cos[θ]), {θ, 0, 2 π}]      which produces the right result, different from `(2π)/b`. Is this a very bad bug? or am I doing something wrong? What could be the reason for this error?
