For example, I have the following list:               AA={{0, 20000.}, {26.6, 19950.}, {53.2, 19950.}, {79.8,        19950.}, {97.1198, 18644.1}, {102.681, 16452.3}}      Another calculation results in an arbitrary value intended for the first part of the list, let's say 21.3. By interpolating linearly, this results in a value of 19960 for the second part of the list. How can I import this in Mathematica?
