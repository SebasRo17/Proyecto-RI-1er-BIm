I'm new to object-oriented programming, and I keep running into this issue. (I'm programming in Java) I've been a bit reluctant to ask about this, since it seems like such a basic issue, but I can't find any information on it, or questions about it here, and none of the textbooks I have read (on a quite basic level of course) have touched on this issue: Often I need to keep track of all objects of a class that have been created, to iterate through them for various purposes. They way I currently write programs, many objects are only referenced from other objects, meaning I have no array or collection with which to reference them all. I imagine that, as this seems like such a very basic necessity in OOP, there should be a quite institutionalized, and simple, way to go about this? Is it usual practice to keep a separate list of all the objects of a class? I thought about a static array or collection, to which through its constructor, every new object created would be added. This however would not work with subclasses, since constructors are not inherited? I realize this question might not have one easy answer; I just hope someone can enlighten me a bit on this subject. I feel like if I'm lacking a central piece of knowledge here.
