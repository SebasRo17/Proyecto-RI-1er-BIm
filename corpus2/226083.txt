In a webapp, I have a scenario where I need some kind of global context (Static like) for few variables, _for the current thread only_. If there are 3 different concurrent users, then I expect three corresponding global context variable for the 3 separate threads/sessions. Using a Static variable makes its scope global for all the threads. Is there a way in which I can achieve this?
