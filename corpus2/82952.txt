I'm about to start an open-source project which shall be licensed under Mozilla Public License (MPL). The problem is, I'm not sure what's this "Exhibit A" thing... Am I supposed to put that wordy "Exhibit A" in each and every source file contained in the project? And what about the MPL text proper; must I provide a complete text of the MPL in the root directory of the project? I'd really appreciate it if someone can point me to a guide on how to _release_ software under MPL (as opposed to _using_ software with MPL). TIA.
