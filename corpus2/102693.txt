Some time ago I wrote a BlackBerry application. I find that I now want to release it under an open source license. I am strongly considering the GPL v3 license. All the code is mine; there are no third-party libraries (with the exception, of course, of the all the standard BlackBerry/Java libraries that I am "linked" to). This is the first open source project that I will be maintaining or starting. I find myself a bit lost about how to handle contributions. It seems to be more-or-less standard to expect some kind of copyright assignment from contributors so that the project has a unified copyright. I could either assign all copyrights to the FSF or assign all copyrights to myself. How should I handle this? The most important features of whatever implementation I use are:   * Protects me from being sued for any unintentional violations of the GPL in my own code   * Protects others' contributions from being misused by me if I become evil   * Encourage others' contributions to the project (or at least does not discourage such contributions) For assigning all copyrights to myself, the most promising strategy for copyright assignment seems to be one based on Oracle's contributor agreement, located here: http://openjdk.java.net/legal/oca.pdf. However, I feel like expecting any contributors to sign a legal document, providing me with fairly personal information is asking for a lot, especially given that my project is very small. Should I proceed with requiring contributors to sign a document similar to Oracle's agreement? Should I just accept contributions and cross my fingers that I won't have any trouble down the road? Is there another strategy that I should employ?
