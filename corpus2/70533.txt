I'm a C# dev and I have plans of starting to develop apps targeting Android, which of course means Java. I have heard good things about Mono for Android and the idea of reusing my skill set is appealing, however the licensing cost (for now) is a bit prohibitive to me. On the other hand, from what I can see, Java is very similar to C#, so I'm predicting that shifting my skills to it will be more or less easy (easier than shifting to Obj-C I guess). Am I wrong in assuming that? Are there any hidden costs I'm blind to?
