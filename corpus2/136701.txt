I have written one web services using Java. Its already live (up and running). During development I have SVN (repository) + Jira for task maintenance + Maven for building the web services. Now I have some small update for my web services and I have created that task in Jira and committed the files in svn with respect to Jira-Id after all testing, etc. Say my web services is used by 10 clients, we did not give our source code to them. Is there any steps/procedure available to release patch/updates?   Is there any way to render/create the change log at the build time (maven)?   How do I manage the change log for all version or Patch updates during build time? (Automatically)
