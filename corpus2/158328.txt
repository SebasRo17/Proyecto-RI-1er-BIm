For an area of an application that has been developed, the request has come in to remove an item from a menu. I know this is a small thing, but how do you treat it in Scrum? I'm used to using User Stories to add functionality, not to remove it. So my question is, should I create a user story for this, somehow phrased to do with removing the button? Or is there a better way or dealing with this? Thanks, Paul.
