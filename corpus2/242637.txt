I am trying to build a java program for user login but I am not sure if my MVC design is accurate. I have the following classes:   * LoginControl - servlet   * LoginBean - data holder java class with private variables getters and setters   * LoginDAO - concrete java class where I am running my SQL queries and doing rest of the logical work.   * Connection class - java class just to connect to the database   * view - jsp to display the results   * html - used for form Is this how you design a java program based on MVC design pattern? Please provide some suggestions?
