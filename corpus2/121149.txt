Many, but not all, HTML layout problems can be solved with CSS alone. For those that can't, JQuery (on document load) has become very popular.* As a result of its ease, many developers are quick to use JQuery or Javascript for layout and style -- even without understanding whether or not the problem can be solved with CSS alone. This is illustrated by responses to questions like this one. **Is this bad practice? What are the arguments for/against? Should someone who sees this in practice attempt to persuade those developers otherwise?** **If so, what are the best responses to arguments in favor of JQuery saying it's "so easy"?** * * * * Example: Layouts that wish to use vertical layout flow of some kind often run into dead ends with CSS alone -- this would include layouts similar to Pinterest, though I'm not sure that's actually impossible with CSS.
