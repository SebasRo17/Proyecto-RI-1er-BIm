I am not sure if this would be the right forum to ask the question (Please let me know and I will move the question to appropriate forum). I would like to know what can be the best way for elders (in my case, my parents) to learn how to program. I was looking at Qimo 4 kids as a possible platform so that my parents can have a closer look at Linux environments. But it seems like Qimo mostly consists of educational games. I also don't know about which programming language would make the best choice. If anyone can provide me with information on how to go about with this "project", that would be grateful!!!
