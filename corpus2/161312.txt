I'm requesting best practice with this question. This is only an issue if the customer company is strictly national has a native language other than English, I think. If the customer has a lot of mainly very domain specific (say, German) expressions, mixed with some lesser domain specific namings. The language of our code comments, class/method/variable names is English. Would you translate all domain specific names?
