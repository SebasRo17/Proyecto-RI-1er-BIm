I would like to create a series of correlation matrices that starts with :               sensMat[[1]] = DiagonalMatrix[ { 1,1,1,1,1 } ]) // MatrixForm      and iterates in 0.1 steps for each of the elements (other than the leading diagonals) until the last matrix of all 1's are obtained. Maybe using the `Correlation` command? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pn5RU.png)
