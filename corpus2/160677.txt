As I understand it, there are three different "types" of CMS:   1. **Proprietary** : A CMS built and owned by a company, and altered to meet a client's needs.   2. **Open-Source** : An open/free version of the above. An existing system altered to meet a client's needs. (E.g. Drupal, Joomla, etc.)   3. **Fully Bespoke** : A CMS built from scratch to the client's exact needs. It seems to me that, from a client's perspective, their order of preference (if everything else was equal) would be 3 -> 2 -> 1. There's a danger that option 3 could be riddled with difficult to understand code, but that's a danger with the other two as well. As developers, what's best for our clients? I ask this because a competing agency just pitched to one of our clients that Open-Source CMSes are the preferred solution. While I can see the benefits of using OS software, I can't see how it's better than a Fully Bespoke solution. As a developer blog put it, > "Adding features to [an existing] CMS is not easy. It takes more time than > to develop the feature alone, because you need to trick the CMS into doing > something it was not designed to do. This is especially true for features > that write to the database a lot, like community features, or features that > have unusual business logic."
