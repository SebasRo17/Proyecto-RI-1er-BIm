An application has the following logic:   * client => created *.cpp => sent to the server => cl.exe + *.cpp =   *.exe   * client => created *.cs => sent to the server => csc.exe + *.cs =   *.exe   * client => created *.pas => sent to the server => PascalCompiler +   *.pas = *.exe   * etc. The language - C#. I hear that MSBUILD can help me, but I don't understand how to change compiler on server at runtime. Does anyone know of options other than Process class? I'm trying to write an online system to test programs in programming contests. The programmer selects the compiler and sends the source code to the server for verification. And I do not need to build the project, I just need to compile a single file.
