I'm a bit confused about how the 4+1 architectural view model maps to UML. Wikipedia gives the following mapping:   * **Logical view:** Class diagram, Communication diagram, Sequence diagram.   * **Development view:** Component diagram, Package diagram   * **Process view:** Activity diagram   * **Physical view:** Deployment diagram   * **Scenarios:** Use-case diagram The paper Role of UML Sequence Diagram Constructs in Object Lifecycle Concept gives the following mapping:   * **Logical view** (class diagram (CD), object diagram (OD), sequence diagram (SD), collaboration diagram (COD), state chart diagram (SCD), activity diagram (AD))   * **Development view** (package diagram, component diagram),    * **Process view** (use case diagram, CD, OD, SD, COD, SCD, AD),    * **Physical view** (deployment diagram), and    * **Use case view** (use case diagram, OD, SD, COD, SCD, AD) which combines the four mentioned above. The web page UML 4+1 View Materials presents the following mapping: ![UML 4+1 View Materials](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5zzFg.gif) Finally, the white paper Applying 4+1 View Architecture with UML 2 gives yet another mapping:   * **Logical view** class diagrams, object diagrams, state charts, and composite structures   * **Process view** sequence diagrams, communication diagrams, activity diagrams, timing diagrams, interaction overview diagrams   * **Development view** component diagrams   * **Physical view** deployment diagram   * **Use case view** use case diagram, activity diagrams I'm sure further search will reveal other mappings as well. While various people usually have different perspectives, I don't see why this is the case here. Specially, each UML diagram describes the system from a particular aspect. So, for instance, why the "sequence diagram" is considered as describing the "logical view" of the system by one author, while another author considers it as describing the "process view"? Could you please help me clarify the confusion?
