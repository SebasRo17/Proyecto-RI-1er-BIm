I've got a table with the following structure :               Col1 | Col2  | Col3     A    | B     | C     A    | C     | B     E    | D     | C      The primary key is (Col1,Col2,Col3). I get the data in another project and display it in view with a grid. When the user edit a row in the grid, for example : A,B,C -> A,B,E, I get (A,B,E) and try to update the database. But I don't know which row must be updated if I don't have the original (A,B,C). What's the proper way to resolve this issue ? Should I create a temporary ID on my second project ? I don't think create an specific ID in the database is a good idea.
