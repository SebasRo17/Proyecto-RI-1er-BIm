Perhaps I accidentally did something to hide them... I finally tracked down a weird problem I was having with Export and other image-related operations to the type of stylesheet I was using. Consider the same expression evaluated in three different notebooks:               ImageDimensions[Rasterize["Mathematica"]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TsH0j.png) You can see that, with the fancier stylesheets, the graphics of the notebook have interacted with the graphics produced by the Mathematica expression. Is there a work round for this? Here's another example - exporting a video using the Creative/PrimaryColor stylesheet.               grafik = Manipulate[        Graphics3D[{Blue, Cuboid[{0, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1}]}, Boxed -> False,         SphericalRegion -> True,         ViewPoint -> {12 Cos[t],  12 Sin[t], 6 Sin[t]}],  {t, 0 , 2 Pi,         Pi/24}]     Export["/tmp/grafix.mov", grafik]      ![stylesheet problems 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oYiIc.png) When the resulting movie is viewed in a movie player, you can see the orange outline and the original graphical frame: ![stylesheet problems 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ASM6a.png)
