In JavaScript, we have something called **undefined**. I said something, because I really don't know if it's a base class, or a built-in variable, or a keyword, or anything else. I just know that it's there. To see it in action, you can simply write:               undefined;     typeof undefined;      Can anyone please explain to me why this **thing** has been inserted into JavaScript? We have `null` value in this language, thus it shouldn't be something like `null`. In other languages, when we don't know the value of a property or variable, we simply set it to null. Here we can do the same thing. How we can use this _thing_ in JavaScript?
