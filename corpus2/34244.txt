I try to show the convolution of a step function and a triangle function is smooth with the following code:               Manipulate[f0 = UnitBox[p - t0]; f1 = 2 UnitTriangle[t0];       f2 = Convolve[f0, f1, t0, t1];      Plot[{f0, f1, f2} /. {t0 -> x, t1 -> x}, {x, -3, 3}],      {{p, -2}, Locator}]      It should be something like this: ![The original PIC](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PnT9w.png) But after have a click to locate the Locator, it seems Mathematica have plot some "non-necessary" curves (I have marked by red cross): ![After cilck](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q22of.png) How the get the right plot?
