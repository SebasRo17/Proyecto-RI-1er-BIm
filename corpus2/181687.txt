I've been teaching Java to a group of four people for about four months now. Prior to this, they've all had very limited or no other experience programming. We've gotten through basic control structures and their use and have been able to solve some of the simpler Project Eulers. Things similar to:               int count = 0;          for(int index = 0; index < 1000; index++)     {             if(index % 3 == 0 || index % 5 == 0)             {                     count += index;             }     }               System.out.println(count);      We've also gone over basic object-oriented things such as classes and their uses. However, we have not covered inheritance or polymorphism yet. I'd like to introduce inheritance and polymorphism together, but I'm not sure how to properly explain polymorphism to someone who's never seen nor heard of it before. To sum up my question in a few words, I am looking for an effective way to introduce polymorphism to new programmers.
