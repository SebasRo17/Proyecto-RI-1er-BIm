I am building a lot of client-side heavy SPA-like apps with VS2010 and MVC3/4. VS2010 Javascript/HTML/CSS editing (mostly javascript) is interminably slow and sluggish. I'd love to use something like JetBrains' WebStorm to edit my .CSHTML files (with embedded javascript, etc. because I am using RAzor to pop in URL names, etc.) WebStorm seems to have all of the things I want.. better language recognition ("intellisense") and the ability to integrate additional outside libraries into this (I'm using Kendo), etc. Is this possible? How do you get WebStorm to recognize the @"" invoked Razor language inserts? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.
