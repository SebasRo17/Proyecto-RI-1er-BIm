I have a collection of lines segments, represented by an array. Ex: [3,7,13,6,9] is 4 line segments: [(3,7)(7,13)] , [(7,13)(13,6)] , [(13,6)(6,9)] , ([6,9)(9,3)] ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vv0FK.png) I want to find all the lines segments intersections(not including the common point), is there any better way of doing it rather than brute force(Checking all the options with O(N^2))?
