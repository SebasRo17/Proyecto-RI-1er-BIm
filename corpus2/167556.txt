In my experience, a Software Development Team that comprises:   * 1 Project Manager   * 1 Tech Lead   * 1 - 2 Senior Dev   * 2 - 3 Junior Dev (Fresh grad) Only the **Tech Lead & PM (and/or Senor Dev/s)** will participate in a meeting with **Clients, Domain Experts, Client's technical resource**. I can think of the ff potential pitfalls:   * Important info gets lost      1. Human error (TL/PM might forgot to disseminate info due to pressure or plain human error)     2. Non-verbal info (maybe a presentation using a diagram presented by Domain Expert)   * Maintaining Ubiquitous language is harder to build since not all team members get to hear the non-dev persons   * Potential of creative minds are not fully realized (Personally, I am more motivated to think/explore when I am involved with these important meetings) Advantages of this approach:   * Only one point of contact   * Less time spent on meetings? Honestly, I am biased & against this approach. I would like to hear your opinions. Is this how you do it in your team?
