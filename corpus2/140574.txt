HTML5 introduces a wide variety of tools such as Geolocation. Many browsers support them, but some do not yet. Should web developers rely on them to build professional applications for industry? The features are powerful, but not all browsers support these features. What are some ways (perhaps Javascript libraries?) to reliably test for browser support for HTML5 features such as Geolocation?
