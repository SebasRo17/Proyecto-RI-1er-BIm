This post by Rob Conery (note the slug) says that development environment should be run inside a virtual machine. I see what he's saying and tend to agree, but still feel a little uneasy. Now that virtualization is so mature that even production systems run inside VMs speed is pretty much a non-issue, but as I say something bothers me here. What's your take on virtualizing your development machine? Have you already done so? If you did, any pitfalls or gotchas along the road?
