I recently got into PostSharp, an AOP tool for weaving in code. I've been finding a lot of resistance with other developers over giving up writing code to perform the tasks the weaving was meant to simplify. For instance, I'm finding logging or error-handling code where I have postsharp already doing that. I can understand why its happening, since its hard to remember everything that weaving was setup to do (I'm applying a global attribute definition). With that said, factoring in levels of experience, etc, is AOP beneficial to a project? What is your opinion? Thanks.
