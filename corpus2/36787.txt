The integration result for                Integrate[1/(r^2 Sqrt[x/r^(4 - 2 \[Gamma]) + 1]), r]        is:               -((Sqrt[1 + r^(4 - 2 \[Gamma])/x]Hypergeometric2F1[1/2, (-1 + \[Gamma])/(2 (-2 + \[Gamma])), 1 + (-1 + \[Gamma])/(2 (-2 + \[Gamma])), -(r^(4 - 2 \[Gamma])/x)])/(r Sqrt[1 + r^(-4 + 2 \[Gamma]) x] (-1 + \[Gamma])))      **first Case:** If I put x -> 2 and [Gamma] -> 3 in the result, I get:               -((Sqrt[1 + 1/(2 r^2)] (-2 r^2 + Sqrt[2] r^2 Sqrt[(1 + 2 r^2)/r^2]))/(r Sqrt[1 + 2 r^2]))           **Second case:** On the other hand, the answer for               Integrate[1/(r^2 Sqrt[2/r^(4 - 6) + 1]), r]          is:               -(Sqrt[1 + 2 r^2]/r)      which is different from the previous answer. Why? The second part of my question is that Maple gives:                -(Hypergeometric2F1[1/2, -(1/(2 (-2 + \[Gamma]))), 1 - 1/(2 (-2 + \[Gamma])), -r^(-4 + 2 \[Gamma]) x]/r)          as the result of the above integration. Why the answers of Mathematica and Maple are different? If I draw the integration results versus r, it is obvious that they are different. Did I miss some thing? **Edit 1:** In the first case the result for r=1 is : -0.0857864 and in the second case the result for r=1 is : -1.5 **Edit 2:** The results of Mathematica and Maple: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tmYqQ.jpg) **Edit 3 (Solution)** : With the help of Vašek Potoček, it seems that the difference between Mathematica and Maple outputs and also Case 1 and Case 2, is a constant value. Also one can uses the following relation to convert Maple output to Mathematica one: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uKtFk.gif) In our case, the second term is a constant value.
