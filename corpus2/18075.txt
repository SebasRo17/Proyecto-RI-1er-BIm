> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Wrapping EventHandler by Table I am running _Mathematica_ 7. However, I am new to using `Dynamic`, `DynamicModule`, `EventHandler`, and the like. I would like to create a `Graphics` object containing `numDisks` `Disk` objects, where `numDisks` is a positive integer. I would like each of the `Disk` objects to be `Red`, `Green`, or `Blue`. The default color is `Red`, but if a disk is clicked, that disk goes to the next color, cyclically (`Red`-->`Green`-->`Blue`-->`Red`-->...). Is it possible to accomplish this using a `DynamicModule` and multiple `EventHandler` declarations? I have tried the following. This code generates `numDisks` disks in a row. When the user clicks anywhere within the `Graphics` box, the color of _all_ three disks changes to the next color in the sequence.               radius = 1;     numDisks = 3;          DynamicModule[{col = Red},      EventHandler[       Graphics[        Table[{Dynamic[col], Disk[{2.5*(i - 1), 0}, radius]}, {i, 1,           numDisks}],        PlotRange -> All],       {"MouseClicked" :> (col =            col /. {Red -> Green, Green -> Blue, Blue -> Red})}]      ]      ![Three Disks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uAT32.gif) However, what if I would like each of the `numDisks` `Disk` objects to have its own color, which can be changed _independently_ of that of all of the other `Disk` objects? Is this possible? Can this be accomplished somehow using multiple `EventHandler` declarations? Thanks for your time.
