My company is inheriting a large code base for two products that's fragmented into different applications using different languages and technologies, with a significant portion of it spaghetti code. I'm the only in-house IT person, and while I'm confident I could maintain the software for current operations, I don't have the expertise to refactor it into a more maintainable form. With the approach and development choices being entirely malleable, would a role like this appeal to a senior developer or would "we have a bunch of bad code" cut off "and are intent on improving it correctly"?
