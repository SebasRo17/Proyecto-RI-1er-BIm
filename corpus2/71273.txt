I'm a recent college graduate, and I recently had a interview with a company for an entry-level programming job. The company told me that they require two months of unpaid training for all entry level programmers. The reason given was that since they are providing free training, there wouldn't be any compensation. Is this normal? **Update** For other junior developers looking at this: Don't go for these type of scams. This was my first interview. I interviewed with 10 other companies around the area and got about 9 job offers from them. I worked for a fortune 50 company for 9 months with good pay and recently found a better opportunity for even better pay and better work. I guess moral is to be patient and have confidence in yourself.
