Following up my previous question which got great replies, I am now trying to do               NMinimize[{1/2 + Sqrt[2] Sqrt[n] - Ceiling[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[1 + 8 n])],  n > 4}, n]      It gives me the answer `0.328427`.               NMinimize[{1/2 + Sqrt[2] Sqrt[n] - Ceiling[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[1 + 8 n])],  n > 5}, n]      gives me `-0.0358984` and so it goes on if I change the range or add upper bounds for n as well. Is there any way to get a minimum with any confidence? My guess is that the true minimum for n > 4 is 2*(sqrt(3)-2).
