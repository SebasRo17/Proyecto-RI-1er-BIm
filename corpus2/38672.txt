Is there a function to show algebraic numbers in Mathematica more conveniently? I am looking for something similar to MatrixForm for matrices. For example, I would like to view `AlgebraicNumber[1/2 (1 + Sqrt[5]), {-3, 2}]` as `-3 + 2*q`, where `q` is the generator of the number field my algebraic number comes from, i. e. `1/2 (1 + Sqrt[5])` in this case. I searched the documentation concerning algebraic numbers with no success. Something along the lines of `Extract[AlgebraicNumber[...], {2}].{1, x}` works, but it requires tweaking for different fields.
