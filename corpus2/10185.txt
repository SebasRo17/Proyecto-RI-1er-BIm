This one should be simple, but I can't figure it out. I would like to define a transformation (function) such that $r$ maps to $m.r + r$ The help file on AffineTransformation says that               AffineTransformation[{m,v}]      maps $r$ to $m.r + v$ so for example               tt = AffineTransform[{d*IdentityMatrix[2], {a, b}}]     tt[{x,y}]     {a+dx,b+dy}      But how would I define a transformation such that it would return               tt[{x,y}]     {x+dx,y+dy}      for any ${x,y}$? And that it could be applied to graphics objects, e.g,               Graphics[GeometricTransformation[Rectangle[], tt[d]]      where I have added a function argument `d` which is a parameter of the transformation function.
