I teach Economics at University. I often use Mathematica to generate interactive diagrams with demand and supply curves. We also use Blackboard (blackboard.com) to manage our subjects, including assessing students through quizzes and numerical questions. I would like to embed Mathematica in Blackboard, for instance using HTML code. I have tried using Mathematica's Computable Document Format (CDF) but I am not sure where to save the CDF, so that Blackboard can use it. Is there anyone who knows how to embed Mathematica in Blackboard (or any similar eLearning platform)? Thanks, Mario
