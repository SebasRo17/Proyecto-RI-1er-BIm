I'm starting to study a project that mainly will allows users to make payments from their iPhones or Androids. Since I don't have e-commerce experience and also I have never owned a smart phone, I ask you to give me some orientation on what is important when heading this kind of project. **What is making me doubt**   * Is it possible to do this witout apple or google refusing my app or charging my transactions with amounts similar to 30%?   * Is google checkout an alternative to paypal or am I getting this wrong?   * For debit card payment, what are the most common payment services in the US nowadays?   * How high is the technical complexity of that application? Is it very different to do it for iPhone and do it for Android? **What I already know:**   * The payments has nothing to do with the application itself; this is not an in-app scenario.    * We would like to go live with Android and iOS, but it would be acceptable to start with only one of them.   * No credit card information will be stored by the application; a payment gateway like PayPal should by in charge of the actual money movement. **Why Am I asking this?** Someone is asking me to develop an iOS or Android application for allowing his cutomers to add money into their customer cards. **Details of the application requeriment:**   * This service would be available only in the US.   * The application will cost a fix amount to download.    * It is initially required for iOS or Android but off course, bb's and why not wp7 could need to be supported soon. Searching stackoverflow and then the web I came to the feeling of Apple and Google being restrictive to this kind of applications, I also would like to know if it is true. **Example** I've found Starbucks' mobile app to be a very good example of what I need as the link says: _To reload the card, customers can link it to a debit, credit card or PayPal account_ I wonder if doing that is possible for any application or if there is a commercial agreement between starbucks and Apple behind. **Thanks for your help!**
