How to programmatically create and plot **regular planar graphs** with $k = 3, 4$ or $6$ (not hypercubes) and **regular nonplanar graphs** of $k = 8$ (see figure)? Note that what matters is the average connectivity, as nodes at edges and corners have smaller $k$ values. Is there any easy method to do this, or one has to write its own `VertexCoordinates` function and the method to generate the appropriate graph? ![planar and nonplanar graphs](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IFkih.gif) Also, how to create and plot **random** planar graphs, where only the average connectivity is given and nodes possibly have varying connectivity. Note that the Computational Geometry Package has some means to deal with planar graphs, but e.g. `PlanarGraphPlot` can only give the Delaunay triangulation of the given dataset. Thus edges cannot be specified for e.g. top-right and bottom- left graphs in figure.
