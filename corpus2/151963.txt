SO I'm building an application for uploading files. We're paying scientists to contribute information on pests, diseases and bugs (for Plants). We need the ability to drag and drop a file to upload it. The question becomes since the users will be authicentated and setup by us, will it be necessarcy to include a virus scanner to prevent the uploading and insertition of malicious files. How important is this?
