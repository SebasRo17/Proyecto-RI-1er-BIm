I was recently talking to a couple of friends who run a modest e-commerce website (Daily visitors: approx. 100,000,). They plan to have an in-site chat module to engage customers. Since the whole operation is run by 3 people at the moment, they probably won't be able to respond to all the queries in a timely manner. The question they asked me was, was it possible to build an automated chat bot which could maybe engage the customers for simple queries and for more complex ones, forward the chat to one of them. Now, I haven't built anything of the sort and it looks like a great challenge that I'd love to take up. There's no set deadline for the moment (which is really great) and this gives time (hypothetically) to learn a few things that may come in handy. My questions are as follows:   * What sort of architecture would this chat bot consist of?      * I was going through this site for a rough idea but I noticed they didn't use a database.     * Is noSQL the standard where chat bots are concerned? If yes, which one's recommended?   * I have am comfortable with Python - is that a good enough language to build this?   * If I wanted to make this project available to more than one person/project, what are the considerations which have to be taken into account so that this bot is adaptable to any site. For example, the people for whom I intend to build this for sell only t-shirts on their site. So they bot would answer questions related to fabrics, designs, colors etc. But tomorrow, if I want to show this bot to someone who, say sells pottery on his site, which parts of the bot should I leave open to learning? Or should I have a separate module which learns the products of the target site? At the moment I am using this question as a starting point. I apologize if there's anything left out. Please let me know if there are more details required.
