Consider these polygons: ![Consider these polygons](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jSeLV.png) For reasons of simplicity I only consider triangles or polygons with 4 vertices. These shapes are specified by the vertices, the output of the program should be modified vertices. I am trying to find an algorithm to create a space between the polygons, the colored area depicts the space: ![polygons with space](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yQD6h.png) I have tried these things:   * scaling each polygon around it's center of gravity    * scaling the bounding box of each polygon None of those worked. I am thinking of an algorithm to modify the corner points of each polygon to create the equidistant space. What would be a feasible algorithm for this problem?
