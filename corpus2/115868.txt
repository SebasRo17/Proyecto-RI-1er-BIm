There are some great libraries for Python that have cousins in the .NET world, but some are unmatched. Realizing that Python is a dynamic language, which makes it difficult to mix with a (largely) statically typed language like C# (though this is seemingly getting easier with .NET 4.0), there are options like IronPython which can help match up the two languages. I've never come across any other options for dovetailing Python libraries with .NET. Are there any other ways to do this that are tried and true? I have far less experience with Python, so it's entirely possible that I'm overlooking something.
