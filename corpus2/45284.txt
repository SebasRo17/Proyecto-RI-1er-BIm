I have the following recurrence relation that has no general solution: $$x(t+1) = \frac{x^2 + x(1-x)(1-sh)}{x^2 + 2x(1-x)(1-sh) + (1-x)^2(1-s)}$$ In Mathematica language it gives:               x[t + 1] == (x[t]^2 + x[t] (1 - x[t]) (1 - s h))/(        x[t]^2 + 2 x[t] (1 - x[t]) (1 - s h) + (1 - x[t])^2 (1 - s)  )      * * * I'd like to plot $x$ as a function of $t$ (range{0,100}). How can I do this? Also, that would be awesome if I could directly on my plot, modify the values of $h$ and $s$ in the range {0,1}
