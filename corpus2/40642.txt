I've been doing web programming and currently work at a company working with mainly PHP and Javascript. For a little while now I've been becoming more and more frustrated with the shortcomings of this type of development and want to move to a company with a more defined development process that values doing things the "right way" such as using Unit tests, dependency injection / IoC, etc. I've been learning JEE / Java as much as I can on my own time but would really like to make a switch to doing this as my career and leave behind the PHP world altogether. I'm just wondering if anyone can give me advice on which things to put my main focus on right now to make myself marketable as an entry level Java developer? Basically, I feel that I'm not really learning anything new at my current job that will benefit me and its only making me more and more frustrated so I figure if there is any way to position myself for a transition I would rather do it sooner than later.
