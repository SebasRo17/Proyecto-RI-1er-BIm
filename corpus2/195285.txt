I work in a small web development company (3 programmers) for a while. During the last year the company had hard times (less projects) and a few co-workers were fired, including our Production Manager. Having this person out of our team mean to us that we have to deal more and more with the company bosses (owners). It's them who meet the clients and discuss about upcoming projects (custom web app for example) We had a meeting with the boss this week about a particular project for which he wants the specs to change (add a few features). I understand that in the real world specs **always** change during a project (I'm in this business for almost 10 years, I already figured that). What I am having hard time with is when the boss keeps trying to **minimize the complexity, the impacts of the new specs** because in his mind those changes are not that hard and should not take a lot more time (especially because he already signed a contract with our client for a fixed amount of money). With one programmer co-worker we joked about that, saying that it's not by adding two wings on a car that you will make plane, it has major impact on the whole design of the vehicle, time required is not the same, so is the same with software. Any idea how we should handle that kind of attitude from a boss? Is it possible to make him change his minding in that kind of situation ?
