Please bear with me as I am a beginner at Mathematica. In the following system, all variables on the right hand side are known, except for `w1`, `w2` and `w3`, for which we are trying to solve. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NuG4w.jpg) I am trying to solve this system in Mathematica, but I am not sure where to start. Also, in my real example, the system is composed of 10 equations instead of three: we are trying to solve for `w1`, `w2` and `w3` where `FA = FB = FC = FD = .... = Fj`. Please let me know if the explanation is a bit confusing, and I will try to explain better! Thanks!
