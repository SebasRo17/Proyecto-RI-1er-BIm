When I study from lecture slides from the web in (File Structures lesson), I stacked at the below question, I coudn't understand it. In the slide and at the web, I searched about the topic but I cannot find any explanatory solution about the question. Could somebody please explain the answer with the details? > Given a file of 30000 records, 1600 bytes each, and block size 2400 bytes, > how does record placement affect sequential reading time, in the following > cases? Discuss: > >   1. Empty space in blocks-internal fragmentation. >   2. Records overlap block boundaries. > The slide can be accessed from the link : http://tr.scribd.com/doc/14991462/24/Fast-Sequential-Reading
