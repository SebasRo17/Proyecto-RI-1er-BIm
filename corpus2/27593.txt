I do abuse it often but when I have faced this feature first time I was really suprised:               i = 0;     (i++; # - i) & /@ Range[5]      > {0, 0, 0, 0, 0} What am I asking about is **how do we know`Map` will do 'mapping' position after position?** Of course it might look logical but it is not stated, and then, since I know nothing about memory allocation etc., I could expect strange results. To be more precise, I could expect them only in cases where mapping funcion is changing during mapping. I have failed to find a word in documentation, only related but **not important** in this case: > Leaves are visited before roots * * * Have I missed something?
