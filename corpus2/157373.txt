I know that default arguments are created at the function initialisation time and not every time the function is called. See the following code:               def ook (item, lst=[]):         lst.append(item)         print 'ook', lst          def eek (item, lst=None):         if lst is None: lst = []         lst.append(item)         print 'eek', lst          max = 3     for x in xrange(max):         ook(x)          for x in xrange(max):         eek(x)      What I do not get is why this was implemented this way. What benefits does this behaviour offers over an initialisation at each call time?
