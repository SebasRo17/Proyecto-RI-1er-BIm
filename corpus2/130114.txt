I recently started learning JavaScript and am looking for a good JavaScript Editor/IDE. I found dozens of them in a Google search but I would appreciate if users who have experience with using such an IDE could recommend one. I want an IDE with **syntax highlighting** , possibly **IntelliSense** and **debugging support** for JavaScipt code. I'm a **Windows 7** user and do just **client-side** JavaScript development. Any suggestions??
