**The story** Over the last couple month I have been working on a pretty big project. It's an enterprise-level software, I designed to be used at a local gym, but I believe it can be used in other places, where things like keeping track of clients, attendances, purchases and payments are required. **The problem** Well recently, I started to think on how to mature this project from being home-made. Not just because I want my project to grow but also because I would like to have some gain from it. **The solutions?** And here I saw 2 paths:   * License the software under some restricted license and try to sell the software to other business around. This way I can get some money for college (I am a high school junior right now)   * License the software under some free license, publish it on GitHub or something, and try to engage other developers to participate in the project. This way I get experience of working in a team and a better chance that the project will keep growing. The latter would be a good + for my resume, when I'll trying to find a job. So far both ways seem pretty exciting and beneficial to me. The first one offers a good college career, while the second one offers some additional experience and the project's growth. **The questions** Can anyone point to some other +/- of these 2 options? What would the better option in my situation and why? Or are there other options?
