To simplify a huge expression efficiently, which involves a variable in a bunch of exponential functions going to infinity, I have tried to substitute               /.Exp[-x_]->0      where my intention was to set to zero any exponential function featuring a minus sign in front of an arbitrary function. Unfortunately this substitution had no effect. How can I do what I intend? Please note, `Simplify` and `FullSimplify` functions involving any `ComplexityFunction` are not an option, since they take forever to evaluate. **EDIT** On a similar note, I noticed that oftentimes expressions of the same power appear as multipliers in numerator and denominator, like in the following example $$\frac{a f_{1}+af_2}{(a f_3+af_4)f_5}$$ still the $a$ does not cancel out automatically. Is there a command to explicitly look for such cancellations and carry them out without attempting any other simplifications? I tried `PowerExpand`, `Expand` and `ExpandAll`. None of them work like this.
