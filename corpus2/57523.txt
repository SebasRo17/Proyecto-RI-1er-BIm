I would like to evaluate the following (simplified) expression with Mathematica : $\frac{\delta}{\delta J} \exp[(J(x)+K(x)) \Delta (J(x)+K(x))]$ where $\Delta$ is a differential operator independent of $J$, depending on $x$. The thing is, I don't want to write an explicit expression for $\Delta$ since it is not necessary. Is there a way to do that ? I apologise if the question is very basic, but I'm quite new to Mathematica and I have a hard time understanding how it works. Thanks in advance. Edit : here are a few additional details. The operator $\Delta$ is a differential operator of the form $\Box - mˆ{2}$, typical KG but not in a flat metric (if that is helpful for the question). I need to actually compute : $$\exp \left(- \frac{i}{4} J_4 \left(i \frac{\delta}{\delta J} \right)ˆ4 \right) \exp[(J(x)+K(x)) \Delta (J(x)+K(x))] $$ so I thought about expanding the exponential in a sum and apply the sum on the exponential on the right to see if a pattern could be found, in order to get an analytical expression for that. Doing the differentiation by hand is quite long and tedious, so I wanted to see whether Mathematica could help me or not.
