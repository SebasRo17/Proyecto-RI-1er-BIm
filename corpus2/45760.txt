using : Mathematica 9.0.1.0 Hello ! Does RuleDelayed work inside MessageName ? This code:               myFunction[x_]:= x + 1;     myFunction::test = test /. test :> StringJoin[{DateString[], " message"}];     Message[myFunction::test]      gives               myFunction::test: 2014 04 10 15 10 51 781 message      on a pc and               myFunction::test: -- Message text not found --      on another one, and I can not get a sens of the underlying general rule. Presumably, I messed up some Global Preferences in Options Inspector, but I can not imagine which one. Thanks !!
