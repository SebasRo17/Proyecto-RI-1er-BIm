I've been making MVC programs for work (I'm an intern) and I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job at abstraction, single responsibility, etc. But I have this feeling about how I keep making objects properties of other objects and I'm not sure if it's a bad thing. Example:               User     {          String Username;          Int32 UserID;               .               .               .          BusinessLogicClass Variable;     }          BusinessLogicClass      {         AnotherClass Variable;         AndAnother Variable2;     }          AnotherClass     {          IThinkYoureGetting ThePoint;     }      All my Classes are properties of the others in one massive hierarchy, It's kind of what the business logic calls for but I can't help but wonder if I should be trying to prevent something like this. So I end up effectively with one variable that I control the children of, but the classes are separate. Is this something common? Is it bad? If it is bad, what should I do about it?
