I have developed a Swing application that controls execution of several scripts like jobs. I need to display the interim output of the jobs concurrently. I have followed MVC while writing the application. The application is working as expected. But off late I have the following requirements in hand:     1. A few of the script jobs need special user privileges to execute so as to access specialized resources. There seems to be no way in Java to impersonate as a different user while running an application.[examined in this question]. Also trying to run the Swing application as a scheduled task in windows is not helping.   2. Once started the jobs should be running even if the user logs off after starting the jobs. I am thinking of separating the execution logic from the UI and run that as a service; and introduce JMS in between the two layers so as to store/retrieve the interim the output. Note: I need to run this application on windows. Any ideas on meeting my requirements, will be highly appreciated.
