My company is an online retailer, and we use an homebrew ecommerce platform. In the last year or so, we've partnered with a accounting software vendor, as our homebrew solution was unable to produce reports as needed, or otherwise satisfy the requests of banks and investors. We're off to a rocky start with the software, but I'm wondering if it's our approach. Currently, we store a complete set of data in the database connected to our ecommerce platform. Nightly, we send the necessary API calls to sync our entities in the accounting software (orders, POs, invoices, etc), and each morning, I've created scripts that validate that the data is correct between the two systems. This collective system has been a nightmare, as any minor chages to the ecommerce platform cascade in violent and horrible ways to system B. It's resulting in a TON of work on my part to make corrections on a daily basis. Is there a correct way to approach this problem? Or does the problem really lie upstream, in our decision to duplicate the data between the two systems. Has anybody successfully done something similar? It has been a non-stop fire drill for 3 months now, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.
