I have spent several months creating the language Wake. It is now in alpha status, meaning its highly usable but still has many planned features -- features which will be slow to create with only one developer. Being in an alpha release, I don't want to go for too much publicity too soon. I don't want to push anyone to use it in production, or have Wake remembered as "that language that is in the works." The number one thing at this point is gaining contributors. I did a presentation (there's a video on youtube) to friends and family that might have gained me one or two, probably more help on styling and docs than feature development. Do you think the language is ready for   * sharing on reddit   * presenting at conferences   * pitching to companies for supplementary help   * adding to package databases like ubuntu, brew, chocolatey, etc   * sharing on lambda the ultimate And what other publicity actions could I take? Do you think I need to write "how to contribute" articles? I have been planning on making a blog post _From the ashes of Google's Noop comes a new language: Wake_ to take a piggy-back approach to marketing it. Is that sort of introduction good to broadly publicize right now?
