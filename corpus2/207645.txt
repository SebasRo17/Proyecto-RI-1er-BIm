I'm exploring options for running a small cloud Windows Server (either AWS EC2 Micro or Azure Extra Small). The server won't be hit very hard, but I need to run a simple relational database, which I'm expecting to be moderately sized - probably a few tables with a few hundred thousand records, and running a few thousand queries a day to aggregate the data. I'm most familiar with SQL Server, so I'm looking into using SQL Express. However, the system specs are well below the recommended values for SQL 2012 Express. 2008 is a little better, but still not great. Anyone have experience (good or bad) with running SQL Server Express on one of these servers? I'll definitely do some testing before making a decision, but with the inconsistency that comes with these shared computing solutions, I can't be confident after just one or two testing sessions, so anecdotal evidence would be great. If SQL Server doesn't work well, I'll be looking into other solutions - it seems Postgres works well in a wimpy server, or maybe MySQL or one of its forks, or possibly cloud database hosting like Azure SQL Databases.
