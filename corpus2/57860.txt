I'm a software engineer at a local university, and I feel I'm able to competently do my job, but recently I've been interested in "filling in" the gaps in my knowledge. I suspect I would have learned some of this in school; for example, I don't have a lot of knowledge of sorting algorithms (something I feel is pretty common in college). So, **what knowledge am I _likely_ missing by not going to college** that I could study on my own? Bonus points for listing resources that might put me on the right track! Some background: I've programmed in **PHP** , **Java** , and **Ruby** (more seriously in Java and Ruby than PHP); I have some experience with **C/C++** , though my workload doesn't really lend itself to those languages; I work mostly (recently) with the web, using frameworks such as **CakePHP** and **Rails**. I'm familiar with **SQL** (though probably not with some of the theory). Note: The university I work for has no technical classes, so taking courses on the university's dime is a great idea but not possible for me. :)
