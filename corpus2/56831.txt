I have an integration to do. I want to integrate. $\int_0^\infty sin^2(2\pi t)f(t)dt$ where $f(t)$ takes values from an array in the form $\\{t,f(t)\\}$ The time steps in the array is 1.1s. Can you please suggest a method to do this? I tried using the Trapezoidal method for numerical integration but gave a bad approximation. Is there an easy method with inbuilt function or another method?
