So there are 3 computers that I use to work on this project with, my home PC, work PC, and work Mac (for building to devices). The project has an SVN repository that two other programmers use so I can't commit broken code to it. The lead doesn't know how to use version control so the trunk contains art assets and everything else in addition to the project itself, making branching impractical (and I wouldn't want to use svn for branching anyway). I would use GIT if I could but it is not an option. My question is, how can I go to work, update my working copy, work on it a bit, send it to my mac for building, then go home and work on it some more later- keeping in mind that I may go 1-2 days without being able to commit working code to the repository?
