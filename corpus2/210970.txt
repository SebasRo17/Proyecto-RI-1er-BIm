Hello I have been using C++ and Java for years. For better or for worse, I have always looked at JavaScript as not as powerful as these languages and therefore probably not worth my time and effort to learn. However, I have recently been more interested in web development. I have researched Rails, MySQL databases, Html5, etc. I have been working a lot with GWT. I like GWT, but I have read that people feel too constrained by Google and that you probably have to know JavaScript anyway for making anything worthwhile. I don't have any specific kinds of websites in mind at the moment, just learning as much as I can. I really want to become proficient with setting up and querying databases, and using them to provide user generated content to a webpage. My question is, can I get away with not learning JavaScript, or do I have to bite the bullet? I know I am being lazy, but there are just so many tools out there that it is hard to know which are worth learning sometimes. I have also been researching languages like DART, but since it also compiles to JScript, and currently only Google implements it, I can't see a great reason to learn it. Sorry my question is so long, and thank you.
