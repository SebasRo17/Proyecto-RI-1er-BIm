We are looking to centralise our Integration in our company and I'm wondering what sort of solutions other have for this and what the best way to approach it would be. At the moment we have different types on integration running different lanuages, different frameworks on different servers so we are looking to move them all to a single framework to make it easier to manage. Some of the current Integration includes:   * SQL Server scheduled tasks (on 3 or 4 servers)   * SQL Server Integration services (on 2 or 3 servers)   * Console applications (.NET on 2 Servers)   * Windows Services (.NET on 2 servers) What we are after is:   * 1 server that manages all integration jobs scheduling (so this only needs to be setup once and we always know where to find it)   * A job monitor that displays the history of jobs run (Much like the SQL Server Job Activity monitor)   * Jobs might need to run custom .NET code, here some sort of API might be used to allow for more flexibility over SQL Server Integration Services
