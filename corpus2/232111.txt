The company I work for has commissioned a software company to produce a compliance software for several big companies. As part of our contract it is required of them to provide us with src code and documentation in case in the future we want to take over and further develop the project in house or have another company take over. What are the best practices for software documentation in this case? I.e. What shall I ask of them to provide us for if a 3rd company in the future were to take over? Right now they just provided us the src code and a auto-generated class document (not even class diagram, just a list of all classes, parameters etc). I hope someone can point me in the right direction so that I can produce a small document with what our requirements are.
