It's not uncommon for projects to fail. As a programmer, how do you deal with projects that fail? Some definitions of failure:   * Misses deadline.   * Code and functionality does not do what it's supposed to.   * Software becomes vapor-ware or endless number of phases, essentially undeliverable. Or maybe you have your own definition(s) of failure. Do you start pointing fingers? Do you blame yourself, the requirements, the technology, the management, the client, etc? Do you do a lessons learned session as a team?
