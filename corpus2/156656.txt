If I open a picture file, lets say with an PNG extension, I will see bunch of code. Now let say I want to get some information from the picture mechanically. So the question here is what is the first step here, do I need to parse the picture?. If so how can I get the grammar for picture files? (PNG, JPEG, etc.) UPDATE: Found an issue with my thinking!. Parsers are for text-based languages, however pictures are binary files. So, I dont think we need to parse them we need to go in the opposite direction and turn them into abstract syntax trees, wondering how to do so without knowing the grammar!
