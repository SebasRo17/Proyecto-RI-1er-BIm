I have a good breadth of experience now (over a dozen) primarily as a dba,developer, BI admin, data analyst. I started my career in a couple of startups and now for a big internet company. The culture has always been interesting, fast-paced and just constantly moving. Recently, a family member of mine asked if I would be interested in taking my experience to his company (an established Oil & Gas). There's an opening for a database developer position there. The hiring manager liked my quals and has asked me to come in for an interview. Not having experience in this domain, the opportunity seems to be intriguing to work with data in this domain. It sounds like the culture is much slower- paced, but there is stability. People who have worked there for years. This is primarily a windows shop using .NET, Sybase, SQL server. Almost all my experience has been on unix/linux platforms with oracle, mySQL, open source tools. Given my experience thus far described, would this be an opportunity worth trying? Going essentially from an internet domain to a manufacturing company? Anyone experience this transition? I'm thinking there might be a good growth opportunity in the manufacturing company. There is also a chance I can obtain security clearance which could lead into other opportunities as well.
