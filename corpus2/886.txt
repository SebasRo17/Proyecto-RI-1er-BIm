Take the following example for hiding/showing a notebook through a `Checkbox`:               x = True;     CreateDocument[{"hello"}, Visible -> Dynamic[x]];     Checkbox[Dynamic[x]]      It works correctly until the kernel is restarted, but not after. The documentation explains that the variables in a `DynamicModule` are owned by the front end, not the kernel. So to make this piece of GUI resistant to kernel quits/crashes, I tried:               DynamicModule[      {x = True},      CreateDocument[{"hello"}, Visible -> Dynamic[x]];      Checkbox[Dynamic[x]]     ]      This one does not work though. Can someone explain why, and whether there is to use this `DynamicModule` variable outside the `DynamicModule`? Is this behaviour somehow related to the `DynamicModuleParent` option? * * * **Update:** As Brett Champion has pointed out in the comments below, there's a similar example in the documentation in the DynamicModule Wormholes section. This shows how to make it possible to access a particular `DynamicModule`'s variable from another `DynamicModule` using the `InheritScope -> True` setting. However, my example I don't have a second `DynamicModule` in the newly created notebook, only a single `Dynamic`, so I am not sure how to connect the variables.
