In which ways could object-orientation (OO) make my data analysis more efficient and let me reuse more of my code? The data analysis can be broken up into   1. get data (from db or csv or similar)   2. transform data (filter, group/pivot, ...)   3. display/plot (graph timeseries, create tables, etc.) I mostly use Python and its Pandas and Matplotlib packages for this besides some DB connectivity (SQL). Almost all of my code is a functional/procedural mix. While I have started to create a data object for a certain collection of time series, I wonder if there are OO design patterns/approaches for other parts of the process that might increase efficiency?
