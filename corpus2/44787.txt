Consdier the following package               BeginPackage["packageName`"];        exportedFunction::usage = "...";        Begin["`Private`"];           globalVariable = Null;           initializePackage[args___] := (globalVariable = workOn1[args]);           exportedFunction[args___] :=               Block[{localVariable},                 If[globalVariable===Null, Abort[]];                 localVariable = workOn2[globalVariable, args];                 workOn3[localVariable]              ];           workOn1[args___] := ...;           workOn2[gv_, args___] := ...;           workOn3[lv_] := ...;        End[];     EndPackage[];      and assume that is being debugged in a workbench session, and that a break point has been set somewhere in exportedFunction. The debugger reports on the values of localVariable, but I can never see the value of globalVariable. Is there a way to inspect the value of globalVariable as well?
