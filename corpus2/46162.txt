This is related to my previous question here A series of my questions are related to an important problem: It is important to be able to CDF-publish a document, and be able to open a separate interactive window from this document. Let me explain in more details. In my concrete situation I have a document in a form of a cdf file. I would like to open, say, a manipulate-based demonstration in a separate window. To enable the reader to read the rest of the document, and to use the demonstration while reading further. The discussion here has shown that it is likely to be impossible. What is impossible, however? What I tried to achieve at that point was to open an nb notebook from a cdf file within the CDF Player. That is clear that it is counter logic. If this would be possible, it would be the work around to use the free CDF Player instead of Mathematica. OK, is it possible to create a cdf document, and then to embed this document into another one in a form of a code? This is to be able to open one (slave) cdf document from another (master) CDF document. Then one will open a cdf, rather than nb within the CDF Player. This should not be forbidden. To be precise, let us assume a notebook with this simple code:                Manipulate[Plot[Sin[a*x],{x,0,6}],{a,1,2}]      This notebook can be saved as a stand-alone cdf. My question is this: Is it possible to get a code corresponding to this cdf document, such that it can be launched by, say, the following code:               Button["Launch cdf file", the_code_in_question]      from another notebook. This notebook will also be transformed into the cdf form So, do you see such a possibility?
