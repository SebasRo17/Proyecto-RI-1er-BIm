I have a simulator that pulls data from a DB - calculates and return JSON result to an ajax call that renders a table for the results. The calculation procedure are as follow:   1. grab X number of data that are group together and have weights to them.   2. use historical data and run a weight distribution algorithm on the group.   3. return as a JSON the metrics of each data, the old value, and the calculated new value 2 Questions: 1) Is Javascript calculation better or worse (or equal) to PHP calculation in order to yield the results. 2) IF Javascript calculation is faster or on par to PHP then I would assume the trip to call ajax is a small bottleneck. So one possibility would be to pre-load data and have it calculated on the fly. Now how would you persist that pre-loading efficiently? Would that just simply load everything in a simple var via ajax? Thus far it takes approx 55 seconds for the result to return 2000 entries on 14 days worth of data.
