I was curious to know, if juggling between 2-3 projects at a time is a good or a common practice or not. When I say, 2-3 projects I mean:   1\. 1 primary project,   2\. 1 project with minor improvements/changes and   3\. 1 project which comes at times for bug fixes So essentially, I find my self generally working on 2 projects in parallel and sometimes the 3rd one comes in with a trivial fix. Is this a problem? Or I should be learning to work on multiple projects at any given time. My personal opinion is, this style of work might affect how detailed and in-depth you think about a project.
