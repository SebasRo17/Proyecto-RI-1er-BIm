I'd like to get better at estimating how long it will take me to complete tasks. When estimating things I know little about, I think it's best to start with base rate information and adjust it based on things I _do_ know, rather than to go on 'gut feeling' which is what I normally do, and is generally optimistic. What I lack is that base rate information. Are there any statistics available which give typical ideal man-hour costs (or some other metric) based on some property/properties of the task in question? For some context, I work as a programmer in the video games industry, and I'm talking about chunks of work that typically take somewhere between 2-16 hours, though occasionally drag on far longer than that... ;) I realise this is a big ask, but I have to start somewhere! Things I've already tried:   * google - my search terms appear to be too general - lots of irrelevant results.   * This question \- asks for overall estimate, in a different domain. Unsatisfactory answers.
