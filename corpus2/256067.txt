Macros exist in many programming languages, for example, C.   1. A data type is a set of values with operations on the values. Are macros values, or data types?   2. Are macros identifiers, variables, or constants?   3. Are macros something not belonging to a programming language, and something that will be translated to the programming language in the preprocessing step of compilation? Thanks,
