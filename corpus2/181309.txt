So my question is this: Is there any easy way for a single developer to release an app on iOS and Android? I am a web developer that primarily plays in PHP, Node, Ruby, AS, and JS. I have dabbled a tiny, tiny bit in Objective-C and Java. Basically I am looking for a good way to release a fairly simple app on both Android and iOS and have a uniform UI that is fairly easy to maintain. The app's main purpose is a well designed visual interface (with animation to help convey actions) to a simple backend API. Currently I was looking at using Flex, but want to find out other options if they exist. Thank you!
