I am able to launch remote kernels from my _Windows_ box to our _Linux_ cluster that   1. has the data I need and    2. the capacity to run analysis (numerous & speedy cores, spacious memory, etc.). Works great except for the fact that there's a bit of latency. That's not a huge deal given the cost of the calculations I run, but what kills me is the predictive interface. Any time _Mathematica_ tries to be helpful with the predictive interface functions, the latency kicks in, the program stops responding, and I have to wait for the remote kernel to return its results before any part of _Mathematica_ becomes responsive. Is there a way to peg the local kernel to user interface or predictive interface tasks and assign the remote kernel(s) to computation only?
