One of my professors says "the syntax is the UI of a programming language", languages like Ruby have great readability and it's growing, but we see a lot of programmers productive with C\C++, so as programmers does it really matter that the syntax should be acceptable? I would love to know your opinion on that. Disclaimer: I'm not trying to start an argument. I thought this is a good topic of discussion. Update: This turns out to be a good topic. I'm glad you are all participating in it.
