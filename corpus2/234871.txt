My team is working with git for the first time and has really messed up our git remote due to our inexperience. I'm trying to help educate them on git to solve the problem in the long term, but in the meantime, the commits that have been made are totally wrong. We haven't made very much progress at all, and I don't see the value in retaining these commits when they could cause confusion/additional problems down the line. The most recent commit was a merge between the master branch and a second branch that one of the team members unintentionally created. If I try to revert, git states that I must be using the -m flag, but I'm not sure whether I should be reverting or trying to rebase in this case, or how I would do it given the structure of the past couple of commits. What is the best way to resolve this issue and how should I go about doing it?
