I'm doing a research on PHP and wondering if there any other commonly used programming langues that use an associative array for both simple indexed element storage and key-value functionality. Does it make PHP unique in this sense? For example, a language like C# distinguishes clearly between a simple array and a map\dictionary\hash               T[] array = new T[];     Dictionary<T, S> map = new Dictionary<T, S>();      Meanwhile PHP makes no such distinction (at design time)               $array = array(1, 2, 3);     $map = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3)
