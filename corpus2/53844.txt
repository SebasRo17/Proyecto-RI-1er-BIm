I paid for a web site for my motel business, then due to my landlord actions I was placed in a position to file for bankrupcy. I asked my IT manager and web developer to close down the web site for the business. He has since then sold my web site to the new owners. I took all the photos myself and I am in at least 4 of the photos on the site. There are no changes to the site as I left it and it now states that it is under the copyright on the new owners? I am not sure what I should do as this happen 10 months ago and I have just found this out. Thank you for your help, I am in Australia.
