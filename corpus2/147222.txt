With a recent project our .Net based dev team has been tasked with integrating with a whole host of java based web services around the world, and we really have had a surprisingly (well, we are certainly not surprised any more) large amount of issues because the XML generated by WCF is not accepted by the java services. It also seems that there is not really that much good information to find on the subject, we have gotten some good tips from Yaron Nave's excellent WCF blog, http://webservices20.blogspot.com, and also on the MSDN WCF forum http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wcf/threads. Are there anyone here who really feel that they got this down, and know the definitive resource on the subject? Would be interested in tips on books, blogs or any websites. Edit:   I am torn on setting the answer accepted on this thread, because each of the two best answers has some value:   1\. We will probably end up with doing more HTTP Webrequest implementations instead of fighting WCF.   2\. But the WCF Express Interop Bindings 1.0 was also a very sensible tip.
