I'm developing a commercial cms. I'm going to sell this cms. I use jQuery, also I use date and time picker jQuery plugin in my cms, I can say this is just a 1% of my big script, I don't want sell my whole program as GPL because of these two small integrations (jQuery and DateTime picker). Please ask on these questions:   1. I'm worry about license issue. What is the best way to sell my product(licensing type)?   2. Is there any way to provide some partial licenses? I mean just add small notification in my license that the jQuery and The DateTime picker is still in GPL, but other part of this CMS has commercial license?   3. If there isn't any way to sell commercial product as close source with GPL small parts, what is the most strong license for selling my product to keep it safe? Please sorry for my English
