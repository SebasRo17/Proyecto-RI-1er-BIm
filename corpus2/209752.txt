I'm an open source web application for use in my university. Currently professors usually have a website, but do to the fact that they're teaching multiple classes in a given term, they don't care to spend time and make an extensible, functional website. The purpose of this project is to create an OSS website that can be dropped in place and enabled by simply running an init.php file. I'm curious though as how to handle information storage for such a task. A full server database is a bit outside of the scope I'm looking for, but something like SQlite would fit very well. The problem I'm running into is that not all departments have SQlite installed on their servers, and getting them all to do so won't happen. Can anyone think of a way to include SQlite into an application where the drivers aren't already installed on the system, or a more common alternative that would provide a similar level of power/flexibility?
