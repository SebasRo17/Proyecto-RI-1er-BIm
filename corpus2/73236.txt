Other than being able to put "I know Python" on a resume, are the certifications from O'Reilly School of Technology (they are issued by the University of Illinois) any good for obtaining employment? I am interested in learning many of the topics covered by these programs and since they are fairly well-priced, I was thinking of going this route. However, I don't really want to do it if it's about as worthwhile as a degree from University of Phoenix. Does anyone know what effect these certs may have on obtaining employment vs not obtaining a certification, but learning on your own?
