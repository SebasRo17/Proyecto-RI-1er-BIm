Consider the function `f` which should behave as               f[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6, 7}}]      > >     {f[{1, 2}], f[{3, 4}], f[{5, 6, 7}]} >   The following code doesn't worked as expectation               fromDig[ls_?VectorQ] := 10^Range[Length@ls - 1, 0, -1].ls;     SetAttributes[fromDig, Listable];     fromDig@{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}}      I figured out a way, using `Compile`,               Clear["Global`*"];     cfromDig = Compile[{{A, _Integer, 1}},      10^Range[Length@A - 1, 0, -1].A, RuntimeAttributes -> {Listable}];     cfromDig[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}}]      Is there a better way?
