I am familiar with _Mathematica_ to a certain extent, but its subtleties still elude me. **Currently I am trying to solve the following problem:**   The function $f(x,y)$ is continuous. I know how to create a contourplot of it. I also have a list of points `{{x,y}, ...}` which I would like to insert into my contour plot. **Background:**   I am working on some genetic algorithms and would like to visualize how the population converges to the global optimum. This is why I would like to show the population (or at least the best candidate of each generation) in the contour plot. How could this be done?
