It is pretty common for a web application to display a list of items and for each item in the list to indicate to the current user whether they have already viewed the associated item. An approach that I have taken in the past is to store HasViewed objects that contain the Id of a viewed item/object and the Id of the User who has viewed that item/object. When it comes time to display a list of items this requires querying the database for the items, and separately querying the database for the HasViewed objects, and then combining the results of these queries into a set of objects constructed solely for the purpose of displaying them in the view. Each e.g li then uses the e.g. has_viewed property of the objects constructed above. I think it is time to find a better approach and would like to know what approaches you would recommend.
