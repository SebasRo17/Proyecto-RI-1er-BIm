Imagine this scenario: You've created a multiplayer game app for a mobile platform such as Android. You successfully set it up with one server, you figured out how to do that. It works quite well. To your surprise, the game TAKES OFF. Server demands explode. You need to scale, but you have hardly any experience with running a single server, let alone running multiple servers in tandem. What do you do? Is there a service (Heroku-style) to help with such a thing? Anything? Or do you need to hire someone with a certain skill set and the necessary experience?
