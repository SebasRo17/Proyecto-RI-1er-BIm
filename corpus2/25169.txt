I want to mark critical areas for statistical test on the plot. How can I do this? This:               pdf = PDF[NormalDistribution[], x]     Show[Plot[pdf, {x, -5, 5}],       Plot[pdf, {x, -5, -2.001}, Filling -> Axis]]      gives: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/op81t.png) I know that it is probably some super-duper Mathematica feature, but as far as I know this filling shouldn't be cut in such strange way, so I don't want to use this feature. How can I make the filling look right?
