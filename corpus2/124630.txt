After reading a question about books every programmer should read, I wonder if the following should be considered obsolete:   * Code complete: 1st edition in 1993; 2nd edition in May, 2004   * Introduction to algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein): 1st edition in 1990; 2nd edition in September, 2001; 3rd edition in 2009   * The Pragmatic Programmer: October, 1999   * Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs: 1st edition in 1984; 2nd edition in September, 1996   * The C Programming Language: 1st edition in 1978; 2nd edition in April, 1988 All these books seem very old. Isn't there a difference between modern computing and what was current when those book were written? For example, my 61-year-old teacher explains things very nicely but forgets to take into account all that has been done between when he began to teach 25 years ago and now. Isn't the same true for those books? Aren't there any more modern books that teach principles and technologies that are closer to current practice? Or do you consider them to be useful and relevant even today?
