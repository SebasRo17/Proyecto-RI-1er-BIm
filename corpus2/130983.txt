We have a family business and I need to be in India, Delhi for 4 months as a part of a business trip. I won't be doing much all day. I already have a degree in economics, but I also love software. Over the years I have taken different courses. I even took a degree in software engineering, completed the first 2 years but then I left for family reasons. It did not affect me as I already had a degree and also the family business. Now I am thinking what are some of the things I can do in the 4 months that I will be there. Programming lessons is one of them, in some of the languages that I am not familiar with, but what else? Are there any certifications I can get?
