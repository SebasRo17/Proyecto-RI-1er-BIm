When upgrading Visual Studio to a newer version, a new directory is created e.g. "Visual Studio 2013". I understand that that makes sense as we want to differentiate between code targeting different versions of .net. But since some projects use other projects as their dll's for some repeated code - this raises a question - should we copy everything and have everything separate for .net 4.0 from .net 4.5 or should we have one library that works for both (since 90% of the code will be the same) and only create a special library for code that can't run on 4.0? Just suggesting doing "whatever works for you" is not a good solution - at the moment both look viable. If one of the options has some disadvantages, they might become apparent only after we have many internal links from solution to solution, and there's no real way to change all links at once - one must search for every one of them manually, hoping not to miss anything. Since we're obviously not the first facing this question, I'd like to hear from those with experience in the matter. (or anyone else, of course.) (Though there might not be a clear cut answer to this question, I hope it will be allowed here just as the highest voted question on this site is.)
