Today I lost a lot of time with a strange behavior and I narrowed it down to this small piece of code:               a = {1, 2};     ToString@Row[DeleteDuplicates[a], ","]     ToString@Row[Union[a], ","]      > >     "Row[{1, 2}, ,]" >     "1,2" >   Can someone explain this bizarre behavior? Is this a bug? This is interesting too:               a = {1, 2};     l1 = DeleteDuplicates[a];     l2 = Union[a];     l1==l2     s1 = ToString@Row[l1, ","]     s2 = ToString@Row[l2, ","]     s1==s2      > >     True >     "Row[{1, 2}, ,]" >     "1,2" >     False >   There is some "memory" in `l1` created using `DeleteDuplicates`. **UPDATE** This bug was fixed in V10.0.0
