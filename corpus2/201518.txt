I am developing a software for a laboratory to test some devices. To test each device there are multi subtests which should be done to reach to the final result.To perform a complete test, the software must pass Stage1 then automatically goes to Stage2 then Stage3 and so on until the whole test is finished. meanwhile the user can select to just have the Stage3 or Stage2 or any other Stages independently to be performed (which she selects that at runtime). this is the thing I have done so far: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UTpiF.png)               public class IronTestWorkFlow:ITestWorkFlow         {             private readonly List<ITestStages> _testStageses;                  public IronTestWorkFlow(List<ITestStages> testStageses )             {                 if (testStageses == null)                 {                     throw new ArgumentNullException("testStageses");                 }                 _testStageses = testStageses;             }         }      I am useing a DI container. But I don't know how to change the list of Stages in `ITestWorkFlow` at runtime. **Questions:** 1- Am I designing this right? 2- If yes which pattern shall I follow to obey the principles and change the stages at runtime? and how can I do that?
