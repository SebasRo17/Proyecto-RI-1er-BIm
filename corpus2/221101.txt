I want to become a better developer, and so have been dedicating most of my free time outside of work to learning design patterns, and when to implement them (since I feel learning general patterns is a better starting point than learning specific libraries or tools). One issue is, that the majority of highly regarded design patterns I'm reading about tend to described in terms of their applications in software development. I was wondering what should be considered when applying them to web development rather than software development? For reference, these(Reference1 Reference2) is what I've been using as a reference when picking out what design pattern would be best applied for my current project.
