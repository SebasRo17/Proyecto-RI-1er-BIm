My code:               Clear[r1, r2];      par[r1_, r2_] := r1 r2 / (r1 + r2);      Reduce[{5 par[r2, 32000]/(r1 + par[r2, 32000]) == 1.8 && par[r1, r2] == 5000}, {r1, r2}]      with this result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xGpr3.png) I checked it a dozen times, but I can't see why MMA doesn't give me a value for r1. So, like I always do when I'm desperate :-), I quit and restarted MMA. Copied and pasted my input. And ecco!: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g5go4.png) Any idea what could have caused the first result?
