I typically run across gurus at SO and other places (instructors, book authors etc.) that would say something along the lines `"This will cause alignment issues"` or other low level tidbits. I want to learn about all these tidbits that are `relevant` to programming. Now usually when I see low level books (computer architecture books for example) they are too low level and geared towards people whose primary area of interest is computer architecture and not software design. Do you have recommendations for books that go through low-level stuff that is relevant to programmers?
