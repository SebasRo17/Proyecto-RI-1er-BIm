I am an advanced-intermediate level student focused on the .NET and C#. I know all the basics as well as classes, methods, objects, inheritance, OOP principles and all that. Problem is we haven't covered data structures like trees and graphs yet. Basically what I need my program to be able to do is this: Part 1 Console application:   1. Go online to a specific website and following the net of links on it, starting with the main page, create a directed graph with weightless edges and store it locally, so that it can be used without internet connection.   2. Be able to recreate the graph from the locally saved data and then by given 2 links as parameters to find and print the shortest path between them. Part 2 Some sort of UI:   1. By given webpage address and depth - visually represent in the browser a tree structure with the given website as root and the level of depth of the possible pages accessible by following the links from it. I would really appreciate it if you can direct me in the choices I have to make to accomplish this task. Mainly I am puzzled by these:   1. How to represent a graph in C#.   2. How to save it locally (program must finish within 5 seconds, so I cannot go online and do everything from scratch).   3. What should I use for the UI part with the tree visualization. I don't seek for complete answers rather than good directives. I need to learn these fast and not to waste precious time wandering.
