I am using an Export Module, now I want to extend it for different connections. I have a database which contains products Its Description, Review, Images etc. I use the serialize function to save it as XML file. After saving it as XML, in admin pannel I have possibility to select how this XML file will be exported. for example throught ftp, http, local, webservice, email etc. user has the possibility to select one or more connections to export the files. Each connection like ftp, http has it own settings in Database e.g ftp domain, username, password. what will be the best way to write these connection classes (by implementing Interface or using Abstract class or some Manager) and how to pass them to the export component as one exoprt may have on to many connections.
