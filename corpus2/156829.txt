Hi and thanks for looking! ## Background I have a project wherein I need to abstract meaning from a passage of text to determine what the text is seeking and then match that text to a list of search results. Now, I have some context with this and the following scenario is very close, but doesn't violate my NDA with the client: Let's say I have a software developer job description from a posting on Craig's List. I want to somehow parse that description and make a guess as to whether the posting is seeking a C# developer, a DBA, a SDET, a C++ dev, etc. Even better, it would be good to distill certain parameters such as years/level of experience and experience with any particular stacks (.NET, Java, etc). Once I have abstracted the requisition, I then need to reference a database of resumes (CVs) to find a ranked set of matches, probably using the same algorithm or at least a system of tags. ## Question How best do I attain this goal? Should I be looking into building an index of keywords? Natural Language Processing? Evolutionary Algorithms? We have to assume that human interaction will be very minimal. ## Example Job Posting Here is an example Job Posting that I have pulled at random from Craig's List: > We invite you to bring your career to an environment where talent is > rewarded and new ideas are encouraged.
