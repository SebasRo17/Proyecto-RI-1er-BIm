MMA 9.0.1 MacOSX "Mavericks". This issue is apparently mac specific. The issue of this post is illustrated here, for example. In a `SetterBar` control straight out of a `Manipulate`, there are no dividers, though the default appearance in other contexts is to have them. I prefer to have them and don't know why that design decision has been made, but anyway. I found a simple way to restore them using the `Paneled` option for `Manipulate` (which happened to produce other beneficial styling effects):               Manipulate[       Panel@view, {{view, 3, "Fruit:"},          {1 -> "Apples", 2 -> "Pears", 3 -> "Medlars"}, SetterBar},        AppearanceElements -> None, Paneled -> True]          Manipulate[       Panel@view, {{view, 3, "Fruit:"},          {1 -> "Apples", 2 -> "Pears", 3 -> "Medlars"}, SetterBar},        AppearanceElements -> None,  Paneled -> False]          Panel@     Manipulate[       Panel@view, {{view, 3, "Fruit:"},          {1 -> "Apples", 2 -> "Pears", 3 -> "Medlars"}, SetterBar},        AppearanceElements -> None, Paneled -> False]      ![Output of code above](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aEZo5.jpg) My question: is there a better way to get the dividers back from within a `Manipulate`?
