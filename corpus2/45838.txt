I'm trying to verify an identity involving symmetric traceless tensors over the reals. What I tried was:               In[11]:= $Assumptions = d \[Element] Matrices[{3, 3}, Reals, Symmetric[{1, 2}]]     Out[11]= d \[Element] Matrices[{3, 3}, Reals, Symmetric[{1, 2}]]     In[24]:= dd = d - Tr[d] IdentityMatrix[3]/3     Out[24]= {{d - Tr[d]/3, d, d}, {d, d - Tr[d]/3, d}, {d, d,d - Tr[d]/3}}      I think the output in 24 is assuming that d is now a scalar. That gets me into trouble later when I tried to compute outer products of dd and use TensorReduce. For example               lh = TensorReduce[TensorContract[dd\[TensorProduct]dd, {{1, 3}, {2, 4}}]]     TensorDimensions::fscl: Nonscalar expression d encountered as an argument of numeric function Power. >>     TensorDimensions::inhom: Inhomogeneous dimensions in sum d-Tr[d]/3. >>      Why is this not working, and what is the right way to do computations on traceless matrices?
