The complex Morlet function is defined as: $$Ψ(t,f_c,f_b)= \frac{1}{\sqrt[]{ \pi f_{b} } }\exp(-t^2/f_b)\exp(\jmath 2πf_ct)$$ where $f_b$ and $f_c$ are two important parameters in modifying the complex Morlet wavelet. It seems that _Mathematica_ doesn't support complex Morlet transform and Its only support real morlet function that I am not interested to use. I'm into complex wavelet function. _Mathematica_ only has Gabor transform for complex wavelets, and Gabor transform only has one parameter to be tuned.   so I need complex morlet function to run continues wavelet transform. Also I want to define $f_b$ and $f_c$ of the complex morlet function myself.   Can I make a complex Morlet wavalet transform by changing Gabor's parameter? How can I change $f_b$ and $f_c$ in it?   can I define a new wavelet exactly like the equation of complex morlet? P.S: Actually I am a _MATLAB_ user and as such I don't really know anything about the flexibility of _Mathematica_ , but the reason why I came here is that _Mathematica_ has the `InverseContinuousWaveletTransform`.
