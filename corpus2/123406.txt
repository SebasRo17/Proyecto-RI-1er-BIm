After a while, we are hiring again, and I'm reviewing tests for programmers; some of them are a bit out of date. What are some of the FizzBuzz-type questions for web developers and SQL? That is, not too trivial, but still solvable in five to ten minutes with pen and paper and without Google? I typically eliminate about two thirds or more of the candidates based on CV, and then all but a few really good candidates in a one-hour interview (which can be over the phone). At this point the candidate is writing a personality test and has a chance to write a bit of FizzBuzz-like code. So, I'm not trying to eliminate a bunch of candidates, but I am trying to validate my initial assessment that candidate is hireable and able to code.
