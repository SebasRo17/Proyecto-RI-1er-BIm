I have recently moved to a new company where I am tasked (in part) with evaluating the existing code base and coming up with patterns and best practices. Our development team consists of around 20 programmers and we have nearly as many projects. The bulk of the code is done in C# and SQL (Stored Procedures). Naturally, I speak to the guys writing the code. However, I need to read through the code to get a proper idea of what is going on. Given the number of projects, it is extremely time consuming; especially if you're simply trying to get a high-level view of what is going on. At the moment I am using Enterprise Architect to import the classes into class diagrams. This helps to an extent, but I guess something like a flow diagram would be more useful. I suspect team leads deal with this same problem often when it comes to code reviews. How do you manage to speed-up code analysis?
