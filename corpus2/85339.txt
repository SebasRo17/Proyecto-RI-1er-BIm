What are possible/standard words to describe your skill levels in different programming languages in your CV? I currently use these three:   * expert   * advanced   * beginner I do not consider myself an expert in any programming language, so I classify all my skills as either beginner or advanced. However, I would like to differentiate more. I am especially looking for something between _advanced_ and _expert_. Any suggestions? Or should I not even bother to differentiate any more detailed?
