I am trying to make a visualization of random process: coin flip. What I want to visualize is the result of i-th try: 1 or 0 value (the dot) and the mean (line) at i-th step. My code is as follows:               m = {}; c = {}; k = {};      Animate[      AppendTo[c, RandomInteger[]];      AppendTo[m, Mean[c]];      AppendTo[k, i];      Show[       ListPlot[Transpose[{k, c}]],        ListPlot[Transpose[{k, m}], Joined -> True,                PlotRange -> {{1, 100}, {0, 1}}, AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}]       ]      , {i, 1, 100, 1}, AnimationRepetitions -> 1,AnimationRunning -> False     ]      What I can't figure out is: Why at the very beginnig I get such a plot: ![I get such a plot:](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MJzVD.png) The line is not a mean value as should be expected. The second thing: Why there are two points at the moment, despite the fact that I have AnimationRunning->False? And the third: why k list is filled with ones only? Shouldn't it contain 1 to 100 values?
