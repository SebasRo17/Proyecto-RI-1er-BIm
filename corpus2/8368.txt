Maybe it's me, but I've never encountered nearly as many problems, annoying challenges, indirect error messages and general frustrations with any other technology as I have with WCF. What are the ACTUAL benefits? Not the MS Press Release benefits of 'a unified architecture for something something that's not going to work anyway.' And are those benefits worth the annoying frustrations? I'm normally a big MS fanboy over here, but I just can't get behind WCF.
