Architecturally speaking, which is the preferable approach (and why)?               $validation_date = $users_repository->getUser($user_id)->validation_date;        * Seems to violate Law of Demeter by accessing member of object returned by method call   * Seems to violate Encapsulation by accessing object member directly `$validation_date = $users_repository->getUserValidationDate($user_id);`   * Seems to violate Single Responsibility Principle as $users_repository no longer just returns User objects
