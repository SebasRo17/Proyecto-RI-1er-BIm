While trying to simplify expressions in the form `Sqrt[(expr)^2]` when `expr>0` I noticed a peculiar behavior that was not resolved with code from this Q&A.               Simplify[Sqrt[(x - y + a b c)^2], x - y + a b c > 0]      > >     Abs[a b c + x - y] >   When I remove any of the `a`, `b`, `c`, `x` or `y` it returns the result without the `Abs`:               Simplify[Sqrt[(x - y + b c)^2], x - y + b c > 0]      > >     b d + x - y >   I loose faith when I meet such behavior with Mathematica :-( Even though               Simplify[Sqrt[expr^2], expr > 0] /. expr -> (x - y + a b c)      does fix the first issue how could I simplify this:               Simplify[Sqrt[(x - y + a ^2 b^2 c^2)^2], x > y]      Anyway, can anybody explain why this happens and propose a way to fix it for general expressions?
