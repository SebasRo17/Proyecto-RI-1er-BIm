I have some video processing to run and FFmpeg already contains much of what I need. However my videos are all compressed with H.264 video codec and libx264 is a GPL part of FFmpeg. On the other hand, the Constrained Baseline Profile is pretty enough for my application what means I could perfectly use OpenH264. So would it be possible both in theory and in practice to make this replacement?
