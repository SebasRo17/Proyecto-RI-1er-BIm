I am building an animated model of the solar system, where I would like to display the `OrbitPath`s of the planets along with their `Position`s at any one point in time. I would like to display the orbital paths as lines, just as they are given when inputting `AstronomicalData["Earth", "OrbitPath"]`. I'd like to display the positions as `Sphere`s though. For some reason, even though I am combining the two graphical elements, only the spheres are displaying, and I cannot see the orbit lines at all. Would anyone be able to pinpoint what I am doing wrong in my code?               Animate[      Show[       Graphics3D[        AstronomicalData[#, "OrbitPath"] & /@ AstronomicalData["Planet"]],        Graphics3D[        Sphere[AstronomicalData[#, {"Position", DateList[x][[;; 3]]}] & /@           AstronomicalData["Planet"], 5*10^10]]       ], {x, 1, 10000000000}, AnimationRate -> 100000000      ]      For the record, I tried putting the graphics primitives in a single `Graphics3D` and combining the spheres and lines into a single list of primitives, but that was throwing up too many problems so I figured this way would be more straightforward.
