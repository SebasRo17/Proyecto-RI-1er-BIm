I'm determining which browsers a new site should support. I'm looking for a respected and accurate (as possible) report on the browser versions that are currently in use. This report should, at minimum cover the % of people who use what browsers, and versions of that browser. Is there a widely accepted source for this kind of report? If so, are they regularly released and available for free? Bonus points for other metrics such as breaking down by OS, Flash versions, JS versions, etc.
