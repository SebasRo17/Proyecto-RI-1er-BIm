I may be violating some StackOverflow terms by asking a question which is more likely to yield discussion than a clean answer. Here goes, however. I've developed some software for a small company that isn't a software house (so we don't already have a lot of processes in place). It is in Turbo Pascal (Delphi 2009) and my source is version controlled (CVS). I use several third party components (graphing, TCP comms, etc.) In Delphi, the default behavior is for the source for these to be stored in an include folder under the the Delphi IDE program files folder. It's now time to pass this project off to another developer. Now he'll have to install the IDE + components in order for them to appear correctly when editing forms in this application. But I'd like our production build process to be automated and I'd like a build server to be able to perform a code checkout and compile. This means I think I really need to put all the source code (or at least the DCUs where I don't have the source files) for these 3rd party addons in source control. I think they should be part of the CVS module for the software project being developed (i.e. not their own source controlled module). I think we need to be able (as a small company) to point a future developer at the repository, and say "Check out this module" and he'll have everything he needs to be able to compile from the command line without doing anything else. (i.e. portability to new dev environments is important) Is this sensible, or would it be more scalable for us to keep each library in its own version controlled state and then in the build script, pull the source code for this project, and the correct version of the source code for each library? Thanks in advance, and my apologies for the rambling nature of the question. Duncan
