> What is meant by a step-by-step refactoring plan describing how to implement > a certain design? As little as I know about refactoring it regards improving a (UML) design model and has nothing to do with the implementation of it. Therefore I'm pretty much confused by what this question means. Does anyone know and willing to explain? EDIT: In the context the design corresponds to a UML diagram with classes, methods and underlying associations.
