I'm quite new to Mathematica, I have version 9. I need to use it to simulate some physical problems. I know the equations (like Maxwell's equations and Newton's laws and so on), but I have no real idea on how to get some nice visual simulating output. Maybe let's start with some example: If I have two stars rotating around each other, what is the best way in Mathematica to simulate and display the gravitational vector field of this problem (dynmically depending on the location of the stars)? Or if I have some charges (not just points, but spheres, for example, ideally with some properties like polarity and permitivity) in an external electric field, how can I calculate and visualise the resulting field and the infleunce of movements and positions of the charges? Where do I have to start here? Just by hacking the genereral equations that I have on paper into Mathematica I won't get some dynamic output. I know the basics about `Manipulate` and on how to enter equations and on how to do some basic calculations (like `DSolve`). But I have no idea on how to get these things dynamical and visual so that I can just "move around" my stars and charges and see the resulting fields visually and in numbers.
