What is the minimum software list that one should be looking at for learning C#, ASP.NET, WinForms. I do have a system which has Windows 2003 installed in it. I am looking at something like WAMP for C#.NET development. Do we have a listing? Something along the following lines   1. Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition   2. IIS   3. My SQL (anything specific to C#.NET or should it definitely be SQL Server 2005/2008 Express Edition)   4. LINQPad   5. Anything else?
