Two days ago I got a suggestion to pass test of HTML 5 (I am looking for a job). I was shocked because modern web browsers don't support some features or support its partially. Other side of situation: I worked for a some company that still using SQL Server 2000 (now is available 2005, 2008) on her production. So my question is: how do you feel about those companies that try to use newest technologies? The newest is evil of good? **SUMMARY** We continue using old technology because of it predictability (this applies to critical systems in particular). A lack of productivity, low expansiveness, difficulties of deployment, implementation, testing of old technology are picking us to choice a new one. Even if we know that a new technology can be unsupported and now it is untested, raw and has low documentation, simple human curiosity is pushing us to use it. Any way we should be oriented on our target audience, people which are using our IT solutions. Other important things should be taken into account:   * time to implement    * time and cost to learn   * ease of deployment, implementation, testing   * faster and easier to use
