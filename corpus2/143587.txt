I would like to ask on method parameters design consideration. I am usually deciding between using individual variables as parameters versus grouping them to a class or dictionary as one parameter. Is there such a rule when you should use individual parameter against using a class or a dictionary to group the parameter? Individual parameter \- Straight forward, strongly typed Dictionary parameter \- Very extensible, like HTTP request but cannot be strongly typed. Class parameter \- Extensible by adding member to the class parameter, strongly typed. I am looking for a design reference on when to use which? Note: I am not sure if this question is valid in programmers but I definitely think it would be closed in stackoverflow, If it is still not valid, please point me to the proper page.
