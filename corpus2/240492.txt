I am preparing for interview and try to solve the exercise problems of the book. > 3-6. [5] Describe how to modify any balanced tree data structure such that > search, insert, delete, minimum, and maximum still take O(log n) time each, > but successor and predecessor now take O(1) time each. Which operations have > to be modified to support this? Solution: Maintain extra pointers to the successor and predecessor. Update the pointers on insert and delete. Nothing else right? Or is there some other trick involved. Thanks
