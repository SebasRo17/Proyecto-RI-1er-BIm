I'm starting a project with a big client that has several websites across the world, and they want to integrate them into a single Sitecore codebase/structure. All good in principle, but there are certain navigation controls that we have to use but, due to organizational complexities, _we don't have the other sites sources available_ (not that they don't have it somewhere, just that our team will have a difficult time getting a hold on it). So we are left with the task of going site by site (each site is in a different language), looking at the navigation controls, and more or less copy html and js and use that. Something that doesn't sound impossible, but i've never tried to do this before and i feel somewhat confused about how to go about this task. **Edit** to reiterate, we aren't concerned about translations nor do we want to grab the display text from the other sites, what we are after is obtain the controls code so we can use it locally. And with code i mean html/css and js. The controls need to look exactly the same as those already on production Do you have any general or concise recomendations to offer?
