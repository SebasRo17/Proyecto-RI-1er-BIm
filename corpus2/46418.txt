I'm trying to import a PDF file whose text I'd like to parse, but I'm getting an error with no explanation:               Import["foobar.pdf", {"PDF", "Plaintext"}]     (* $Failed *)      I know the file exists as named, because if it didn't, $Mathematica$ would show a message:               Import["foobaz.pdf", {"PDF", "Plaintext"}]     (* Import::nffil: File not found during Import. *)     (* $Failed *)      Is there any way to get more information than the `$Failed`?
