I am a web developer. I'm doing all kinds of web-sites and web applications. It's very strange for me that a lot of customers do not know the difference between a web developer and a slicer. They just want to "give you the PSD" and expect you to give them a web site with a DB back-end and so on... I'm just asking here: am I wrong in my thinking? Of course, a web developer MUST know html and css but I don't think that he should slice the PSD and do all the work a css guru can do... I would like to hear your opinions on this.
