I want to download Visual Studio 2010 Express Edition to learn all that is new in it. I find it insufficient as there is no Crystal Reports integration in it. Apart from that I want to learn other enterprise features that are bundled with the Professional Edition. If I download the VS 2010 Professional Edition, it is just limited to 90 days. Is there any other alternative for learners? Also, is there any FREE alternative for reporting in Express Edition.
