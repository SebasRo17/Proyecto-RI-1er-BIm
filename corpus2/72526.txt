Why is writing code when you encounter a tricky problem considered "bad" programming practice? And why is thinking a problem completely through on paper or in your head before you write code "good" ? From what I've been working with, I'm able to see problems in multiple different ways or special cases I didn't think of at first by typing out code and debugging than solving the problem completely first ? Also, I can't really find any appropriate hashtags for this. So any help is much appreciated!
