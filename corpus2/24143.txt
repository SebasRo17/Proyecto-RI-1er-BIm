My question is so trivial and I'm sure most people in here know exactly how to do this, however I still don't know how to run Mathematica in Mac terminal! I need to use all the cores of my computer in order to get faster results. I open Mathematica in terminal using this command:               /Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel      Then when I type `math -run "<<test.m"` (test is my file's name), nothing happens! Can anybody guide me what to do or refer me to a good refrence with some examples at this?
