I'm just beginning to grasp the concept of factories, and want to use them in my next project (I'm using dependency injection, so using factories will make object instantiation easier). Some basic questions I have:   1. Does it make sense to have one factory class per application layer (GUI, BLL, DAL), per class, or just one factory class for everything?   2. What is a typical naming convention for factory classes? Addendum:   1. If I create a factory per class, in a .Net project, should I simply create one class file called Factories.cs to house all of my factory classes? If not, what would be a better approach?
