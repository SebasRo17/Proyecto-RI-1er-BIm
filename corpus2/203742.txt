We are porting our Java API library to C++. (Our target platforms are Linux and Windows.) Since we have minimal C++ experience, the learning curve has been pretty steep, but overall we have been able to make a clean port so far. In Java we use log4j, and are looking at to use log4cxx in the C++ version. It took us a few hours to get log4cxx to build on Windows (due both to our inexperience, and also build documentation seems out of date). We haven't yet tried to build on Linux. To my uninformed eye, log4cxx seems messy and somewhat outdated. Is there any consensus on whether this is a good logging framework to go forward with? (Log4j also seems to have been superceded by SLF4J and Logback.) I looked also at boost logging, but that does not appear to be part of the main distribution, so I wasn't sure if I was provided a more standard option with that or not. One other piece of information to add into the evaluation - the first client we are providing this to is already using log4cxx.
