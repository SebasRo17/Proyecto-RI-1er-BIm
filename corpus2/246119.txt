My company has a client-side web application that we would like to open- source. We don't want to impose any restrictions on usage, except that any modifications and derivative works should contain a **visible** attribution, e.g. show our name and/or logo - we want it to be visible that our code is being used in the application. As I understand, while licenses like BSD 3-clause contain an attribution requirement, it can be satisfied with something like a HTML comment only. How to license to ensure that derivative works are visibly labeled?
