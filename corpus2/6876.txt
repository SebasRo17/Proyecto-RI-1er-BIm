I'm playing around with some code that's calling external command-line commands on a windows platform, and when doing this, the command prompt will pop up quickly and then disappear. This is not a huge bother, if you are calling something once, however if you have a loop running and each call takes some time, it becomes a major annoyance. Consider the following code:                Table[Pause[1/2]; Run[ "dir" ];, {3}];      Is there any way to avoid this behavior, or calling an external program though other methods then by `Run[]`.
