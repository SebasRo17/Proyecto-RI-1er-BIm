At work we mostly do WinForms development and it’s not a secret that it is already very outdated. I have a passion to learn new stuff like WPF, MVVM and want to use full advantages of C# 4.0. There is no way I can push my bosses to change “well-recommended” and “proven” technologies like WinForms to something else. I have up to two hours a day which I can dedicate to self-learning but I simply don’t know the most efficient way to study. I tried to read couple of books and even wrote a simple WPF application but think that it’s not enough. How can I manage my time learning new things in a way that sticks, even if I don't use it on a daily basis?
