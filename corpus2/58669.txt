In Mathematica 9, a number of issues concerning the `::Usage` and templates were raised. In 9.0, there was a bug first reported here and better diagnosed here, where error messages were generated by simply moving the insertion point somewhere in the argument of a function for which a `::Usage` was defined. This was fixed in 9.0.1 In both 9.0 and 9.0.1, it was reported here and here that functions with formatted `::Usage` needed `?Function` to be called twice in order for messages to be rendered properly. A bandaid solution was given here. Certain inflexibility about the text in the templates was raised here, and inconsistencies reported here. The consensus I gather from the discussion in the comments above is that `::Usage` and templates are implemented in _Mathematica_ in a very kludgy way. This can be a source of major frustration for package developers. So the question I raise is which of the issues have been addressed in v10? Are there plans for a major overhaul of the `::usage` system?
