I would like to measure the density of my western blot band by measuring the area under the peak from this plot. More specifically, my image will have several lanes with a pattern of bands in each lane (see link below). I would like to select an area and then measure the intensity of the bands as scanned from top to bottom. I would do this for each lane by selecting same area (essentially move my rectangle over to the new lane) and then plot the density vs length of gel (down direction). I would then like to integrate the area under each curve to get a value which can then be compared to the pattern and density (increased or decreased) of the neighboring lane. Is this possible to do in _Mathematica_ and, if so, how can I do it. I'm very new to _Mathematica_ and any help would greatly be appreciated. ![http://i2.wp.com/homemadeprojects.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/02/gel.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HnRBX.png) * * * _Keywords_ : line, lines, spectrum, spectral
