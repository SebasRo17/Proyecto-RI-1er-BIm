I would like to mesh the surface of a cloud of points that may not be completely convex, for example the points in this question. Mathematica does not provide triangulation of 3D points, but there is a link to TetGen                Needs["TetGenLink`"]           {mypts, mysurface} = TetGenConvexHull[dat];      Graphics3D[GraphicsComplex[mypts, Polygon[mysurface]], Boxed -> False]      which results in this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I5TH5.jpg) Notice it doesn't get the surface meshing associated with subtle twist in the curved shape, and meshes points further away in the goal of creating a convex object. I suppose one could try to mesh the surface piece by piece and slowly merge it as in this answer, but that sounds like a nightmare. Here is the cloud of points for reference: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O0nL3.jpg)
