I have the following system of equations:               x = -(1/3) + 4/3 Cos[1/3 π (-t1 - 2 t2)] Cos[1/3 π (-t1 + t2)] Cos [1/3 π (2 t1 + t2)]     y = 4/3 Sin[1/3 π (-t1 - 2 t2)] Sin[1/3 π (-t1 + t2)] Sin[1/3 π (2 t1 + t2)]      and I know that t1,t2 >= 0 and t1+t2<=1. I wanted to ask _Mathematica_ to give me `t1` and `t2` in terms of `x`, `y` \- sort of inverse map the above function. so I did this:               Clear[Evaluate[Context[] <> "*"]];     Assuming[t1 >= 0 && t2 >= 0 &&        t1 + t2 <=         1, {Solve[-(1/3) +            4/3 Cos[1/3 π (-t1 - 2 t2)] Cos[1/3 π (-t1 + t2)] Cos[             1/3 π (2 t1 + t2)] == x &&          4/3 Sin[1/3 π (-t1 - 2 t2)] Sin[1/3 π (-t1 + t2)] Sin[            1/3 π (2 t1 + t2)] == y, {t1, t2}]}]      But it takes too long to solve, and keeps running.. I left it for half an hour and closed the kernel. Is something wrong?
