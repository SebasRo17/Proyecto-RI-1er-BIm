I am looking for existing _Mathematica_ code to compute the unique sphere inscribed inside an irregular tetrahedron. I can write it myself, but I would love to find that someone already performed this calculation and can share their code. I want to take as input four points (a,b,c,d) in 3D and return the center, radius, and four tangency points of the insphere. If no one has already done this, then I will go ahead and write it myself. Responding to the request for an example:               a = {0, 0, 0};     b = {1, 0, 0};     c = {2, 1, 0};     d = {1, 3/2, 1};         ![Tetrahedron](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QOf5N.jpg) * * * **Updated**. ( _11Oct13_ ) The Wikipedia pages to which `ybeltukov` pointed _are_ correct. Here the inradius is all of $0.127$:   ![Tetra InSphere](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D0qNi.jpg)   I have the insphere center and radius, but not yet the four tangency points.... * * * And here are the four points of tangency:   ![InSphere Tangencies](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nurg2.jpg)
