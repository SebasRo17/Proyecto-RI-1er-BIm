As far as my understanding goes, compilers are meant for developers compiling their code into executable (machine-code) files. Compilers don't extend to a client's machine or end-user system. Instead, developers just use the compiler to convert their code into machine code, which is then transported to the other machines for use as applications. Do compilers have a function outside of this process? If so, when are they used?
