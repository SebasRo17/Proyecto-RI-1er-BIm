I just found myself writing the following comment in some (archaic Visual Basic 6.0) code I was writing:               If WindowState <> 1 Then         'The form's not minimized, so we can resize it safely         '...     End if      I'm not sure why I subconsciously use "we" in my comments. I suspect it's because I imagine someone stepping through the code, as if they were actually "doing" all of the commands on each line, rather than just watching them happen. With this mindset, I could have used `I can resize it`, since I'm the one "doing" it currently, or `you can resize it`, as if I were speaking to whomever is "doing" it in the future, but since both of those of these cases will most likely happen, I use "we" as if I'm leading someone else through my code. I can simply rewrite it as `it can be resized` and avoid the issue, but it's sparked my curiosity: is it common to use first person like this in comments, or is it considered distracting and/or unprofessional?
