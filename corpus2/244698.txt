1. In REST, do we **always** use _link relation values_ to convey semantics/role of a _linked resource_?   2. I assume _link relation value_ is always specified using `rel` attribute?    3. Should `rel` attribute only be specified within a **hypermedia control**?   4. I assume for _an element_ to be considered a **hypermedia control** it must provide a linking functionality and must also contain a `rel` attribute?
