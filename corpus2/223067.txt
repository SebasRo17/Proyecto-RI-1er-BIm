I have written software and have granted usage rights to different companies per contract. Is it possible to change the software licence to an open source licence afterwards? At what circumstances is this impossible and how will this affect the current contracts? Like one of the companies is allowed to modify and resale the software. If I change to GPL are they forced to change to GPL, too?
