I am using ownCloud - which is AGPL license - and only create few custom modules, and a theme, the core is not touched at all so:   1. should I allow download source for the whole app ( owncloud and my modules/theme ) ? ( as it is agpl based )   2. or should I only provide link to download owncloud code ( the original code ) ?   3. Or don't have to allow download at all ( optional )? Considering that, I am building a commercial app, where users will pay for the service? Please advice,
