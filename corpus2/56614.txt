Background: During a conference an analyst pointed out in a tweet that developers hate scrum. Myself and another person responded that this was not the case, and started discussing different scenarios on why developers would dislike scrum. One of the scenarios where that lazy developers are not able to hide in a scrum project. They are constantly challenged by the team to contribute. This discussion resulted in a blog post and video http://elsewhat.com/2010/05/20/lazy-developers-hate-agile-and%C2%A0scrum/ I've gotten three comments which I've tried to answer in a neutral way, but they comments do point out that there are some people who loathe scrum (and I am always 100% certain they are not lazy developers). **Question** **Have there ever been a survey among developers on to what degree developers like or hate scrum ?**
