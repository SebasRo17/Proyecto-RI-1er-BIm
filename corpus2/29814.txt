I have this task with two questions I would like to compute in Mathematica. > Suppose a pair of random variables $(X, Y)$ has a equal distribution on the > following 7 points: > > $\begin{matrix} & x & y\\\ 1 & -1 & 0\\\ 2 & 0 & 0\\\ 3 & 1 & 0\\\ 4 & -2& > 1\\\ 5 & 2 & 1\\\ 6 & -1 & 3\\\ 7 & 1 & 3 \end{matrix}$ > > The simultaneously probability function $p(x, y)$ is then given by: $p (1,0) > = \ldots = P (1, 3) = 1/7 \text{ and } p(x, y) = 0$ for all other points > > **1)** Find the conditional mean $E (Y\; |\; X = x)$ and the conditional > variance $V (Y\; | \;X = x)$ for $x = -2, -1,0,1,2.$ > > **2)** Compute the variance on Y and the variance on the conditional mean of > Y given X This additional information might help you:               E(X)=0     E(Y)=8/7      I have tried over and over but without any luck. Ps. I use Mathematica 8.
