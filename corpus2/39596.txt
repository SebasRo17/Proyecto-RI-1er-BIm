This is a strange problem and everything I tried did not work. I have a very large single Manipulate cell (it is a demonstration stylesheet notebook, hence this cell have to be one), and I simply wanted to copy the content of this cell and paste it into another text file. It seems that, for some reason, Mathematica has a limit somewhere, since I am sure the windows 7 clipboard can handle this size itself. When I select the cell, and then do CTRL-c, and paste into a plain text file in my editor, the output that shows up is only about 850 lines (this is much less than the original cell, which is I think few thousands lines long). I tried two different editors with the same result. It always gets cut off at the same place. The copy has to be done as `input text` and not as `plain text`. The copy as `plain text` is able to copy the whole cell, but the formatting is all messed up and not possible to read. I need to copy it as `input text`, which what happens when selecting the cell and doing CTRL-C, then CTRL-V (on windows) I can save the whole notebook as .txt file, but again, the formatting is all lost, and it seems to save it using the `plain text` mode. I can offocurse break the cell into many smaller cells, and then copy one by one with the mouse, but this is very tedious way to do it and I think there should be a way to handle this directly. Here is the notebook and I hope someone can find a way. I have many such notebooks with large cells to do. I am using version 9.01 on windows 7 64 bit.
