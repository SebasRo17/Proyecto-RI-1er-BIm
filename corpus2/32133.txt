I have an equation:                eq = 1 + ( 9 / ( s*(s + 9) ) )*( k/(s + b) ) == 0;      where `s == -2 + 2I` (`I` is the imaginary unit). I know it can be solved by separating into real and imaginary parts, substituting the value of `s` and then equating both equations to zero and solving the simultaneous equations to find the values of `b` and `k`. But how do I make _Mathematica_ do this for me cause it takes very long on paper. For those that have a similar problem, this worked for me:               FindInstance [{ComplexExpand[Re[eq]] == 0,  ComplexExpand[Im[eq]] == 0}, {k, b}, Reals]          {{k -> 9.04063, b -> 5.54344}}
