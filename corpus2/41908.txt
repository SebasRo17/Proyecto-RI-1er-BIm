I want to find the following saddle point of the function of 10 variables: ![saddle_point](http://www.zaslike.com/files/2bc0lawbriuzydi6re38.png). I am not able to find the stationary points by setting the first derivatives to 0, so I need do optimize the function numerically. I think that that performing the above-mentioned optimization is equivalent to finding a set of {a1,a2,a3,a4,a5} that would maximize the following function:               InnerMin[a1,a2,3,a4,a5]:=NMinimize[f[a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,b1,b2,b3,b4,b5],{b1,b2,b3,b4,b5}]      That is how I would do the inner minimization, so I get the value of that function for the values of a1,a2,a3,a4 and a5 I provide as an input. Does anybody know how to find in practice a set of a1, a2, a3, a4 and a5 that would maximize the InnerMin function, or in the other words how to perform the outer optimization numerically (coupled with the inner minimization via the InnerMin function)?
