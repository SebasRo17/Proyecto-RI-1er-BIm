_a. Get the list whose elements are of the form {language,number of words in dictionary)_ I tried this, and it gave me the number if words in dictionary, but I don't know how to get the language part:               lang = DictionaryLookup[All];          langlength =Table[{lang[[i]], Length[DictionaryLookup[{lang[[i]], All}]]}, {i, 1,     Length[lang]}]      _b. Now sort this list in descending order by the number of words and get a list of the form_ `{position in sorted list, language, number of words}`. For part b, I have               sorted = Sort[langlength, #1[[2]] >= #2[[2]] &]     placeList[list_] := Table[{i, list[[i]]}, {i, 1, Length[list]}]      pl = placeList[sorted]      And I got > {1, {"Finnish", 728498}, 2, {"Catalan", 602208}, 3, {"Galician", 515385}, 4, > {"Portuguese", 459996}, 5, {"Hebrew", 455264}, 6, {"Danish", 376469}, 7, > {"BrazilianPortuguese", 264713}, 8, {"Croatian", 260752}, 9, {"Polish", > 234907}, 10, {"Hungarian", 230206}, 11, {"Dutch", 229368}, 12, {"French", > 139657}, 13, {"Swedish", 121430}, 14, {"Italian", 116854}, 15, {"Faroese", > 108508}, 16, {"English", 92518}, 17, {"BritishEnglish", 86135}, 18, > {"Spanish", 86016}, 19, {"German", 76155}, 20, {"IrishGaelic", 65203}, 21, > {"Arabic", 43768}, 22, {"Breton", 32733}, 23, {"Russian", 31801}, 24, > {"Hindi", 15983}, 25, {"ScottishGaelic", 15670}, 26, {"Esperanto", 14780}, > 27, {"Latin", 8777}}` From here I don't know how to get rid of the braces around `Finnish, 728498` and others.
