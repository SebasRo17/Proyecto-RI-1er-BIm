I am looking for a language that   1. has First class functions   2. is dynamic   3. has prototypical inheritance   4. does not have too many features (i.e is easy to get into and write first program). I have been programming in JavaScript for quite some time and have gotten quite fond of it. Are there any other languages that have similar design? Edit (just some clarification) I know a bit of c#.After doing some programming in node js I really started to appreciate javascript and ease of its use.However outside of web development javascript falls short.Sure there are libraries like app.js that allows desktop programming but that's about it.Which is why I was looking for a more general purpose sripting language that has the above mentioned features.I listed those features to make the question more in tune with stack exchange policies other wise it would probably have been closed.
