I'm thinking of developing a pluggable test and assessment module. This tool will be used especially for desktop application projects to report and log errors, bugs, missing features and suggestions from testers. The tool will be plugged to the application by putting a small icon to the application itself. When pressed the tool will be visible where user can create entries about the application. Is there already a tool like that? I am not speaking about UI testing btw. For example, this tool might have a form consisting of   * Page name   * Environment information   * Entry type (can be bug, feature request, suggestion)   * Message   * User Info (name, contact etc)   * Date I think such a tool can greatly help testers prepare reports. Developers can understand the issue better and track all the reports.
