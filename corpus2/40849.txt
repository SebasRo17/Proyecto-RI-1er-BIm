I would like to make a plot where the points of ListPointPlot3D are themselves a Graphics3D object created using SphericalPlot3D, and each one depends on the position of the point. So basically, you have a list of points, {x, y, z}, and at each point there is a graphic which is determined by a function f(xi, yi, zi). I have been searching for about a day now to try and find a solution to this with no luck. Any help is greatly appreciated. Also, I don't have to use ListPointPlot3D, and if there is a better method I would certainly welcome it.
