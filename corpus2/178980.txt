When reading Scrum Guide, as the official text for scrum, I find out there is no specific solution to provide software testing in scrum. (the only hint is on page15) I'm a little vague on whether scrum is considered a software development methodology or not? If it is not, then how come some of its practices opposes _Extreme Programming_? (I know that in scrum guide, the author notes that scrum is a framework not a methodology, but still I'm not pretty clear on that) And what's more, I'm not sure if there are any other important textbook that I'm missing so far about scrum. I need them to be official or of great deal of public acceptance.
