Currently i'm working on a Purchased Order System Application Project for a small scale company. The Software that i am working on is personalized based on the on their business requirement. **The company told me to create proposal include the price how much is the application is so they can process the check for me.** The person who give me this project is the company supervisor and also a former supply chain supervisor in my employer before which i work also in some of their applications back then.So i want to be fair. This is my first time to create an application as a sideline so i really never experienced pricing a software even though i am working as full time web developer in a big company. Any tips and help ?
