I am talking about normal PC applications, memory should be sufficient. They declare global or member variables. In each function/method, they use the same global/member variables. At the beginning of each method, the variables are re-initialized so the old value is never used. Why do they keep the variables but no chance to reuse the old value?               class A     {         List<Car> carList;         public List<Car> M()         {             // always re-init variable             this.carList = new List<Car>();             // ...             // fetch from DB             return this.carList;         }              public List<Car> N(string id)         {             // always re-init variable             this.carList = new List<Car>();             // ...             // fetch from DB             return this.carList;         }     }
