If I were able to "Save" the computed inverse function somewhere and then plot it, the manipulation would become faster. As I understand, Evaluate should do the job, but for some reason it does not. Why?               f[x_] := Sqrt[x]; c[x_] := x^2; g[x_] := c'[x]/f'[x];     x[gamma_, δ_, φ_, ρ_, mode_] :=        InverseFunction[g][gamma/(1 - δ*φ*ρ)*mode];          Manipulate[       Plot[         {Evaluate@x[gamma, δ, φ, ρ, 1],           Evaluate@x[gamma, δ, φ, ρ, 2]},         {gamma, 0, 10},          PlotRange -> {{0, 10}, {0, 10}}],           {δ, 0, 1}, {φ, 0, 1}, {ρ, 0, 1}     ]
