I am a noob to sentiment analysis and found a good resource for Bayesian Opinion Mining and a way to make it self improving. I was wondering though, if the optimum analysis is dependent upon the supplied data set and since self improvement would mean adding known patterns to the data set (my understanding), wouldn't the application become too overloaded with huge data set over due course of time with more and more patterns getting added to the data set every day ? What should be the proper approach to make the application scalable (if I am using the right term at the right place) ?
