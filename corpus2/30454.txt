I want to make export of a plot inside Manipulate, but only once. However, this code runs infinitely and does export infinitely:               Manipulate[Module[{pl},       pl = Plot[Sin[a x + b], {x, 0, 6}];       Export["pl.pdf", pl];       pl]      , {a, 1, 4}, {b, 0, 10}]      If I remove Export[] from Manipulate, problem disappears, but I need it inside Manipulate for other reason;) Can we control number of evaluations of certain code inside Manipulate?
