I am plotting several functions, some of which have fillings. After I combine all the functions together on a plot and export the plot to an EPS file, the fillings obstruct other lines. Exported PDF files are fine. Minimal Working Example:               Show[       Plot[.5, {x, -1, 2}, PlotStyle -> {Thick, Dashed}],       Plot[Sinh[x], {x, -1, 2}, Filling -> Axis]]      (I know I can write the two functions into a single `Plot` command, but I have to use `Show` to combine several separate plots in the real problem.) Link to the exported EPS file I can avoid the obstruction by saving the graphic as a bitmap, but the overall quality seems to be degraded.
