I have a rasterized image that contains two colors: white and black. The black portion is entirely connected and looks like a big blob. Is there a good way to estimate the length of the boundary between the regions? One method I have considered is to simply count how many "edges" of the rasterized grid have a different color on each side. However, for e.g. a purely diagonal line, this will overestimate the distance of the boundary by a factor of sqrt(2). Is there a better method for estimating the boundary length which does not have this problem?
