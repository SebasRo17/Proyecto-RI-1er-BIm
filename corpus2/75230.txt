I've been a tinkerer of tech and programming, but books and online resources only go so far. I want a community to engage in discussions about programming to take me beyond what books can give (also, often just to explain what the books are trying to convey). No one in my daily life is very tech-inclined in the slightest, so where do I go? Are online communities enough for you programmers out there? If not, where do you go, or recommend going? (specifically, I'm interested in C++, Linux, Python, & Objective-C, but that may not apply to the question)
