I am looking for a nice way of flattening (splitting) a list of potentially- overlapping numeric ranges. The problem is very similar to that of this question: Fastest way to split overlapping date ranges, and many others. However, the ranges are not only integers, and I am looking for a decent algorithm that can be easily implemented in Javascript or Python, etc. **Example Data:** ![Example data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NRAkh.png) **Example Solution:** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HP8Ri.png) Apologies if this is a duplicate, but I am yet to find a solution.
