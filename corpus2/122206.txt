There are more than a few questions that hop into mind when someone thinks about Google's indexing services. Jeff Atwood wrote about them at The Elephant in the Room: Google Monoculture and Trouble In the House of Google. I have two questions:   * How does google index dynamic websites? This site has dynamic pages, `QUESTIONS`, `TAGS`, `USERS`, `BADGES`, `UNANSWERED`, `ASK QUESTION`. The content of these pages is dynamically generated, therefore we access the dynamic content and not the physical files on the server. But how does Google shows every question of the site or other dynamic websites?   * What does Google index and keep on its servers? Does it copy the complete page into its server or just the title, meta tags and body?
