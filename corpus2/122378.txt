I was reading Ben Cherry's "JavaScript Module Pattern: In-Depth", and he had some example code that I didn't quite understand. Under the _Cross-File Private State_ heading, there is some example code that has the following:               var _private = my._private = my._private || {}      This doesn't seem to be different from writing something like this:               var _private = my._private || {}      What's happening here and how are these two declarations different?
