I want to implement the MATLAB imshow function in _Mathematica_. This is a `DensityPlot[]` from _Mathematica_ > ![This pic was Densityplot by > Mathematica](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Gakp.jpg) And this is `imshow()` image generated by _MATLAB_ > ![This pic was print by imshow\(\) from > Matlab](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v2RO2.jpg) As you can see there's a difference between the two plots. I want to obtain smooth transition in _Mathematica_ as I can in _MATLAB_.
