Let's have a scenario like this: There is a medium-size project and you are assigned to it to add new features. The project does not have unit tests or dedicated QA person. You are the one who has to add new features and take care of fixing regression (link) bugs. When a regression bug happens, are you a responsible person (in term of finances) or a client? Or to ask another way, when you are paid to add new features in part-time job and a regression bug occurs, should you fix it for free or you should be paid since the project does not have unit tests or a dedicated QA worker?
