What is a better approach when it comes to performance and optimal resource utilization: accessing a database multiple times through AJAX to only get the exact information needed when it is needed, or performing one access to retrieve an object that holds all information that **might** be needed, with a high probability that not all is **actually** needed? I know how to benchmark the actual queries, but I don't know how to test what is best when it comes to database performance when thousands of users are accessing the database simultaneously and how connection pooling comes into play.
