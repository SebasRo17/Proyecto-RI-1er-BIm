When I execute `Foobar[]` in the code below and move a slider, the variable `grad` is printed twice. Why is this? How can I make the `Manipulate` body only execute once on each update?               Foobar[] := Module[{f, vars, grad},        f = a x^3 - b x^2 + c y^2;        vars = {a, b, c};        With[{fman = f, controls = Apply[Sequence, {{#, 0}, -5, 5} & /@ vars]},         Manipulate[          g = fman/(x^2 + y^2 + 1);          grad = D[g, {{x, y}}];          Print[grad];          , controls]         ]        ];      **Edit:** As noticed below, this function is creating a `Manipulate`. My concern is why the `Manipulate` appears to be executing twice for every one update. This is a minimal working example and hence there is significant amount of code (that takes a while to run) excluded from inside the `Manipulate` body. I included `Print` to emphasize that the code appears to be executing twice.
