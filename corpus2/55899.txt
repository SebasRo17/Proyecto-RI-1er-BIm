Now I have a list stored in `data` as follows               data = {{"Ca", 1, 1, 1}, {"Ca", 2, 2, 2}, {"Ca", 3, 3, 3}}      the `TableForm` of `data` is of course as follows:               Ca  1   1   1     Ca  2   2   2     Ca  3   3   3      But how to write this `TableForm` of `data` into a file? I tried code like               OutputForm[TableForm[data]]>>"test"      But the result is               Ca   1   1   1          Ca   2   2   2          Ca   3   3   3      **Why there are blank lines????** How to prevent the emergence of these blank lines when write TableForm expression into a file?
