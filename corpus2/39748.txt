Why am I unable to see the `FullForm` of `^^` (the shorthand notation for `BaseForm`)?               FullForm[HoldComplete[16 ^^ 2]]     (* HoldComplete[2] *)          FullForm[ToExpression["HoldComplete[16 ^^ 2]"]]     (* HoldComplete[2] *)          Trace[HoldComplete[16 ^^ 2],TraceInternal->True]     (* {} *)      My only clue is from the Possible Issues section on `HoldComplete`: > HoldComplete affects only evaluation; input transformations are still > applied: Is there a way to see the `FullForm`?
