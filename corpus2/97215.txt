We're a team developing a hosted CMS (something like WordPress.com, but in .NET platform), and we want every site to get updates as we update our software. Our CMS is not **multi-tenant** , i.e. each site is an entire copy of a site template and has an individual database, files and folders, and would be **deployed across many servers** (2000 sites per server). Now our problem is that we can't figure out how to update all these sites in a centralized way, without users firing the update process (because this is a hosted solution, not on-premise). For example, imagine that we want to add a module to these sites and imagine that we have over 10,000 sites over 5 servers. It's **really really really** horrible to install this new module on 10,000 sites. Or imagine that we want to add a new template. Again it's not practical to copy template files to 10,000 sites. Is there any known pattern for such a **distributed hosted solution update/upgrade**?
