I am trying to Write String to file, something like this:               Write["test.txt", "This is a test"];      when I opened the file I found that the string was written with the Quotation mark " like this: "This is a test" how can I write only the string text? **Note:** "This is a test" is part of matrix and I can't manually type it like this:               Write["test.txt", This is a test];
