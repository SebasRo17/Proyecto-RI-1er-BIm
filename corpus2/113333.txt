I have almost 2 years commercial experience in web development. Yet every time I apply for a job I get a call back "Sorry you don't have enough commercial experience for this position." The last 6 months have run like this:               10 Try to gain commercial experience.     20 Can’t get a job because I don’t have enough commercial experience.     GOTO 10      I've been applying for PHP developer roles working with existing codebases and requiring between 1 and 2 years of experience. How can I gain creditable 'commercial experience' when no-one will hire?
