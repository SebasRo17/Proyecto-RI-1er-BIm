I have to make a presentation about Haskell, and I'm looking for interesting Haskell examples, tips, and topics in general I should not miss in my presentation. The purpose of the presentation is to give a general idea about the language. I'm still writing what I'll say, but the following topics are already included:   * Lazy evaluation   * Ways of defining functions (pattern matching, lambda expressions, etc)   * Higher order functions and currying What do you think that **must** be explained when doing a talk about Haskell?
