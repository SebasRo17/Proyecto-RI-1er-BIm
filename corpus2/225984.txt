I have a discount service that gets called if certain conditions are met. I need to write test cases to check if the discount service is called. My doubt is checking if the discount service is NOT called for type 4 and 5 is a valid test case scenario.               public void ApplyDiscount(int typeId, double amount)     {          if(typeId == 1)     {       //call discount service     }          else if(typeId == 2)     {       //call discount service     }          else if(typeId == 4)     {        //do other stuff     }     else if(typeId == 5)     {        //do some other stuff     }          }
