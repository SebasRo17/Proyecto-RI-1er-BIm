This question is somewhat related to this one. Let's say this is the `BarChart` i want to make:               BarChart[Range[5], ChartStyle -> "Rainbow", BarOrigin -> Left,      ChartLegends -> Map[ToString, Range[5]]]      ![BarChart reflected](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dQQw3.jpg) The `BarChart` runs from the bottom and the legend starts at the top. The related question (linked above) gives a solution to reverse the legend, but i'd rather have the axis (and thus the purple bar) on top. It should look like this (made with `ImageReflect[]`): ![BarChart reflected](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KU79U.jpg) I tried `AxesOrigin`, but that doesn't work. My question seems pretty trivial, but i havenÂ´t found a solution for it yet. **Question: is there a way to specify the origin of a`BarChart`?**
