I currently use Word for notes, making nested bulleted lists as I go. I've just started using Mathematica and would like to do the same in its Notebooks, but it doesn't look like it has that capability. There isn't any automatic indenting of the entire line (so when it wraps, it doesn't start at the indent of the bullet point, but it starts at the beginning of the page). Is an option that turns it on or a module that allows for it?
