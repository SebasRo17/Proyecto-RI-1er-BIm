I am trying to find a piece of hardware that will signal a program to start a timer when it is moving and stop when it stops. The hardware can just be a ball that moves and is connected to the computer through USB, I was thinking of something similar to the way a mouse would work. For the programing I would like to use c# or possibly ActionScript with adobe air. I am a web developer and have not had any experience with hardware or drivers and would appreciate any ideas on where to start. Maybe there is some piece of simple hardware out there that I can use to send signals to the computer or some literature of articles for beginners that you can point me to. Thanks in advance
