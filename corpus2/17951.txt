I would like to save current `Manipulate` parameter values to load them again later. Bookmarks (previously discussed here and here) work fine until the cell is reinitialized. Is it there a way to save a bookmark permanently and restore it at the next _Mathematica_ session? If not, how could I export a bookmark to a file and import it back? Since the code is huge (more than 80 controls of different types) and constantly evolving, I would like to have it automatized, preferably by a button within the same `Manipulate`. Many thanks in advance for any useful hints! Here is a small toy model to play with:               Manipulate[          Plot[Fun[2 Pi freq x], {x, 0, 2},              Axes -> showAxes,               PlotLabel -> If[showPlotLabel, plotLabel, ""]           ],         {Fun, {Sin, Cos}},         {freq, 1, 3},         Row[{            Control[{showAxes, {True, False}}],            Control[{showPlotLabel, {True, False}}]            }, "\t"],          {plotLabel, "Plot Label", Enabled -> showPlotLabel}          ]
