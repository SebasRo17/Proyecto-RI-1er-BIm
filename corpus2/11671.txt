Given the exasperating RAM needs of my Mathematica program, I contemplated launching remote kernels to run my Mathematica script. This is a two part question: ## Part 1 If I launch a remote kernel(s), is the need for RAM also distributed amongst all the remote computers? ## Part 2 I keep getting an error message when I try to launch a remote kernel from the Mathematica GUI. > The kernel c20-0707-23 failed to connect to the front end. (Error = > MLECONNECT). You should try running the kernel connection outside the front > end. I have located the Kernel Program correctly on the remote computer. When I try starting a kernel over ssh in a terminal window with:               ssh username@remote.computer /path/to/math      Or               ssh username@remote.computer /path/to/MathKernel      After I enter the password to log in to the remote computer, I see that a kernel has been launched. However, the same doesn't occur with the front end. Are there any easy to understand **tutorials/examples** on launching remote kernels, without needing the GUI as I'd like to run scripts? I tried reading, this, for instance and the only thing that it did was make me panic as it was greek. I also read this but it's not an entirely similar problem Here's a sample script that I used to launch local kernels and execute a simple `NDSolve` command:               #!/usr/local/bin/MathematicaScript -script          CloseKernels[]     LaunchKernels[3]     Print["AbsoluteTiming reveals:" NDSolve[{y'[x] == y[x] Cos[x + y[x]],          y[0] == 1}, y, {x, 0, 30}]; // AbsoluteTiming ]     CloseKernels[]      This question may help answer the other question I linked in the first line.
