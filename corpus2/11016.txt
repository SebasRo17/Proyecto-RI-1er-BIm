Assuming x, a, and b are complex numbers, is there a way to reduce the equation `Abs[x - a] == k Abs[x - b]` to something like `Abs[x - ...] = ...`? Or if it can't be done by complex number, can it be solved by specified the coordinate explicitely? I've try something like this:               d[x_, y_, xx_, yy_] := (x - xx)^2  + (y - yy)^2     d[x, y, x1, y1] - k d[x, y, x2, y2] == 0 // Expand      and got:               x^2 - k x^2 - 2 x x1 + x1^2 + 2 k x x2 - k x2^2 + y^2 - k y^2 - 2 y y1 + y1^2 + 2 k y y2 - k y2^2 == 0      but how can I transform the above equation to some form like `(x-...)^2 + (y-...)^2 = ...` by mathematica?
