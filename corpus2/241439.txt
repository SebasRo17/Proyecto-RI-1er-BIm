Scheme is said to be just an extension of the Untyped Lambda Calculus (correct me if I am wrong). If that is the case, how can it have Lists and Numbers? Those, to me, look like 2 base types. So I'd say Racket is actually an extension of the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus. No? ## Question:   * **Is Scheme's type system actually based or more similar to Simply Typed or Untyped Lambda Calculus?**   * **In what ways does it differ from Untyped and or Simply Typed Lambda Calculus?** (The same question is valid for "untyped" languages such as Python and JavaScript - all of which look like they have base types to me.)
