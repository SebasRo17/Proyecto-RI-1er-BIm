How can I get data from `For` loops to use in `ListStreamDensityPlot`? I tried `AppendTo`, but it didn't work. I probably did it wrong.               Clear[a, x, y, z, m, n, o, Bx, By, Bz]     a = 0.1 (*amplitude*)     z = 0  (*ploting on different heights*)     For[i = 1; x = m, i < 6, i++, x = 2 Pi/4*(i - 1);         For[j = 1; y = n, j < 7, j++, y = -3 + (j - 1);           {Bx = NIntegrate[a*z*Cos[t]/((t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(3/2) -              3 (y Sqrt[t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2]Sin[t]) a),              {t, -Infinity, Infinity}, AccuracyGoal -> 20,MaxRecursion -> 15];            By = NIntegrate[-z/((t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(3/2) -              3 (y Sqrt[t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2]Sin[t]) a),              {t, -Infinity, Infinity}, AccuracyGoal -> 20, MaxRecursion -> 15];            Bz = NIntegrate[(y + a*(t*Cos[t] - x*Cos[t] - Sin[t]))/             ((t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(3/2) -              3 (y Sqrt[t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2]Sin[t]) a),              {t, -Infinity, Infinity}, AccuracyGoal -> 20, MaxRecursion -> 15]};        ]      ]     ListStreamDensityPlot[{x, y}, {Bx, By, Bz}]      I only get > `[out]=ListStreamDensityPlot[{2 \[Pi], 2}, {0., 0., 1.00294}]` Thanks in advance. EDIT: With the help of Verbeia I can now make the plot. I would like to get something like this http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ixqI.png My wire is a different one than the above though. Mine is a sinusoid. Is ListVectorDensityPlot the right plot to get plots like the ones above?               a = 0.1     x = Pi/2          data = Table[With[{y = -1 + 0.1 (i - 1),         z = -1 + 0.1 (j - 1)}, {{NIntegrate[ a*z*Cos[t]/((t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 +          y^2 + z^2)^(3/2) - 3 (y Sqrt[t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2] Sin[t]) a),          {t, -Infinity, Infinity}, AccuracyGoal -> 20,  MaxRecursion -> 20],          NIntegrate[-z/((t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^(3/2) -           3 (y Sqrt[t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2] Sin[t]) a),           {t, -Infinity,Infinity}, AccuracyGoal -> 20, MaxRecursion -> 20]},          NIntegrate[(y +  a*(t*Cos[t] - x*Cos[t] - Sin[t]))/((t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 +             z^2)^(3/2) - 3 (y Sqrt[t^2 - 2 t x + x^2 + y^2 + z^2] Sin[t]) a),       {t, -Infinity, Infinity}, AccuracyGoal -> 20, MaxRecursion -> 20]}],       {i, 1, 21}, {j, 1, 21}]          ListVectorDensityPlot[data, DataRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}]      I get this graph. http://i.stack.imgur.com/YvqyD.jpg The field should be rotational. Is the problem that integrals don't converge? How can I improve the convergence of integrals then? I doubt upping max recursions to 80 would be smart because it would increase the process time a lot. It takes a couple of minutes anyway.
