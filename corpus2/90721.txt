I watched Douglas Crockford's JavaScript talks recently, and at one point, he said that Microsoft did not consider JavaScript important because they saw the web as a passing phase of internet usage that would be supplanted by something loosely known at the time as "Internet X", and they wanted .NET to become "Internet X" Of course, the web is still with us and we know .NET as an application development platform. Can anyone tell me about the early history of .NET and how to went from being an intended replacement for the web to the platform we know it as today?
