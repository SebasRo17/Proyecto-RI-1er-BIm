I am having difficulties exporting vector graphics. Using Kardashev3's code provided here:               images = Image[ListPlot[pdata = Table[Sin[2 \[Pi] x/12.34], {x, #}] +      RandomReal[.1, {#}]]] & /@ Table[i, {i, 100, 200, 10}];      and then exporting them as follows:               Export[NotebookDirectory[] <> "image" <> ToString[#] <> ".eps",      "AllowRasterization" -> False, Image[images[[#]]]] & /@ Range[Length[images]]     Manipulate[images[[n]], {n, 1, Length[images], 1}]      I get the error message:               <<Export::noelem: {...} is not a valid set of export elements for the EPS format.>>      The code works well for rasterized graphics, but appears to run into problems with vector graphics.
