I'm able to do what I need, but it seems like there's always a better way. I have two lists, epiExcel and epiDB. Each has 3 columns and about 2,500 rows. I need to find out if the first 2 columns of each match, and when they don't where the mismatches are. I did the following:               z = Position[epiDB[[All, {1, 2}]], #] & /@ epiExcel[[All, {1, 2}]];     Position[z, {}]     z = Position[epiExcel[[All, {1, 2}]], #] & /@ epiDB[[All, {1, 2}]];     Position[z, {}]      This worked for the specific case I have at the moment. Is there a better way to do this?
