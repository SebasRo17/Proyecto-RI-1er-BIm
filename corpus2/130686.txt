Are there any known design patterns for implementing discount models? By discount models, I mean the following:   1. If a customer buys Product X, Product Y and Product Z he gets a discount of 10% or $100.    2. If a customer buys 100 units of Product X, he gets a discount of 15% or $500   3. If a customer has brought in the last year more than $100K, he gets a flat 20% discount   4. If a customer has purchased 2 units of Product X, he gets 1 unit of Product X (or Product Y) free.    5. ... Is there a generic pattern that can be applied to handle all of the above scenarios? I am thinking of a few models, but unable to come across a generic one.
