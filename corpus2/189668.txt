From what I've read, LGPL 3.0 allows you to use the license together with other licenses, more permissive about that(Not even sure about that).   From https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility it says that it is not compatible with GPLv2, while LGPL 2.1 is compatible with it. That's a bit contrary to the thing I've read... So, do you know what the real advantages and disadvantages of LGPL 3.0 over LGPL 2.1 are?   One disadvantage would be that it is not compatible with GPLv2.
