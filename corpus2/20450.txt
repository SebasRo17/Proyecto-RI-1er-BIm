My employer recently read the twelve steps to better code and wants me to write a protocol for how we should handle bugs and new features. We are a small company with just three programmers and we use OnTime from axosoft to administer our work. I am looking for a course in which best practices for bug tracking, work logging and project planning are taught. The only thing I have been able to find is axosoft's own six hour introductory course. Will that have enough depth? Please give recommendations!
