I was exploring the problem presented by another question, when I ran into some behavior of _Mathematica_ 's arbitrary precision arithmetic engine that perplexes me. Here is what I was doing               poly = 64 x^7 - 112 x^5 - 8 x^4 + 56 x^3 + 8 x^2 - 7 x - 1;     solns = Solve[poly == 0, x, Reals]      > {{x -> -(1/2)}, {x -> 1},   >  {x -> Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 1]},   >  {x -> Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 2]},   >  {x -> Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 3]},   >  {x -> Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 4]},   >  {x -> Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 5]}}               root[n_] := Cos[2 n Pi/11];     poly == 0 /. x -> root[1]      > True               N[Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 5] == root[1], 20]      > True               N[Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 5] - root[1], 20]      > N::meprec: Internal precision limit $MaxExtraPrecision = 50.` reached while > evaluating -Cos[(2 [Pi])/11]+Root[1+6 #1-12 #1^2-32 #1^3+16 #1^4+32 > #1^5&,5,0]. > > 0.*10^-70               PossibleZeroQ[Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 5] -  root[1]]      > PossibleZeroQ::ztest1: "Unable to decide whether numeric quantity > -Cos[(2\\[Pi])/11]+Root[1+6\ #1-12\ #1^2-32\ #1^3+16\ #1^4+32\ #1^5&,5,0] is > equal to zero. Assuming it is." > > True It would appear that Mathematica can compare the values of `Root[1+6 #1+..+32 #1^5&,5]` and `root[1]` more easily than it can determine their difference. I realize differences lose precision very rapidly, but I still find this perplexing. Finally I tried raising the value of `$MaxExtraPrecision`, but still no joy.               Block[{$MaxExtraPrecision = 10000},        N[Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 5] - root[1], 20]]        > N::meprec: "Internal precision limit $MaxExtraPrecision = 10000.` reached > while evaluating -Cos[(2\\[Pi])/11]+Root[1+6\ #1-12\ #1^2-32\ #1^3+16\ > #1^4+32\ #1^5&,5,0]" > > 0.*10^-10020 Larger values of `$MaxExtraPrecision` only made the computation take longer before it failed. Could there be something wrong with the algorithm used to compute a difference to high precision in the case where the two terms are essentially the identical? ### Edit From the first answer posted, I realize I should ask my question more carefully. I am not sure how _Mathematica_ estimates the precision of very small numbers, which can be a tricky business. Perhaps, that's my problem. For a difference that is expected to be zero or very close, should I be asking for evaluation in terms of accuracy rather than precision? I note that               N[Root[1 + 6 #1 - 12 #1^2 - 32 #1^3 + 16 #1^4 + 32 #1^5 &, 5] - root[1], {âˆž, 1000}]        returns `0.*10^-1001` with no error message. For this return value, I get               Accuracy[0.*10^-1001]      > 1000.               Precision[0.*10^-1001]      > 0. This is consistent with the behavior that bothers me, but why is the precision zero? WRI defines precision and accuracy as follows: > Precision[x]: the total number of significant decimal digits in x > > Accuracy[x]: the number of significant decimal digits to the right of the > decimal point in x In my mind, these definitions are not consistent with the accuracy and precision values shown above. The definitions imply that accuracy will always be less than precision.
