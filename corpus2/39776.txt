v = {{0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}}          For[i = 1, i < 6, i++,        For[e = 1, e < 6, e++ 1,          Print[Mod[v[[i]] + v[[e]], 2]]     ]]      I have been trying to make all the output from the loop to be added to another list using `AppendTo`, but it doesn't work. How can I do this task?
