If you are doing code reviews   * How much time do you spend on code reviews, compared to implementation?   * How much of the changes undergo code review?   * you think it's to much / should be more? Are there any studies about effectiveness? [edit] thank you all for the answers, it's hard to pick a "winner" for such a question, there is lots of valuable info in the other replies, too.
