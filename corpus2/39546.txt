I have a Python program which will run a script in the Wolfram language and then return to the main program. Is it possible to return values/variables to the main program? This is the code in Python running the Wolfram language code:               os.system('wolfram  -script file.wl')      Then in file.wl, for example, I can run a command such as 1+1, which will give me an output of 2. Can I then use this value 2 in the rest of my Python program?               e.g. print (ans)
