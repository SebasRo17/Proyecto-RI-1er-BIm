Is it possible to deploy a _Mathematica_ notebook which contains a dynamic `URLSave` function? My code has the following structure:               web = URLSave["http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/", Close[OpenTemporary[]]]     web = Import[web, {"GZIP", "Text"}]     Dynamic[web, UpdateInterval -> 20, TrackedSymbols -> {}, SynchronousUpdating -> False]      The problem is when I start to deploy it, in the last step after I indicate in which folder to save the CDF file, then this error appears: > Select::normal: Nonatomic expression expected at position 1 in > Select[C:\Users\Morry\Dropbox\MEPS\ALISalehi\HTML\146\Untitled.cdf,StringMatchQ[#1,*.png]&].
