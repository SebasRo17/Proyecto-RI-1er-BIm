I'm really new to _Mathematica_ , trying to learn some things, but I need help trying to plot this kind of cylinder, a U tube like cylinder. Tried to use an example code like this, and then vary some parameters, but still unclear on how to do that. Any help is apreciated. ![](http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/280x200q90/905/I9itfx.png)               Graphics3D[{Yellow,        Cylinder[{{v1 t, 0, h1}, {v1 t + Δx1, 0, h1}}, Sqrt[A1/π]],        Cylinder[{{8 + A1/A2 v1 t, 2, h2}, {8. + A1/A2 v1 t + A1/A2 Δx1, 0, h2}}, Sqrt[A2/π]]       Also I have used this               Tube[{{4, 10, h1}, {4, 3, h1}, {3, 0, h2}, {10, 1, h2}},       {Sqrt[A1/2 π], Sqrt[A1/2 π], Sqrt[A2/2 π], Sqrt[A2/2 π]}]}
