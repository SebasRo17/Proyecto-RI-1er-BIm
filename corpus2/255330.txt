I want to use the WebFont icon library FontAwesome (FA) for all the icons in my project. They are using SIL OFL 1.1 for the fonts and MIT License for the source files. My problem is that, I want to use the FA fonts in my project, however I don't want to be tied to their CSS files. Is it possible for me to use the fonts with my own custom CSS styles, without having any dependence on the FA's CSS files. I don't even mind endorsing the project on my website, but if even do that, I want to only endorse the art not the code. FontAwesome License: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/license/
