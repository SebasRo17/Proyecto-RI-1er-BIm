I have a set of pixilated shapes, and after transforming each shape into a morphological component, I want to be able to return the coordinates for pixels that lie on the contour of the shape. More specifically, I want pixels that have some number of background neighbors in their von Neumann or Moore neighborhoods. Say this "shape" is a phrase like the following: http://pixelduke.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/jnbdec2008-hello-world- example2.png We can isolate and color all of the morphological components / pixilated shapes we care about as follows:               shape = Import["http://pixelduke.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/jnbdec2008-hello-world-example2.png"]     m = MorphologicalComponents[ColorNegate[ImageCrop[shape, {300, 100}]]] // Colorize      How can we return a von Neumann or Moore-neighborhood connected set of contour pixels for each component?
