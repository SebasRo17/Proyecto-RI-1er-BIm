What are the various ways of acheiving this ? Can someone please guide me? I have to code a website for a friend (designer). The friend wants me to use core php and not any framework like codeigniter (something I really like and am comfortable with !) . I had a look at a couple of roll your own MVC frameworks guides, but am not sure if this is the ideal approach. Since any solution I might come up with may have various bugs/security issues. My goal is to use plain php , without the help of thirdparty frameworks, to code a site , where the logic is separate from the view . Thanks
