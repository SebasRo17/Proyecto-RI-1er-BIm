I love programming and I like to learn everything I read about the subject. However, I'm having a hard time explaining what I've learned to someone who does not know anything about programming or even to a fellow programmer. There is a quote by Albert Einstein that goes something like this:                If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself.       or                If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.      Does anyone else find themselves in the situation I'm in? This can also affect my job interviews; when someone asks me to explain some concepts that I know but can't put it well enough in words, they might think I'm not well prepared when in fact I am but I'm crippled by my inability to explain myself. How can I overcome this and be more articulate?
