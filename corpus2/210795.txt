I'm currently doing maintenance on an old order system that has grown into the poster child for bad coding practice. One of the tings I'm dealing with is a lot of data duplication, which I want to fix. The problem, is that one central table "users" exists in two different databases (A and B), in A ties into the ordering system, B ties into the logistics system. New users are added to both tables, and they contain identical information, except for that in B there are three aditional fields. My instinct is to remove this data duplication. Now, a lot of queries are made against A and B by their respective toolchains.   1. My first thought is to change the queries for A.users to B.users, and delete the A.users table. Though this seems bad there would be JOINS going from A to B whenever any order tools needs to check against the user table (which is a lot).    2. My second idea is to move the users table into a seperate database that contains only user specific data and move the fields pertinent to logistics into a seperate table on B. Any ideas on how to untangle this?
