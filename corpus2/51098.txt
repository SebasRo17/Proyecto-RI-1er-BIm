I am trying to solve a high degree univariate polynomial using Mathematica's NSolve command. But when I plug the solutions generated by Mathematica back to the equations, the equations are massive numbers and not even close to zero.               Clear["Global`*"];     r := Rationalize[RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, 1]]]     randompol[n_, i_] := Sum[r Sqrt[Binomial[n, j]] x^j, {j, 0, n}]          e= randompol[100,1];          SetSystemOptions["NSolveOptions" -> {"Tolerance" -> 10^(-10)}];     sol = Solve[e == 0, x];          e/.sol      which gives some of the entries as big as `-1.8513*10^56` I don't know what other method can be used to solve high degree polynomials. Any help would be much appreciated. Regards, -John
