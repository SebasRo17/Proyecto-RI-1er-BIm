E.g.   \- $stream1 is the STDOUT of a child process and $stream2 is the STDERR of the same child process   \- $stream1 is one child process and $stream2 is another child process Is there a possiblility in perl to monitor two or more streams at the same time? So we loop as long as anything pops-up in any of the streams and we take whatever comes first either in $stream1 or $stream2. Something like               while (my $line = <$stream1 or $stream2> ) {           #do something with the $line     }      ??
