I have a situation where a custom class is a property of another class. What i need to be able to do, if it is possible at all, is obtain a reverse to the "parent" class (ie the the class that holds the current class as a property). ### For Instance:               Public Class Class1       ...       public readonly property Prop11 as Class2       public property Prop12 as String       ...     End Class          Public Class Class2       ...       private _par as Class1       private _var21 as string       ...       Public Sub New(...)         me._par = ????         ...       End Sub       public readonly property Prop21 as string         Get           return me._par.Prop12 & me._var21         End Get       End Property       ...     End Class      Ultimately, i am trying to access other properties within `Class1` from `Class2` as they do have substance for information from within `Class2`. There are several other classes within `Class1` that provide descriptive information to other classes contained within it as properties but the information is not extensible to all of the classes through Inheritance, as `Class1` is being used as a resource bin for the property classes and the application itself. ### Diagram, lazy design ;):               Application <- Class1.Prop12     Application <- Class1.Prop11.Prop21      ### Question:   1. Is it possible to get a recursion through this design setup?
