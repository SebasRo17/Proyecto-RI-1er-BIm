I tried to substitue variable x of one equation with another variable `z` (`z=nx/(nx+m)`). See as follow:               Solve[z == n*x/(n*x + m), x]      > >     x -> -((m z)/(n (-1 + z))) >   Then:               PDF[FRatioDistribution[n, m], x] /. x -> -((m z)/(n (-1 + z)))      > >      (m^(m/2) n^(n/2) (-((m z)/(n (-1 + z))))^(-1 + n/2) (m - (m z)/(-1 + > z))^(1/2 >       (-m - n)))/Beta[n/2, m/2] >   How can I collect the term `z` and `1-z` together? Factually, if collecting the results by ``z and`1-z`, it can be very simple (that is Beta distribution). Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated.
