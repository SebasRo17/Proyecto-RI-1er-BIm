It's my first time using sql server, I usually go with MySQL, so I'm unsure how to do this. The project I'm assigned will be deployed to multiple platforms particularly PC's with different SQL server ranging from 2008 to 2014, some of them are express edition, some are standard edition and in Windows ranging from XP, 7, 8 and 8.1 for both x86 and 64 bit systems If I use entity framework 6 in my development PC, 64-bit windows 8.1 and SQL Server 2012 Express. Will this pose a problem during deployment?
