I am little bit confused about how to calculate `δβ/δρ` value if I have set of values like this. I have the values of β and ρ like this.               β          ρ          0,324     0,687     0,322     0,695     0,319     0,721     0,317     0,759     0,316     0,798      aka:               β={0.324, 0.322, 0.319, 0.317, 0.316};     ρ={0.687, 0.695, 0.721, 0.759, 0.798};      from the above set of values I would need to calculate `δβ/δρ`. Can anyone explain me how to do it with _Mathematica_?
