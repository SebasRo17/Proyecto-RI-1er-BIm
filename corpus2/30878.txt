I have Mathematica 8.0.4.0 installed on my new MacBook Pro running OS X 10.8. I also have the latest CUDA drivers (and even the CUDA SDK) from nVIDIA. I've noticed that commands like CUDAQ[] take a VERY long time to return 'True'. The CUDA resources paclet is already installed. Here's some examples:               In[1]:= Needs["CUDALink`"]          During evaluation of In[1]:= General::cdir: Cannot set current directory to authserver. >>          In[2]:= AbsoluteTiming[CUDAQ[]]          Out[2]= {112.003663, True}          In[3]:= AbsoluteTiming[CUDAResourcesInformation[]]          Out[3]= {7.734287, {{"Name" -> "CUDAResources"...      Has anyone else seen CUDAQ[] take 112 seconds to return? It's almost like Mathematica thinks the paclet isn't installed or something. Subsequent runs of CUDAQ[] in the same session return quickly. If I kill the kernel and launch a new one, it's back to 100+ seconds again. Other CUDA commands also take a very long time to initially run and then run quickly if run again in the same session. Restarting the kernel gets you back to the excessive times again. A related question: is there a log somewhere where I can see what the heck the kernel is doing when I type in that initial CUDAQ[]? Thanks!
