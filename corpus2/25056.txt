I'm interested in better learning functional programming. To do so, it seems obvious that I should force myself to use the purest possible functional programming language. Hence, I'm here asking, more or less, for an ordering of functional programming languages according to their purity. It seems to me that it would be more practical to learn Lisp or Clojure (or Scheme, or Scala, etc.), but for what I've heard recently, Haskell would be very hard to beat at teaching functional programming principles to someone. I'm not sure about this yet, so **I'm asking you:** which is the purest functional programming language? An ordering would be great if several are competing for the magnificent title of the purest functional programming language.
