Why is it that the IEEE 754 standard provide 8 bits for the exponent but puts a range maximum of 38 on the largest acceptable exponent? Seems kind of ridiculous to have the data storage there but not allow it to actually be used. I wanted to pack data into this exponent for some encoding I'm doing, but I can't use all the bits because I can't pack an exponent larger than 38! I was hoping to pack values up to 256 using all bits (2 ^ 8).
