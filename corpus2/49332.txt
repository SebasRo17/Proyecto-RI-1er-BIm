I've a list of lists,               tl = {{True, False, m12}, {False, m22, m33}, {m32, False, True}}      and each nested list has the same length, What is the proper way to replace the occurances of all `m*` values, i.e., `m12`, `m22`, etc., with a particular value say `x`. All I want is this result > >     tl = {{True, False, x}, {False, x, x}, {x, False, True}}` >   Any help will be appreciated.
