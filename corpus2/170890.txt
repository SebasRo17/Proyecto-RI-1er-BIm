I'm trying to convince my employer to let us use the Microsoft ASP/AJAX toolkit since it simplifies the implementation of many controls. However they have rejected the idea on the grounds that it produces "AJAX code" which is not ADA compliant. However the same employer requires webpages to be written in ASP.NET Web Forms which, as far as I can tell from the source, is very very far from ADA compliance. I am new to both web programming and ADA compliance. My questions are:   1. Do ASP.Net Web Forms actually produce ADA compliant HTML?   2. Will the ASP/AJAX toolkit undermine the goal of ADA compliance?
