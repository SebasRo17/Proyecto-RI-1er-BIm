I have recently learned about the MVC design pattern. I'm learning from the Head First Design Pattern book. According to this book (if I understand correctly): **The Model** is most of the application logic and data. **The View** is basically the GUI that represents the Model visually to the user. **The Controller** is responsible to 'mediate', and act as a 'middleman' between the View and the Model. The View reports to the Controller that the user made an action, and the Controller translates it to method calls on the Model. **However, a lot of places on the web contradict what I understand from that book. They claim that generally the user interacts with the Controller, not the View.** Which one is true or more common? Does the user interact with the Controller directly, or with the View directly? Are both approaches acceptable? Which is more common?
