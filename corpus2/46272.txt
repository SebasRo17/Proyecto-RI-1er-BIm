I'm working as a web developer and I want to be able to determine if I'm efficient. Does this include the how long it take to accomplish tasks such as:   * Server side code for the site logic with one language or multiple php,asp,asp.net.   * Client side code like javascript with jquery for ajax, menus and other interactivity   * Page layout, html, css (color, fonts (but I have no artistic sense!))   * The needs of the site and how it will work (planning) How can i judge how long it will take to complete a website? The site has CMS for adding and editing news, products, articles on the experience of the company. Also, they can edit team work, add Recreational Activities and a logo gallery with compressed psd download, and send messages to cpanel and to email. You are starting from scratch except JQuery and PHPmailer. How can I estimate how long the job will take, and how can I calculate the required time to finish any new projects? I'm so sorry for many scattered questions, but I'm in my first experiment and I want to take benefits from the great experience of those who have it.
