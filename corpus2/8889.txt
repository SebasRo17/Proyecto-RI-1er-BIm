I've barely succeeded in this, I'm just wondering how you convinced your boss to update and if you're faring better than me. Here's where I stand:   1. I'm using Delphi 7.   2. We've bought Delphi 2009 for each programmer.   3. I'm still using Delphi 7.   4. It's almost 2011 and Delphi 2010 and Delphi XE area already out. So I'm stuck in a timewarp, there are too many commitments to bother about creating bugs by updating our IDE. I have a bad feeling that when we do finally start using Delphi 2009 it'll be as obnoxious as Delphi 7. (This may be a bad generic example as there are special Unicode considerations in the 2009 update, but I'd like general answers - because I do more than just Delphi programming for my company)
