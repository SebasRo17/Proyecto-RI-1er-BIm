I would like to run the elf32-i386 library libkernlib.a with a Fortran 77 program on my latest Ubuntu linux machine. From what I've read, `gfortran` is backwards compatible with Fortran 77, but I'm having trouble to get it to work with the library. I've tried -ff2c, -fbackflash, etc. but everything is still giving me               $ gfortran -ff2c -O -o output f77fortran.f -lkernlib          /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible //usr/local/lib/libkernlib.a when searching for -lkernlib     /usr/bin/ld: canot find -lkernlib      I have also tried using `fort77`. I cannot find a `f77` that works. **If anyone knows how to run f77 programs and its libraries, whether using`gfortran` or something else, that would be great.** Btw, the libkernlib.a library has older versions from "libraries" links on this page, but the ones I've tried all give the same error and are all i386 (I figured out that by `objdump -f libkernlib.a`). Context: This is part of a Mathematica project that uses old code.
