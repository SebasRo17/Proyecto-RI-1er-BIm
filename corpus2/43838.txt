A colleague of mine wrote a post a while ago asking Do you own your tools. It raises an important question. Do you? I answered way down in the comments. As an independent, I do own my tools. Even when I wasn't independent, I had my own (fully licensed) tools that I used for personal development. I don't think buying your own tools are something to puff your chest up about (just because you can buy a $100 pair of basketball sneakers they won't make you as good as Michael Jordan), but it IS an investment in yourself that shouldn't be taken lightly. What do you think good people?
