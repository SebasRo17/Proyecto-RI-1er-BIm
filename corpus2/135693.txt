I'm building site with a very simple data structure: documents that are nodes that reference other nodes that each have arrays of parents, children and siblings, so the structure is:               Node:     uuid     name [string]     description [string]     children, parents, siblings [arrays of node uuids]      What is most important is making the following query fast and easy: `all nodes with uuid x in their children/parents/siblings array`. I'm considering using Riak or possibly Postgres with hstore, but would like other suggestions as to a good database designed to easily and quickly store and retrieve data with this structure. Persistence is important, scalability is a secondary concern right now.
