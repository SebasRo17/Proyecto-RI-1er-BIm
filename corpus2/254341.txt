I have a list of events which is always sorted chronologically. The start time is always followed by the end time. Times are strings formatted as 'HHmmss'.               // list of events          var events = [         '010000',  // start         '013000',  // end...         '053000',         '060000',         '161500',         '184500']          // desired output          var spares = [         '000000',  // start         '010000',  // end...         '013000',         '053000',         '060000',         '161500',         '184500',         '235959']      How can I programmatically create a new list of "spare time" from `000000` to `235959`? PS I'm trying to do this in Javascript, but any conceptual answer or pseudo code would be helpful too.
