Basically what the title says. I'm completely new to programming and decided C# to be the best language to start learning, so I went ahead and installed Visual Studio Express 2010 C# to get started. I started reading Learning C# 3.0: Master the fundamentals of C# 3.0 and got worried when I got to the part, which to quote said: > "Unless we specifically say otherwise, when we refer to C# in this book, we > mean C# 3.0; when we refer to .NET, we mean the .NET 3.5 Framework; and when > we refer to Visual Studio, we mean Visual Studio 2008." Does this mean that the book is out-dated and I should find something else? Does this mean I should just read the book anyway and continue in Visual Studio 2010? Does this mean I should uninstall 2010, and get VS 2008, and continue reading? I don't want to learn something that is outdated, and I'm aware of .NET 4.0 being available so I'm not sure if it would be a waste of time. I don't even know if there is a difference, does it just add more features and one could still use the same "basic" code in each? Sorry for being a clueless, I have never programmed before, I just need a kick-start in the right direction so I can start LEARNING just don't want to do so in the wrong way :)
