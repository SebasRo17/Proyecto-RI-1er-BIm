a := az + 1     b := bz + 5     list := {a, b}      I'd like mathematica to print               a = az + 1     b = bz + 5      so basically it needs to first print the name of the variable in the list, followed by "=", and followed by the actual content of the variable. **update (1):** so here is something close to what I want               a := az + 1     b := bz + 5     list := {Hold@a, Hold@b}     Column[Table[Print[list[[i]], "=", ReleaseHold@list[[i]]], {i, 1, 2}]]      outputs:               Hold[a]=1+az     Hold[b]=5+bz      However, I don't know how to get rid of `Hold[]`. I'm also hoping there is a more elegant way.
