In a situation where there are multiple teams making changes to some Maven projects with dependencies between them (otherwise unrelated projects i.e. no super POM or anything like that), with each team working in a separate working branch on all of these projects and merging them back to trunk only after a story is complete and tested, how should one handle the dependencies between snapshot builds that each team produces? Note that any of the teams could be making changes in any of the projects: they work on different pieces of functionality of the same system, and the projects are more like different layers. Before the split into multiple teams, artifacts were deployed to a central Nexus repository. Of course, it would be possible to set up separate Nexus repositories for each team, and an additional one for trunk, but I'm hoping there would be a better way to deal with this.
