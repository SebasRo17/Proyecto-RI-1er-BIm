I'm trying to determine the limit of the sequence of functions $$f_n(x)=\left(\frac{1}{\pi}\arctan(n x) + 1/2\right)^n. $$ I define               f[x_, n_] := (1/2 + ArcTan[n x]/Pi)^n      And enter               Limit[f[x, n], n -> Infinity]      This gives the answer 0. If I instead enter               Assuming[x > 0, Limit[f[x, n], n -> Infinity]]      I get the answer $$e^{-\frac{1}{x\pi}}. $$ While               Assuming[x < 0, Limit[f[x, n], n -> Infinity]]      gives the answer 0 again. Why does the normal Limit give the answer assuming that x<0? Is this a bug, or have I missed something? Thanks in advance.
