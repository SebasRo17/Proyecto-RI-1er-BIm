As a follow up to this question: Calculate mean and standard deviation from ImageHistogram I would like to add two histograms before calculating the mean and StDev. I would like to sum the numbers, not superimpose the graphics. Explanation: I have photographed flat samples, they have a front and back side, and so I would like to get 1 outcome/Histogram for both sides summed. Thank you for responding! Edit: We are now using:               hist = ImageHistogram[finalCrop, Appearance -> "Separated"];     Print[hist]; resImage = ImageResize[finalCrop, 200];          (*imagedata=ImageData[finalimage];*)          (*If[Mod[i,2]==0,histF=ImageHistogram[finalcrop,Appearance->\     "Separated"],histB=ImageHistogram[finalcrop,Appearance->\" Separated \     "]];          If[Mod[i,2] == 0, Print[histF],Print[histB]];*)          rgbImage = Transpose@Flatten[ImageData[finalCrop], 1];          (*hist2=GraphicsRow[Histogram/@rgbImage,ImageSize->500];     Print[hist2];*)          table = TableForm[Through[{Mean, StandardDeviation}[#]] & /@ rgbImage,         TableHeadings -> {{"Red", "Blue", "Green"}, {"Mean", "StDev"}}];     Print[table];      And I will the first to admit that I do not completely understand this, but as you can (hopefully) see, we are using histF (front of sample) en histB (back of sample) so then I would use               histTotal = Join @@@ Transpose[{histF,histB}]       followed by               GraphicsRow[Histogram /@ histTotal]      Correct? Am trying it now!
