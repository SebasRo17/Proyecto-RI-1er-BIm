I tried to generate a random binary tree with a `Table` of `RandomInteger` and to give a shape with a `LayerSizeFunction`, but the degree of the node equal to 2 is not respected. I try also by `KaryTree`, but I'm not able to do it. The folloing figures show an example of network compact and elongated, with 60 vertices, respectively: ![This one is an example of compacted tree](http://i.stack.imgur.com/apqzy.jpg) ![This one is an example of elongated tree](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fbf2B.jpg) Here is my attempt:               SeedRandom@0     TreePlot[Table[i -> RandomInteger[{0, i - 1}], {i, 1, 20}],        MultiedgeStyle -> None, SelfLoopStyle -> None,        LayerSizeFunction -> (1 # &)]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZR2Y3.png)
