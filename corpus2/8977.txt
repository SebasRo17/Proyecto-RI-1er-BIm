I have a mathematica file with an algorithm that feeds another program with data. my problem is that some times (randomly) the output is in fraction instead of decimal. The other program (java) does not read fractions, so I have to feed it with decimal numbers. One solution is to use the `N[.]` function before it output, but this is really painful procedure. Is there any setting in mathematica forcing it to return as output only decimals?
