This test BarChart is generated by the code that follows it: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/96Weu.png)               data = Table[RandomInteger[{1, 10}], {3}, {4}];          BarChart[MapThread[Labeled[#1, #2, Above] &, {data, {1, 2, 3}}],       ChartLayout -> "Stacked",       ChartStyle ->        Reverse@{Lighter@Blue, Blue, Darker@Blue, Darker@Darker@Blue},       ChartLabels -> {{"a", "b", "c"}, None},      Frame -> {False, True, False, False},      FrameLabel -> {"x axis", "y axis"},       BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Helvetica", FontSize -> 14}]      Since only a y-axis component of Frame is rendered: `Frame -> {False, True, False, False}` the "x axis" label of `FrameLabel -> {"x axis", "y axis"}` is omitted - and that's consistent with documentation. Is it possible to display "x axis" at the location it would be if the bottom component of the Frame were there _and_ preserving the set `BaseStyle` values (eg `Font`, `FontSize`)? This can be done using `Inset` but positioning is ad-hoc and it does not preserve `BaseStyle` values. Wrapping `Labeled` around `Barchart` doesn't correctly center the text and moreover does not use the `BaseStyle` values, as the following screenshot shows. Here for comparison the bottom component of Frame is True - and note the disastrous clash of graphical elements. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jeAo7.png) Finally, using the bottom `Frame` component: `Frame -> {True, True, False, False}` but without ticks: `FrameTicks -> {None, Automatic, None, None}` results in an ugly double axis and overlap in labels: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/28ntM.png) Any other options, eg using `LabelingFunction`?
