I have been working freelance for a few years, and before that I worked as an entry-level coder for a non-technical company. I "understand" how delegates, and MVC, and how to make an app and make it work, but I have done a few interviews recently and they are throwing questions at me that I don't know the answers to. These are questions that I think I _should_ know the answers to, but I basically haven't ever had to use the technical language. Needless to say I feel very stupid when this happens but I don't know how to prepare / remedy this problem without going back to Comp Sci 101. It's like I can do the work, but I don't know what they're talking about. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
