**Quick update** I found a way to solve this in webMathematica, using `CollectStreams`. But still, below problem leaves me puzzled, I would very much like to learn how this works. **Original** This question is motivated by the fact that I started to used webMathematica and observed a (to me) strange behavior there. I tried to isolate the problem, in plain Mathematica. I think it is rather closely related to this question, so I hope it is not considered a duplicate. **Setup** We start with a fresh kernel and check the `Streams`:               Quit[]     Streams[]      > `{OutputStream["stdout", 1], OutputStream["stderr", 2]}` Next, we load some `CountryData` related info, such as:               CountryData["CH", "Population"]      > `7.595*10^6` Checking `Streams` again:               Streams[]      > `{OutputStream["stdout", 1], OutputStream["stderr", 2], InputStream[ > "/Users/myusername/Library/Mathematica/Paclets/Repository/\ > CountryData-8.0.62/Data/CountryData.wdx", 111]}` Ok, `CountryaData` opened a new stream to read the info from. All good. Now we `Close` that stream manually:               Close[Last@Streams[]]      so we're back to               Streams[]      > `{OutputStream["stdout", 1], OutputStream["stderr", 2]}` and then we try to get the population a _different_ country:               CountryData["FR", "Population"]      > General::openx: > InputStream[/Users/myusername/Library/Mathematica/Paclets/Repository/CountryData-8.0.62/Data/CountryData.wdx,111] > is not open. >> > > BinaryRead::openx: > InputStream[/Users/myusername/Library/Mathematica/Paclets/Repository/CountryData-8.0.62/Data/CountryData.wdx,112] > is not open. >> > > `$Failed and interestingly, this still works:               CountryData["CH", "Population"]      **My Conclusion** It seems to me that on a fresh kernel, the first time we call `CountryData` (and e.g. `ElementData`, ...) it opens a stream and subsequently remembers that it has (should have) an open stream and tries to read from it. If that stream gets closed (which seems to happen in webMathematica, e.g. on reload of a page), you get `$Failed`. **My Question** Do you know where `CountryData` stores the stream it is associated with, in the open session? Is there a way to "reset" `CountryData` without quitting the kernel? Or can I add the lost stream manually? I tried various possiblities, such as:               OpenRead["/Users/myusername/Library/Mathematica/        Paclets/Repository/CountryData-8.0.62/Data/CountryData.wdx"]      but I got the wrong serial number - and `CountryData` was still referring to the previous one (`111` in above example). **Note** Please let me know if the webMathematica code I used to play with is of interest (how to replicate etc)
