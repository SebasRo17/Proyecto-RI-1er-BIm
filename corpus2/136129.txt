Not sure if this is the right forum. If it's not, please let me know and I'll move it. So I have been asked by a client to develop a RoR Web App for them. He asked me if the development is their property. I said yes, you can request the source code and database migrations anytime. Then he says "I'm asking you this, because we plan to resell the app to other branches. That's why I'm asking you if the development is ours and we have rights to resell it." So I'm thinking they do. I mean, they paid me to program for them. Is there a recommendation from any of you more experienced programmers? I'm thinking about of course, telling him he has the right to resell it, and I could help him deploying the app in more servers and cut him a web hosting deal so I can also benefit from my app being resold. What do you guys think?
