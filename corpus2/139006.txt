I need to allow the user to create an binary tree. I have a Backbone Model populating properly from the database, the problem I am stuck on is how do I setup the ui elements in a way that is fairly easy to use? The general idea is I want to create a boolean expression that contains logic and tokens. The tokens will be replaced later at runtime with appropriate model data when the expression is evaluated. You end up with a final expression like this:               ((({Claim.State})=(TX))||(({Claim.PolicyState})!=(UT)))      Ie, Evaluate to true if the State = TX or the Policy State is not UT Each expression can be a terminating node, and will have a value, or will have no value, and the left and right will point to the next respective expressions and an Operator The database structure looks something like this:   1. State Check: Left: **2** Right: **3** Operator: OR   2. State is TX: Left: **4** Right **5** Operator: Equals   3. State not UT: Left: **6** Right **7** : Operator: Not   4. Claim State: Left: nil Right: nil Value: {Claim.State}   5. Texas Literal: Left: nil Right: nil Value: "TX"   6. Policy State: Left: nil Right: nil Value: {Claim.PolicyState}   7. Utah Literal: Left: nil Right: nil Value: "UT" I am imaging something like for the Above expression, making a panel with 3 select lists, and a Label above it:               ----------------------------------------------------------------      Name: |State Check|                     [.] Value [0] Expression                 Left (Edit/New)   Operator Right (Edit/New)      Expression: [ State is TX ]   [ Or ]   [ State is not UT ]      (Save)     ----------------------------------------------------------------      At this point I'm stuck. What should happen when say, the user wants to edit the left hand value? Do I open a new popup window to rerender the same form, just starting with **2** instead of **1** for the starting expression key? Should I replace the existing form with the new values, and somehow keep track of where the user is in reference to the starting expression? Maybe slide a new editor panel down below the current? What do you guys think? I'm really stuck on what to do.
