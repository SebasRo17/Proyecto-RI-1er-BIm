What would be the most cross browser friendly (IE9, Chrome, FF, Safari, Opera) way to code an animated, interactive double-helix? HTML 5/JavaScript is fine. Flash or Java is not. I am unsure if canvas or svg or pure css should be considered as graphics aren't typically my thing. In fact, I really don't know where to start here, so I probably just need a nudge in the right direction. Any advice is appreciated!
