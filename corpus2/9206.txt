I'm looking for the way to substitute variables in interpolated function again to original one. (I want to know how to get P(r, theta) from Psol(v, w).) The original variables :                   r , theta (d<=r<=Infinity, 0<=theta<=Pi).      New variables :                   v , w (0<=v<=1, 0<=w<=1).       The relationship is ![Relations of variables](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F7tGG.gif). I now have the interpolated solution Psol(v, w). Psol(v,w) has no analytic expression, and was interpolated from numerical calculation. The final goal is to get P(r=d), after angle-averaging the P(r,theta) ![Angle-averaged P](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UOCCU.gif). I want to know how to get P(r, theta) from Psol(v, w) using above variable-to- variable relationship. May I have your advice? Thanks in advance.
