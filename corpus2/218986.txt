I am using JRuby. I have many classes implemented in Java, and I want to create objects off of them in my Ruby scripts. Suppose that I have a class `Sprite` in Java. In Ruby, to refer to it, I use the following:               Java::ComMyWebsiteMyProjectName::Sprite      Because Sprite is defined in the package `com.myWebsite.myProjectName`. Now then, to simplify things, I like to do this:               Sprite = Java::ComMyWebsiteMyProjectName::Sprite      Which sets the constant `Sprite` to the `Sprite` class defined in Java. Now my Ruby code can refer to it by just writing `Sprite`. I have a file full of that kind of declarations. Something like:               Sprite   = Java::ComMyWebsiteMyProjectName::Sprite     Texture  = Java::ComMyWebsiteMyProjectName::Texture     Bitmap   = Java::ComMyWebsiteMyProjectName::Bitmap     Math     = Java::ComMyWebsiteMyProjectName::Math     Geometry = Java::ComMyWebsiteMyProjectName::Geometry      Now, I am not exactly very familiar with programming concepts. I am having problems giving this file a name, because I don't even know if there is a name for this kind of thing. **Does this kind of "practice" have an actual name?**
