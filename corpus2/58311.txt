On the mathematica reference website it gives examples using the MaximalBy function, However when I am using it, I see no desired output. This leads me to wonder if mathematica has stopped using this function. example:               MaximalBy[{{25, 16}, {1, 50}, {2, 8}, {13, 93}, {41, 21}}, Last]      and i get:               MaximalBy[{{25, 16}, {1, 50}, {2, 8}, {13, 93}, {41, 21}}, Last]      when I should get:               {13,93}      Since this does not work, how can I use RankedMax to get this desired result
