Imagine there is an _application_ (`ASP.NET MVC`) that processes some documents. The `document` must be revised several times by _different group of users_. state/role rules:   * **simple user** can only **publish** document; (priority: **low** )   * **userGroup1** can switch it to **next state** or **reject** it; (priority: **higher** )   * **userGroup2** can **confirm** previous state and switch it to **next gradual** state or **reject** it; (priority: **highest** )     1. How to implement such a workflow in `ASP.NET MVC`? How to impelement `UI`, `views` so that group with lower priority can both visually/technically perform only `allowed transitions`? Can I somehow extend that system: link?     2. Do I need extras like service bus, event sourcing for that? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WoeKR.png)
