I am trying to use a real function of a real variable written in C from Mathematica, my .tm file reads as follows:               :Begin:     :Function:       my_function     :Pattern:        MyFunction[ x_Real]     :Arguments:      { x }     :ArgumentTypes:  { Real }     :ReturnType:     Real     :End:          double my_function(double x) { /* snip */ return ret; }      I can compile with mcc, install the program from within Mathematica, and call my function as MyFunction[1.0], but it won't work if I call it with an integer argument, like MyFunction[1], as it is not automatically converted to a Real and then to a double. How can I make my function work well also with integer arguments? Also I have to apply some numerical Mathematica methods (like NMinimize, NIntegrate) and they fail when evaluating the function for integer values.
