After a recent restructuring happened in our corporation - I have got a new line manager. He is generally ok and not as sneaky as the previous one. By "sneaky" I don't mean he was an evil manager - I just refer by this term to someone who keeps most of the information to himself and doesn't share with other team members in order to be the only "go-to person" - you get the idea. But nonetheless I had managed to maintain quite a good relationship with my previous manager - and I had been quite productive. My new boss is more open, which is a good thing, but I really hate one his quality - he likes to race the coders - by giving the same task to a different developer in order to fix the issue ASAP. As you may have already understood the information does NOT flow freely in an environment like ours. So the person who my manager was talking to 10 minutes ago might be starting work on the same issue I am working on now. It happened a few times, and every time I overheard that there might be someone working on the same issue - I did go and ask my manager - who owns the issue - but he usually was very evasive in his answers. So my question is - how to stop my manager from doing it? In our small team of half a dozen developers I am the most senior one and I am usually spared from the racing but when it hits me it really gets to my nerves. And one more thing: I am not implying that my manager is a bad/evil boss, neither I believe in that the world is or should be fair, I just want to find a way to make him stop racing me. One thing at a time.
