y = a + b x;      I can understand this output of the ordinary differentiation of `y` w.r.t. `x`               D[ y, x]      > >     b >   but I don't understand the mathematical meaning of this output               D[y]      > >     a + b x >   In fact there is no matching usage of `D[f]` (with only single argument) in the _Mathematica_ documentation. Usually _Mathematica_ will flag up argument count mismatch when running, e.g. > >     "... called with m argument; n arguments are expected" >   Can anyone help me to understand the meaning of `D[f]`? Is this a bug or undocumented behavior in _Mathematica_?
