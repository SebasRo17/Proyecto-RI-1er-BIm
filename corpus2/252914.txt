I have been looking into full stack developments and I am confused as I am getting different answers from people. I know that full stack developers are responsible for front end and back end programming, but some people say that they are also responsible for designing websites as well. Can someone clarify this? If this is true, it seems impossible that someone would be able to keep up with all of the latest design/art trends while keeping up with an insane amount of languages and frameworks which constantly change (considering they would technically be doing 3 jobs in 1) EDIT: By designing websites, I mean, are they responsible for making the template in Photoshop and then implementing it? Or will they be presented with a photoshop template which they will have to implement? It was incorrectly worded by me, so I thought I would clarify.
