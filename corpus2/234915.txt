These options which obscure me are like `ps aux`, `route -ee`, `gcc -fPIC xxx`, `find . -name xxx` and so on. The examples above aren't comprehensive. I.e., I don't think that the argument handle function like getopt or getopt_long could handle all the "strange" options. In the other hand, these handle ways aren't intuitive. Why do GNU programmers or Unix/BSD programmers code in these ways?
