I don't know that it may even make a difference, and I reckon if it did the differences would be cultural rather than technical, but if one were going to set out today (2011) to learn a language, and specifically wanted to telecommute (so they could live in two different places during the year), are there any languages whose culture looks more favorably upon telecommuting than other languages / cultures? For example, I get the impression (and I am probably completely wrong) that in the Ruby community, you are more likely to be expected to be on-site and doing pair programming (though I suppose you can do pairing remotely too). As a corollary question, are there languages / communities where pair programming is less important, for people who wanted to program in part because they aren't social butterflies?
