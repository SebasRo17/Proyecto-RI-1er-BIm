I've been working in the software industry for a few years now. I've seen Waterfall in practice, and I've seen several projects attempt Agile with varying degrees of success... which got me thinking. What are the bare-minimum requirements for an Agile startup to be successful? I'm thinking in terms of tools, practices, team roles (e.g., source control, automated testing, BA role). I'd like to be able to draft a list of tools/practices/etc that are absolutely essential for the long term sustained success of a startup wanting to do Agile. I ask because I'd like to start my own software company eventually. Most of my experience is in SCRUM so I'm naturally biased towards it and I've already developed an opinion of what the minimum requirements for a SCRUM team to function are. But, being only human, and being only one sample, I wouldn't be surprised if my opinion was flawed or incomplete. I'd appreciate any and all insight and experience. Thanks
