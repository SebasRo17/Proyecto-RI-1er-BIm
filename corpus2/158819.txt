I have been reading Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz and inside the section **Stack Confinement** it is mentioned that each thread gets its own stack and so local variables are intrinsically confined to the executing thread; they exist on the executing threads stack, which is not accessible to other threads. What does he mean that each thread has its own execution stack ?
