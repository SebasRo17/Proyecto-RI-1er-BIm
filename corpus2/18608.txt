If I have the following graphic:               Rotate[Show[{        Graphics@Line[{{0, 0}, {0, 1}}],         Graphics@Line[{{0, 0}, {1, 1}}],         Graphics@Plot[x^2, {x, -1, 1}, Axes -> False]}], Pi/3]      It looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Si8dx.png) I only want to rotate the content of the graphics, not the frame. Normally you would use `Graphics` after rotate, however this doesn't work:               Graphics@Rotate[Show[{       Graphics@Line[{{0, 0}, {0, 1}}],        Graphics@Line[{{0, 0}, {1, 1}}],        Graphics@Plot[x^2, {x, -1, 1}, Axes -> False]}], Pi/3]     (* Error: Graphics is not a Graphics primitive or directive. *)
