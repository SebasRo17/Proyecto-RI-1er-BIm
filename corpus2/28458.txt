I am in the initial stage of analyzing a platform for my startup and I am exploring both the cloud computing and web hosting before I initiate developement. I am quite proficient in both .NET and the java platform and hence I am hoping to get your feedback for helping me with some ideas/directions. Here are is the feature set that I am looking for   * Robust platform (must have)   * Persistence a.l.a {Big table/Cassandra style or RDBMS} ( must have)   * Message queueing frameworks like ActiveMQ (Must have)   * Full text search and advance features - Lucene and Solr (Must have)   * Memcached (Must have)   * Background/Offline services (Must have)   * Hosted SSL (Must have)   * Ability to support RESTful webservices (Must have)   * Support for fast prototyping and deployment (Must have)   * Storage on file system (Nice to have)   * Easy administration, support for scaling, monitoring and profiling (Must have)   * Transparent billing and accounting (Must have) I have looked at Google App engine and although it looks quite appealing, I don't think it supports full text search (what an irony) or messaging which would be dealbreakers for me. I have also looked at hosting solutions ( e.g. www.justhost.com) and they too don't offer messaging and support for indexing/full text search etc. So I am wondering what are my options. Do I need to buy own server farm and talk to my ISP? If so, are there any ISPs that you can recommend? Please advise on how I can go about selecting an appropriate platform Thanks -Venu
