So I have been reading Inside the Machine by Jon Stokes. It is a FANTASTIC book, and it has got me thinking about the effects of programming on processors... Given a branch unit in a CPU and a complex conditional statement that involves a procedure call (If IsTodayAHoliday( Now ) > 0 Then), is it faster to stick the results of that procedure call in a variable just before the IF statement? In terms of static and dynamic branch prediction, it seems logical that having the decision value before the branch unit has to evaluate causes the prediction algorithms to execute flawlessly. Is this true?
