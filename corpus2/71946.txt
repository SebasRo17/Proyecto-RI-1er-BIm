[Edit: Thanks S.Lott for the hints] I'm developing a web service from scratch. The service could have potential of 10,000 requests a day. Actually, to be honest, requirements aren't that clear at this point of the project. What the management team wants is to build something and getting it working. However, it does have the potential of getting bigger, so I need to put down the * foundation* right. I've decided to   1. Use Tomcat 6.0 as the application server   2. Use Apache Axis2 as the web service engine (Install it in Tomcat)   3. Use ??? for web service implementation   4. Use Hibernate for accessing database Point 3 is a bit fuzzy, I am not sure if I should use jax-ws or jaxb or spring or ejb or just POJO to implement the service. To people who have used these technologies, which one is easy to use, which one is easy to maintain, and which one is easy to scale? Thanks,   Sarah
