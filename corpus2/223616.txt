This question is about PSR-0 autoloaded libraries and the way main configuration constants should be declared and used. From your point of view (lib/framework developer), where/how should be declared your library configuration PHP constants (such as `ESCAPE_SOMETHING`, `USE_DOM`, `API_URL`, ...) in such a way that   * your code can easily address them   * client code can easily modify them depending on needs Is there any convention, recommendation, or even something I missed in PSR-0 I should be aware of?
