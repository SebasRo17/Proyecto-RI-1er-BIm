I am writing a node.js application which I am breaking down into modules, the issue is I am not sure how to organise my code in an idiomatic Javascript way. Currently each of my modules exposes a set of functions that are intended to be called directly. All state is modified by the module with the gameId being the first parameter :               //snip         var gameId = gameModule.createGame();         // Return the gameId down to a remote client         client.send(gameId);     }     // When a remote client wants to add a player         gameModule.addPlayer(gameId, "Player 1");     }      An alternative approach would be to actually use objects e.g. :               //snip     var game = new gameModule.Game();     // Return the gameId down to a remote client     client.send(game.getId());     }     //snip     // When a remote client wants to add a player     var gameToModify = gameModule.getGame(gameId);     gameToModify.addPlayer("Player 1");     gameModule.saveGame(gameToModify);      My question is to any Javascript programmers (or regular ones) is which of the two above alternatives looks easiest to work with / most natural?
