I find it really hard to find resources about computer security. I asked questions on message boards about key loggers and viruses and I got negative assumption from people assuming the the worse. Also, I don't think that I can trust random message boards. I know that it is a broad topic, but are there any good websites that I can follow and learn from that are targeted to beginner with some samples? I am a developer (or at least want to be one) and I have a CS degree if that helps.
