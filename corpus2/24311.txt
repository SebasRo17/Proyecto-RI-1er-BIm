I am trying to generate several random numbers from normal distribution using _Mathematica_. The following is the relevant code:               Clear["Global`*"];     SeedRandom[8396]     Sigma = 1;     Dim = 4;          A = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, Sigma], Dim,         WorkingPrecision -> 6];     B = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, Sigma], {Dim, Dim, Dim},         WorkingPrecision -> 6];      F = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, Sigma], {Dim, Dim, Dim, Dim},         WorkingPrecision -> 6];       Now, when I print out `B`, there are several infinities! `B` looks as follows:               {{{-1.92981, -1.21226, -0.244472, -0.00362004},        {0.700307, 1.49892, 0.874067, -0.539336},        {-0.643797, 0.356028, \[Infinity], -\[Infinity]},        {-0.130875, -0.379856, 2.20859, 1.65716}},       {{-1.87016, 0.478610, 0.261428, -1.15096},        {-0.0967131, 1.75239, -0.130795, -0.488940},        {-0.771886, 1.04727, -0.499386, 0.180890},        {-0.844033, 0.439520, -0.153382, 0.0686604}},       {{1.75313, -0.917641, -0.222227, 0.746214},        {1.40456, -0.249076, 1.90326, 0.436745},        {1.14792, 0.369685, 0.00756157, 0.407814},        {1.47316, 1.60401, 0.923612, -0.776877}},       {{0.764598, -1.58140, 1.66268, -1.93439},        {-0.520680, 0.227234, 0.908374, -1.11542},        {-2.28119, -1.58329, -0.536070, 0.209272},        {-0.157313, -0.0102335, -0.225685, -0.198312}}}      How is it possible? It shouldn't be because of the `WorkingPrecision->6`, is it?! This happens to specific `RandomSeed`, e.g., in this case, 6893. For other `RandomSeed`, I don't get this problem! I want to leave `WorkingPrecision->6` as it is to avoid larger floating numbers in the computation, unless it is this specific option that's the problem. Any idea?! Thanks.
