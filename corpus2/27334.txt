The following example either finds a factor of the number $n$ or returns a message saying that the number in question is prime (I specifially wrote this to demonstrate my question below).               n = 125;     For[i = 2, i <= Sqrt[n], i++,         If[Mod[n, i] == 0, Print["Factor found: ", i]; Break[];]      ]     If[i <= Sqrt[n], Exit[];]     Print[n, " is prime."]     ...      I know I could simply include the last Print statement in the if-condition, but I am specifically looking for a command that makes Mathematica skip the last _Print_ statement (and all other statements that might come thereafter...). I tried _Break_ , _Abort_ and _Interrupt_ , but none have the desired effect. Now the commands _Exit_ and _Quit_ work, but they terminate the entire Mathematica kernel, which is a bit of an overkill. How could I bypass this issue? I need something like _SkipRemainingCommands_.
