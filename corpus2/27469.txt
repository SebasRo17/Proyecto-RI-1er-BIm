I try to solve the following equation $$y'=y-2ye^{-0.8y}, \quad y(0)=0.7.$$ By some aruments I expect to have a positive solution $y(t)\geq0$, for all $t>0$, however, NDSolve shows that starting from $t\approx 25$ there are some oscilations arround $0$. Their amplitude is quite small, less than $10^{-7}$. A similar result I can obtain using Maple. Is it surely means that my theoretical arguments are wrong or it may be an error in NDSolve algorithm due to some bad properties of this equation?
