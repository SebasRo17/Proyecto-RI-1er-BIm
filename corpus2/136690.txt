I find myself aiding novice programmers relatively often; explaining why their code won't work when they ask, suggesting solutions and the like. The people I'm helping do have a formal education in programming from a first-year degree-level module, in Java, but I feel like I can't communicate with them very well. For example: one might write a function but not understand why it isn't executed, not realising they forgot to call it. If I use phrases like `"(make a) call (to) the function/it"` and `"pass it the.."` I get blank looks. My normal process then would be to find some place in their code where they call a function from the language, and tell them they can call their own functions in the same way as they called this other function. Sometimes even that gets blank looks. **Are there other pieces of vocabulary that are more suited to (better for?) helping novice programmers? Or is this not an issue of communication?**
