Apparently naming things is one of the hardest things in programming..! I have a synchronisation implementation which uses timestamps (number of seconds since unix epoch) to sync. Currently, the timestamps have simply replaced an older revision field. My question is, does it make sense to name it "Revision" or is "Timestamp" better? Revision makes sense to me since that's what's used to version an entity - to know what's created, updated, deleted. But if I needed to increase the granularity of the revision field in the future (ie. to become a decimal, to include fractions of a second), I wouldn't be sure that a decimal revision would make sense. On the other hand, perhaps I want to move away from timestamps in the future (ie. to sequence numbers) in which case revision would make sense.
