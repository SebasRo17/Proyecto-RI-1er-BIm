I am trying to create a simple, almost transparent 3D sphere with a mesh that is made of solid lines if they are on the front surface (i.e. if they are directly visible) and of dashed lines if those lines happen to be in the back of the sphere (i.e. not directly visible). I cannot think of an easy way of doing it without involving an explicit calculation of what part of the sphere is directly visible, given the viewpoint, and what part is not... Any ideas?
