I'm starting a project that will have a web front end for the users coupled with a database. There will then be a stand-alone service running that will, on a specified interval, poll an API and update the database with the changes it found. What I need advice on is how the service should be setup. When a user creates an account on the site, I"ll need to create a "hook" in the service that will then go poll the API for that specific user. I looked at building the service using NodeJS because I could use the non- blocking structure of it along with callbacks then the API returns data that needs to be reflected in the database. I don't know how I will be able to create more monitors when a user creates an account since it's already running. Can NodeJS run in a continuous loop as as service? I am familiar with .Net and could use a Windows Service, but how would that scale with polling when the user numbers grow?
