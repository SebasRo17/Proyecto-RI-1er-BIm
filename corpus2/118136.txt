My employer asked me to implement a feature that would require storing passwords in clear text in a database (or using an obscure encrypt/decrypt function stored in a binary, which is a bit better, but also insecure). I replied that I was willing to implement such a feature, provided that customers were acknowledged of security implications when using it. When discussing this problem with colleagues, someone told me that, as a software engineer, we are personally responsible (in the legal sense) for security problems that we introduce in our products. I looked into my contract, but did not found anything related to a similar case. From a legal point of view, should I refuse to implement such a feature? Is it true that my employer could take me to court if a customer experiences damage due to this feature, even if he was aware of security concerns as well? * * * _EDIT:_ I understand this question can only be answered reliably from a lawyer. The same is true for licensing questions: people here give their understanding and their experience, sometimes after having consulted a lawyer, with no guarantee it applies in another jurisdiction. But licensing is explicitly accepted as a topic here, see What kind of questions can I ask here?. I believe other programmers may have the same issue, and other may have been confronted to this situation before, and may have consulted a lawyer for that.
