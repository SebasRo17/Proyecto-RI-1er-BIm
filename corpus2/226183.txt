I am writing a simple piece of code. Its a function that allowed the user to withdraw some money. There are some restrictions to this though.   1. The user can't withdraw more than the given withdraw limit.   2. The user cannot withdraw more money they that have.  The script will terminate if this happens, and let the users know. Otherwise they user can withdraw the money and the balance updates, they also get a confirmation message. Now my question is should I return `False` if they hit either case 1 or 2? And should I return `True` if the transactions completes successfully? I do not have any current plans where I will need the booleans from the function call. But I wonder is it good coding practice to return something in a case like where the function could take different paths. Some example code (Python):               limit = 500     balance = 5000          def withdraw_money(amount):         if amount > limit:  # above the limt             print('You cannot withdraw more than ${}'.format(balance))             return False         elif amount > balance:  # not enough money             print('Insuffecient funds')             return False         else:  # actually worked             balance -= amount             print('Your new balance is ${}'.format(balance))             return True
