I read in the Dennis Ritchie's _The C Programming Language_ book that `int` must be used for a variable to hold EOF - to make it sufficiently large so that it can hold EOF value - not `char`. But following code works fine:               #include<stdio.h>           main()  {        char c;        c=getchar();        while(c!=EOF)  {          putchar(c);          c=getchar();        }      }       When there is no more input, `getchar` returns EOF. And in the above program, the variable `c`, with char type, is able to hold it successfully. Why does this work? As per the explanation in the book above mentioned, the code should not work.
