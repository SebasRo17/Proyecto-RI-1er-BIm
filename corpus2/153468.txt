I'm developing an application that has methods of this kind:               attackIfIsFar();     protectIfIsNear();     helpAfterDeadOf();     helpBeforeAttackOf();      etc. The initialization of my application for n players is something like               player1.attackIfIsFar(player2);     player2.protectIfIsNear(player4);     player3.helpAfterDeadOf(player1);     player4.helpBeforeAttackOf(player3);      etc. I don't know how to configure a jtable that that can allow me to set the equivalent of this code-block In others words I need simply a way to create a jtable with 3 column and n row, were I can set in the column 1 and 3, the player, and in the central column one of the available methods that each player on the column 1 must invoke on each player of column 3
