I'd like to get a serious discussion started about a package manager. This has come up elsewhere, and many people have implemented their own solutions. It would be nice to have a standardized way to deploy and distribute Mathematica code to anyone. I also imagine we could distribute other content this way. For example, one thing I think would be nice, if there were interest, would be to collate information from this site and serve it as a package that includes tools and supplemental documentation. Please share your ideas on how we can achieve this.
