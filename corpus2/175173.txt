I have a number of open-source projects that have gotten some significant usage and would like to find co-maintainers so that I am not a bottleneck when it comes to maintenance and support requests and to get other perspectives on how the project should evolve. Where should I look for co-maintainers, what should I look for in a co- maintainer, and how should I go about bringing them up to speed on the code and maintainer responsibilities?
