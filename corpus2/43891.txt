I have               h[phi_, delta_] := ArcCos[-Tan[phi Degree] Tan[delta Degree]]     insolation[phi_, delta_, S_: 1368] := (S/Pi) (Cos[delta Degree] Cos[phi Degree] Sin[h] + h Sin[delta Degree] Sin[phi Degree]) /. h -> h[phi, delta]     ContourPlot[insolation[phi, 23.5 Cos[t]], {t, -Pi, Pi}, {phi, -90, 90},         PlotLegends -> Automatic, ContourLabels -> False, Contours -> 20,          ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap"]      But the resulting figure has areas that are "missing": ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2THqS.png) What am I doing wrong? How do I get the expected vertical contours extending from the truncated edges to the near horizontal axis in the upper center and bottom right and left corners? How to I "fill in" the regions in the upper right and left corners that are 0? * * * A similar figure for comparison: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8TKIm.png)
