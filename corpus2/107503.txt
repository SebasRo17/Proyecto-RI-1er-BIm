At a web startup, is it more common to have an engineer working the front-end AND back-end of the feature (basically in charge of the whole feature)? Or have engineers separated between the back-end and front-end? Which ones are more beneficial and for what situations? The downside, I've noticed, regarding having one engineer in charge of the whole feature is that the person might only be particularly strong in either frontend or backend development but not both, thus sometimes having a decrease in speed and quality. Having frontend and backend developers on one feature increase the speed of the feature and the quality AND it encourages collaboration. But I am concerned about having 2 engineers working on one feature which may be a poor use of resources since the 1 engineer can be placed on another feature to work on. What is the common/best practice for allocation backend/frontend engineering resources at a small early-stage startup? And then how will it change as it grows?
