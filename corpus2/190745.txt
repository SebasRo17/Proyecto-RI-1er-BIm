I'm trying to understand more about shells. I'm looking to implement one and want to look at what's been done in the past. In a regular shell, you have features like aliases and relative paths, and strong syntactic conventions, like `--flag` and so on. The IPython community have added loads of nice features to their shells with only a tiny bit of new syntax. Are there other projects that demonstrate innovative features, or novel use of syntax, that could be useful when designing a shell language? _As examples, the answers given below, onBoo and on Forth and Rebol, are perfect._
