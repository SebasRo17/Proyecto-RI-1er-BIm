Forgive me for my poor English, me and my friend were doing school homework, suddenly he asked me to read this line of code `ptr = &array[1][1][1]` (ptr is a pointer to an integer). He said > ptr is pointing to the address of the second element of the second column of > the second row of an array. I think he will be right if it was an array of char. As far as it's an integer 3D array I have no idea how to read that line of code in plain English. How would you read it?
