I have an open source project that uploads files to DropBox among several file hosts. Right now I am screen scraping for DropBox. To use their API, I have to hardcode a SECRET KEY provided by them to me for OAuth authentication. But I'm afraid that the key won't be secret if it is visible plainly for anyone to see. It is 'possible' for someone malicious to use my key to upload a virus to a user's account (who already allowed access to my app) that will spread to their pc (if they had desktop sync enabled) and to others' pc (if they had shared folders) and so on. :O I found this unanswered question that has the same problem as mine. But I would like to know generally how one would hide confidential data in an open source project. I have one idea.   * Have a placeholder in the source code like "<SECRET KEY HERE>" and fill it only when building binary for release? (yuck!) Any decent idea?
