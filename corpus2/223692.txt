**Background:** (may skip): I am currently in my second year at university studying Computer Science and applying for placement positions for a year of work. One application I have run into is asking me to rate my knowledge of the programming languages I know. quote : " _rate your understanding and knowledge on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the highest (eg. JAVA=8, C++=6, etc)._ " Now I feel like I am quite familiar with the languages I know but it is possible I may be over or under estimating my ability in them as I am ultimately still learning. **The Question:** is there a way or systematic approach I can use to give my understanding of a programming language a rating?
