Okey, so I have for a while now been thinking of rewriting the minecraft server, this time in a language called golang. It's just a example project that I can learn a new programming language through.. My question is: If I -rewrite- the minecraft -server-,:   * I read the Minecraft EULA, and they only talking about -modifying- the the current server or client. Nothing about re-creating it. Do I violate the EULA if I recreate the minecraft server in golang?   * If I ever will finish the project, having a completley functional rewritten server. Can I release it?   * And if I can release it, can I earn money from it in form of donations? Thanks!
