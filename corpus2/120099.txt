I am currently a high school student and know how to use Pascal and C/C++ to take part in competitions such as the Informatics Olympiad. I have learned data structures and many algorithms to solve various kinds of problems. Now, I want to move on to become a web developer. However, I know web development is quite different from competitive programming. To make a web application, I have to master HTML, databases, back-end programming etc. But these all look like separate pieces of information. I don't know where to start and what order should I follow. Anybody who can give a comprehensive list of learning points? I know there are HTML, Ruby on Rails, CSS and Javascript. What else? More importantly, can someone give a brief outline of their relationship?
