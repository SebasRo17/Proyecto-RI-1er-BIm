I am trying to use _Mathematica_ , in this case in a well known and rather simple list of equations, but I get stuck whit _Mathematica_. Since I am just starting to use _Mathematica_ for mathematical purposes, I am aware that this might be to simple. However, I would like to get a good demonstration of how to proceed. I am trying to follow: This page Normal Distribution Here is what I have done so far.               D[f[x], x]          D[f, f] == -k (x - μ) \[DifferentialD]x          D[f, f] == -k (x - μ) \[DifferentialD]x     ∫\[DifferentialD]f/f == ∫(x - μ) \[DifferentialD]x          Log[f] == x^2/2 - x μ (     Log[f] == x^2/2 - x μ + Log[c]     Solve[Log[f] == x^2/2 - x μ + Log[c], f]      This is where I get stuck, and if you look at the page that I have linked, you see that this is not the answer given there. Could someone who is capable provide a step by step solution of how to derive this. I think it would be helpful for many people just starting to use _Mathematica_ for this purpose. I also think that having an example to look at would make it easier to find your own solutions later on in other cases.
