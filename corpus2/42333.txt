Is it possible to use _Mathematica_ (or the _Mathematica_ kernel) to interact with Microsoft Windows, much like any macro-based scripting language that controls the keyboard/mouse, opens/closes programs remotely, manipulate window sizes, files, and folders, etc? It seems _Mathematica_ is usually used for math related engineering purposes inside the _Mathematica_ notebooks, I'm interested in its symbolic programming style to create standalone applications that interact with windows (to automate repetitive tasks).
