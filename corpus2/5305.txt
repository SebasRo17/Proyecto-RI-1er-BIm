Consider the following demand of products for the next four months.               data={1,20,3,40};      I could produce the whole demand in the first months, leading to the following "production vector": `{63,0,0,0}`. As you can imagine, producing everything in the first month leads to high costs of inventory. Another possibility would be {21,0,43,0}. Now I would like to get all possible combinations of the subsets of `data`, leading to:               results=     {{{1},{20,3,40}},     {{1,20},{3,40}},     {{1,20,3},{40}},     {{1},{20,3},{40}},     {{1},{20},{3},{40}},     {1,20,3,4}     }      It is important that `Table[Map[Flatten,results][[i]]==data,{i,Length@results}]` is `True` for all `i`. This means that each sublist of `results` has the same order of figures as in data.
