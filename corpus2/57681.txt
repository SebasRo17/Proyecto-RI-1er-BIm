I have graphs in DIMACS format, with vertex colors specified. The vertex colors are denoted by lines `n u c`, where `u` is the vertex number and `c` an integer representing its color. Here's an example of a triangle colored with 2 colors:               p edge 3 3     e 1 2     e 2 3     e 3 1     n 1 1     n 2 1     n 3 2      Using `Import`, I can nicely import the graph, but not the vertex colors. Is there a way to read them in with `Import`, or am I forced to write my own reader that manually sets the vertex colors?
