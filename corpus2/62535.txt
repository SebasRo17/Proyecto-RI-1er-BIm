I would like to have some professional opinion about the programming language used for a project in a company. Let's explain me... In my company, the first argument to choose Java as the main language is its name and its popularity from the perspective of the customer. It appears that if you propose to develop the client's software in Python/Ruby/..., he is less convinced. I would like to know if you are experiencing this kind of situation and what you think about that ?
