I'm creating a **simple MVC** at the moment and am wondering if it's 'correct' to be able to call any model class directly from the controller to get the data to send to the view? I have the following folder structure:               .htaccess     index.php     /controller     /model     /templates      I also have the needed model classes within the `/model folder`, at the moment I've tried playing with a `/model/model.class.php` to try and build all parts of the site but it's already starting to become huge and I think it might be better to completely cut it out. I'm thinking the better approach is to use:               elseif($_GET['type'] == "Profile") {         $profile = new thread($userId);         $comments =  $profile->getComments();         require "templates/profile.php";     }      The above is a brief example but is that how a controller could/should/might look or was the first approach better or am I completely missing the point of the model and controller communication?
