I frequently have a probelem using my charts in reports because the text (axes labels and tick marks) look low resolution (fuzzy). When I export my charts, i export them as PNG files. Unless I'm mistaken, this is the correct file format for vector graphics. In _Mathematica_ , the charts look great at any size, but when I export and drag them into Word, they don't look nearly as nice any more. Does any one have any tricks they use to use the _Mathematica_ charts in applications like Word?
