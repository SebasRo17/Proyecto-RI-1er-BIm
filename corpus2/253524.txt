Recently I decided to start developing a client/service based system using WCF and a Duplex Channel (callbacks from Service to client). The clients will behave as "slaves", that is, they will only connect to server and from then on, only the server communicates with them. Eventually the server may request that the clients send "data streams" to him (frequent updates of new content/objects). I want to make my software as loosely coupled as possible, but even reading about the different patterns for this, such as MVC and MVP, they don't seem to be designed to fulfill my specific requirements. What is the best code architecture or pattern for my problem? Considering the technologies I am using?
