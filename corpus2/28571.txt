My goal is to use MathLink to access the functions in sofa (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) So far I have had mixed success. I have very little C programing experience so I am hoping to get access to these algorithms via MathLink. I have a very simple C code file that loads the sofa libraries:               #include "mathlink.h"     #include <stdio.h>     #include "sofa.h"     #include "sofam.h"          int main(int argc, char* argv[])     {     return MLMain(argc, argv);     }      Then, from the sofa documentation I find function definitions like:               double iauAnp(double a)      Which I then turn into inputs, in the sofa.tm file               :Begin:     :Function:       iauAnp     :Pattern:        iauAnp[i_Real]     :Arguments:      { i }     :ArgumentTypes:  { Real64 }     :ReturnType:     Real64     :End:          :Evaluate: iauAnp::usage = "iauAnp[x] Normalize angle into the range 0 <= a < 2pi."      I'm then able to compile this and load it into _Mathematica_ via the `Install[]` function. So I know I can turn the crank once for a simple case. The question: How do I write the lines for the sofa.tm file for the following function?               void iauC2i00a(double date1, double date2, double rc2i[3][3])      My understanding of the workings of this function is that `date1` and `date2` are inputs and the 2D array, `rc2i` is returned by reference. I would like the _Mathematica_ function to look like this:               rc2i = iauC2i00a[date1, date2]
