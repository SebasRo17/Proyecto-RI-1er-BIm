Excuse me if I'm not descriptive enough, as I do not have much of a background when it comes to these things: How would I go about coding a primitive trading strategy and link it to some sort of artificial trading environment? Where do I start, and what are some other essential questions I should be asking? I am interested more in doing this because it interests me than making returns. Ideally it utilizes random/historical market data and doesn't actually execute any real trades. My background: I'm almost done my undergrad degree in computer science, and have had intro finance and economic courses. Familiar mostly with C and Java.
