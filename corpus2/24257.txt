The Peirce quincuncial projection is the cartographic projection of a sphere onto a square. In short, I would like to see it implemented in _Mathematica_. Here is my code:               Clear[InversePeirceQuincunicalMapping];      InversePeirceQuincunicalMapping[x_Real, y_Real] :=       Module[{cn, m = 1/2, th, phi},             cn = JacobiCN[x 2 EllipticK[m] + I 2 y EllipticK[1 - m], m];             {th, phi} = {2 ArcTan[Abs[cn]], Arg[cn]};             {th, phi}]          zf[{th_, phi_}] := Cos[th]     xf[{th_, phi_}] := Sin[th] Cos[phi]     yf[{th_, phi_}] := Sin[th] Sin[phi]      The contours that correspond to the equation $\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}$, besides the expected tilted square, also includes the diagonal and anti-diagonal. This is not an artifact and can be proven. ![contour of inverse Peirce mapping](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IQF89.png) These lines make me suspect that I am not doing the projection the right way. I would be glad to see a prototype implementation of it in _Mathematica_. Thank you.
