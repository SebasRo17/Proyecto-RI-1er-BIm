I'm working through K&R and I notice that their code is extremely tightly spaced. I haven't developed C since at University, but professionally most source from other languages I've worked in has used blank lines to aid readability. Is C generally more tightly packed or is it a historical matter related to display size in the 70s? Exercise 1-16 seems to hinder readability by, for example, an `if` immediately after `for` loop that doesn't have braces.               /* mygetline: read a line into s, return length */     int mygetline(char s[], int lim)     {       int c,i;            for (i=0; i<lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != EOF && c!='\n'; ++i)         s[i] = c;       if (c == '\n') {         s[i] = c;         ++i;       }       s[i] = '\0';       return i;     }
