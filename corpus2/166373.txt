With mobile technologies becoming increasingly popular what is happening on the server-side with most of these apps when they need to communicate with a back end? I'm used to the world of technology from 10 years ago when most resources were accessed by requesting a dynamic web page that behind the seen used a server- side language to get the information it needed from a relational database. Is this still the case, and if not, what are the big changes?
