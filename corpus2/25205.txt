In order to make my computations faster I have developed a C/C++ application calling _Mathematica_ kernel and performing many operations using _Mathematica_ functions for equation solving. Now I want to use multithreading and in particular I plan on taking advantage of the _Posix_ library in order to do so (`pthread`). But how does the link behaves when many threads insist on it? I guess that being a buffered/packet approach, if two threads try to send stuff to the same link without a mutex in guard (of the link), everything is a mess. SO I should create as many links as many threads I create. So here my questions:   1. Is there a limit to the number of links I can create to _MathLink_?   2. Is there a way to perform parallel activities on the _Mathematica_ kernel in an automated way? I know about the parallel core of _Mathematica_ , but what happens when I am interfacing to _Mathematica_ through _MathLink_ from C/C++?
