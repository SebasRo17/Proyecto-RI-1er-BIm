I need to create some graphs in _Mathematica_ with a bunch of labels, such as axes labels, graph labels, etc. In particular, there must be some points that must be labeled with their coordinates. Thanks to Internet search and this website in particular, I learned how to use the `Epilog` option. So I can do things like               Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 1}, Epilog -> {Text[y == x^2, {0.5, 0.5}]}]      to label an equation or                ListPlot[{{1, 1}}, Epilog -> {Text["(1,1)", {0.5, 0.5}]}]      to label a point. Thru my experimenting, as you can see in these two examples, I figured that meaningful _Mathematica_ inputs can be used in `Text`, but meaningless (for _Mathematica_ ) would cause an error message, so I do them as strings in quotes. Now here's a problem. I need to label a point whose x-coordinate is 2/3, and I want it to look as a stacked fraction. I can't type coordinates of points in parentheses without quotes because for _Mathematica_ it's an error. But if I type it in quotes, the parentheses don't stretch vertically, which doesn't look right. ![my ListPlot samples](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rmksn.png) Can anybody advise a solution to this problems?
