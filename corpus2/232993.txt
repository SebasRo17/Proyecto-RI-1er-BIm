Many times I have to write a loop that requires initialization of a loop condition, and an update every time the loop executes. Here's one example:               List<String> currentStrings = getCurrentStrings();     while(currentStrings.size() > 0) {       doThingsThatCanAlterCurrentStrings();       currentStrings = getCurrentStrings();     }      One things I dislike about this code is the duplicate call to `getCurrentStrings()`. One option is to add the assignment to the condition as follows:               List<String> currentStrings;     while( (currentStrings = getCurrentStrings()).size() > 0) {       doThingsThatCanAlterCurrentStrings();     }      But while I now have less duplication and less code, i _feel_ that my code is now harder to read. On the other hand, it is easier to understand that we are looping on a variable that may be changed by the loop. What is the best practice to follow in cases like this?
