Consider the following scenario. You currently have a feature set `A` you wish to extend to include feature set `B`. In the near feature there's a high possibility that you wish to extend this even further to include feature set `C`.   * Option 1) Cost to extend `A` -> `B` is minimal, but high maintenance costs.   * Option 2) Cost to refactor `A` and `B` to make more logical sense is moderate, but low maintenance costs. Extending to include feature set `C`:   * Cost to extend refactored(`A` & `B`) -> `C` is minimal, again low maintenance costs.   * Cost to extend A,B -> C is high, (both to refactor and extend). Assuming the inclusion of feature set `C` is beyond the scope of the current sprint, how do you go about choosing an option? How does this change if the addition of feature set C is several (2 or more) sprints out?
