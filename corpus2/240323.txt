What is the term for an error or bug that exhibits itself on computers with certain environments/setups only? **Context:** We have produced our own anti-piracy software. We distribute applications that are locked using this anti-piracy software. The anti-piracy software is simply a windowless Windows OS executable. When it runs; it downloads an encrypted file (Client File) from our server, decrypts it, checks that the users serial number occurs in the Client File and writes the result (hashed) to a Result File. Each of our companies products 'consults'/accesses this executable to verify that the user is allowed to run and use our product. On some of our clients computers, our anti-piracy executable is being blocked from running or blocked from downloading the Client File (its unknown what the cause is yet). These clients are Civil Engineering firms that have their Windows OS's very controlled and 'sandboxed' for security reasons. _So to sum up, the anti-piracy software works and passes our tests on most of our clients computers and on all our in-house test nodes. The software fails on these few Civil Engineering clients computers._ **What would be the term (if any) for this kind of error or bug in software?**
