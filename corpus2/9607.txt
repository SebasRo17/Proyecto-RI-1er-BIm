Here I define (`NormCoordinates`).               NormCoordinates[coordinates_]:=Norm/@coordinates;     NormCoordinates[{{2.2,4.4},{5.5,6.6},{-6.7,1.3},{-2.7,-0.3}}]          (* {4.91935, 8.59127, 6.82495, 2.71662} *)      As in the example above, I plan to only use it on elements with the Head `Real`. I notice (`Norm`) can't be compiled. Can anyone implement this using `Compile` and lower level functions in a way the runs much faster on a large list?
