I have a project where my files have gotten out of hand because of the volume of them. I have started to combine classes of similar types in single header files because you can, and it still is good practice, now can i do the them same for those classes functions, that are declared in the source files. Is it a good idea to combine several classes functions in a single source file, if the classes are say all sub classes of the same super class?
