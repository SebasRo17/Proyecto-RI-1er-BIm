Is it possible in Mathematica to write a program inside a graph? For example if you have a bunch of different `If[]` statements that you need to embed within one another, instead of writing them all within one another and getting very confused as to where in the control flow you are up to, is it possible to somehow embed these within a graph, so that you can more clearly keep track of precisely where you are? Thank you
