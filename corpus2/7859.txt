I have a relatively simple operation I'd like to perform on a plot: I would like to reflect the plot across the x-axis. I do not have any tick labels, so making sure that the labels are not themselves reflected is not a concern. Rotating the plot works as expected:               Rotate[ListPlot[{{0,0},{1,1}},Joined->True],90\[Degree]]      ...but there does not appear to be a "Reflect" command or equivalent that performs a reflection operation. I've tried using GeometricTransformation and Scale, but both of those don't seem to work on plot objects. How should I go about doing this?
