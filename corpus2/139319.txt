I am using PetaPoco micro-ORM. It is indeed very easy and secure to work with databases using ORM tools, but the only thing I hate is extra code. I used to put most of the code in the database itself and use all the RDBMS features like Stored Procedures, Triggers etc., which it is built to handle better. I want to know when not to use ORM over Stored Procedures/Triggers and vice- versa.
