I conducting my summer training or internship for 2 months in an IT company as a a Sysadmin and Web developer. This is my first week. My mentor assigned me to work on an existing Flash/AS3 project(alone) to improve it and add new features. ( I think this wasn't part of my training plan) The problem is that I have never worked on AS3, so I took my time this week to learn as much as I can, about it. Today, I saw the source code of the project and it was outsourceed with 3500 lines of code plus no comments or any documentation included. I am panicking . The company has no one with AS3/Flash experience nor my mentor. I'm not sure if I can accomplish the task with their requirements. As it definitely needs an experienced developer in this field , plus I have only 2 months - so it's short. Hence , I'm asking here and looking for advice and suggestions on what to do next. Should I ask him and explain ? or should I risk and (try) working on it? what if I fail? Thanks advance! EDIT: I'm not sure if I have to accomplish the task in 2 months. I'm sure less so that I work on other projects. I haven't really asked. Since I'm not living in the US , I'm not sure if an Intern is the proper word to use. Every university student is required to conduct his/her summer training for 2 months in a company. At the end , either he/she passes the course or fail.
