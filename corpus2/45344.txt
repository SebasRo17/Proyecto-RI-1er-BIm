I have a very large text file, `test.txt`, in the following format:               (Same specific character or word like '^' or '*') Title 1 (end-of-line)          Text 1 (with paragraphs markers, end-of-line markers spaces, all kinds of stuff)          (Same specific character or word like '^' or '*') Title 2 (end-of-line)          Text 2 (with paragraphs markers, spaces, all kinds of stuff)          (Same specific character or word like '^' or '*') Title 3 (end-of-line)          Text 3 (with paragraphs markers, spaces, all kinds of stuff)          ...      I'd like to make two arrays, one corresponding to the strings `{ "Title 1", "Title 2", "Title 3", ...}`, and the other corresponding to the strings `{ "Text 1", "Text 2", "Text 3", ...}`.   Is there a simple one-liner to do this? Here's a specific test example. Here each line starting with `^` should be a `"Title"` (of which there are three), and the material between the `^` corresponds to `"Text"` (of which there are three sections). Notice that `^` only appears as the first character in the `"Title"` string, and that each title is finished with an end-of-line, and finally that each `"Text"` section can consist of multiple lines of strings.
