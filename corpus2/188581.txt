I wrote the following function to validate emails for a web app I'm working on:               function validate_email($email) {         $valid = true;              if(!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {             $valid = false;         }              $email_parts = explode("@", $email);              if(count($email_parts) < 2) {             $valid = false;         }         else {             if(!checkdnsrr($email_parts[1], "MX")) {                 $valid = false;             }         }              return $valid;     }      It's not intended to replace the validation email sent to the user with a link to complete the registration. I know it wont catch all invalid ones, it will just reduce them. Hence reduce the amount of bounced emails received. My questions are:   1. Will it flag a valid emails as a false positive?   2. Is it okay to depend on a DNS check to validate the domain?  Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
