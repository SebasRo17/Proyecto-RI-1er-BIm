We all sometimes find images on the web that are carelessly stretched to larger dimensions than original, which results in nothing but a reduction of the detail / dimensions ratio. See **Original** vs **Stretched** below: * * * Source: Kaley Cuoco (Model), Esquire (Latin America) # Original ![original](http://i.imgur.com/WsXXsnL.jpg) # Stretched ![stretched](http://i.imgur.com/RMEuvh3.jpg) * * * Questions:   1. Given only **Stretched** , is there a way to automatically find the best dimensions to shrink _Stretched_ down to which maximizes the `detail / dimensions` ratio?   2. Is there a generic way to define `detail` for all images (photos, line-art, text, etc.)?   3. Is 'stretched' the correct term or is there a more technically correct applicable?
