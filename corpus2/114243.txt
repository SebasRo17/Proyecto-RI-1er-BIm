I'm a PHP / Java / Objective-C programmer, looking to finally learn some MS technologies, to increase my marketability, etc. I am looking at these two books, can anyone experienced in the field suggest one over the other, or another book that'd be good for learning C# / .Net, etc? What impressed me about "Pro C# 2010 and the .NET 4 Platform" thumbing through it at the bookstore, was that they explained a whole lot of the inner workings and paradigms of MS, not just the language. I haven't had a chance to look through the other one, and probably won't get a chance. Here are the two I'm considering: http://www.amazon.com/2010-NET-Platform-Andrew-Troelsen/dp/1430225491/ http://www.amazon.com/Professional-4-0-NET-Wrox-Programmer/dp/0470502258/ I know this is a very specific question, but I feel it can greatly benefit others like me, trying to get into some MS tech.
