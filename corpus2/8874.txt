This is for a physics report that I have to hand in. I have a list of two- dimensional data points that approximately form a linear line. I want to:   1. calculate the best linear fit.    2. put both data points and the linear fit line on a plot   3. put names and units on x and y axis   4. (if possible) put slope and intersection of best fit on plot Is it possible to do this in _Mathematica_ and if so how? Example data:               Time, Displacement              t (s)   d (m)         0       0         1       1.9         2       3.8         3       5.9         4       8.1         5       10.1
