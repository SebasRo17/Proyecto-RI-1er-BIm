I did this:               b[x_] := Cos[b[x - 1]] + 1; b[0] = 1;     num = SequenceLimit[N[Table[b[n], {n, 1, 100}], 50]]      I also did the listplot which shows a convergent value. ![the recurrence relation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4IOtd.jpg) Both results suggests that SequenceLimit did the right thing. The limit is 1.2834287895560837995226068447. Is there a way to find the exact value of convergent recurrence relation? Or find the limit without repeated calculation ?
