My code:               sqrSize = 16/2;     dots = Flatten[Table[{2 i + Mod[j, 2], j Sqrt[3]},                           {i, -sqrSize, sqrSize}, {j, -sqrSize, sqrSize}], 1];     inner = Select[dots, Norm[#] <= 5 &];     zePlot = ListPlot[{dots, inner}, PlotRange -> {{-sqrSize, sqrSize}, {-sqrSize, sqrSize}},          AspectRatio -> 1, Axes -> None, PlotStyle -> {{PointSize[0.02]}},          Epilog -> {Circle[{0, 0}, 5], PlotStyle -> {Blue, Opacity[0.2]}}];     ImageCompose[zePlot, {Graphics[{Blue, Disk[{0, 0}, 5]}], 0.2}]      gives this `Plot` as result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UuyZg.png) Two issues:   1. The disk seems to use another scale than the rest of the image; I'd like to have it the same size as the circle   2. (not in the code yet) Instead of the disk I'd like to have its complement, i.e. the area outside the circle should be blue, inside the circle white. How can I achieve these?
