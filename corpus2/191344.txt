I'm very confused. I can't even begin to understand how MVC would be implemented outside of web development. This might seem like too general a question, but how would one apply MVC. I have the following general questions:   1. Are M, V, and C all meant to be one class each, or many. If many, how would that work.    2. Most classes I've made previously have had their data inside them, not in a separate class. How would this work with MVC? 1) For instance, lets say you have a class where you take care of a virtual dog. I would think that you would make a Dog class with, for example, a "bark" command that would play a sound along with a name variable and a coat_color variable. I know this is very simple, but how would this fit inside MVC? It seems that you would end up with MC and V, where the information (model) AND the controls were in the Dog class, which would maybe access swing, or whatever library, to update the view. 2) Or, what about a program like sims (simplified version) where each person would have their own information... would you put all that info in another class? Sorry if these are all based on giant misconceptions, but I'm pretty confused. Right now I'm using Java, if that matters for MVC...
