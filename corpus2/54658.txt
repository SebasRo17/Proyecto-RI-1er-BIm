If I evaluate, with a fresh kernel               Names["Global`*"]      I get > >     {"rhs", "z"} >   I think this is not caused by any packages in `$UserBaseDirectory` or `$BaseDirectory`, because if I evaluate the same expression under V9.0.1, which has the same strings for these variables (directories), I get               Names["Global`*"]      > >     {} >   As expected. I was wondering if others are getting the same result. `rhs` and `z` do not have values, but still I am a bit concerned about the safety of               Remove["Global`*"]      when certain functions may depend on the existence of these symbols in Global`. For example if I set               sys`f[Global`xxxx_] := Global`xxxx      and evaluate               Remove[Global`xxxx]      then the following looks a bit scary                sys`f // Definition      > >     sys`f[Removed[xxxx]:_]:=Removed[xxxx] >   `sys`f` still works, but I still think it may lead to trouble (e.g. with `Save`). Kirma came up with the nice idea of testing this on the cloud. I get               Apply[And,       MemberQ[CloudEvaluate[Names["Global`*"]], #] & /@ {"z", "rhs"}]      > >     True >   But there are many other symbols in the `Global`` context there. So, is this a bug?
