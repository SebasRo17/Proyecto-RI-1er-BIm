I am trying to get a solution to a non-linear ODE, below is the code that works for my problem.               s = NDSolve[{y'''[x] + y[x]^2 y''[x] - y'[x] == 0, y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 0, y''[1] == 1}, y, {x, 0, 1}];     Plot[Evaluate[{y[x], y'[x], y''[x]} /. s], {x, 0, 1}]      1 Question how do you get the equations of the lines that are being plotted? So say on x from 0 to 1 what is the equation of the line. 2 How do solve the same problem but using a substitution of u=dy/dx?               u''[x] + y[x]^2 u'[x] - u[x] == 0, u[0] == 0, u'[1] == 1      and we need to integrate to get the y value, not sure how to set that as a BC as well. Thank you
