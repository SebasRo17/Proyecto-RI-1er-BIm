I am implementing the Douglas, Peucker's Line Simplification algorithm in Python. I started with this implementation. However, it fails to run in Python due to Maximum Recursion Depth being hit. How can I convert this algorithm to a iterative one? I am not able to imagine this problem in an iterative view. My expectation is to get approach/hint which can be used rather than actual code. Is it possible to use some internal stack to resolve the stack overflow (or avoid the maximum recursion depth)? **Update:** Found the iterative implementation of the algorithm here.
