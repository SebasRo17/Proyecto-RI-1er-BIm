[EDIT 2.0 ]Hello everyone. This is my second phone interview for a development internship. My very first one was okay, but I didn't get my dream internship. Now, I'm facing fears about this upcoming interview. My fears include the following:   1. I'm 19 years old. The thought of 2 lead developers interviewing me makes me think that I'll know so little of what they'd want me to know. Like they will expect so much.   2. I'm a junior having these panic attacks that I did not get in the other internship. I have a little voice saying "You didn't get the other one. What makes you think you'll get this one?".   3. I'm scared that I'll freeze up, forget everything I know, and stutter like an idiot. I'm still traumatized by the last one, because I really really wanted that internship, and I even studied very hard for it. When I was in the interview, I was so nervous I couldn't think clearly. As a result, I didn't do as well as I know I could have. The minute I hung up, I even thought of a better solution to the interview question! Any tips for a soon-to-be intern (hopefully!)? Thank you! P.S. I'm preparing by using this guide for phone interviews.
