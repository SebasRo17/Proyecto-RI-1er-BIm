I've been a solo .NET programmer for a small startup for the last 8 years. I've put together some pretty decent software, and I always strived to better myself and conform to best practices, including source control (SVN/TFS). I worked very closely with a team of engineers of other disciplines, but when it came down to the software I was the only one programming. I love the craft of programming and love learning new things to sharpen my tools. In 2 weeks I will be starting a new job in a team of 20 .NET developers. My position will be mid-level, and I will be working under some programmers with incredibly impressive backgrounds. Again, the team aspect of development will be new to me, so I'm looking for some general "new guy" tips that will help me be as effective and easy to get along with as possible from the get-go. Anything goes, including high level tips, and small day-to-day things about communication.
