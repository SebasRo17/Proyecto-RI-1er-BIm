I'm going to the U.S.A. and was wondering how I can get a job there. I've been a developer for 3 years. Well, I've been working on big projects like the core banking system of one of the biggest banks of the country and I'm quiet good at programming and problem solving skills in general. But unfortunately these projects were developed using VB6 and I haven't been able to update my skills. I have a background in C# but I'm not proficient in it. So VB6 is the only language that I'm good enough to get a job. And I'm pretty sure that's not gonna help me to find a job in the US. So how Should I update my skills to be qualified for a windows application developer? Should I go to college or something like that? I'm in a bad situation and I have no idea what to do. Any help from you would mean a lot to me and is hugely appreciated. Thanks in advance. Edit: Basile, Graham, spaceknarf and tgkprog thanks for sharing your knowledge with me.
