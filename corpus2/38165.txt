I started my career writing C#. However after an year I moved to Java and then after 6 months back to C# where I've been more around 3 years now. I strongly believe that although the basic principles do not change and are reapplied learning a new stack (and the supporting frameworks) is always a big investment. How often have you switched stacks in your career? Has it ever hurt your career progress? Do you like working with people who have worked on multiple stacks but have lesser knowledge of the respective stacks or with people who have worked on a single stack and have a deeper understanding of the ins and outs of it?
