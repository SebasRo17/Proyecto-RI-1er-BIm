I am trying to get CUDALink working on my laptop. I am running Crunchbang "waldorf" which is based on Debian 7 "wheezy". I am a linux novice. The issue is that Mathematica can "see" the nVidia drivers, but yet I am not able to get CUDALink to work. I have searched, and read over the article CUDALink not working on Linux-64 and Asus GTX460 which is close to my issue but doesn't seem to cover it, and where it does shed some light I don't appear to have any of the directories mentioned. I have engaged the Crunchbang linux forums to no avail.. I would really like to get CUDALink working.. I have tried information such as on this website http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic- research/graham/cuda5-debian-wheezy/ but it ruined my video driver setup and I was forced to go through the smxi script again and re-install to get the GUI back. At the moment I am re-downloading the cuda_5.5.22_linux_64.run file from nVidia. I have tried installing the nVidia CUDA binaries from the debian package manager but it ruins my system every time, forcing me to use the smxi script to repair. Otherwise, Mathematica 9 is running wonderfully. If someone can please illustrate the process of setting up CUDA/CUDALink I would greatly appreciate it. Cheers! Will EDIT: I have installed CUDA 5.5 from the above package and have run deviceQuery, with positive results. It detects the card and all fields are nominal, referencing the nVidia website for the 3100m. EDIT 2: It was discovered from https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mathematica that the x64 version of Mathematica is "hard wired" to look for drivers in the /usr/lib64 and not in /usr/lib where things are installed in an x64 native system. Since making a symbolic link using "ln -s /usr/lib /usr/lib64" Mathematica's CUDALink appears to be working now. This question is now closed, but hopefully this can act as community support for others. EDIT 3: As is mentioned in my answer, there is now an issue with CUDALink not running certain functions. It is the same symptoms as this question: CUDALink is not initialized
