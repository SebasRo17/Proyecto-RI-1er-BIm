I hold a Sun SCJP from ten years ago or so. At first it was supposed to be a temporary certification (valid for a few years, I don't remember exactly: all I remember is that I had an expiration date on my certification card) then Sun changed their mind and decided the SCJP was lifetime valid. Another SCJP programmer told me I could change my cert so I contacted Sun (there was a procedure for that that I don't remember either) and received my new SCJP (without any expiration date). Now that Oracle bought Sun I was wondering: can I get somehow a Oracle/Sun SCJP paper/card/badge whatever knowing that I do own a SCJP? If anyone here holding an old SCJP changed it to an Oracle/Sun one (if such a thing exist), I'd be interested to hear what can be done. (btw I'm new here so I cannot create a new tag: maybe someone with more rep could create a Sun tag?)
