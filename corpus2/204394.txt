Often in a table that has no natural key, it is still useful for users to be able to have a uniquely generated identifier. If the table has a surrogate primary key (and in such a case you would certainly expect it to) should that key be exposed to the user or should another field be used for that purpose? One reason not to expose the surrogate key is that now you can't do operations that preserve the relationship between records, but change the key values, such as certain kinds of deletion/re-insertion, many methods of copying data from one database to another, etc. The main advantage of exposing the surrogate key is the simplicity of using a field you have anyway. Under what circumstances is it better to directly expose the surrogate key to users?
