I want to do something when the mouse is clicked. But it shouldn't matter where the mouse is clicked, so I can't use `EventHandler`. Instead, I'm trying to do it like this:               DynamicModule[{i = 0},      WhenEvent[ControllerState["Button 1"], i = i + 1]       i]      `WhenEvent` is not the right function. What I want is a function that will do something when `ControllerState["Button 1"]` switches from `false` to `true`.
