I am writing my first application for Android and will use the SQLite database so will be trying to limit the size as much as possible, but I think the question applies in general to database design. I am planning to store records that will have text and the date of creation. The app is a stand-alone app, i.e. it will not link to the internet and only one user will be updating it, so there is no chance that there will be more than one entry with a given date. Does my table still need an ID column? If so, what are the advantages of using the ID as a record identifier as opposed to the Date?
