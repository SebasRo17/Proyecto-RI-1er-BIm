I have an idea that would require triggering a call or text message simply by pressing or dialing a certain number. Example: Pressing 2324 on the pin code. Despite it not being your pin code to unlock the device, my application (always running in the back) would detect your code "2324" has been typed in and send a call or text message. Another Example: Holding volume button for 5 seconds and then pressing "2" on pin code lock. This could be another trigger. My question is, how flexible are the iOS and Android SDK's to allow this level of customization? Can I override tone settings via an application (change from Silent to Normal)? Can I close applications? What can't I do? I tried researching this but have not come up with any recent or updated answer. Hoping someone could clarify what I can't/can do with Iphone and Android SDK's.
