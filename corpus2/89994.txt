I was struck by the heading > Tired of querying in antiquated SQL? on http://www.linqpad.net/. I am a N-Tier application developer and learnt my trade in a company that worked with a lot of data, so became fluent with SQL, but mostly for DALs. My finac√©e is a SQL developer so I've had an exposure of the SS/SSAS/SSRS/SSIS suite too. Other than the LinqPad team writing antiquated SQL themselves, or only using PROCs for application DALs rather then data heavy tasks, I can't think why the the LinqPad team think SQL is antiquated?
