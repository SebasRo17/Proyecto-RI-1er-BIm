Not sure if posted before, but I'm asking this question from a _Mathematica_ fellow user who tried to load expressions, whose problem soon turned into a prison break game featuring the following code.               SetAttributes[hold, HoldAllComplete];     GetOut /: hold[GetOut] := Unset[$Pre];          $Pre = hold;      After executing this code, all subsequent evaluations are hold, including the GetOut "key" and the reset expression.               GetOut     $Pre = .      Are there any ways to unhold subsequent evaluations, in addition to rebooting _Mathematica_?
