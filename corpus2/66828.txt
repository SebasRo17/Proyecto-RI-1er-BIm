I think most programmers prefer to work solo on projects, even when it's not feasible. I prefer to work alone, even outside of programming projects. When working with other developers, I typically find that   * I don't like their formatting or conventions (such as variable or method names)   * I don't have a good understanding of how the code they wrote works, which I would have if I wrote it myself   * I think there is a better or more efficient way to implement something they wrote What are the best ways to overcome these issues and any other similar team issues for a project with 4-5 programmers?
