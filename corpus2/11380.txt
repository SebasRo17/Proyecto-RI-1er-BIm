I'd like to know if it is possible to use `NestList` on a regular function of several arguments, such as:               fc[x_, y_] := {x + y, x - y};     res = NestList[ fc[x,y], {100, 75}, 50]      I just started learning _Mathematica_ at my university, read about pure functions, but from the homework's text it doesn't look like I should use that. Roughly translated, it would be " _Define a function of 2 arguments (...) and apply`NestList` on this function._"
