I want to export a plot into an eps file. Below I present a sample plot code in order to demonstrate the two issues that appear. (1). `LabelStyle`: When I use "Times" or "Helvetica" style all seem to work fine. However, when I choose "Traditional" or "Tahoma" the style of the labels in the exported eps file is horribly deformed. This happens regardless the procedure I use; using the `Export` command or choosing the plot and then form `File -> Save Selection As ...` (2). Capital Greek letters: I use the capital Greek letter `Theta` for the label of the y-axis. However, I discovered that many capital Greek letters are also deformed in the exported eps or pdf file. Many thanks in advance and I look forward for your replies and comments               S1 = Plot[Exp[-x]*Sin[7*x], {x, 0, 5}, Axes -> False, Frame -> True,       FrameLabel -> {"x", "Î˜(x)"}, RotateLabel -> False, PlotStyle -> Red,       LabelStyle -> Directive[FontSize -> 17, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],       PlotRange -> All, ImageSize -> 500]           Export["Plot.eps", S1]      * * * Thank you very much for all your replies and I am really very sorry for not responding sooner. I am using the latest version 9.0 of Mathematica in Windows XP SP3. However, the same issues appear in older versions (8,7, ... , 4) which are also installed in my PC. Therefore, I suppose that the version is irrelevant. Below I present three exports using different format (eps, pdf and jpg). I used "Tahoma" style. First the .jpg output. All seems to be OK. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/k4gh5.jpg) Then the .pdf output. Well, the Greek capital letter Theta is deformed. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zLfGE.png) And finally, the .eps output loaded in GSView 5.0. Here, not only the Greek letter but also the axis labels are deformed. However, if I convert the exported .eps file to .pdf with Adobe the axis labels are becoming normal as Fig. 2 but still the Greek letter is deformed. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3RHyC.png) If I am correct, I encounter an issue regarding fonts. So, I would be very grateful if you could suggest me some solutions to my problem.
