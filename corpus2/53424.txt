I'm nearing the end of my education and in preparation for getting into the work place I thought it might be good to study up on some hot topics in the CS field. I've heard of things like Net Neutrality and Computer Human Interaction and others but never really until now spent much time studying these kinds of things in depth. I was hoping to get some input so I can focus on things that are more useful/practical in the field. Also as a side note what would be some good certifications to pursue that would really open up job opportunities. Just a little background in case its important: I have work experience as a webmaster and currently would like to pursue embedded programming or network programming of some sort.
