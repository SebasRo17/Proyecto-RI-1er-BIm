As the title states I would like to dynamically show `::usage` on several functions. Let's consider two functions here:               funlist={Plot,Plot3D};      Thus I do:               Input[       Panel[        PopupMenu[Dynamic@whichfun, funlist], "usage should be here"],        Dynamic@whichfun]      Instead of `"usage should be here"` I obviously tried `(Dynamic@whichfun)::usage` but it's complaining that the `Head` is not a `Symbol`, so I tried to convert it to a `Symbol` but it still fails. Thus the question is: How can I convert `Dynamic@whichfun` in order to be able to have its `usage`?
