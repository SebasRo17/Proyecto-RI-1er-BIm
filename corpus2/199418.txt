Firstly, apologizes for any bad terminology, lack of research, or poor delivery of my question. I should note that originally I had one big question, but I figured the first half is sort of independent, so I've posted it individually, link. My understanding of "commercial purposes" is so far based on the OP of that question. So basically my next piece of work will be the first to be involved in a commercial purpose, so I want to learn how to make appropriate technology choices that puts me on the safe side of legal concerns, **let's take Java for a case example** :   1. I will assume that the only thing I need to worry about is the licensing of JDK.   2. It seems that the license for JDK is this one, which seems to not put any commercial concerns except for contents of table 1-1 from this link, which are stuff I never heard about, and probably won't cross.   3. From #2, and from various implications that JDK mainly adheres to GPL, and from what I understood from GPL, it seems Java is in the green when it comes to commercial purposes, provided the owner of the executable has also ownership of the corresponding source code. **Q1:** So, are my previous conclusions correct? **Q2:** The research process was really exhausting from my end, are there some key elements to pursue when checking these stuff? or are there online resources/communities that already did most of this verification research? Forward thanks.
