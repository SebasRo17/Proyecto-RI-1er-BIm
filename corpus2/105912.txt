Is it possible to alter the code of the Chili plugin, which had its latest release on July 2008, and it is licensed under the MIT license, to then license it under GPL? As far I can see, there is no restriction about the new code being licensed under the same license. Is it really so, or is there a minimum number of changes? In my case, I would change the jQuery plugin in normal Javascript code that is executed in a CMS. This essentially means that, among other things:   * The code will not use the "ChiliBook" namespace.    * The function will not be invoked as `$($element).chili()`, but as `GlobalObject.ChiliHighlighter.process($jquery_element)`, where "GlobalObject" is a JavaScript object used from the CMS.   * The code will allow other modules to alter the `GlobalObject.ChiliHighlighter` object to add functions that are optionally called from `GlobalObject.ChiliHighlighter.process()` when they are defined. As alternative, as the repository I am using allows me to include code not licensed under GPL 2 or higher license when the code is not maintained anymore, could the plugin be considered not maintained anymore, as its last version was released three years ago?
