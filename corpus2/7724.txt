So I wanted to create a Histogram with a custom number of bins. Luckily there is a simple function for this in the form of `Histogram[data, n]` where n specifies the number of bins. There is even an example of using it in the documentation:               data = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 200];     Histogram[data, 5]      Problem is that this doesn't produce a Histogram with five bins but with seven bins: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sa0Ky.png) `Histogram[data, 6]`still gives seven bins: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Iv6Ka.png) `Histogram[data, 7]` also gives seven bins: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ptj1t.png) But `Histogram[data, 10]` gives thirteen bins: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TMs7c.png) Now I am utterly confused. Is this a bug or have I misunderstood something completely? How would I go about producing a Histogram with five bins?
