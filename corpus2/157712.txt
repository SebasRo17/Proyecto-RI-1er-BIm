I am working on a uDig application. I have been trying to figure out how to modify the open-save-close life cycle of the MapEditor class created by uDig. The reason being I want to make sure that the asterisk does not display denoting a "dirty" editor, avoid the pop-up box that asks the user if they want to save the current map, and avoid having the old map open up again when the user starts the application up again. Any thoughts on how to accomplish this. Does anyone have any experience modifying the life cycle of an editorPart in Eclipse, particularly the uDig MapEditor? Thanks!
