I have an array of $(x,y,z)$ triples (array dimensions: N x 3), from which I can make a 2D scatterplot of $(x,y)$ values:               t = Table[{Sin[i], Cos[i], i}, {i, 0, 2 \[Pi], N[\[Pi]/20]}];     ListPlot[t[[All, 1 ;; 2]]]      Now, I want to color each point according to its $z$ value. I can find how to do so by creating a series of `Disk`s and putting them all into a `Graphics`, but then I have to take of absolutely all the formatting. Yet, I can't see how to leverage `ListPlot` options, such as `ColorFunction`, to achieve my goal. What would you suggest?
