`HistogramList` returns a list of bin boundaries and a list of counts. There is one more boundary than counts, and I'd like to pair them up so I can feed it into `ListLinePlot` and get an alternative view of a histogram. Here's some code that will do this:               {bins, counts} = N[HistogramList[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[5, 2], 100]]]          (* => {{0., 2., 4., 6., 8., 10.}, {13., 19., 37., 28., 3.}} *)          points = Transpose[{Riffle[bins, bins], Flatten[{0, Riffle[counts, counts], 0}]}]          (* => {{0., 0}, {0., 13.}, {2., 13.}, {2., 19.}, {4., 19.}, {4., 37.}, {6., 37.},             {6., 28.}, {8., 28.}, {8., 3.}, {10., 3.}, {10., 0}} *)      Note that it also adds in some zeros to bring the resulting curve down to the axis:               ListLinePlot[points]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cEF8v.png) Is there a simpler and/or more intuitive way of achieving this behavior?
