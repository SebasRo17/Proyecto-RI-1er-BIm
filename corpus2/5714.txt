I want to make a 2D plot where the x-axis is flipped so the higher numbers are on the right and lower numbers are on the left. I've managed to do it by flipping the data and making new `Ticks` but this solution is manually and requires manipulating the data. I was hoping there was a better way. For the normal plot:               data = Table[{x, x^2}, {x, 20, 100}];     ListLinePlot[data]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dLsT8.png) And for the flipped data and the new plot:               data = Table[{100 - x + 20, x^2}, {x, 20, 100}];     ticks = Table[{x, 100 - x + 20}, {x, 20, 100, 10}]     ListLinePlot[data, Ticks -> {ticks, Automatic}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJdWT.png) I couldn't seem to find any options like `ReverseAxis`.
