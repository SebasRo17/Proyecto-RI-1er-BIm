Let's say I wanted to start an open source project that I hope/expect to have many people submit patches and whatnot. Is it viable to take a strict TDD approach? Can/should I expect/trust collaborators to write quality tests whenever they submit a patch? One thing I've been thinking about is writing test suites for individual bug reports and feature requests and requiring that all patches/pull requests make the tests pass, but at that point it seems like it would be better just to write the feature/bugfix myself. As far as I can tell, most of the major open source projects that use TDD (or at least write tests) seem to be mostly written purely by an individual or team, where it's easy to enforce practices such as TDD.
