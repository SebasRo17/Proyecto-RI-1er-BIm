So obviously NASA need programmers to develop applications for them, be it VOIP applications, applications for control of machines and AI, etc. But in what language do they actually use for this? I'm 15 and plan on studying Software Engineering in University and my dream job is to program for NASA, astronomy is a huge hobby of mine. I have a need to learn things before I am of the "recommended" age, for example I have been studying post-grad Astrophysics in my free time. As a result of this I would like to know what programming language NASA use so I can begin to learn the basics and see if it is something I may enjoy. Please do not say `Live you life as a kid` as I have seen people say such things before, this is how I enjoy to live my life and absolutely love programming. I just feel that, like in many things, if I learn it at a younger age I will have greater experience when I am older - yes I have aspirations like you wouldn't believe (Haha). I am thinking of learning how to program an Arduino, or Engduino as we may be witnessing in my Computer Science classes, but is this at all related to the type of programming NASA do. I understand that NASA will be programming MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more advanced programs than I, but to just get the sense of bringing a inanimate object to life would be an achievement to me. So yeah, what programming language do they use, what would you recommend I study in University to follow up such a dream?
