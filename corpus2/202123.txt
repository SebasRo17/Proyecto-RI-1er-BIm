I have searched and could not find any information about it. What is the best approach to storing revisions? I have a website where the user can write a document which can be fairly long (200-300 lines). How do you determine when to make a revision? Is it not a scalable solution to make a new one whenever the save, because that would be useless to the user when the want to look back, and it would require quite a lot of space. You could use time and say for every 15 minute they are working on it there would be a revision, but that would sometimes be nothing or the whole document have completely changed. I could make a diff from the previous revision, and compare by line and look at how many percent of the lines have been changed. What are other doing revisions?
