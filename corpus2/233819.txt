I am playing with dependency injection, but i am not sure I am doing it right. Especially, I am not sure what should be the correct way to build classes with injected dependencies. Say I have a class A that creates class B. Class B depends on class C and class C depends on class D. Who should be responsible for creating class D?   1. It could be class A. However, in a large system, class A might end up creating and assembling a very large number of objects.   2. A separate builder class that will create D, C and B. A will use this builder class.   3. Some other option. In addition, I read a lot about DI containers. However, it seems that there are no major frameworks for C++. Also, if I understand correctly, DI can be performed well even without containers. Am I correct?
