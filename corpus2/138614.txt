I am developing a software system (Patient Administration System) and I have noticed it already had 451 lines of code(in one namespace). Is this bad? Or does the number of lines of code not matter as long as the methods and comments are useful and they doing what they are intended to do? Or there is a number of lines of code to maintain like a namespace should only have 500 lines of code something like that
