I am starting to write a thesis for which I want to use MMA for all my plotting needs, mostly because a lot of the basic analysis has been done there. To ensure that I am applying styles consistently (plot colors, image size, label size, etc.), I need a method which I can use across multiple files. There are several types of plots that I will need:   1. `ListPlot` / `Plot`   2. `ListDensityPlot` / `DensityPlot`   3. `ListContourPlot` / `ContourPlot` I can think of several way of doing this:   1. Define my own functions `thPlot`, `thListPlot`, etc which have my default styles applied   2. Define my own style options into a variable, and use some combination of `FilterRules` and `Options` to make sure that options from that variable are applied to the right type of plot   3. Set default options using `Default` for the different types of plots. I am assuming that each of my datasets (which may have one or more plots) will be self-contained mathematica files that I can re-run. So, if I decide to change the style in some central location (via one of the methods above) I can re-run the MMA files and get the plots in the new style. What have people done in the past?
