I have a web crawler, and I'm looking for hints that will help me automatically detect a website country of origin. And by country of origin I generally mean the country the website is targeting. For example:   * http://www.spiegel.de/ -> Germany   * http://www.lemonde.fr/ -> France   * http://publico.pt/ -> Portugal   * http://www.elpais.es/ -> Spain I know there's not a foolproof way of doing it, so I will likely rely on a scoring system.   * The domain name;   * The content language;   * The server's IP address;   * `Whois` information; What additional parameters would you use? For the previous examples a combination of domain and content language will do, but many websites have a `.com` domain and a language spoken in more than one country...
