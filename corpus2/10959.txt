I am not sure how to explain it, but whenever I compute something in _Mathematica_ , the output always spits back the result in a _Mathematica_ language as opposed to easy-to-read equations. It's troublesome if my answer contains multiplies of parentheses and if my matrix is large. Is there a way to make _Mathematica_ display answers in "$\LaTeX$" form? So for instance, if i compute               RowReduce[{{1, 0}, {0, 1}}]      How do I make it spit out a square matrix instead of giving me back `{{1, 0}, {0, 1}}`?
