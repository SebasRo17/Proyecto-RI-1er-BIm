I recently came across this video: Mathematically correct breakfast, which shows how a bagel can be neatly sliced into two identical linked halves. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YpMqNm.jpg) I'd like to try this with Mathematica. Here's a ~~torus~~ bagel and a ~~Möbius strip~~ cut overlaid. How can I slice the bagel along this cut to create the two halves and pry it open?               With[{opts = {Mesh -> False, Boxed -> False, Axes -> False}},          bagel = ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[t] (3 + Cos[u]), Sin[t] (3 + Cos[u]), Sin[u]},              {t, 0, 2 Pi}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, opts,              PlotStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.3], FaceForm[Orange], Lighting -> "Neutral"]];          cut = ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[t] (3 + r Cos[t/2]), Sin[t] (3 + r Cos[t/2]), r Sin[t/2]},              {r, -1, 1}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}, opts,              PlotStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.9], FaceForm[Gray], Lighting -> "Neutral"]];     ]     bagel ~Show~ cut      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yf6Om.png) Although I've used a Möbius strip for the cut, I have a feeling it is a 2-twist strip because of the two sides — I haven't been able to fit this correctly inside a torus...
