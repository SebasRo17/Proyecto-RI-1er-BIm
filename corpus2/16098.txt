Is there an obvious way to force Mathematica to separately integrate the terms in a sum? According to the docs, > When part of a sum cannot be integrated explicitly, the whole sum will stay > unintegrated. But I want to do this because some of the terms have a nice closed form, and some don't, but I want to compute the former. Here's what I've done; it works, but it seems inelegant:               integrand = m^2 + mp^2 + mp f[mp] (* the actual integrand is much more complicated! *)          (myint[integrand // Expand]          //.  myint[a_ + b_] :> myint[a] + myint[b]         //.  myint[i_] :> Integrate[i, {mp, -1, 1}]) // FullSimplify      Which gives the correct               2/3 +  2*m^2 + Integrate[mp*f[mp], {mp, -1, 1}]
