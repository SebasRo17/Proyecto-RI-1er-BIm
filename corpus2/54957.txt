I am experiencing an error attempting to save a modified Notebook in _Mathematica_ 10 under Windows. The error I get is: > >     Could not access the directory X:\Docs\\Mathematica. You should check > that directory's permissions. >   Note the doubled `\\\`. The correct path is `X:\Docs\Mathematica`. `NotebookDirectory[]` returns the correct (escaped) path:               NotebookDirectory[]      > >     "X:\\Docs\\Mathematica\\" >   **_Correction** : This is happening with multiple (all?) Notebooks in this path in the current session._ Has anyone else experienced this error? How can I determine its cause and seek a solution?
