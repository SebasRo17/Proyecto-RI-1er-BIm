I've been reading various techniques for splitting large user stories in helpful ways, such as by user workflow through the system etc. What I'm struggling with is how to word these smaller stories if all they achieve is facilitating the next step in the process and not delivering the application's main benefit to the user. For example, if my new system is split down into 3 smaller stories along the lines of;   1. Create a new account online   2. Create certain entities against my new online account   3. Have my mobile device query these entities against my account and act on them The system only really provides useful functionality to the end user when all stories are complete. So if following the traditional "As a [User] I would like [Functionality] so I can [Benefit]" The benefit of the first and second story is simply facilitating subsequent stories and not really providing the user with the main piece of functionality (the epic). Is this the correct way to do this?
