I want to create a service where people can upload files. However, since file storage costs money, I want to compress the files so they take less space. I would want to write my own compression algorithm, however, PHP doesn't have good ways to handle binary data (which is needed for many compression algorithms). So I wondered, what would be a better language to create such a website in? I have knowledge of PHP (and Javascript, HTML and CSS) but no experience with other things like Ruby, Perl, Python, and other web development languages.
