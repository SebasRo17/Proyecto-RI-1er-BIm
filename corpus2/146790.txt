I'm using jQuery, jQueryUi and qTip in my web application alongside custom JavaScript I've written. All three of the JavaScript libraries I mentioned above are licensed under the MIT license. From what I've read, I just need to include a copy of the MIT license for each of those libraries in my web application. Is it OK to put each license as a separate file underneath a "licenses" directory of my project? So, I would have a licenses directory with "jQuery- MIT-LICENSE.txt", "jQueryUi-MIT-LICENSE.txt" and "qTip-MIT-LICENSE.txt" in it. Or, do I need to put the licenses right at the top of the JavaScript files? Confused about where exactly these licenses need to be put in my web application... What I'm ultimately looking to do is combine all of the JavaScript files into one minified version for faster loading and I want to put the licenses in whatever is the proper place...
