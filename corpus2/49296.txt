I am trying to solve $dx/dt=\sqrt{1+(ix)^{1.8}}$ for initial condition $x[0] =-0.9877 + i 0.1563$, where $x$ is a complex variable. I would like to plot the imaginary part of the solution versus the real part. I used `NDSolve` and `ParametricPlot`.               s1 =        NDSolve[{x'[t] == (1 + (I x[t])^1.8)^0.5, x[0] == -0.9877 + I 0.1563}, x[t], {t, 0, 10},          Method -> "ExplicitMidpoint", "StartingStepSize" -> 1/1000];          ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{Re[x[t]], Im[x[t]]} /. s1], {t, 0, 10},        PlotRange -> Full, AspectRatio -> 1]      The result is wrong. I expect some kind of spiral. I think the problem is due to the fact that the graph crosses the branch cut which emanating from the origin. How can I fix it? P.S.: I expect something like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G3C0X.png)
