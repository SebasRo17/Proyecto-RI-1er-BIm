Take something like:               Manipulate[N[Pi]*s, {{s, 5}, 0, 10}]      This results in the following: ![The <code>+</code> sign has not been clicked](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CNMkC.jpg) What I would really like is the following: ![The <code>+</code> sign has been clicked](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hpH4A.jpg) Is there any way to make this happen by default? In other words, is there a flag I can set so that the little `+` sign is clicked by default?
