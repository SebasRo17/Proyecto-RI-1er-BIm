I'm attempted to use `MapThread` to draw a series of circles at coordinates correspond to some list, like so:               pointList = {{1, 0}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}};     Graphics[MapThread[{Circle[#1, 0.1]} &, pointList]];      However, this fails. Looking at the output for:               MapThread[{Circle[#1, 0.1]} &, pointList]      I see the following:               out -> {{Circle[1, 0.1]}, {Circle[0, 0.1]}}      MapThread is obviously not doing what I'd like it to do. Where's my error?
