I did a look around and couldn't find a question that addresses my case, so I figured I would post. I have a situation where as a new team, we ran into 2 unforseen spikes (is there a better term?) during a sprint. We 'thought' we knew, but then we had to research mid way, so this introduced a spike. My questions are:   * If we have an outage/process issue (Jenkins craps out, requires 8 hours of debugging / setup by a dev or more), is this a spike or somethine else? Do I create a spike, throw it into Sprint (mid sprint), do I then subtract hours from overall sprint (8hr spike = minus 8hrs of planned tasks?) or just end up with undelivered items for next sprint?   * If I had an estimate of 8 hours for something, then the devs find, in fact they need to research more, do I have a spike there too? remove task times? etc; I want to make sure I have a better hand at planning out these 'unforeseen' events, and have a good idea of deliverables for the sprint. I'm looking at this from a purely Project Management perspective where I need to report up the chain on progress / burndown of tasks / deliverables.
