From the essay _Programming Languages Explained_ by Paul Graham, published in _Hackers & Painters_: > The high-level language that you feed the compiler is also known as _source > code_ , and the machine language translation it generates is called _object > code_. From the Wikipedia article on object code: > Object code, or sometimes object module, is what a computer compiler > produces. From a definition of 'compiler': > Traditionally, the output of the compilation has been called object code or > sometimes an object module. (Note that the term "object" here is not related > to object-oriented programming.) So what _is_ the term object related to?
