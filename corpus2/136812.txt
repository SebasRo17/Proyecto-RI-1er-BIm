I don't know if it's the right place to post this question but, to improve my productivity I need to install an open source issue-tracking system to keep tracks of all bugs and information about the completion. There are a lot of open source systems to do that but I'm looking for one which could be hosted on PHP / MySql / Linux server and, in particular allows to raise a ticket via rest or soap from my Spring webapp (I thought to create a simple form in my webApp to submit a ticket). I took a look to The Bug Genie, Mantis and WebIssues and the first two are very hard to be used by non IT user. WebIssues seems to be very easy also for my customers that just need to take a look to the ticket resolution status. Any tips? * * * Note I prefer to install my own system in order to pay only one hosting service.
