**Context** I would like to use the _Mathematica_ front end to pre-process expressions before exporting them to LateX, for the sake of readability. **Example** Say I have this expression                  (16*((-3 + r^2)*BesselI[0, r^2/8]^2 - ((-48 + 16*r^2 + r^4)*BesselI[0, r^2/8]*        BesselI[1, r^2/8])/r^2 +         15*BesselI[1, r^2/8]^2)*Cos[2*\[Theta]])/(3*Sqrt[3]*E^(r^2/4))      which looks like this in _Mathematica_ ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uriYq.png) Once I edit it by hand within _Mathematica_ , it might look like this: (notice that its more publishable in that form) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/05BZq.png) (This is a great feature of the Front-End by the way!). If I then select the expression and choose the export to latex menu, _Mathematica_ exports the original (unedited) equation. **Question** How do I tell _Mathematica_ to mind its own business and export to LaTeX the result of my edit, not its re-processing of it? **EDIT** Following the suggestion of @Nasser, I tried ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fzLvV.png) So it does not really preserve the original expression?
