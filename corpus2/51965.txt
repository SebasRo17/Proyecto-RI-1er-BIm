A multivariate Gaussian distribution for $k$ dimensions looks like this: $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^k|\mathbf \Sigma|}}\mathbf e^{ -\frac 1 2 \mathbf x^T \mathbf \Sigma^{-1}\mathbf x }$$ $\mathbf x$ is a $k$-dimensional vector, and $\mathbf \Sigma$ a $k$ by $k$ symmetric positive definite matrix. Now I want Mathematica to integrate this expression over all $\mathbf x$, the result should be 1. How can I do this? Nothing else is known, in particular we don't know the number of dimensions.
