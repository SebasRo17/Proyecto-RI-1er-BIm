> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Composition of mappings not working as expected I am new to _Mathematica_ and I am having trouble defining a certain composition of functions. Let `m1` and `m2` be maps such that $m_1: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ and $m_2: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ where $\mathbb{R}$ is the real line               m1[eta_, zeta_] = {eta^3, zeta^3}      m2[x_, y_] = x^2 + y^2          m3[eta_, zeta_]  = Composition[m2, m1][eta, zeta]      On evaluating the last line, I get the output               (* m2[{eta^3, zeta^3}] *)      But the anwer to this should be `m3[eta,zeta]=eta^6 + zeta^6` How can I do this?
