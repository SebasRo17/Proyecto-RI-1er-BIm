A previous Agile discussion here had good answers specifying what is **critical** to the success of implementing Agile methodology in software development. Most of the points were the typical organizational and management challenges, but one point worries me and it is that the client must be involved throughout the process. The client is the one thing that you cannot control realistically, perhaps your business model gears you to government contracted work for instance where an intensely strict contract obligates the company to:   * Provide X features exactly as requested   * Feature requests will be thrown over a wall, don't bother us we don't want to hear it.   * There is no concept of feature priority in the customer's mind, _they are all important or we wouldn't have asked for them._   * The project will cost no more and no less than Y regardless of overruns or deadlines.   * Absolute, strict, final and non-negotiable deadline for complete delivery of all work. We have never worked with such a client before but the money on the project is just too good to pass up. We need this work. I came here and worked **HARD** to change processes within to move towards Agile development and here I don't know how to reconcile where this project fits into our new process. I have never before had the luxury of open-minded hands-off management that trusted me to lead the development team and processes down this path and now that we are here I can't honestly tell myself that this project will truly be done in an Agile way. I feel like management trusted me to lead this path and that I let them down because this situation we are in now so clearly calls for Waterfall. I am afraid that I might lose their trust if I backtrack now. Other answers like the one here say Agile is impossible with this kind of client, do you agree? Have any of you been in a similar situation and made it work? What strategies did you implement to make Agile happen successfully?
