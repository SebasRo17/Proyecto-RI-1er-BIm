I'd like to use the Drawing Tools palette to draw objects in CMYK colour. The only way I seem able to change the colours of these objects is to use the window shown below. ### Edit Is there a way to change the colours of objects made with Drawing Tools that will allow me to enter the C, M, Y, K values into input fields? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dwtwF.png)
