I'm somewhat of a novice to CSS. Anyway, I noticed that an extremely common method used in CSS is to have negative or off-screen positioning, whether it be to hide text or preload images or what have you. Even on SE sites, like StackOverflow and this website, have               #hlogo a { text-indent: -999999em }       set in their CSS. So I guess I have a few questions.   * is this valid CSS? or is it just a "hack"?   * are there downsides to doing things this way?   * why is this so common? aren't there better ways to hide content?
