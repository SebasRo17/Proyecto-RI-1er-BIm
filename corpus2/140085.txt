Our customer wants us to write a custom application for him that he can use on a handful of iPads in his company. This application is probably only useful for this one customer (maybe for two or three more in the future, but only after additional customization). I read that if the customer subscribes to Apple's Volume Purchasing Program, we are able to provide him with a custom B2B application. This, however, seems to be restricted to US developers (or customers? or both?). What are the alternatives for Europe-based (or, more generally, non-US) software developers and their local customers?
