I am using Linux (CentOS, Gnome 3.8.4) and I suspect this is an OS dependent problem. When I input some text, and use mouse to select the text as follows: First press the mouse left button, keep holding the button while move the mouse to select something, and do not release the button for about 5 seconds (i.e. typical selection process, only hold the button for longer time). Then a window jumps out: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zs2fm.png) I have to press `wait` (if I press `Esc`, Mathematica is killed, without asking me to save anything). I am not sure if it is a bug of Mathematica, or the Linux Gnome side. When using KDE there is no such problem. EDIT: (1) Sounds like my expression is not clear :) Here is screencast: http://youtu.be/YX3hXTfE1aI Note that after selecting the letter a, I didn't release the mouse button. (2) In Mathematica 9, there is no such problem.
