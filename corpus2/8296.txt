I am trying to make a visual representation of the curve $y=x^{2}$, with $x\in\left[0,1\right]$ in the vector field defined by $\vec{F}=\left[-y,x\right]$. However, as far as I can tell there does not seem to be any facility which allows me to do this in Mathematica (I've looked through as much of the documentation as I could find which seemed pertinent). I know how to do each of these separately, e.g.               Plot[x^2,{x,0,1}]     VectorPlot[{-y,x},{x,-3,3},{y,-3,3}]      However, I am unsure how I can combine these two plots (or plot them both at the same time). Thanks in advance!
