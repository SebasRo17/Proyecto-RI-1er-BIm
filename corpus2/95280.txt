In programming languages, when numbers (either integer, or real) are printed out, are they firstly converted to the codes of the readable characters that are meant to represent the numbers, and then the codes are then decoded into the readable characters? For example, in C, functions such as `printf` can print out the value of an integer variable `a` to screen or files. Suppose the value of `a` is 1. Does `printf` first convert the number `1` to the number `0x31` which is the ASCII code of character `1` and then decode `0x31` to character `1` in its output? Thanks and regards!
