I really need your advice. I'm reading a few articles about TDD in JavaScript but I'm really struggling to understand how to use it in my daily work. For instance I'm currently working on a page that has an accordion and each item of the accordion has dynamic contents populated through a JSON object. The JSON object is provided by a third party. I'm using jQuery. My way of testing so far is called console.log :)   * What kind of tests should I write?    * Does TDD make sense for this kind of application of is meant for something else?  Sorry for the noob question but I'd really appreciate your opinion
