I have a huge list that looks like this:               list = {8, 12, 201, 0.001, 3, 7, 100        (InterpolatingFunction[{{0., 0.0018}},"<>"][2916/35] +         InterpolatingFunction[{{0., 0.0018}}, "<>"][2916/35]),        23, 44, 11, -0.002}      I want to extract only the numbers, specifically the numbers around 10. I tried using this `Select[list, _?(7 <= # <= 13 &)]` but it returns an empty list. I think this happens because the list has both numbers and the `100 (InterpolatingFunction...` that I want to ignore. I would also be happy just to extract ALL numbers hence ignoring the `100(InterpolatingFunction...` elements. Could you give me some tip please?
