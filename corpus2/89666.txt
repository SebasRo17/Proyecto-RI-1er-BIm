I am working as a programmer for last 3 years, recently my company has promoted me as a project manager. Now I am facing resource management issues and I am not comfortable as a manager and I want to continue my profession as a programmer. I have talked to my director to step me back as a programmer but he forced me to continue as a project manager as this is one step ahead from programming. Now suggest me what should I do?
