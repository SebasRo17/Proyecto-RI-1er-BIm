What's the difference between these two ways of specifying dependent packages? **Method 1:**               BeginPackage["foo`bar`", {"xxx`", "yyy`"}]      **Method 2:**               BeginPackage["foo`bar`"]     Needs["xxx`"]     Needs["yyy`"]      Do they always have the same effect? Note that these packages may be used in a big collection of packages which have complex interdependency.
