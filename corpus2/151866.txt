Event Sourcing was popularized by LMAX as a means to provide speed, performance scalability, transparent persistence and transparent live mirroring. Before being rebranded as Event Sourcing, this type of architectural pattern was known as System Prevalence but yet I was never familiar with this pattern before the LMAX team went public. Has this pattern proved itself in numerous production systems and therefore even conservative individuals should feel empowered to embrace this pattern or is event sourcing / system prevalence an exotic pattern that is best left for the fearless?
