It's been a while I have been thinking on what could be the best scenario for creating a secure login in a client-server application running on internet or any other networks ! So I became with the idea to ask this question on programmers and I hope that this question will make awareness of new aspects of threads and security here by some kind of brain storming , I am really interested in good and new anseawres . Thanks in advance for your participation .
