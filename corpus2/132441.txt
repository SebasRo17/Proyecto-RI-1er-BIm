It is critical to know what constitutes "conveying" under LGPL v3. I am considering creating some software based on LGPL v3. The software will be used to run a web application. Now I wonder whether the "conveying" clauses would get activated if I published the modified code on GitHub to the public. I understand that none of you are lawyers so IANAL is implied. I also understand that I could contact the developers of the LGPL software and ask for a different license.
