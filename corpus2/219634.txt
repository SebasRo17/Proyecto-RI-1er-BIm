I want to make a synchronization. What's the algorithm for it in a nutshell? 1) A client reads a local data and sends them to a server **afterwards**. The server compares them with its actual data, decides what are newer and overwrites its data with received data in case received data is newer. or 2) A client reads data from the server **first** , compares them with its local data and in case data from the server is newer, overrwrites them with the server data. And does the order matter?
