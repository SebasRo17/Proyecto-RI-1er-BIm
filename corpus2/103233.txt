Quite simple, why would I want to write code that works for all cases and scalable data when all I need to do is repeat the same process a few times with a few minor tweaks? I'm unlikely to need to edit this again any time soon. It looks like a lot of less work to just go...               function doStuff1(){/*.a.*/}     function doStuff2(){/*.b.*/}     function doStuff3(){/*.c.*/}      And if I ever need to add something...               function doStuff4(){/*.d.*/}      And if I need to remove it, I remove it. It's harder to figure out how to make all of those into one straight-forward pattern that I can just feed data into and deal with all the cases, and make a bunch of changes I don't feel like I'm ever going to have to do. Why be DRY when it looks like a quick cut+paste is going to be so much less work?
