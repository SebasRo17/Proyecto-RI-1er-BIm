I've worked in a team that developed and gave support for SW practices tools. Those tools were written (and will be written) in many programming languages. According to Scrum, a given story, **can be implemented by several team members** (according to what I know). When organized in a team that is oriented to a specific SW domain/framework (.NET for example), this seems possible and even reasonable. But if your team needs to write in _Python, C#, Java etc._ for several tools, some with different orientation (DB/UI), is this possible? How does the "division of labor" should be made in this case? Thanks.
