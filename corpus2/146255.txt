We are in a small company with around 10 developers. I am the team leader and responsible for the development process. Supervisors and salesmen are close to us since we are a small team, but have no clue on how software is developed. When they ask me how much time I want for a change (bugfixes/features) in a product, my response is 'let me calculate it'. After giving them the schedule, they start by saying OK you can do it in XX time which differs a lot from my plan. We are using a model close to Agile basic principles and have circles per week or per three days. Of course I argue and say that this cannot be done. They seem to have no idea on the effort we are doing. They do not want to see `WHY` my schedule is for that amount of time. I know this behavior is stupid, but how can I make them see the problem?
