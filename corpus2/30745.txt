Original domain of my independent variable `t` is 0 to 10 nanometers, but in _Mathematica_ (as in most numerical software), it's good idea to solve differential equation in the more 'usual' unit scale 0 to 10.               pfun = ParametricNDSolveValue[ {x''[           t] + a x'[t] + b^2 x[t] == 0, x[0] == 1,         x'[0] == 0}, x, {t, 0, 10}, {a,b}]      How can I scale back `t` in the resulting `ParametricFunction` to nanometers? Note: With `NDSolve` we used before version 9 (which introduced `ParametricNDSolveValue`), the result was an `InterpolatingFunction`, which was easily scaled back by using               Interpolation[{#*10^(-9), pfun[#]} & /@Range[0, 10, 10^(-1)]]
