I've been trying to find some kind of mathematical computer software to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. The Excel Solver is able to do it, but I've noticed there is a built-in function in _Mathematica_ : > TravelingSalesman[g] finds an optimal traveling salesman tour in graph g. I've been given a matrix which represents the costs of traveling between six cities. I could start typing them in to the `Graph` function and then use the `TravelingSalesman` function to solve it. But I'm too lazy for such work. Is there a way to type in the matrix, convert it to some kind of graph, and then apply the `TravelingSalesman` function directly to the graph? Hope you understand my question! Thanks in advance.
