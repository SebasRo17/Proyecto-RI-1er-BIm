Given a numerical range and a list of used numbers that fall within that range I need to compress the range into blocks of used and unused numbers. For example:               range: 0 to 10     used:  3,4,5,9      I need an output like               0-2: free     3-5: used     6-8: free     9:   used     10:  free      Not sure where to start with this, so any guidance appreciated.
