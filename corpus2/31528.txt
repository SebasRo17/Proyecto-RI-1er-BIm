I am fitting a theoretical equation for a complicated curve to some experimentally measured data. As you might be aware, algorithmically quantifying 'goodness of fit' for a complicated curve is something of a dark art... I want to load the experimental data and display it in a graph, and then over the top have a manipulable plot of the generated curve superimposed, so that I can tweak the parameters by eye until the fit looks good. I can plot the measured data, and I can plot the manipulable curve from theory, but I need them to be plotted on top of each other! I'm having trouble getting it to show the two graphs at once though... is it possible? Many thanks, Ben
