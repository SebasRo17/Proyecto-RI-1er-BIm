how to generate mesh functions according to more than one condition? This plot will have mesh according to z:               Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}, MeshFunctions -> {#3 &}]      This plot will have mesh according to x:               Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}, MeshFunctions -> {#3 &}]      how to generate MeshFunctions with more that one conditions? I want something like this:               Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2},       MeshFunctions -> {#1 || #3 &}]
