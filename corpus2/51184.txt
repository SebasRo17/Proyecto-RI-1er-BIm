I'm trying to understand how `ParallelEvaluate` works, considering the two following snippets:               count = 1;       SetSharedVariable[count];       ParallelEvaluate[count++]        > >     Out[320]= {1, 2, 3} >   Whereas if I do:               count = 1;       SetSharedVariable[count];       ParallelEvaluate[count = count + 1]        > >     Out[329]= {2, 2, 2} >   The output, as seen above, is quite different. The first case is mostly from the docs for SetSharedVariable. My confusion is because in the docs for the increment operator, the statements `k++` and `k = k+1` are mentioned to be the same. Therefore, could someone please explain why the parallel kernels treat the two situations differently?
