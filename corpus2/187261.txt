I have a remote procedure call API where the connection parameters need to be stored somewhere that the API code can access. This API is expected to be used mainly to create web services. I originally planed to store these parameters in a separate xml file, and require users of the API to define the path to that file in code. A coworker has suggested that I should find a way to store these parameters in the web.config file instead. Without a lot of WCF experience, I am under the impression that the web.config file should not be used here, because it contains many settings necessary for a web service or web app to function. I don't want my API to mess with that file. I feel it is too risky. What is your opinion on this? Is web.config an appropriate place for storing settings for my API, or should it be left alone?
