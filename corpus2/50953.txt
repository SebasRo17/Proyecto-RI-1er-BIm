A `HighlightGraph` inside a `Manipulate` initially displays correct however after approximately 2 seconds, the layout changes and the text, links and nodes get displaced. It appears to be caused by the Manipulate cell, after the initially correct display - is again being evaluated after two seconds (judging by the appearance of the darkening of the evaluation indicator right side of the cell). Please find a simplified example and see how components "jump" away from the initial, correct placement. The real problem I experience is on a larger graph and the effect is substantially more dramatic, as nodes are displaced in a manner that the graph becomes illegible. Despite the simplicity of this mock-up, It does show the reevaluation (if that is what it is) after two seconds and the displacement of nodes and text. What is causing this and how can I avoid it, preferable without changing what I am trying to display? To my knowledge, it is only happening when I combine a graph with self-loops and Vertex labelling inside a `Manipulate` wrapped around `HighlightGraph`.               f = {1 <-> 5, 5 <-> 6, 5 <-> 5, 6 <-> 4, 4 <-> 5, 5 <-> 3, 3 <-> 6,           6 <-> 2, 2 <-> 4, 4 <-> 1, 1 <-> 3, 3 <-> 2, 2 <-> 1};     h = Graph[f, VertexLabels -> description, ImagePadding -> 10];     Manipulate[HighlightGraph[h, f[[i]]], {i, 1, 12, 1}]       ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1XVV8.png)
