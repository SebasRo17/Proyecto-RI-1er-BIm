Whenever I try to plot an inequality with "RegionPlot", all my plots come out in boxed frames. Is there a way to plot inequalities where I get my standard x and y axes crossing each other? For example, I am trying to plot $$x^2 - y^2 \leq 1$$ and Mathematica gives me with RegionPlot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zreir.jpg) See how my x and y axes are stuck to the left of the box instead of having them cross at the origin? Anyway around this?
