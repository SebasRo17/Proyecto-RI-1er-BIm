Many questions here about learning new things. But what about `unlearning`? When we used to develop software 10 or 20 years ago very differently, we counted RAM in bytes, libraries were very rare, IDE was an unknown word and Merise was king. **What should we unlearn today? What bad habits we should get rid of?** EDIT: **unlearn** doesn't mean **forget**. Rather to use old techniques that was useful in the past, use the new technologies (such as GC for memory management). But your past knowledge will always be useful today.
