I have multiple sets containing integers. An integer maybe present in one set or multiple sets. I would like to find/match the sets with the most common integers. Example s1 {1, 2, 3, 4} s2 {1, 3, 4, 5} s3 {6, 7, 8, 9} s4 {1, 6, 8, 10} In this case, I would like to "efficiently" group s1+s2 as they have the most overlapping elements (3) followed by s3+s4(2) s1+s4(1). You can do this the brute force way (match all possibilities - then sort) Looking for an efficient way to do this.
