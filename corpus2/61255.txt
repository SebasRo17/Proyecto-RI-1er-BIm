From your real life experience & executed work. How to choose between starting a project as a Phone App or a Web App ? From what I've read, it is a matter of : the need vs time & $ cash to solve it. I am not sure for the long term & with a limited budget what path to take. My main concerns and comparisons : Phone App   * locked in on a given platform   * specific to each device   * specific dev skills needed for each device   * cost of programming    * cost of distributing   * limited distribution channel  Web App   * open platform    * multiple devices friendlier    * overlapping dev skills    * cost of programming    * no distribution cost   * no distribution channel What are your Pros / Cons
