Mathematica includes some custom fonts that allow you to use a wide range of mathematical symbols in output. For example, one can write:               testdata = FoldList[0.99 #1 + #2 &, 0.,       RandomVariate[StableDistribution[1, 1.3, 1, 0, 0.5], 100]]     version1 = ListLinePlot[testdata,       PlotLabel -> "Shocks are StableDistribution, \[Beta]=1"]      The resulting graphic will show a nice beta ($\beta$) in the plot label, and the Mathematica-specific font will embed correctly in a PDF file, for example. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bPXS1.png) That's fine if your target format is PDF, or if the other users of the graphic have the Mathematica fonts installed. But what if you want to include the graphic in a PowerPoint for Windows files, and therefore need to use WMF or EMF format, but you can't guarantee that the viewers of the PowerPoint file have the Mathematica fonts installed? Is there a way to use the ubiquitous Symbol font instead?
