Why can't _Mathematica_ solve $\quad\quad\frac{1-i}{\sqrt{2}}=e^{i \alpha } \tan \left(\frac{\beta }{2}\right)$ with the restrictions $\alpha \in [0, 2 \, \pi)$ and $\beta \in [0,\pi]$:               Solve[(1 - I)/Sqrt[2] == E^(I alpha) *Tan[beta/2] &&  0 <= beta <= π && 0 <= alpha < 2 π]      > Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve. The solution is $\beta=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\alpha=\frac{7 \cdot \pi}{4}$. If I give _Mathematica_ the value for $\beta$,               Solve[((1 - I)/Sqrt[2] == E^(I alpha) *Tan[beta/2] /.        beta -> π/2) && 0 <= beta <= π && 0 <= alpha < 2 π]      I get the solution               (*{{alpha ->  ConditionalExpression[(7 \[Pi])/4, 0 < beta < \[Pi]]}}*)      What is the problem here? I also tried the other functions like `FindRoot`, `Reduce`, etc.
