I was plotting the relative error of the $e^{11/12 -n}n^{n+1/2}$ approximation to $n!$ as $n$ gets larger and larger, and at some very large value of $n$ _Mathematica_ gives this plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8eFU.png) Can somebody explain what exactly the plot means? Of course, I understand that, for larger and larger $n$, the relative error tends to a limit, but I am not sure how to interpret this plot. In particular, I don't understand how the error can show greater variation as $n$ grows large. Thanks. Edit: I want to add that when $n$ is an order of magnitude less what I get is something like this: ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/5zK7i.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BjD6o.png)
