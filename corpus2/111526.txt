I'm a bit of a tool nut and I'll often spend as many as 6-8 hours a week finding new tools, improving my existing tools by writing plugins or adapters or playing around with new tools to see if I like them any better than the ones I have. That's not counting that my official day job is basically tool-chain development for a large company. Should I be spending this much time trying to improve my tool-chain? What should I be focusing on when improving it to maximize my time?
