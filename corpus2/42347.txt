`ReplaceAll` seems not to reach inside `Image`, and I don't see why it shouldn't. Here is an example. Create a black and white image with four pixels:               image = Image[{{1, 0}, {0, 1}}]      The full form of `image` is:               Image[List[List[1.`, 0.`], List[0.`, 1.`]], "Real", Rule[ColorSpace, Automatic], Rule[Interleaving, None]]      The following line switches the pixels as desired:               Image[ImageData[image] /. n_?NumberQ -> 1 - n]      My question is, in the following usage, why doesn't `ReplaceAll` reach inside `Image` and accomplish the same?               image /. n_?NumberQ -> 1 - n
