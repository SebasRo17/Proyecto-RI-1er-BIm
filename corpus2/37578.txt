I would like to combine a dynamic module with a manipulation, whilst maintaining the functionality of both. I have tried things like `Show` and `Epilog -> Inset@...`, but neither seem to work. The code for both dynamic module & manipulation are as follows:               Manipulate[     Plot[x^n, {x, 0, 5}, PlotRange -> {{0, 5}, {0, 5}}, GridLines -> {Range@5, Range@5},      GridLinesStyle -> Directive[GrayLevel[0.8], Dashed], AspectRatio -> Automatic,      PlotStyle -> Thick, Axes -> False, ImageSize -> 200], {n, -3, 3},          DynamicModule[{x = 11}, Grid[Map[Button[ToString@#, x = #, Background ->      Dynamic[If[Divisible[#, x], Green, Red]], ImageSize -> {40, 40}, Appearance ->      "Frameless"] &, RandomInteger[{1, 10}, {5, 5}], {2}], Frame -> All,      FrameStyle -> Dashed, Spacings -> {.2, .2}]]]      produces: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6EFDA.gif) Functionality in the above illustration is preserved, but I would really like one to overlay the other (plot on top 'layer'). I have included the grid on both to show how I would like to align them. I have looked here, and here, to no avail :( _This is a slimmed-down version of a previous (deleted) post - I hope it is a little clearer :)_
