As a software development professional in a fairly conservative large-firm, I always had a much more action-oriented bent, as my job was fairly stable and all that mattered was doing as I was told and completing tasks that were germane to the career of a benevolent dictator (i.e., my boss' boss). Now that I'm no longer working for "the Man", I find it just as important to use the left side of my brain and wrap my head around this whole "vision thing". Which do you think is more important for software product development in a small, yet feisty start-up: Knowing the path or walking (or running) it?
