I am currently attempting to make a Trading Card Game and I have got a whole array of features working already, yet I am stuck now at the portion where one player can attacker another player (more strictly: the monster cards of another player on the field). The game is designed primarely to be played with two players in mind, though having it open for future extensions is never a bad idea. This is the design I have so far, shown as a minimalistic example in pseudo- code:               class Game         private final Player self         private final Player opponent          class Player         private final String name         ...      The game loops over all players and lets them do their turn, which may involve attacking another player. That method has the following structure:               class AttackMonsterAction         private final int monsterIndex         private final int targetMonsterIndex         private final Player targetPlayer              public void performAction(final Player player)      If it is of any relevance, I am coding this in Java. My concrete question is the following: How do I create my class design such that `AttackMonsterAction` called from a certain `Player` object, can reference "the other player"?
