I am keen on organizing a code retreat in my city. It's actually at my home with around 4-5 people. I have read some good inputs here, but I have some questions.   * Should I think of some programming samples/puzzles or should it be a small proto/poc of an idea?   Ex: Creating a twitter client, working with oData, etc.   * Should all the people present there by aware of the programming language being selected? Or is it expected that they'll come there, browse the net and learn and code?   * Should the end result be something that can be showcased/demoed or can it be some piece of code that we can forget about?   * Time duration for the code retreat: Is one day good enough or should I keep it for two days? Will two days become overkill?
