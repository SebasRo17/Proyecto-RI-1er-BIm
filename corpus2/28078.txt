Recently I have read some articles/blogs/comments about the development and history of WPF and Silverlight. In some forums many developers and users criticize the performance of WPF applications (for example Visual Studio 2010). Actually the market share of Silverlight in comparison to Flash is not very high. At PDC 2010 Bob Muglia said something like "our Silverlight strategy and focus going forward has shifted...." and Microsoft wants to push HTML5 in the future. Additionally, Microsoft has announced HTML5 being a core part of the Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 ("Mango") platforms. Recently I have started learning Silverlight and now I must ask myself, if I should continue investing time in learning these (in my opinions) very nice and powerful technologies!? Does they have a future? Does (Windows) desktop (client) applications have a future? Does so called "Rich Internet Applications" have a future? Or will HTML5 become the "absolute truth" in software development? What is your opinion and what do you think?
