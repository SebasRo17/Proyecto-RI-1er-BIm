I have never had an issue with opening a saved notebook before, but recently installed Mathematica 10 and saved my first notebook with it. It's saved as `.nb` and is a small file with dynamical content. I have tried to open the notebook from both the opening prompt that asks for new notebook or open and File, Open... When I try to open the notebook using either method the file never appears to load. On the contrary I tried saving a notebook that did not contain dynamical content, just a test notebook and that loaded just fine.
