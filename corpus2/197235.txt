I started reading some tutorials about OOP, because I want to learn the basics. I have a question about it. I understand how you can have a object "Car" and give it a color like this $oCar->setColor("white"); But there are some things unclear to me. Let's say I have a database with all kinds of cars. What is the best way to create the object "car"? A SQL-query instead the class? And the other question is: how can I output a list of all cars? Do I need to create a object called "Garage" with has only one method within that selects all the cars from the database? Or does this kind of method belong in the "Car" object?
