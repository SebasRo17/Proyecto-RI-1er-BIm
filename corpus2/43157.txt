I have a problem which is mostly neatly described by using Young Tableaux. Mathematica seems to have these Tableaux built in, except that the `Tableaux` function is only in Combinatorica. When I `Needs[Combinatorica]` I get a warning suggesting that I look at the Compatability Guide for Combinatorica, which I can't seem to find. Does anyone have a link, or know if any of the `Tableaux`-related functions are the problematic ones? The Tableaux function itself is hardly documented at all, and its output is quite tough to read. I am hoping there is a nice built-in way to draw the Tableaux in the nice YT in English notation (longest rows on top) [A custom drawing function is in How to insert a function into OptionsPattern? ]. Is there such a function? Finally, can anyone explain what the format of the input to `Tableaux` should be? Here are some examples that work:               In[1]:= Needs["Combinatorica`"]              General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and Permutations functionality has been superseded by      preloaded functionality. The package now being loaded may conflict with this. Please see      the Compatibility Guide for details.          In[2]:= Tableaux[3]     Out[2]= {{{1, 2, 3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1}, {2}, {3}}}          In[3]:= Tableaux[{3}]     Out[3]= {{{1, 2, 3}}}          In[4]:= Tableaux /@ IntegerPartitions[3]     Out[4]= {{{{1, 2, 3}}}, {{{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1,          2}, {3}}}, {{{1}, {2}, {3}}}}      while something like `Tableaux[{1, 2, 3}]` gives errors. Does `Tableaux[integer]` give all possible tableaux with `integer` entries?   Does `Tableaux[{int1, int2, ..., intk}]` give all possible tableaux of `k` rows of length `int1` ... `intk` respectively? This would explain why `Tableaux[{1,2,3}]` throws errors---it would be a malformed tableaux.
