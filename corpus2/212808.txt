Hopefully this is a good question. I am working with a native class that represents a 2D image as a 1D array. If you want to change one pixel, for example, you need to now how to derive the index from the `x,y` coordinates. And I am trying to grok, in abstract terms, how to map a multidimensional object to its underlying unidimensional representation. So, let's say we have a 1D array `array1d` like this:               array1d = [ a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y ]      In the context of our program, `array1d` represents a 2D grid:               a b c d e     f g h i j     k l m n o     p q r s t     u v w x y      And we want to perform operations on `array1d` such as:   * Get the value at `x,y` coordinates (in this example, `1,2` would give `l`)   * Get any sub-grid using `x,y,width,height` (`1,2,2,2` would give `[l, m, q, r]`)   * Set the value at any `x,y` coordinate (etc.) Is there a computer science-related or mathematical term for said operations, which map points/regions in 1D data to coordinates in 2D/3D/4D... objects? If so, what is it? Clearly all computers with displays solve this same issue, so what is this fundamental problem called and how is it conventionally solved?
