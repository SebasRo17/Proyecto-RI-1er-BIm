What is the suggested way (specifically in the open-source world) for the package name when porting a library. Say I am porting someone else's library where they have used a reverse domain name stucture for there package name, so there library package name was some thing like `com.therename.thelib`. What should I do if I decide to port it to a new language? Should I keep the domain name intact, even though they didn't have a hand in it? Or should I change it to something like `com.myname.thelib`?
