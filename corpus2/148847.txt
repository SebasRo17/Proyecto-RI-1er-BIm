I am currently doing my first real project with TDD. I have written tests, and implemented most of the logic for the application. However, there are properties I know I need to have on the UI, however, there is really no way to write a useful test which will cause their creation. For example, a description field. It's the ID that is really cared about in the logic of the application, but the actual description is just carried along from when it's populated and sent to the UI. How would you go about writing a test that is worthwhile, since a new property is literally nothing more than.               public string foo { get;set; }
