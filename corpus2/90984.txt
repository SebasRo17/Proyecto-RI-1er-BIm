While developing in a group atmosphere and adding or modifying features in some code base. Is it considered offensive or impolite to reformat the previous developers code to bring it up to current coding standards? I understand that standards have changed, and will probably continue to change, but would any of you get offended if someone came through and changed your code formatting? To be clear, I'm not talking about changing any logic, just messing with tabs and spaces and such. EDIT: I don't only do this for the sake of coding standards, it helps me read through their code and bring it up to date so I can fully understand the logic that has been implemented before I start modifying critical applications.
