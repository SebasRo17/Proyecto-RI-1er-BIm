Consider the following toy-code:               data = Table[{k, Sin[k], 0}, {k, 0, 1, 0.01}];          ListPointPlot3D[{data},      PlotStyle -> {Gray, PointSize[Small]},      Boxed -> False,      AxesOrigin -> {Floor[Min[data]], Floor[Min[data]], 0},      AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}     ]      which generates the following plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nQ95M.jpg) Note that the axis label "y" is inside the plot, i.e. to the right of the axis. How can I get the tick labels as well as the axis label to left of the axis?
