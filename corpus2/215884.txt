Basically I'm new to network programming in Python, so I went on a tutorial online to find out about it. Using what was taught in the tutorial (creating a socket, connecting to ports, etc), I modified the code so that I made a program where two computers can send messages to one another. If I were to apply for a job and show this to my interviewers, would the code for it technically be mine? It is fair to say that I didn't modify the code by that much; However, what if for example I modified it into something like a tic-tac-toe game, where two users play each other from different PCs, would the code then be mine? I just don't want to look like a plagiarizer hence why I ask.
