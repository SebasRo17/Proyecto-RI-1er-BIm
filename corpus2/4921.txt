The system function `Remove` evidently exists primarily to turn a fatal problem into an annoying one, by giving the user a (rather blunt) instrument with which to resolve symbol clashes. Presumably, it works by removing the entry for a given symbol from whatever internal table Mathematica uses to look them up by name. However, there can be some interesting consequences when you have a reference to a symbol that you later `Remove`. First, we need to set up a symbol that we will remove, and give another symbol a reference to it:               In[1]:= y = 3     Out[1]= 3          In[2]:= x := y          In[3]:= x     Out[3]= 3          In[4]:= OwnValues[x]     Out[4]= {HoldPattern[x] :> y}      And then we can remove it:               In[5]:= Remove[y]          In[6]:= x     Out[6]= Removed["y"]      Now, we have `Removed["y"]`, which is the ghost of the symbol we just bludgeoned to death. However, contrary to appearances, `Removed` is not the head of the expression:               In[7]:= x // Head     Out[7]= Symbol       It's still a symbol. It appears to just have had all its values cleared when it was `Remove`'d. However, you need an elaborate incantation to contact a symbol that's moved on into the spirit world in order to verify this:               In[8]:= OwnValues[x]     Out[8]= {HoldPattern[x] :> Removed["y"]}          In[9]:= ReleaseHold[Hold[OwnValues[x]] /. OwnValues[x]]     Out[9]= {}      That's OK, though, because I can still give new values to the removed symbol!               In[10]:= With[{yy = x},               yy = 17]     Out[10]= 17          In[11]:= ReleaseHold[Hold[OwnValues[x]] /. OwnValues[x]]     Out[11]= {HoldPattern[Removed[y]] :> 17}      So, what _can't_ you do with a removed symbol that you can do with an ordinary symbol? And is there any reliable programmatic way to check whether a symbol really has been removed, seeing that it has a perfectly ordinary `Symbol` head? I suppose you can hack something together with `StringMatchQ`, but that just feels wrong and it's tough to get the evaluation order right if the removed symbol might have `OwnValues`.
