I have an MVC 5 application that will be used world wide. A number of the pages in the app will require users to enter dates. I'll be using the jQuery datetimepicker plug-in to allow the user to select dates. Or they can enter them manually. I'm curious what the best practice is for cultures where dates are entered in the dd/mm/yyyy format instead of mm/dd/yyyy? I could require all dates to be entered in mm/dd/yyyy format, which is the format my app is expecting, but I also don't want to cause too much angst with my users in other parts of the world.
