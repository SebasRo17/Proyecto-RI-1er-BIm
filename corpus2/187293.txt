I am looking to build an application similar to Blocky. For that I will be using JavaFX. I am working on prototypes atm. It appears that JavaFX UIs are generally made using Scene Builders. I am still not sure how much flexibility is this going to provide me, when I will be looking to dynamically change shapes (make them bigger etc) during runtime, detect collisions to connect shapes etc. Could someone more experienced using this technology tell me how feasible an application like this is using JavaFX? Also would it be easier/same to do it with Java? Thanks.
