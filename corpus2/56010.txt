Why would this work to replace the head `b` with `newHead`:               b[c, d] /. head_[arg__] :> newHead[arg]     (* newHead[c, d] *)      but when `b` is nested within another head `a`, only `a` is replaced using the same rule:               a[b[c, d]] /. head_[arg__] :> newHead[arg]     (* newHead[b[c,d]] *)      Using `ReplaceRepeated` (`//.`), and `HoldPattern` did not help:               a[b[c, d]] //. head_[arg__] :> newHead[arg]     a[b[c, d]] /. HoldPattern[head_[arg__]] :> newHead[arg]     a[b[c, d]] //. HoldPattern[head_[arg__]] :> newHead[arg]     (* newHead[b[c, d]] *)      * * * **My question is** : Is there any way to replace both `a` and `b` with `newHead` using a transformation rule?
