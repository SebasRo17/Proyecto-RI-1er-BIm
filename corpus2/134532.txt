I've only worked on commercial projects, and I'm having a hard time trying to find a project that interests me. I'm looking at a new job soon, and I'm thinking about contributing to a few open source projects in the short term so that I can add them to my résumé. Is having open source projects on a résumé important? If so, would trying to contribute to several in a few months look too much like trying to boost my résumé?
