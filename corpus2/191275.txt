I haven't used Generics in C# for a long while. Every time I think I need to use them I either go in the wrong direction and give up or find that I don't really need them. I feel that I'm missing out or ignoring a technique which could be useful and powerful. I'm aware of how generics are meant to be used (or at least I think I am). If you have three methods that are all doing the same thing with different types, then using generics enables you to have just one method that will work with these three types. EDIT (in response to comment) **Are there any code smells or patterns that I should be looking out for?** Note I use `List<>` a lot, so I'm not ignoring generics in the the standard library. It's just that I've not written custom code using Generics for a while.
