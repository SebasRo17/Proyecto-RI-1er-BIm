> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is ageism in software development based on anything other than bias? I have been a software engineer in the U.S for about 10 years now and I am already in my late thirties. I still have the passion and dedication for this industry and I am still trying to improve myself every day at work. For family reasons, I have to relocate to another state where I need to find a new job. Since I am a pure technical guy I would still like to find a software engineer job. However I am a bit worried about my age since I am already in my late thirties. I am confident about my past experience and my technical strength however the age factor is something beyond my control. My question is: Will I be discriminated because of my age when looking for a software engineer position? If I am really as good as I think, would the employers be interested in hiring me anyways? Any comments/suggestions for improving my chances of being hired are also welcomed! No suggestions like “try to become a manager” please, since I am not interested in any management related jobs. Thank you!
