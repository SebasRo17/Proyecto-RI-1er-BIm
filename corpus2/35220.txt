I have a code that will output an expression in form of a functions like this               (Λ[θ]^3 Ω[θ] - 4 (3 Derivative[1][Λ][θ] Derivative[1][Ω][θ] + Ω[θ] ( Λ′′)[θ]) -       4 Λ[θ] (Ω[θ] + 3 (Ω′′)[θ]))/(4 G J Λ[θ] Ω[θ]^3)      Now, I have functions $\Lambda(\theta)$ and $\Omega(\theta)$, that I'd like to replace with some values of theta. I tried with `->` and `:>` and none of the replacement rules will differentiate my replacement. I can differentiate the variables separately, and then specify replacement rule `Λ'[θ] -> value(θ)`, and then use `/. Derivative[1][Λ][θ]-> value[θ]`, but that seems kinda redundant. Why isn't _Mathematica_ doing it on it's own, recognising that it is the same expression, and just evaluating the derivative? This way _Mathematica_ is treating differentiated lambdas or omegas as something not connected to original lambda and omega. Why is this so, and can it be circumvented?
