I am importing data from Excel and plotting it with `DateListPlot`. My code is               DateListPlot[{       Join @@ Import[""][[1 ;;, 3 ;;]][[All, All, 2 ;; 3]],        Join @@ Import[""][[1 ;;, 3 ;;]][[All, All, 4 ;; 5]]},        Joined -> True,        FrameTicks -> All]      But my problem is this works for just for the first sheet (year 2013) of the many in the same file. Sheet 2 is for Year 2012 and has the same format, and so forth. I want to get all the sheets for all the years; they are continuations of each other. Could you help me to figure out what code will do this?
