I want to generate low-discrepancy sequences and for that purpose I use `SeedRandom[]`, like:               BlockRandom[        SeedRandom[(* ..., *) Method -> {"MKL", Method -> {"Sobol", "Dimenstion"->2}}];     RandomReal[1,10]]      The problem is that `RandomReal[]` returns the same sequence always as if I set the seed to some fixed number. My **question** is: what should I put as argument to `SeedRandom[]` in order to restore the default behaviour or how could I change the method without affecting the way the generator is seeded ? **EDIT** : One work-around would be to calculate a bunch of seeds with, say, `seeds = RandomInteger[2^32]` before calling `SeedRandom[]` for the 1st time and subsequently feed them to the latter.
