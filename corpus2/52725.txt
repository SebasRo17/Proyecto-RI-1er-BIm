I have an SDET interview upcoming in a week. I have been preparing for a long time. It is a good company. I am working as SDET for two years. I wonder what questions I should ask my interviewer regarding testing and other things. I would appreciate your help if you give me some sample questions that I should ask my interviewer during the interview. Some of them I thought are:   1. What type of testing methodologies do you use?    2. Do you have triage meeting everyday?    3. What percentage of code coverage is done by unit tests? I do not find these questions to be more effective. I would appreciate if somebody could help me out in coming out with better questions.
