I'm finding it hard to solve the problem and was hoping that someone could help me with the solution or at least give me a search term to use for problems like this one. The generalized problem: I have a set of numbers (e.g. `[1,2,3]`) and a an array of sets (e.g. `[1,4,5],[4,2,3],[6,7,8],[2],[1,3]`). What I need to do is to find if I can create the first set from the others by taking 1 or 0 elements from them (e.g. taking 1 from the first, 2 from the second and 3 from the last). Order of the elements doesn't matter in any of the sets.
