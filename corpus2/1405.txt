I am totally new to mathematica but started learning how to use it. I use the following function to convert a decimal number into its binary representation.               binExp[num_, d_] := First[RealDigits[N[num, d], 2]];      Currently, I am stuck with two points:   1. If I type `binExp[240, 7]`, I get a 23-bit binary representation of a decimal number in the interval `[0,255]` BUT I need a 24-bit binary representation of it.   2. I have a `100,000` decimal numbers stored in a text file and want to use the previous function within mathematica to convert all of them to their 24-bit binary representation and store them back in a text file. Any help is appreciated.
