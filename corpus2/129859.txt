I'm looking to get a job as a Python programmer. I know the basics of the language and have created a few games with it using pygame. I've also started to experiment with Django. However, looking at the job market, it doesn't seem very many Python jobs are web-related. On the desktop side of things, it doesn't seem like very many companies use the popular GUI libraries like pyQt or wxPython. How are companies actually using Python? What areas should one focus on to land a job as a Python programmer?
