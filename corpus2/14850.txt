I saw on the internet a lot of nice experiments with Microsoft Kinect. I just bought one and would like to know if someone here has been able to use it with Mathematica. The main idea is to been able to use it as another controller device. So you could get it state using `Dynamic@ControllerState` Mathematica command. In some way, it's necessary to install a driver that make this possible. I installed zigfu and synapse-kinect on my mac (see links below). They demo worked just nice, but no additional device appeared on my Mathematica. You can list connected devices using the `ControllerInformation[]` command. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iq2ld.png) Here are some links with potential starting points, as suggested in the comments: http://zigfu.com/en/downloads/browserplugin/ http://www.shiffman.net/p5/kinect/ http://developkinect.com/resource/application/synapse-kinect http://glovepie.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=32
