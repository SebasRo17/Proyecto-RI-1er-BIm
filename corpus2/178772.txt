There _is_ a partial answer on Stack Overflow, but I'm asking something a teeny bit more specific than the answers there. So... Does the formal semantics (Section 7.2) specify the meaning of such a numeric literal? Does it specify the meaning of numeric operations on the value resulting from interpreting the literal? If yes, what are the meanings (in English -- denotational semantics is all greek characters to me :))?
