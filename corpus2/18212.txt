I recently purchased the O'Reilly book: Programming Entity Framework by Julia Lerman. Unfortunately it is the 1st edition. I didn't realize that there was a newer edition. Which in hind sight explains the lessor price for the book. So my question... Should I return it and get the 2nd edition or read the 1st edition? The 1st edition spends a lot of time in the version 1 of the EF and the 2nd edition spends a lot of time in version 2 (which is where I want to be). I think I want to return it, but I thought I would ask the question first... Thoughts?
