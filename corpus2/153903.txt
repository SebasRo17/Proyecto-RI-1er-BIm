We have REST webservices that can serve XML or JSON (WCF). I'm toying with idea of implementing Protobufs. Why? PROS   1. Less load on servers.   2. Smaller message size - less traffic.   3. It is easier to switch now than later. CONS   1. Need to be implemented   2. Going to be harder to troubleshoot/sniff messages for debugging.    3. I can enable GZip on server and JSON will consume as much traffic What is your suggestion and/or experience on this?
