I have a question about exporting an InterpolatingFunction to excel. I checked the forum, but I still couldn't completely understand how to solve my problem. Could someone help me with this problem?               a = 10^-2;     eq1 = {hf'[t] == -a*(hf[t] - hs[t]),hs'[t] == a*(hf[t] - hs[t]), hf[0] == 20, hs[0] == 0};     sol1 = NDSolve[eq1, {hf, hs}, {t, 0, 100}]      The I got solution for `hf[t]` & `hs[t]` :               {{hf -> InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,100.}},<>],       hs -> InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,100.}},<>]}}      I'm wondering how I can export `hf[t]` & `hs[t]` values to excel as t ranges from 0 to 100.
