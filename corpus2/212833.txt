I'm implementing what's basically an event log system for a larger system. I used Single-table inheritance to build out the table. The problem I'm having is figuring out how to build out the classes from the database. It's easy enough for me to figure out what they are to load them into the database, but to pull them out and create objects and collections out of them is a little trickier. The only way I know of is to have a switch statement and hope that if someone implements a new object that they'll update the switch, but that doesn't seem practical. I'm sure I'm getting something wrong about how I'm thinking of the factory pattern here.
