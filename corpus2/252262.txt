I am somewhat new to C# and just found out that: in C# all of the fields and methods in a class are default private. Meaning that this:               class MyClass     {          string myString          }      is the same as:               class MyClass     {          private string myString          }      So because they are the same should I ever use the keyword private on fields and methods? Many online code samples use the keyword private in their code, why is that?
