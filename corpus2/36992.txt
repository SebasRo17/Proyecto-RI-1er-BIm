I've created a custom menu in the _Mathematica_ title bar (by editing `MenuSetup.tr`) that executes code using `KernelExecute`. These pieces of code may sometimes produce error messages that I'm still interested in seeing, but they don't seem to come through, either to the `SelectedNotebook[]` or to the `Messages` console. Is a different `OutputStream` used for commands executed through _Mathematica_ menus? Is there a way to redirect the output and messages generated by these commands so that they're still visible to the user?
