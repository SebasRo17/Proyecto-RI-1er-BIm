If I'm undergoing a technical interview that's based on my C++ skills, would most companies allow or expect me to use STL containers to solve problems? I think it's clear that if a question is pertaining specifically to a linked- list and my knowledge of linked-lists that I probably won't be able to or shouldn't use the STL list containers. On the other hand, I could get a question where using std::vector might be really useful and the question itself doesn't concern std::vector directly. In this latter case I would think using the vector STL container would be acceptable. Of course, the answer to this question is at least somewhat company dependent. I'm curious as to how bigger tech companies approach this situation.
