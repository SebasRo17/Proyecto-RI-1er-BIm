Where does binary go in a computer? When you turn the computer on it points to the bios and runs through it. I get that. Then it loads data off something ( disk, flash, etc. ). But where does it go? Does the binary go in ram? Does that mean if my program is 2mb and ram is 32mb I can only address 30mb? I mainly want to know so I can tell how big my bin can be. I'm just a little confused on this issue. I know it's platform specific. But in general where would it go, and in general what document would I look at to check this information?
