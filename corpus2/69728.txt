@Amir Rezeai says that 'Coding Assistance' is his favorite Resharper feature. I actually just found out about 'Coding Assistance' after watching James Kovacs' most excellent webcast, entitled 'Resharper Tips and Tricks' on Pluralsight.com. My Question is: > Do you use 'Symbol Completion' or 'Smart Completion'? And if so, did it take you a while to get used to [either feature]? * * * These features could potentially accelerate development. But it seems like they require a different mindset.   [I don't know - Maybe it's just me.]
