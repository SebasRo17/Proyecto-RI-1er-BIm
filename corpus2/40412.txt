If I solved an example equation like `|x|+|y|=1` numerically, I would to get a 90Â° rotated rectangle. If I was to plot the equation, it would result in an image like the following: ![example problem](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mVafC.png) As an example, this is the problem I want to solve:               Sin[x] Sin[2y] + Sin[y] Sin[2x] = 0      May I get suggestions on the best method to plot the example problem achieving the same result?
