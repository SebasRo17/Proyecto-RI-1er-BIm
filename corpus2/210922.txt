I have a question about CA1819 msdn performance warning. The rule is: Arrays returned by properties are not write-protected, even if the property is read-only. To keep the array tamper-proof, the property must return a copy of the array. Typically, users will not understand the adverse performance implications of calling such a property. Specifically, they might use the property as an indexed property. I understand the rule. I want to know if this happens only with arrays? If yes, why?
