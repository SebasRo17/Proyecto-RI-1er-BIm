I was asked by an employer about CRM in the context of C++ software development. The position I was applying for was C++ Software Engineer. I told them: As far as I know, CRM is an acronym that stands for Customer Relationship Management. It also refers to software tools that track the responses and actions of customers and employees that are involved in some business relationship. But they seemed disappointed that I didn't know how to code or implement a CRM framework in C++ and I couldn't seem to find much on the Net either. Does anyone know what an employer is looking for at this stage - before they hire you and train you up? I would appreciate some pointers to get started.
