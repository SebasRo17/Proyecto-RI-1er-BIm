I am working on a C# .NET Application, where I have a Form with lots of controls. I need to perform computations depending on the values of the controls. Therefore, I need to pass the Form values to a function and inside that function, several helper functions will be called depending on the Control element. Now, I can think of two ways to pass all the Form values: i) Save everything in a Dictionary and pass the Dictionary to the function or ii) Have a class with attributes that corresponds to each of the Form element. Which of these two approaches , or any other, is better?
