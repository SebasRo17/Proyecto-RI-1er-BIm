In the dev shops I've worked in, nobody has ever mentioned "coding priorities". I read this in a book or site somewhere, and sets the expectation of what priority should be first in the code. In places where this is not specified, what should the first priority be? It may sound simple to say " **do what the business need requires** ", but that could be at the expense of performance/maintainability. Many people say maintainability first, regardless, some say fulfill the need regardless. I am a young developer, so I am probably missing the point somewhere. Of course, programming is engineering and tough because you can never have the perfect solution. Thanks
