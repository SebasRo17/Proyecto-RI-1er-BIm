It appears from the documentation that we share styles via stylesheets. I am trying to set up a customised default stylesheet for my notebooks. I have tried simple ideas, and more complex ones, without success.   1. If I edit the provided default.nb, my changes to it are not saving.    2. If I make model notebook of my own, say aModel.nb, and customise that notebook's styles, a copy of that model does not have those styles.   3. If I "install" the stylesheet of aModel.nb, and apply that to some other notebook, it has no effect.
