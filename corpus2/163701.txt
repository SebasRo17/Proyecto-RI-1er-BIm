Itâ€™s a well-known fact in software engineering that the cost of fixing a bug increases exponentially the later in development that bug is discovered. This is supported by data published in _Code Complete_ and adapted in numerous other publications. However, it turns out that this data never existed. The data cited by _Code Complete_ apparently does not show such a cost / development time correlation, and similar published tables only showed the correlation in some special cases and a flat curve in others (i.e. no increase in cost). **Is there any independent data to corroborate or refute this?** And if true (i.e. if there simply is no data to support this exponentially higher cost for late discovered bugs), **how does this impact software development methodology?**
