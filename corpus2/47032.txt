I have 3 questions about the GPL here:   1. If I use GPL software in my application, but don't modify or distribute it, do I have to release my application under the GPL?   2. What if I modify some software that my application uses. Then do I have to release my application under the GPL, or can I just supply the modified software under the GPLs terms.   3. And what if I use GPL software, but don't modify it, can I distribute it with my application? My case in point is, I have a PHP framework which I use the GeSHi library to highlight some output.   1. Because GeSHi is GPL, does my framework have to be GPL?    2. Can I modify GeSHi for particular use cases of my application if I supply the modifications back to the GeSHi maintainers?   3. Can I redistribute my framework with GeSHi?
