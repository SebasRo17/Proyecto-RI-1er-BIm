Most Java applications don't look the same as C/C++ applications. Swing might have been designed on purpose to have a distincitve look, but based on what I've read, SWT for example tried to 'look native', and doesn't completley succeed. My question is: Why is it hard for the developers of the Java language to design a GUI system that copies _exactly_ the look of native GUIs? What's different in native GUIs? Isn't it only a matter of designing buttons that look like 'native' buttons? Or does it go deeper than that?
