In everything that follows I am using `Roots` to get the solutions to the equations. I start off with this equation: $$ \frac{A}{3}x^4 - x^2 + 2ax - b^2 = 0$$ Now `Roots` gives me back $4$ complicated looking solutions to this. Now if one stares at the solutions it appears that if one tunes to $a =b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{16 A}}$ then these 4 solutions collapse to $3$ namely, $ x = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{A}}, -\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3}{A}} \pm \sqrt{\frac{6}{A} }$ **however**   * when I from the beginning itself set $a = b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{16 A}}$ and run `Roots` on the equation the system just hangs!   * And of these $3$ solutions the "$\pm$" _doesn't_ seem to satisfy the original equation. (with $a = b = \sqrt{\frac{3}{16 A}}$)  Can someone kindly explain what is happening?
