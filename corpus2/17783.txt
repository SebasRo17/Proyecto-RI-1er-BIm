Suppose that I want to write a function `fun` that takes an `Integer` `num` as input, and returns `Red` if `num == 1`, `Orange` if `num == 2`, and `Yellow` if `num == 3`. One way, I think, to do this is to use `Which`:               fun[num_Integer] := Which[num == 1, Red, num == 2, Orange, num == 3, Yellow]      Is there a more concise way to write `fun`? In other words, is there any built-in function (analogous to `Which`) that I can use that would allow me to avoid typing "`num`" all the time instead of always having to specify it to `Which`. Writing `fun` as a series of nested `If` statements would be even lengthier. Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for your time.
