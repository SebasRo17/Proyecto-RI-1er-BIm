Whats the best way to get started on iPhone development if you are an expeienced C++ or C# programmer? Most books either assume you know nothing or something. What are the steps to achieve this? For eg: first learn objective C (let's say), next learn cocoa... I am interested in books/resources. I read Getting started with iPhone development from Oreilly (the missing manuals book) but that just provided an over view on the programming and concentrated more on getting your app into the app store. I need resources that will help me start coding. Other questions: How much of objective C do you need to know? How do I start learning the cocoa framework? Can I directly start on cocoa touch or do I need to know the MAC cocoa framework first? Inputs from someone who was in the same situation (Know c++/c# but no clue about mac programming/objective c/cocoa) would help greatly.
