Why does the Lisp community prefer to accumulate all the parentheses at the end of the function:               (defn defer-expensive [cheap expensive]       (if-let [good-enough (force cheap)]         good-enough         (force expensive)))      Why not employ a convention like C or Java?   Well ok, Lisp is much more older than those languages, but I'm talking about the contemporary Lispers.               (defn defer-expensive [cheap expensive]       (if-let [good-enough (force cheap)]         good-enough         (force expensive)       )     )      Note: Code snippet is from the book "The Joy of Clojure".
