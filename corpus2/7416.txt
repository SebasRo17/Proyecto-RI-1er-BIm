Observe:               rand = RandomReal[1, {4, 3, 2}];          Graphics @ Polygon @ rand      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dZ1JA.png)               Graphics[Polygon /@ rand]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HIizb.png) I am losing anti-aliasing when I use the multiple-polygon syntax form of `Polygon`. Yet it is possible for _Mathematica_ to apply AA as can be shown with:               Style[      Graphics @ Polygon @ rand,      Antialiasing -> True     ]      (Incidentally this `Style`-applied AA does not copy with Szabolcs's Image Uploader but the in-Notebook appearance is identical to the second output above.)   * Why am I losing anti-aliasing here?   * Is there a system option to turn it on, and with what caveat?
