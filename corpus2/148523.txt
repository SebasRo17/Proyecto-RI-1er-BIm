I'm creating a game on wp7 and it will be an online game played between a max of 4 players. The game will be a turn based game. My question really is what is the best way to do this server wise? is WCF the way to go? The following is information transferred to and from the server from each player.   * Player Chat message   * Chat message from other players.   * Players points from game.   * Picture sent to each player for start of game
