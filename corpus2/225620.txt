In some articles and books that I read, I some time see the term 'Bootstrapping'. For example I see this sentence "Bootstrapping X.JS" in angular js document: http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00 > Bootstrapping AngularJS apps automatically using the `ngApp` directive is > very easy and suitable for most cases. In advanced cases, such as when using > script loaders, you can use imperative / manual way to bootstrap the app... What is the meaning of bootstrapping in software development?
