AFAIK, Scala and Clojure are implemented in Java and Java is implemented in C. I suppose that many or most languages are implemented in C, for instance Perl, Python and SQL. I don't know much about language implementation but maybe you can tell me the rationale to favor one implementation language Java over another C? Are there any theories about one language implementing another, or are we resorted to Turing machine theory where a language is regarded are a Turing machine?
