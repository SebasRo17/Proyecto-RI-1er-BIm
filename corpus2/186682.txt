Recently i was re-visiting the basic concepts of operating systems. Since I am a java developer, I have inherently started looking at everything from java point of view. I am also reading 'Inside the JVM fundamentals' from http://www.artima.com/insidejvm/ed2/jvm.html so when I see the basics of operating systems and JVM, I have begun to think that there are lot of similarities on an abstract level, i.e. both do the memory management, process scheduling, etc. So I want to ask SO programmers whether I am correct in my learning or assumptions?
