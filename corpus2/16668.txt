I have a function defined by $$f(t)=\int\limits_0^t g(x) dx$$ $g(x)$ is a complicated function (specifically the Mittag-Leffler function which has recently been implemented in Mathematica 9 as `MittagLefflerE[a,b,t]`) and so I evaluate this integral numerically using `NIntegrate`. I want to perform two tasks with this function---Plot it as a function of the limit $t$, _and_ evaluate it's value at a number of different time instances. I have stored these values of time in a vector of the form `{t1,t2,t3,...,tn}`. Mathematica's documentation suggests that to plot the function I will have to define it as `f[t_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[g[x],{x,0,t}]` which works perfectly fine. However, I cannot use this definition of the function $f$ to now evaluate it's value at every element of my list. I assume the issue is because `NIntegrate` is not listable. Is there any way I can get around this?
