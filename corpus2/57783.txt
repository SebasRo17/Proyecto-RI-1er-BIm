Is there any updates regarding installing CRAN packages via RLink in Mathematica 10 on Mac OS X? Or are we still stuck with the base R package and that's it? I was able to point to my R distribution using this answer but using external packages led to errors. Here is my code:               Needs["RLink`"]     SetEnvironment[     "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" ->      "/Library/Frameworks/R.Framework/Resources/lib"];          InstallR["RHomeLocation" ->      "/Library/Frameworks/R.Framework/Resources"];          REvaluate["R.version.string"]          REvaluate["library(GA)"]          REvaluate["f <- function(x)  abs(x)+cos(x)                fitness <- function(x) -f(x)                ga(type='real-valued',fitness=fitness,min=-20,max=20)                summary(GA)"]          Out[15]= $Failed      and the error message:               REvaluate::rerr: Failed to retrieve the value for variable or piece of code f<- function(x)  abs(x)+cos(x)     fitness <- function(x) -f(x)     ga(type='real-valued',fitness=fitness,min=-5,max=5)     summary(GA). The following R error was encountered: Error in typeof(myRandomVar123456740025) :      object 'myRandomVar123456740025' not found >>
