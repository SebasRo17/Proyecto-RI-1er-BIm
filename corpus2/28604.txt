While there is this question with a very similar title, it does not answer my question, which is: I have part of an input, in my case               Re[Exp[I*x]]      which _Mathematica_ "simplifies" to > >     Cos[Re[x]]/E^Im[x] >   So I am wondering how to tell _Mathematica_ to leave this expression, whether it's alone or part of a longer formula, in its previous form rather than to change it as shown here. ### Update I should probably add I am still running version 6, hoping this is not causing the issue.
