I don't have a basic example just yet but I'll describe the problem for now. I have a large system (>100) of coupled first order ODEs. Where the output from one solution becomes the ICs for the next NDSolve. In each case the equations are the same except various coefficients get updated according to a pre-existing list. I then solve this sequence 1000 times or so. What are some tricks I can try to speed this process up? Can I do something with Compile perhaps? Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated.
