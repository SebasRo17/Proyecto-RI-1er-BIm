I plotted `m[t]`, but actually what I want to plot is `g[t]`, which is a summation of `m[t]` from 0 to 19 seconds. But when I plot `g[t]`, I get dots. On the picture, what I want is on the right, I don't want the dots, so I guess list plot is not the way to go. How should I plot g to look like the picture I have to the right; ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j6FkE.png) ### EDIT My code;               period = 1;                                          beta = 0.05;     An = List[{-1 , 1, -1, +1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1}];          sinch[t_] := (Sin[(Pi*t - t*period)/period])/(Pi* t);                                      m[t_] :=        An * sinch[t] * (Cos[(Pi*beta*t - t*period) / period] /          (1 - (4*beta^2 * (t - t*period)^2 )/period^2 ));           Plot[{m[t]}, {t , 0, 19}]                  g = Sum[m[t], {t, 1, 20}];     ListPlot[g]
