I've heard about software and apps going into Generation 1.2 or 2.6, is there an actual methodology behind this? or it's more of a marketing thing? Currently we are using Scrum as our methodology in agile software development and it's based on sprints, but I haven't been able to find any information detailing what's actually a generation in software development (neither on Agile based methodologies and non-agile). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28scrum%29#Sprint
