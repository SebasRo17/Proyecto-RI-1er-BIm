Recently, I was a part of a discussion about which criteria should be used when determining a salary for a programmer: arguments varied from "it is a matter of employer's choice" to other arguments that took into account one's education, experience, understanding of technologies, etc. Not so long ago, I read a great post on the Stack Exchange blog on the subject and I couldn't agree more with it, but not many employers follow the described logic. In your experience, which elements are the most important ones when determining salary for a programmer? Which criteria are most often applied in those situations? Which criteria _should_ be most often applied? And finally, to which extent is formal education (college, university) important in determining salary?
