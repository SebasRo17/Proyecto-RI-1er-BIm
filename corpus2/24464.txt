My question here is relative to jobs for programmers. Why does employer still contract programmers if today we have a lot of good commercial system avaliable on the market? I want to be very clear at this point, this question is relative only to a system, more specially to ERP systems. Maybe this question looks a little bit useless, but right now I'm working and this doubt arose to me and my boss. I have a few answers to my own question, but I really would like to speculate this subject a bit more. Also I know, every good company needs a customized system, but ... the question is here. :-) Any answer will make me feel better. Thanks.
