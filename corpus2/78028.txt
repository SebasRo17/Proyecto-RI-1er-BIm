I'm in a bit of a precarious position. I'm working remotely for a client that has recently brought in a junior developer straight out of college into the project. He works physically at their office. I believe he studied computer science (although I can't recall 100% at the moment). He has been with the company a couple months now and was started, by the project manager, on testing and getting familiar with the app and for about the past month, has been assigned small bugs and features. The thing is, in that time, he has only committed code once and it was code that I basically walked him through and wrote out for him. (I thought it would be beneficial for him to see the working solution after he had spent days trying to get it to work). I have had a few calls with him and some pair programming sessions but he is spending days getting frustrated at simple JavaScript code that should really not be that difficult even for a junior developer. I am beginning to think that maybe programming is not a good path for him but want to make as much effort as I can to helping him find solutions on his own and help him improve. This is the first time I have been in a position of having to provide training and mentoring. Being remote probably makes this much more difficult as well. What can I do to help him improve and to get him going?
