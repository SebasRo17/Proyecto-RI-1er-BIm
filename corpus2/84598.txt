In database programming there's a technique called "normalization" that you do to data you want to store. Has anyone tried to apply this concept to object design? How did you? How did it work out? Edit: To expand/clarify, database normalization is more than a set of principles to reduce redundancy. There's actually steps and stages you go through and at least moderately objective measures that tell you which stage you are in. Object design has its own principles, and there's the concept of smell, but is there any way to do something similar that would tell you that you're in XX-form0,1,2...etc...and methods to move to the next most "normalized" level?
