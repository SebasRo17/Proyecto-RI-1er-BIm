I am debating on a career in programming. The problem for me is that I don't think college is right for me. I am planning on joining the Air Force as a Computer Systems Programmer will they will train me and I will gain some college credits. From what I can understand there is a large amount of people taking a major in Computer Science because they hear computers make money. Most drop out but some do graduate but find they don't really know anything about programming. Ive always heard the issue being that these students often get good grades but don't push themselves to learn beyond the course. I'm a very self motivated learner and I am having a blast learning C++ as well as I love computers and have since before I could even read or write. So learning the actual trade isn't the issue. I could go to college for free or nearly free. I will most likely enlist for 6 years. But when (or if I decide to make a career out of it) I get out of the military will I be able to find a job with 6 years of experience in lieu of a degree. I would assume i would because said employer would know if I could do the work rather then having to deal with some college kid who there not even sure if he knows how to program.
