I see constant references to the " Way," such as descriptions of a particular framework or application as "Pythonic," a certain person as a "Perl hacker," or "true Ruby code," but where are the "PHP hackers," the "PHP-ic" applications, the "true PHP style"? This made me think - does PHP even have a definite style? Saying PHP is easily "changeable" to other styles doesn't count, as the same goes for any reasonable language. Any input much appreciated.
