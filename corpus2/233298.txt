I've been reading in basic concepts of OOP,as i'm trying to make this shift from transactional scripts to more oop manner in php, and i often come across this definition : > An object stores its state in fields (variables) and exposes its behavior > through methods (functions). Methods operate on an object's internal state > and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication and a simple example like : > Objects like real life objects have state and behavior. Dogs have state > (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail). from definition i see that methods should be either manipulating internal state (setters) or communicating with other objects; but when i try to apply this to a Blog example. composed of mainly 2 domains User and posts. **what could be the`User object` Behavior ?** I cannt find any !   1. login, its an auth lib. thing so i should not include it in user.   2. posting articles is a Post object thing; again user conduct it; but its more of a post object concern to create a post right ? User may be the main Aggregate object in a blog; yet the user is more like the Creator of Other Objects but he does not have a Behavior i can think of; he is being used -and his state- by other objects in most cases that all ! **in a nutshell :** what are allowed type of methods inside an object ?
