Many of us have worked in multiple environments over the years, and have found that some are more productive than others. In many cases, it's not directly related to the abilities of the developers, but instead to their environment. I myself have experienced this, being in places where I seemed to develop faster, and better. And yet other places I seem to be dragging time, and developing less thoughtfully. What do you think creates a productive development environment?
