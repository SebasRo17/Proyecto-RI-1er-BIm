I am a new user of Mathematica and have some questions about the simplifications of calculated expressions. I am unable to attach an image of the session, but my Mathematica commands are:               Element[{x,y,z},Reals]      Element[{x0,y0,z0},Reals]     rhatV={x-x0,y-y0,z-z0}     rhat=Norm[rhatV]      In the expression for rhat, I am unable to get rid of the `Abs` functions, despite the Reals declarations.               phi=1/rhat     D[phi,x]      In the evaluated derivative is there a way to have x-x0 in the numerator recognized as rhatV[[1]] and the denominator as rhat^3, such that it can be used in additional operations?
