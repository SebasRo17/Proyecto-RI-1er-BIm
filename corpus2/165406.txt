I work on a well-established, embedded C++ code base. We have been using a proprietary API to our filesystem. For better integration with third-party C libraries, we are currently in the process of implementing most of `stdio.h` and `fcntl.h`. I made what I thought was a non-controversial proposal that we should also implement the fstream class and encourage new C++ code to use it instead of the new (to our code base) C-style API. We already have the `stdout` parts of `iostream` available, although it is not widely used. Given a choice between using `stdio` and `fstream`, what are good reasons to choose `stdio` for embedded software development in C++?
