So I have 2D plot, made with DensityListPlot. Mathematica just cannot export them properly to PDF, so what I want to do is 1) export the plot itself, without axes, labels, etc, as a jpg image, and 2) Inset this image in an empty graphics containing only axes, labels etc. So far so good. The problem is that when I export the final graphics to PDF, the image are not compressed at all -- and the file end up weighing 400k instead of 30k. The question is: how do I specify the format and compression factor of images embedded in a pdf?
