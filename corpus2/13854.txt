I was trying to get the volatility value of a specific equity on a given day. Based on the _Mathematica_ Help, the syntax is > `FinancialData["name","prop",{start,end,...}]` gives a list of dates and > values of a property for a sequence of dates or periods. So I tried this with the specific request.               FinancialData["SPY", "Volatility20Day", {{2012, 10, 11}, {2012, 10, 11}}]      which generates a long error message that starts with `DatePlus::date: Argument {{2012,10,11},{2012,10,11}} cannot be interpreted as a date. >>` By the way, the syntax does work with other properties such as close, open, return, etc. Is there any specific syntax that is different for `Volatility20Day`?
