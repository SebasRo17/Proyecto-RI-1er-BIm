As many people have noted, the 2D graphics primitive `Circle` doesn't work in a `Graphics3D` environment. Several solutions to this problem have been proposed, both on this site and on StackOverflow. They all have the disadvantage that they result in either rather ugly circles or highly inefficient ones because these circles were generated by a polygon with several hundreds of facets, making interactive graphics incredibly slow. Other alternatives involve the use of `ParametricPlot` which doesn't generate efficient graphics either or yield a primitive that can't be used with `GeometricTransformation`. I would like to have a more elegant solution that creates a smooth circular arc in 3D without requiring zillions of coordinates. The resulting arc should be usable in combination with `Tube` and can be used with `GeometricTransformation`.
