I'm in the planning stages of developing a web application that I want to make as secure as possible. I'm pretty clear about how to do that from a technical point of view, but there is one massive potential security hole: I want the site to have users. As anyone who has ever been a user knows, users forget usernames, forget passwords, sometimes forget that they even had an account with your site. Users respond to phishing emails and give away their credentials. If you do anything that they find too complicated they won't use your site, it has to be simple and all happen in as few clicks as possible, but we have to balance that out by making it as hard as possible for users to accidentally give away their credentials and to keep access to the service as secure as possible. What I'm particularly interested in are strategies that go beyond the standard username and password combination and ways of recovering or resetting passwords that make things easy for users but hard for anyone trying to steal their account. I know a lot of sites provide an extra user-set security question, but because I don't trust users not to create a stupid question like "what is 1+1" I don't see how this can guarantee security. Are there strategies that could be useable to the most clueless user but challenging to a determined and targetted attack aiming to break into their account? If not what are the closest things we could get? As a user what are the best/worst sites for this you have encountered and why?
