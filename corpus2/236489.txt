I am currently learning C#, I am pretty proficient in Java. A project I have been working on for a while is basically an application that lets you input code "Snippets" or blocks of frequently used code and lets you tag them with specific topics for easy sorting. How should I go about saving the inputted code so I can access it later and possibly format it or keep it in the formatting it's pasted in? I would want to put more information into the file it is stored in addition to the actual code, like the tags and dates/times so things like XML have came to mind but I really am not sure. Just for clarification, I am aware of the snippet function in visual basic. What I am asking about is for making my own C# standalone application and how to store the code on my own.
