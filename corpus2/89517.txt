Gathering that map-reduce is being used to process huge amounts of data, I set out to understand it. My queries were:   * What class of problems does it aim to solve?   * How does it help breaking down of complex problems?   * Can I write a sample app, (locally!) to get started? After a lot of googling, blogs and wikipedia, I know who is using it, who is selling infrastructure for it. But, I am still clueless about the above queries. The closest I got is this tutorial on Amazon: " _Contextual Advertising using Apache Hive and Amazon Elastic MapReduce with High Performance Computing instances_ " http://aws.amazon.com/articles/2855?_encoding=UTF8&jiveRedirect=1 This tutorial assumes understanding of online advertising and map-reduce, hence, tough to follow. Anybody have any clues to how a programmer can get started on map-reduce?
