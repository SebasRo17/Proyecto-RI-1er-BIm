I was looking to add a simple form that states my project's build number on a form to quick identify what version I am running. Then I realized I'm not sure what fits on an about page. In my highschool projects I would make silly splash screens with this info, with images and other unnecessary information. What are standard/appropriate elements to include on an "About" page in an application?
