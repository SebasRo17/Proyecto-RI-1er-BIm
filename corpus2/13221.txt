Looking at the plot below, how can I know what colours made the `Hue` shade?               Plot3D[Cos[x - y + x], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}, ColorFunction -> Hue]      I want to have only the RGB or HTML color values used by `Hue`. I have copied the colors from rm -rfâ™¦'s answer:               FF0000     FF9800     CCFF00     33FF00     00FF66     00FFFF     0066FF     CB00FE     FF0099     FF0000      but with an imprecise tool; how can I have the correct colors used by _Mathematica_ , when I use the `ColorFunction -> Hue` command?
