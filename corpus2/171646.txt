I'm going to teach teenagers some C++ code. I need an editor which is simple and has built in compiler. We tried CodeBlocks but when we installed it in the machines, the text got reversed, I'm not sure what the reaoson is. I would be great if the file size of the editor will not be large. We need just simple features: **-Text highlight.** **-Compile and run.** **-easy to use** **-Should run on Windows XP.**
