I'm a new user and would like to find the minimum value of soln1[30] obtained after repeating the following evaluation (below) for 1000 cycles (for instance). I can obtain sequential values of soln[30] if I reevaluate the entire notebook manually each time, but I want to be able to automate this process until a minimum value of soln1[30] is reached. The difficulty that I am encountering is that the entire notebook requires evaluation in order to generate a different random integer each time- I am having trouble figuring out how to force the evaluation to include the randominteger step using commands like Table, etc. I'm probably missing something simple- any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance...               Clear[w, t, q, soln1]          f1[t_] := 5*t;          w = RandomInteger[{1111, 9999}];     a = IntegerDigits[w][[1]];     b = IntegerDigits[w][[2]];     c = IntegerDigits[w][[3]];     d = IntegerDigits[w][[4]];     p = 0.1;     k = 0.6;          end1 = a;     p1 = end1 + p;     end2 = p1 + b;     p2 = end2 + p;     end3 = p2 + c;     p3 = end3 + p;     end4 = p3 + d;          soln1[t_] := Piecewise[{{f1[t], t < end1}, {k*f1[end1],       end1 <= t < p1}, {f1'[t]*(t - p1) + k*f1[end1],       p1 <= t < epnd2}, {k*f1[end2],       end2 <= t < p2}, {f1'[t]*(t - p2) + k*f1[end2],       p2 <= t < end3}, {k*f1[end3],       end3 <= t < p3}, {f1'[t]*(t - p3) + k*f1[end3], p3 <= t <= 30}}];           soln1[30]
