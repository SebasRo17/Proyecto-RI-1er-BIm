I need to draw a set of curves on one graph (characteristics equations). As you can see they have exchanged x and y axes. My goal is to plot all those curves on one graph. Are there ways to do that?               f[t_, t0_] := -(2 - 4/Pi*ArcTan[2])*Exp[-t]*(t - t0);     g[x_, x0_] := (x - x0)/(-(2 - 4/Pi*ArcTan[x + 2]));     Show[Table[Plot[f[t, t0], {t, 0, 1},        PlotRange -> {0, -0.3},        AxesLabel -> {t, x}], {t0, 0, 1, 0.1}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6BDw9.jpg)               Show[       Table[         Plot[g[x, x0], {x, 0, -0.3}, PlotRange -> {0, 1}, AxesLabel -> {x, t}],          {x0, 0, -0.3, -0.05}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F9h7Q.jpg)
