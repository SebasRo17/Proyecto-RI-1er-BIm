Is it possible to set an `Image` as the `Background` of a `Panel`? I've studied all the options in the Documentation center, but didn't find anything about it.                 image=Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/U6Pby.jpg"]      ![Background Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U6Pby.jpg)                 Panel[Style["This is Infratab",                      Bold,                      20,                     Editable -> False                    ],            Background -> image, Alignment -> Center, ImageSize -> {400, 400}       ](*panel is closed*)      Instead of a color, I want to set `image` as background of the `Panel`.
