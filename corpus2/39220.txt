We have seen many new things in the last five to seven years on the web: Facebook, HTML5 appeared, new browsers grew strongly, Google failed with Wave. Facebook, GTalk and Gmail are cross-platform and device. Similarly, I **thought** and **hoped** that forums, chat, mail, usenet, conversation rooms and p2p protocols could inter-operate to allow the user to transparently access all those services. Of course I realized that things are far more complicated, for several reasons:   * The IETF cannot invent new things. They just propose standards.   * Microsoft and other big players are often obstacles to relevant innovation regarding open formats. The biggest hurdles are document formats and Internet Explorer, with its delayed reaction supporting web standards.   * Smartphones, thanks to the appearances of OS's such as iOS and Android, are finally able to navigate the internet: Former devices were deaf, and weren't directly connected to the internet.   * The mail protocols were left unchanged despite the growth of spam and malware. I don't know what to think, because I think there is still a lot to do, but I feel like it will never happen. Or that nobody seems interested in the basic text transmit features... So what do **you** think are the next big steps in the evolution of the web? Do you think it will still walk hand in hand with open source?
