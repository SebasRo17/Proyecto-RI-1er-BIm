> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Plot Even Piecewise function Based on Howell's Principles of Fourier Analysis, I found a function $ f(x)= \begin{cases} \sqrt{|x|} & \text{ if }-\pi < x < \pi \\\ f(x-2\pi) & \text{ in general } \end{cases} $ and the author seem to be able to produce a graph with Maple that is like a bun and continuous. Now my question is how can I produce the same graph of this type in Mathematica. I am aware that I can use the piecewise function but the second condition say "in general" and hence I am lost. Please give advise.
