I'm a new user of _Mathematica_ and I'm trying to use it to calculate the collisional cross-section as a function of energy for a given potential and decay rate. I know that the resulting function should be continuous, but when _Mathematica_ does the integration and plots the function, it gives a discontinuous function. Please help! Here is my code:               rc[k_?NumericQ, b_?NumericQ] := Level[NSolve[3/x^12 - 10/x^6 + (5 k/2) b^2/x^2 == k, x,      Reals], {-1}][[-1]]          i2[k_?NumericQ, b_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[(1/x^12)/Sqrt[N[k] - (3/(N[x])^12 -      10/(N[x])^6 + (5 N[k]/2) (N[b])^2/(N[x])^2)], {x, rc[N[k], N[b]] + 10^-12,Infinity}]          p2[k_?NumericQ, b_?NumericQ] := 1 - E^(-2 i2[N[k], N[b]])          pb2[k_?NumericQ, b_?NumericQ] := N[b]*N[p2[N[k], N[b]]]          s2[k_?NumericQ] := (N[2 Pi])*NIntegrate[pb2[N[k], N[b ]], {b, 0, Infinity},        MinRecursion -> 3, MaxRecursion -> 20]      The typical probability function for a given energy looks like this:               Plot[p2[5, b], {b, 0, 3}]      ![This the plot of probability vs. impact parameter for k=5](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0u7JW.jpg) Notice that there is a spike somewhere near `b=1`, where the probability jumps up to `1`. However, we know that this function is continuous because the probability for the decay of an orbiting resonance is `1`, and the probability will continuously approach `1` for energies both slightly above and slightly below the resonance. Mathematically, the exponent `-2i2[k,b]` just goes to `-Infinity` and so `1-E^(-2i2[k,b])` goes to `1`. Since all of these functions are continuous in this way, the function `pb2[k,b]` should also be continuous, having a value of `0` for `b=0` (since b approaches `0` and `p2[k,b]` approaches something between `0` and `1`), so we should be able to integrate `pb2[k,b]` with respect to b numerically without any issues, thus obtaining `s2[k]` but when I tried to compute `s2[k]` for various `k's` and plot the results, this is what I got:               Plot[s2[k], {k, 1, 10}]      ![This is the supposed plot of cross-section vs. energy](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2UuXU.jpg) Now everything we know about the mathematics and the physics of the situation suggests that the cross-section should be a continuous function of the energy, so what gives? Why did Mathematica integrate a function which is clearly continuous in both of its variables and give me a /dis/continuous function? I think it must have something to do with that last numerical integration, because I was given the following error message: > >     NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect >       one of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, > highly >       oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small. >> >   Like I said, I'm a beginner and don't know how to deal with this stuff. What should I do to get the nice continuous `s2[k]` that I want?
