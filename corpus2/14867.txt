Suppose I have a list of lists, i.e.               list = Table[{x, x^ k}, {k, 1, 10}, {x, 0, 1, 0.05}];      and I want to interpolate each of the lists by a function using `Interpolation` (or another appropriate function). Is there a way to create a function of `k` and `x`, i.e               Table[interpFunct[k] = Interpolation@list[[k]],{k,1,10}]      so I have `interpFunct[1,x]`, `interpFunct[2,x]`, etc. available? I know I can interpolate the surface but the mesh is not structured, which leads to new difficulties that have nothing to do with my needs. Any advice will be very helpfull.
