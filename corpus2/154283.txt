I work at a place where we buy a lot of IT projects. We are currently producing a standard for systems-requirements for the requisition of future projects. In that process, we are discussing whether or not we can demand automated unit testing from our suppliers. I firmly believe that proper automated unit-testing is the only way to document the quality and stability of the code. Everyone else seems to think that unit-testing is an optional method that concerns the supplier alone. Thus, we will make no demands of automated unit-testing, continous testing, coverage-reports, inspections of unit-tests or any of the kind. I find this policy extremely frustrating. Am I totally out of line here? Please provide me with arguments for any of the opinions.
