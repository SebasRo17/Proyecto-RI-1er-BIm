I'm in the process of finishing and delivering a web development project. The contract specifically specified that client is responsible for adding all content and installing. The deliverables specified are the WordPress theme. I ended up using a lot of content from their existing site because I needed it to make sure everything worked as promised. I also included 30 minutes of training to show them how to use the custom dashboard I created. I did the training yesterday and gave the client an admin login so they could inspect my work. I offered to do a staff training session at an additional hourly rate ( original agreement was project priced) and also include the database to use as an example on how to add the content. The client declined and said they would handle the training. They mentioned they were going to do some training today and didn't even ask if they could use my server and installation. I just got 3 emails that new admin accounts were added and it looks like they started migrating some content. Should I tell them that it will be an extra charge for the database or bill them for using the server? This has been one of my largest projects and first time to encounter this situation. What's the professional thing to do without letting them take advantage of me and keep the relationship intact?
