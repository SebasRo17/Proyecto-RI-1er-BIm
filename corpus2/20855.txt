I have a set of points in the plane which I would like to have "glow". I would like for each point to glow individually and I would also like some increase in the intensity corresponding to an increase in density of the points. I've come up with a couple ideas for how to do this using `DensityPlot` but neither are quite what I'm hoping for. I'll describe them below. I need some points, say               pts = Table[{Re[E^(I t/2 - t/10)], Im[E^(I t/2 - t/10)]}, {t, 1, 50}];      The first idea is to consider an density function like $$ \frac{1}{\epsilon + \min_{a \in \text{pts}}\operatorname{dist}((x,y),a)}. $$ My code for this is               eps = 1/16; exponent = 1/2;          distfunc1[x_, y_] =         1/(eps + Min[           Table[              ((x - pts[[k, 1]])^2 + (y - pts[[k, 2]])^2)^(exponent),              {k, 1, Length[pts]}           ]        ]);          Show[        DensityPlot[distfunc1[x, y], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},            PlotPoints -> 40],        Graphics[{PointSize[0.007], Point[pts]}]     ]      which produces ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gEYhF.png) The non-differentiability of the density function leads to sharp divisions between the glows. To get around that I considered adding the distances instead of taking the minimum, like $$ \sum_{a \in \text{pts}} \frac{1}{\epsilon + \operatorname{dist}((x,y),a)}. $$ My definition is               distfunc2[x_, y_] =         Sum[           1/(((x - pts[[k, 1]])^2 + (y - pts[[k, 2]])^2)^(exponent) + eps),           {k, 1, Length[pts]}        ];      By varying the parameters `eps` and `exponent` I can get parts of what I want. For example with `eps = 1/4` and `exponent = 1/2` I get nice smooth glows around the outer points but the inner region becomes too "hot": ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5TAjM.png) With `eps = 1/2` and `exponent = 1/1400` the middle is no longer too hot and has the brightest glow from the density but the outer points no longer have significant idividual glows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y39gz.png) I haven't yet found a way to have a nice strong glow in the center as well as distinct, nontrivial glows for each of the outer points. I appreciate any ideas you may have. Also, I'm new to _Mathematica_ and I don't really know how `ColorFunction` works. Is it easy to increase the range of lights/darks (i.e. increase contrast) in the color function used by `DensityPlot` to render its pictures? I would like the darkest color to be near-black in the above pictures if possible.
