Which is the preferred test package structure for packages containing subpackages: ### Tests in Subpackages?               a/       __init__.py       b.py       c/         __init__.py         cc.py         test/           __init__.py           test_cc.py       d.py       test/         __init__.py         test_b.py         test_d.py      This structure suggests that each subpackage is a cohesive unit that can be tested (and possibly later released) by itself. ### Subpackages in Tests?               a/       __init__.py       b.py       c/         __init__.py         cc.py       d.py       test/         __init__.py         test_b.py         test_c/           __init__.py           test_cc.py         test_d.py      This structure does a better job of keeping the tests in one place, but makes it a little harder to run the tests for a particular subpackage. ### Something else?
