I am trying to learn how to use the `DesignMatrix` function in _Mathematica_ and how to perform a `LeastSquares` fit. I am at end of my rope and seek expert intervention. Say, I have some experimental data and some experimental fit coefficients               size = 20; (*no of points *)      expdata = (Array[#, size] & /@ {x, y, z})~Join~{ConstantArray[1, size]};       coeffs = {{a1, b1, c1, d1}, {e1, f1, g1, h1}, {i1, j1, k1, l1}}; (*can be larger*)       My experimental equations would look like:               lhs = coeffs.expdata; (*Left hand side *)     rhs = Array[#, size] & /@ {u, v, w}; (*Right hand side *)     eqs = Flatten[ Table[ lhs[[#1, i]] == rhs[[#1, i]] & /@ Range[3], {i, 1, size}]];      I know I can solve these equations exactly using the `Solve` function as follows for a small number of data points:               Solve[ eqs, Flatten[coeffs]]       But assuming I have a large number of noisy data points, how do I setup a `LeastSquares` problem. In specific, I’d like to understand how to use the `DesignMatrix` function….
