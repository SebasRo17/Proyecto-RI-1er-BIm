If an estimate is not a promise then as a product owner how can I deliver my projects without knowing how long it will take? Does a Scrum team work more efficiently if we treat time estimates as a promise? How much research (preparation, effort to understand the problem) in a story is enough to come up the right estimate? What about unexpected technical problems (problems that can really mess your initial estimates) that come up after you estimate your work?
