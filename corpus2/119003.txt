Here's a common situation:   * You need to implement a bulk operation in an application that uses an ORM framework.   * After the first pass, you've noticed significant performance problems. Here's my question:   * In this situation, should you _favor_ a solution that includes raw SQL?   * Or are there well-known design patterns that can help you mitigate problems that are commonly associated with bulk operations with ORM frameworks? **EDIT:**   * I'm not asking if you should remove the ORM framework from the entire application.   * I'm asking: Should you forgo the ORM framework for this small slice of the application?
