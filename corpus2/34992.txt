I'd like to write a function that behaves one way when the argument is a _Mathematica_ date, such as `{2013,12,15}`, or with added hours, minutes and seconds if necessary. And the function needs to do something different with strings that will look like > 2013 Month 02 I see that I can specify List, as in `f[x_List]` and `f[x_String]` that will do what I want as long as I don't mess up the arguments. Is there way to be more specific about the patterns that are allowed?
