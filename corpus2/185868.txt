I sent out an email earlier reminding our developers that, _the use of the word, 'Shall', in your derived requirements should not follow over to your functional requirements. When writing functional requirements the word, 'Must', is used to describe the function a derived requirement must do.   Derived = System Shall be requirement   Functional = System must do requirment_ It was sent back by one of our Seniors that, that was wrong and that shall should be used in every requirement. Am I wrong here and Shall should be used in every requirement. I haven't been able to find anything to back that up.
