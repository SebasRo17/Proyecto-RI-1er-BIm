I'm relatively new to mathematica and I can't find the error here. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that vx, vy, vz aren't blue on my mathematica - as in, they already have some assigned values. But I don't know how that would have happened. I get the error "Supplied equations are not differential equations of the given functions." Code:               DSolve[{vx'[t] == (fx*c^2 - vx[t]*(fx*vx[t] + fy*vy[t] + fz*vz[t]))/(m*(c^2*Sqrt[          1 - (vx[t]^2 + vy[t]^2 + vz[t]^2)/c^2] + vx[t]^2 + vy[t]^2 + vz[t]^2)),              vy'[t] == (fy*c^2 - vy[t]*(fx*vx[t] + fy*vy[t] + fz*vz[t]))/(m*(c^2*Sqrt[          1 - (vx[t]^2 + vy[t]^2 + vz[t]^2)/c^2] + vx[t]^2 + vy[t]^2 + vz[t]^2)),              vz'[t] == (fz*c^2 - vz[t]*(fx*vx[t] + fy*vy[t] + fz*vz[t]))/(m*(c^2*Sqrt[          1 - (vx[t]^2 + vy[t]^2 + vz[t]^2)/c^2] + vx[t]^2 + vy[t]^2 + vz[t]^2)), vx[0] == 1, vy[0] == 1, vz[0] == 1}, {vx, vy, vz},t]
