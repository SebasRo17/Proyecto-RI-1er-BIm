how is it possible to divide two equations with Mathematica? I have the following code:               eqn416 = a == Kp h (1 - E^(-ta/tau))     eqn417 = a/2 == Kp h (1 - E^(-ta2/tau))      Obviously one will get               2 E^(-(ta2/tau)) - E^(-(ta/tau)) == 1      by dividing them, but with               Eliminate[{eqn416, eqn417}, {Kp, h, a}]      I only get 'True'. And if I try just to eliminate 2 of them and assuming afterwards 'a' is not zero               Eliminate[{eqn416, eqn417}, {Kp, h}];     %[[2]]     FullSimplify[%, a != 0]      I'm not getting rid of 'a'!               FullSimplify[a (1 + E^(-(ta/tau)) - 2 E^(-(ta2/tau))) == 0,       a != 0]     (* Out[434]= a (1 + E^(-(ta/tau)) - 2 E^(-(ta2/tau))) == 0 *)      Any suggestions?
