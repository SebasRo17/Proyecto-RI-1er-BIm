I am trying to rotate a series of lines by the same angle around their centre point. Say each line is defined by a co-ordinate at each end, simplified example below of a typical dataset.               foo = {{{100, 25}, {150, 45}}, {{200, 45}, {240, 85}}};      Then the midpoint can be found by:-               boo = (#[[2]] - #[[1]])/2 + #[[1]] & /@ foo;      This is visualised using the code below:               Show[     Graphics[{Thick, Dashed, Black, Line /@ foo}],     Graphics[{Black, PointSize[Large],     Point[boo],     Table[{Black, Text[ToString[boo[[p]]], boo[[p]] + 2]}, {p, Length[boo]}]}]     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zmjPE.jpg) I was hoping to create a series of transformations using RotationTransform such as below:               rot = RotationTransform[Pi/2, #] & /@ boo      Then mapping this across foo using MapThread, but I'm not sure which function I should be mapping across to make each line rotate by 90 degrees around its own centre point.               MapThread[?, {woo, rot}]      I think I'm close to what I want to achieve (or maybe not), but I can't quite seem to close it out. All suggestions welcome.
