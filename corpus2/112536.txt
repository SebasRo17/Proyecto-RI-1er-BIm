In my place of work, we have a number of applications that seem to interact in a rather ad-hoc, haphazard way, and I feel I need to understand system integration better. I'm currently deciding whether to do an SOA School Profesional Certification. The certifications are well recognised, but from what I've read of them, I'm a bit concerned that even after I've passed the exams, I won't really be in a position to implement what I've learned, or that the information won't be hugely useful in my day to day job as a developer. It all seems a bit too theoretical. Will it be any practical use to me? Also, I've heard the 150 page booklet that costs $300 is not enough to prepare you for the exam. Is this correct? **Edit** Really, what this comes down to is whether SOA is really going to be the answer to my integration problems. At the moment, it seems to be the de facto answer.
