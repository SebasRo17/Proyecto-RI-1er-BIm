I have developed an open source PHP application and currently it uses both the MySQLi or MySQL extension for backwards compatibility. I'm wondering about switching it over to only be compatible with MySQLi since PHP now no longer supports the MySQL. Another reason I'd like to get away from supporting both MySQL and MySQLi is that I'm basically using MySQLi the same way I do as with the old MySQL extension. Can anyone explain to me if this is a good or bad idea?
