Some use this convention:               private String event;     public getEvent() { return this.event; }      public setEvent(String value) { this.event = value; }          private int id;      ... same as above ...      In some projects they define all the fields first, all static fields after (or before), all public/private variables, then the setters, getters, other methods. Which do you use and why?
