I need advice and I would appreciate your help. I recently got accepted for two internships, both require me to work 20 hours a week, and am wondering, is it wise to accept both and work 40 hours a week as an intern for both companies, is that even possible? I am interested in both to be honest and its hard for me to choose between them, yet I am afraid that doing both will be too much for me to handle. On the other hand, if I work for both I can be in a more stable state (money wise) and it would help me a lot in paying my college funds (among other stuff). I need some advice please?
