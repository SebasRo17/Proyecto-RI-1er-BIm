I would like some input on how to handle clients and third party vendors that ask me about the deficiencies in my design. For example. It turns out I need a data field in a webservices response. This response has been signed off on weeks ago and I get questions like " _Why haven't you identified this field X weeks ago?_ ". Of course the answer is that all software development is iterative and this requirement wasn't on my radar at that point in time. I'm not prescient. I would like a business-y way of deflecting these questions. Any advice? **Update** : To clarify, this shortcoming is completely on me. How do I then own up to this mistake cleanly, without sounding too apologetic?
