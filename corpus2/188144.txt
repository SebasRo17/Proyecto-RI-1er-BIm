I have been studying condition coverage for last few days. In a book "The Art of Software Testing" they highlight that it does not assure decision coverage, because for example > IF(A && B) `A=True, B=false` and `A=False,B=True` satisfies the condition coverage but the decision is always `False`. I wonder, how can this satisfy the coverage? The `True` value of `B` will actually never be tested because of short circuiting so how it can satisfy the coverage?
