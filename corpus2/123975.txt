I am planning to use boost libraries, as it is quiet rich, and will save lots of time. But my question is, what are the guidelines i have to follow, so that   1. I can replace some part of boost with standard C++ as and when they are supported, considering so many new features are coming in C++11.   2. Also, how to encapsulate them in a way so that i have to change least when i change platform/compiler/boost version.   3. Also is there a category which suggest, which portion of the library to use and avoid, considering stability and standard.
