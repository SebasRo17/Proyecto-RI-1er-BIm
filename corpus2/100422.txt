Would it be worth taking Automata over Databases or Networking assuming no immediate plans on a Masters degree in Computer Science? I'd assume I'd learn things in there that would somehow be real work applicable like complexity theory but is it more useful immediately out of school or better to do a course somewhere post baccalaureate and take something more obviously applicable in its place? I've limited slots left or I'd take all of them.
