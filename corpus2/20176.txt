I'm using ListLinePlot to plot a list containing 10 lists, using the default colors:               ListLinePlot[myList]      I would like to be able to keep the default PlotStyle options for the 9 first lists, but not for the last one. I tried to do:               myStyle = Append[Table[{Automatic}, {9}], {Green,Thickness[0.01]}];     ListLinePlot[myList, PlotStyle -> {myStyle}]      but all the lists are plotted in {Green,Thickness[0.01]} What's the best way to do that?
