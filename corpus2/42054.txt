When I try to solve this equation using Mathematica:               Solve[Exp[b*x]-c*(x^2)-a*x-1 == 0, x] /. {a -> 6.336, b -> 8, c -> 32}      I don't get any result and this error message: > Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients or the system > obtained by direct rationalization of inexact numbers present in the system. > Since many of the methods used by Solve require exact input, providing Solve > with an exact version of the system may help. > > Out[60]= Solve[-1 + E^(8 x) - 6.336 x - 32 x^2 == 0, x] I also tried Reduce and Nsolve instead of Solve with no luck!! Note that I don't get even the obvious solution of x==0. Although I would like to have a solution with x!=0.
