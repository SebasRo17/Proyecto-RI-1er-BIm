Example: Try this example only if you have > 4G ram               d = 2000;      f[x_, y_, d_] =           Sum[Subscript[a, i, j]*x^i*y^j,             {i, 0, d - 1}, {j, 0, d - i}];      Then               Clear[f]      or               f[x_, y_, d_] =.      You will see that the memory usage is not reduced after calling `Clear` or using `Unset`. _**Question: How to free the memory when I don't need a function anymore which is already evaluated?_** Edit: I look at the memory usage in taskmgr under Windows OS. As the answers report that the memory is indeed reduce by using MemoryInUse to check it.
