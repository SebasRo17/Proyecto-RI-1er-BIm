this is my first post but you have already helped me so many times that I have to start by saying thanks a lot! I have a really long calculation to do, and I have used the Evaluation->Kernel configuration options to create 2 new local kernels and divided the task in three groups of little ones. The problem is that I don't know how to share the information between different notebooks running on different local kernels. Can you help me? Thanks again anyway.
