I a student and have good knowledge in C programming and like to contribute any open source project which is developed in C. I searched sourceforge and selected 7-Zip because its widely used one and developed using C. I thought to start first by fixing bugs (which was suggested by many people in their websites) and gone through few bugs but couldn't understand how to respond to them and how to start fixing them.. I didn't understand anything. Could you please explain how to approach this.. I have even gone through some files in the source code which I downloaded but didn't understood anything. Please help me!
