I'm trying to define a function `myFunc` with a special case:               myFunc[x_, y_] = (x^2 - y) Log[x^2 - y];     myFunc[x_, x_^2] = 0;      This seems to work in limited cases only:               In[1] := myFunc[x, x^2]     Out[1] = 0      But if I put in numbers, or anything else, it fails. How would I fix this?               In[2] := myFunc[2.1, 2.1^2]     Out[2] = Indeterminate          In[3] := myFunc[a^2, a^4]     Out[3] = Indeterminate      I am more interested in making case with numbers to work. What should I do?
