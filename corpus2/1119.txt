Mathematica has numerous built-in data for **science** and **math**. Every first call to a data function in a new Mathematica session will "re-initialize indices" (download the data). Is there a way to store this data locally to save time on the next data call after Mathematica is restarted? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bUkv8.png) **======== Edit: further thoughts with Leonid's answer ========** After Leonid posted his answer, I decided to update this question – the title and content. I would ask about this anyway – so may as well do it here. The point is not in whether data were cached or not, but really in a method to speed up the load process. I just confused caching and loading. I do not want to take away “best answer” from Spartacus, because he did answer what I asked ideally, thanks. But thank you very much Leonid for posting your answer too. +1 to both of you.
