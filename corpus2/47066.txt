What `ComplexityFunction` (or other technique) can I use to have Mathematica pull things out of fractions? I have a rational function of several variables and I'd like to have Math'ca simplify, e.g.,               x(... + y(... + wz)) + ...     --------------------------                 xyz      to               x(... + y(...)) + ....     ---------------------- + w               xyz      ? I've already told it that the relevant variables (in the denominator) are nonzero. I was thinking of counting complexity as `LeafCount` plus the `LeafCount` of numerators, but I'm not sure how to do that.
