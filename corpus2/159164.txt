This is some sort of follow up to an older question of me. So I put the GPLv3 license into the project which contains my script and also added the copyright notice and copying permission statement to the top of my script. Now, apart from the script, the package also contains files which are helpful for using the script (e.g. a bash completion file and unit tests) but which are not relevant for the script to actually work. Do I also need to put copyright notice/permission in there? I've looked into some projects on github, and most don't seem to add these information to accompanying things. Still, I'm unsure what's the best approach.
