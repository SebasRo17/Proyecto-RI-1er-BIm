_Motivation--- I have a glimmer of an idea that a convergent sum could be considered a self-referential number similar to a fractal. I would like to play with it for a while._ I have the following convergent sum:               NSum[((1/Pochhammer[m^2 + 1, m]) + (1/Pochhammer[m^2 + m + 1, 2 m])),       {m, 1, Infinity}, WorkingPrecision -> 50]        Is there a way to show the internals of about 4 or 5 steps?
