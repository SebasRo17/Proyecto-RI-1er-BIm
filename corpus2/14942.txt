This question was prompted by a comment left on another question pointing to this article. What Is Clean Code? I was thinking about how that sentiment can be applied to shared resources (servers, etc). What are some of the ways you've found that work to ensure that when others use a shared server they clean up after themselves?   * Delete files / folders after one time use (after a fix or upgrade)   * Leave the desktop clean of crap   * Dont install software that they can use on their desktop    * Dont create filesystem shares not needed for the solution Oh Yes, the applies mostly to a windows server environment, in a team of developers + support staff of about 25. I know there are a few ways to tackle the problem, so what have you guys found that works?
