What kind of information do you require from the project management team before you can proceed on a project? Is there a certain format they utilize on Programming Requests which helps you to understand exactly how the development team can succeed with this project. Example: I always like it when project managers mock up forms. It helps significantly to know how they are visualizing the UI for many tasks. Any suggestions on how we can assist the Project Management team in issuing Programming Requests that are as clear as day will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
