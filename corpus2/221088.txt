I am currently working on an open source PHP script and trying to adopt an attribution license. The ones that I found are CC 3.0: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ and CPAL 1.0: http://opensource.org/licenses/CPAL-1.0 They seems very similar to me. What's the difference, pros and cons? What I want is:   1. Allow use for free and commercial work, modify it to suit their needs if required, but can not redistribute it as a new product or with a different name (no sublicensing?). EDIT: I am bit confused about CPAL license on this, what does it allow and disallow?   2. Copyright info in the source codes can not be removed   3. Copyright attribution on the frontend and backend (admin panel) can not be removed. But I will adopt dual licensing model by adding commercial license to allow removing them with a fee (only the frontend and backend, not the copyright info in the source codes).   4. Any plugins or themes created for this script doesn't need to adopt my license as long as the main source codes are not modified, it can be any license(commercial, MIT, GPL, CC, CPAL) adopted by the authors. I think that's basically it. I am also open to suggestions for other kinds of license types and why
