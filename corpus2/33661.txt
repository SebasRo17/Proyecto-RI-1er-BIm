I'm trying to create a "template" notebook for myself.   I want to get input from a single `InputField`, and then run a few operations on it. **How can I make the`InputFiled` (that is, the box itself) be prettier?** How can I manipulate it's style? **EDIT:**   I was asked to define prettier (which stands to reason).   So let's have _WolframAlpha's_ (website) input box as a refrence point.
