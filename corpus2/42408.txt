Has anyone gotten _RLink_ to work with _Rtools_ (or even tried)? If so a simple step-by-step would be much appreciated ! When attempting to access any _Rtools_ functionality through _RLink_ I get: > The following R error was encountered: Error in system(cmd, intern = \ > !verbose) : 'C:/Program' not found Background: I'm trying to get data in and out of the _RStan_ package with _Mathematica_ (mostly because _Mathematica_ is the program I've used most for manipulating data and the more I can do in _Mathematica_ the less time I'll have to spend learning how to manipulate the data in _R_ ) and _Rtools_ is required for _RStan_. Thanks for the responses- Some new info in response to the comments: I installed R 2.15.3 (since version 3 doesn't work with RLink in Windows yet) Then:               InstallR["RHomeLocation" -> "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.15.3"]      And that works for the basic RLink functionality. Through the R command line, I got the required packages installed. Then restart Mathematica, and check to make sure the packages are installed (which they are) and accessible - at least at the level that `REvaluate["library(Rcpp)"]` and `REvaluate["library(rstan)"]` both seem to work - returning a list of the loaded libraries. But then either running the "hello world" example from https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started or trying to use any of the rstan commands results in the above error. Any further thoughts?
