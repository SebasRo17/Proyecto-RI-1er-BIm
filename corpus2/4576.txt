In a stacked `BarChart` or `Histogram` the bars are stacked from bottom to top, while the legend entries are listed from top to bottom. Is there a way to make the legend entries go the other way round to improve the visual correspondence between the chart and the legend? E.g.               {bottom,middle,top}=RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0,1],{3,200}];     Histogram[{bottom,middle,top},10,ChartLayout->"Stacked",ChartLegends->{"Bottom","Middle","Top"}]      ![histogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mc0PT.png)
