Customers need some education because they think different. Customers think:   * changes are not a problem in any time of the project   * details are not important (exceptions even less)   * time does not cost money (they have a fix price agreed)   * one sentence in the specification can be extended/read freely to fit the actual needs - and this does not affect the contract. (here we see often the "common sense" discussion - example: "Of course we need a invoice management screen when we talk about accounting managment - this is common sense!")   * the list goes on... The main problem is that customer (no matter if external or internal/department) do not want or can not understand. It took me many years to understand software creation process and I am still learning, so how can they in just a few months. What is your experience, what is the best approach to educate customers?
