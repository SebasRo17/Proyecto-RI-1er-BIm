I have been a software developer for years now. I have been working in big companies using their own standard and tools. I have always been able to use some of my favourite tools, like Intellij as my main java IDE, but it can not be always the case. I have also been forced to use some crappy tools (bloatwares source versionning, broken quality insurance application, ...) and frameworks I would happily have replaced by another. What can I do to find a 'perfect' mission, where using my tools will be the norm, or at least not forbidden? Or even better, how can I find a job using a non mainstream framework? I don't want to sacrifice the payroll for my tools of choice, so joining a cheap start-up won't be a solution. I'm not looking for a job offer, but more on tips used by the lucky developers that have found a perfect matching job.
