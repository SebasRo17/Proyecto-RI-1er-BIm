Following up on ndroock1's question, I naively tried to apply the solutions to a 3D point and polygon and they didn't work. For example, functions involving `ArcTan` that are used in kguler's answer don't work with three arguments, Mac's answer doesn't consider the 3rd dimension at all, the undocumented function `Graphics`Mesh`PointWindingNumber` doesn't work in 3D, and complex numbers only map to 2D planes. And so on. So, is there any way to **check if a 3D point is in a 3D planar polygon?**
