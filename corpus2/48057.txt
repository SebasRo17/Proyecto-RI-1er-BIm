I know how to create a function from concrete expression like               Function[{x, y}, x^2 + y^2]      But what if I have a list of expressions list1 and I know the set of variables which can occur in this list. I want to map all expressions of list1 to curresponding functions from these variables. Like               {x^2 + y^2, z^2, x, y}      should be mapped to               {       Function[{x,y,z}, x^2 + y^2],        Function[{x, y, z}, z^2],        Function[{x,y,z}, x],        Function[{x,y,z}, y]     }      I've tried               Function[{x,y,z}, #] &/@ list1      but this doesn't work. Can someone help me with solution?
