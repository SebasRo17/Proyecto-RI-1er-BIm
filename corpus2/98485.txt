What is a negative side of your TDD experience? Do you find baby steps (the simplest fix to make test green) annoying and useless? Do you find no-value tests (when test has sense initially but in final implementation checks the same logic as other test) maintanence critical? etc. The questions above are about things which I am uncomfortable with during my TDD experience. So I am interested whether other developers have similar feelings and what do they think about them. Would be thankful for the links to articles describing negative sides of TDD (Google is fullfilled by positive and often fanatic articles).
