**Edit** From the comments I received and verifying the information about CDF at wolfram.com, it appears that it is presently impossible to embed CDF into iBooks. WRI does not appear to be happy with this state of affairs, and promises to provide updates if and when CDF for the iPad is supported by Apple. * * * My question is related to an earlier question, How can I embed a Manipulate...in my website using CDF?. Has anyone had success in getting CDF to work in Apple iBooks? There are some lovely examples of how to use Computable Document Format (CDF) to embed Mathematica applets into electronic textbooks in Pearson's Calculus: Early Transcendentals textbook. See also Eric Schulz's Sharing Wisdom Gained in Publishing a CDF ebook and a video by him here. Apple's iBooks Author does not currently accept code such as that shown in the Vornoi diagram example. It does have an Author widget, called HTML, for accepting HTML in DashCode. Before learning to use DashCode (or seeking out someone who does) I'd like to know whether this is a promising option for publishing CDF applets in ebooks. Any help would be appreciated.
