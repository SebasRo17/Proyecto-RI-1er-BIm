I have several sets of 20 images I need to import. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l0yz5.png) Each time they have different categories. "Name"<>"Cat"<>"No" Electric B 1 for example. I need to create lists that contain the images for those different categories. As of now this is what i am doing :               importOne[set_, cat_, num_] :=       ImageResize[       Import[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[], set,               set <> cat <> ToString[num] <> ".png"}]], 128]                    ElectricB = importOne["Electric", "B", #] & /@ Range[6];     ElectricC = importOne["Electric", "C", #] & /@ Range[5];     ElectricN = importOne["Electric", "N", #] & /@ Range[5];     ElectricE = importOne["Electric", "E", #] & /@ Range[4];      And then, thanks to previous question/answers : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VTO9P.jpg) **What would be a more efficient mean to import automatically for different sets ?** As of now I need to repeat this operation for each set.
