My question is rather a design question. In my program I got to a data structure that looks something like this:               private ConcurrentHashMap<A, ConcurrentHashMap<B, ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, C>>> services  = new ConcurrentHashMap<A, ConcurrentHashMap<B, ConcurrentHashMap<Integer, C>>>();      Is there a way to handle such a data structure more elegantly? Thanks! **edit** : A, B and C are business classes. An A instance "can have" (as association) many Bs and a B "can have" many mappings Integer-C.
