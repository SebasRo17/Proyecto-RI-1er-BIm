I want to make a plot , where the data is structured like so               { {"l1", "l2"}, n1, n2, n3} }      The values in the inner sub list are labels which are associated with each data point. Each distinct "l2" should be on the 'x' axis (like a histogram bin). Therefore I want to plot ("l2", n1) and ("l2", n2). The point generated by using ("l2", n1) should be labeled with "l1", and the point generated with ("l2", n2) should be labeled with "l2" any repeated values are ignored.               exampleData = {       {{"A", "B"}, -1, -2, 0.5},       {{"C", "B"}, -3, -2, 0.6},       {{"D", "A"}, -5, -6, 0.7}     };      For example from the above data we would plot   * (B, -1) label A   * (B, -2) label B   * (B, -3) label C    * (B, -2) label B (* ignore this one since we plotted the same point *)   * (A, -5) label D   * (A, -6) label A The xAxis Position can be obtained by using a replacement list like so:               rules = {"A" -> 1, "B" -> 2}      The plot should have 3 points above B and two points above A and each point should be labelled.
