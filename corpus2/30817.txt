I'm developing a package that contains a function that requires evaluation of an expensive `Table`, so I use `ParallelTable` instead. It works correctly, but always gives an error message, repeatedly, for each kernel, like this: > `Table::iterb: Iterator {mypackage`Private`m,1,mypackage`Private`nsrc$663} > does not have appropriate bounds` How can I avoid this error? Do I need to distribute variables explicitly?
