I have a list of GPS coordinates.E.g.               GPSList = {{47.680800, 17.626446}, {47.681078, 17.627283}, {47.682759,          17.631810}};      I would like to crate a Google Map of the part of the city (GyÅ‘r) with some signs. If I could do that, I could change simple red dots to discs or bars showing data.               Show[CountryData["Hungary", {"Shape", "Equirectangular"}],       Axes -> True,       Epilog -> {PointSize[0.01], Red, Point[Reverse /@ GPSList]}]      The resolution of that is not enough.
