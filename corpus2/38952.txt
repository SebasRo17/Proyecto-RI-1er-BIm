I searched and did not find similar answers which can resolve the 'no precision loss' issue. A sample string is:               "-5.100686209408900133332e+02 -1.294005398404007344443e+01 -2.59376479781563728887e+02 -1.3043629998334040122222e+02"      If I immediately convert them into real variable by `ImportString` or `StringToDouble`, then there will be precision loss, the resulted precision is only `$MachinePrecision`. How to convert them into real number which should have higher precision than `$MachinePrecision`.
