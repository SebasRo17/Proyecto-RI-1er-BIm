From time to time I have tried some monitors. My main work is coding (work, phd, etc). At work I have an LG Flatron L246WH which I highly recommend. However at home I have an LG W2363V with which I feel pretty uncomfortable when coding. Fonts, subpixels or whatever mess with my minds when using smooth fonts. Currently, what are the best monitors out there, to best fit our needs?
