I have this question on coding Newton's method in _Mathematica_. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bCHim.jpg) I have some code to go by but I have no clue if it's computing the functions in the right order. The book is the numerical methods 4th edition by Faries.               NewtonsMethodList [f_, {x_, x0_}, n_] := NestList[# - (Function[x, f][#]*Derivative[1][Function[x, f]][#])/(         Derivative [1] [Function[x, f]^2][#] -           Function[x, f][#]*Derivative[2][Function[x, f]][#]) &, x0, n]
