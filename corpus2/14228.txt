Table[Mean[OrderDistribution[{NormalDistribution[], 4}, i]], {i, 1, 4}] // N     (* {-1.02938, -6.47326, 0.297011, 1.02938} *)      Above are the means of order statistics from a random sample of size $n=4$ from a standard normal distribution. Now, the problem is that the second element in the output is wrong; it should be `-0.2970111` because of symmetry. Also, the first and last elements of this array are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, due to symmetry. I'm using _Mathematica_ 8.0.
