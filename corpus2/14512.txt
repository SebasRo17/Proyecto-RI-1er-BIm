I have a List containing vectors. The coordinates are random numbers:               r = {RandomReal[{-1, 1}, n], RandomReal[{-1, 1}, n], RandomReal[{-1, 1}, n]};      Now I want to calculate the Norm of each Vector (into another List). Is this possible without a loop? Something like               Norm[r,2]      Where 2 is the dimension (columns) in which the norm should be calculated.
