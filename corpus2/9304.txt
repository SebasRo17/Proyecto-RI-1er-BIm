I have the following question: I have a file that has structure:               x1 y1 z1 f1     x2 y2 z2 f2     ...     xn yn zn fn      I can easily visualize it with _Mathematica_ using `ListContourPlot3D`. But could you please tell me how I can plot contour plot for this surface? I mean with these data I have a set of surfaces corresponding to different isovalues (f) and I want to plot intersection between all these surfaces and some certain plane. I tried to Google but didn't get any results. Any help and suggestions are really appreciated. Thanks in advance!
