I am trying to solve a system of coupled nonlinear PDEs in a rectangular region with the new FEM solver in Mathematica 10. However, I come across an error stating > NDSolveValue::femnonlinear: Nonlinear coefficients are not supported in this > version of NDSolve. Is there any workaround? I find it hard to believe that this task should not be possible. Do I have to adjust the method of the solver? Here is my complete code:               Ω = Rectangle[{0, 0}, {2, 2}];     pdes={        \!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(∂\), \(t\)]\(u[t, x, y]\)\) -           Inactive[Laplacian][u[t, x, y], {x, y}] ==          0.6 u[t, x, y] - v[t, x, y] - u[t, x, y]^3,        \!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(∂\), \(t\)]\(v[t, x, y]\)\) -           Inactive[Laplacian][v[t, x, y], {x, y}] ==          1.5 u[t, x, y] - 2 v[t, x, y]        };     c = {        (** ic **)        u[0, x, y] == Exp[-5 ((x - 3/2)^2 + (y - 3/2)^2)],        v[0, x, y] == Exp[-5 ((x - 1/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2)]        (** blank bc = noflux **)        };     {usol, vsol} = NDSolveValue[{pdes, c},        {u, v},         {x, y} ∈ Ω,        {t, 0, 2 π}        ];
