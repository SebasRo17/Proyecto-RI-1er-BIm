The title is the topic, since I'm mainly a web developer,my hacking ability is limited to those loose type languages like PHP and Javascript. But I want to be more capable programmer. I saw Hip Hop PHP made by Facebook and realized that C++ is a must, I mean they reduced the CPU usage by 50% and added 1.8% performance improvement. So I made up my mind that I need to get serious in C++ language. Can you please show me where to start, some friendly tutorials. because I read some tutorials in C++ and noticed that it's very different from PHP.
