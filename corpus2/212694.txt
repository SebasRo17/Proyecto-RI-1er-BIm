I have gone through many articles and I am still confused whether to use the Unit of Work pattern or not. I use generic repositories (Repository Pattern) but if my understanding of the UOW pattern is correct, most persistence tools today offer a unit of work pattern already implemented (DbContext, ObjectContext, DbSet). I want to know if, in such cases, we should not try to implement the UOW pattern altogether? or I did see in one of the articles (sorry can't reference it since I missed it somewhere) that they had wrapped the DbContext inside an UOW class and I was left wondering what reason they might have of doing so.
