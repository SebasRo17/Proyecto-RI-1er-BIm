I'm working on an application, and adding logging, but now I'm stuck. I want to allow ( _not force!_ ) the user to set the location of the logfile. Basically, my problem is:   * logger initialization should be the first thing the program does   * but I can't initialize the logger until I determine where the user wants the log to be saved   * determining where the log should be saved ... is a process that should be logged How is this problem solved? Are log file locations not user-customizable? Is log output buffered until a logfile is set?
