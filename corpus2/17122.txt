I am trying to make a TreeGraph[] that has as labels for vertices both text and Tooltip. The text displays all the time, when the `TreeGraph` is plotted, and in addition, when the mouse moves over the vertex, another text shows up using `Tooltip` (may be below the static text, but I'll worry about this later). This Tooltip text will contain more information about the node. Right now, I can do each one of the above separately but can't figure how to combine them. I'll show my attempts below. This is all using V9 ### Tooltip shows up when mouse on vertex               TreeGraph[{1, 2, 3}, {1 -> 2, 1 -> 3},      VertexLabels -> {"Name", 3 -> Placed["equation 1", Tooltip]},       ImagePadding -> 20]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W3WTT.png) ### standard vertex label               TreeGraph[{1, 2, 3}, {1 -> 2, 1 -> 3},      VertexLabels -> {"Name"}, ImagePadding -> 20]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2FHgK.png) # Attempts to combine them I noticed that it says in the help that any expression can be used as label: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QiH3i.png) ### attempt 1 Since any expression can be used as label, then I tried `Column`               TreeGraph[{1, 2, 3}, {1 -> 2, 1 -> 3},      VertexLabels -> {"Name",         3 -> Column[{"3", Placed["equation 1", Tooltip]}]},       ImagePadding -> 20]      Which does not work. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOtqH.png) ### attempt 2               TreeGraph[{1, 2, 3}, {1 -> 2, 1 -> 3},      VertexLabels -> {"Name",         3 -> Labeled[Placed["equation 1", Tooltip], "3"]},       ImagePadding -> 20]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RiMbR.png) ### attempt3 The strange thing is that one can add a button that changes the color of the node and speaks when clicked and also add a Tooltip at the same time, but so hard to add a text in addition to Tooltip               TreeGraph[{1, 2, Button[Style[3, Red], Speak["Vertex 3"]]}, {1 -> 2,        1 -> 3}, VertexLabels -> {"Name",         3 -> Placed["equation 1", Tooltip]}, ImagePadding -> 20]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E4hdT.png) Tried maybe another 10 different ways, too boring to show. So I gave up. I am a newbie in using Graphs in Mathematica, only today I started looking at them. **Question** How make a label for Vertex and also show Toolip when mouse is on Vertex?
