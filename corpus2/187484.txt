I have two resources: users and links. Users can have several links associated with them. I have designed my RESTful API so that you can reach the links associated with a user at the following URI: `/users/:id/links` However, I always need to have a URI for just links â€“ sometimes I might want all links, regardless of user. For this I have: `/links` Does this sound okay? Having two URIs for links? I wonder if I should instead reach the links for a user with a URI such as: `/links/user/:id` or `/links/?user=:id` This way, I only have one resource for links.
