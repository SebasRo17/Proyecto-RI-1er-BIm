I have a database table holding 40 million records (table A). Each record has a string a user can search for. I also have a table with a list of character replacements (table B) i.e. i = Y, I = 1 etc. I need to be able to take the string a user is searching for, iterate through each letter and create an array of every possible outcome (the users string, then each outcome with alternative letters used). I need to check for alternatives on both lower and uppercase letters in the word A search string can be no longer than 10 characters long. I'm using PHP and a MySQL database. Does anyone have any thoughts / articles / guidance on doing this in an efficient way?
