Unfortunately, somebody has taught our upper management the word "Agile" and now they want us to move towards it. I have a peripheral understanding of agile (in principle) but have never used it in practice. From what I know, it will not be a good fit for our organization. Right now, things are pretty grungey. Here's how it is; We're a very small team - two developers, one DBA, one designer. The company I work for makes a disproportionately large amount of money relative to its size, and nearly 95% of that is pure online sales. From a development perspective, we are subjected to many desk invasions during a typical day (we're tech support as well as dev), work can regularly just fall out of the sky at a moments notice if a sales team member promises something to someone. We do undertake larger projects too, and they're a nightmare with the constant interruptions. Some of us are starting to tear our hair out! Project plans are drawn up by non technical managers in excel spreadsheets, where they try and break the task down into bite-sized sentences that they can understand and put a date beside each one. These dates are always hideously unrealistic and often missed, and our meetings (which we have around weekly) are regularly filled with awkward moments with people asking "why hasn't this been done yet". I am pretty sure Agile isn't the one for us. Now, given that (and i have tried) this company _will not change its ways_ , and only the dev team is willing to change, is there a development methodology that we could adopt which is a good fit for just saving us some sanity?
