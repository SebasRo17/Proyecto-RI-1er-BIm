Programmers are largely responsible for helping move a product from design to implementation. This process is always full of snags:   * implementation details rear their ugly head and make parts of the design infeasible   * user feedback on early prototypes leads to changes in the design   * new technologies alter the field of what is possible, bringing back designs previously thought impossible   * priorities shift, schedules change, and requirements wander How do you keep design and implementation in contact during the implementation? What processes do you use? Tools? Artifacts? Guidelines? Communication strategies?
