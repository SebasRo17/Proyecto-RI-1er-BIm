How might I construct a function called `EmToPX[p]` such that the following 2 `InputField`s would be the same width. If not please explain why doing such isn't possible.               InputField["a", ImageSize -> 100]     InputField["a", FieldSize -> EmToPX[100]]      After some trial an error ~7.2 appears to be the proper number of EMs above( `InputField["a", FieldSize -> 7.2]`), but after trying to convert to a function using proper ratios it appears such technique doesn't work very well.               EmToPX[p_] := (N[         p (1.888888 + CurrentValue[EvaluationNotebook[], "FontSize"]) ]);     Manipulate[      Column[{        InputField["a", ImageSize -> EmToPX[a]],        InputField["a", FieldSize -> a],        EmToPX[7.2]        }]      , {a, 1, 100}      ]      **Background:** Ultimately I am working with `Grid` elements and would like an easy way to switch back and froth between `CellSize`,`ImageSize`,`ItemSize`,`FieldSize`.
