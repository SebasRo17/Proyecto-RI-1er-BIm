Do you have any pointers on how one should go about implementing the oAuth2 protocol itself? That is, the server side or the "provider" facet of OAuth2? If you have tried to implement (a part of) it, please share the issues and the solutions. Note that this is completely technology and programming language agnostic - except, of course, for the de-facto standard cryptological technologies that might be involved. The IETF draft (v23) for oAuth2 is located here
