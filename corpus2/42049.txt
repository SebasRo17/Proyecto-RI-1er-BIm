I'm using a theoretical answer found on the official Wolfram site as a reference to ensure my code isn't faulty (even though I'm fairly confident that my original code is half decent).               sol = DSolve[y'[x] + x*y[x] == Cos[x^2], y, x]      > >     {{y -> Function[{x}, E^(-(x^2/2)) C[1] + 1/2 E^(-(x^2/2)) Sqrt[Ï€/10] >              (Sqrt[1 + 2 I] Erfi[Sqrt[1/2 - I] x] + Sqrt[1 - 2 I] > Erfi[Sqrt[1/2 + I] x])]}} >                 Plot[Evaluate[y[x] /. sol /. {C[1] -> 1}], {x, -7, 7}, PlotRange -> All]      The output shown of the Wolfram site actually shows a nice looking plot. On my display all I get is `-Graphics-`. There is no plot. Why is this?
