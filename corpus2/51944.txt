Evaluating a double integral with bivariate normal distribution yileds widely different results depending on the method used. I define a bivariate normal distribution with {10, 3} and {8, 1.5} as mean and standard deviation for each and a correlation coefficient of 0.5.               f[x_ , y_] =        Simplify[PDF[MultinormalDistribution[{10,8}, {{9, 0.5 1.5 3}, {0.5 1.5 3, 2.25}}],          {x, y}]];     F[x_ , y_] =        Simplify[CDF[MultinormalDistribution[{10, 8}, {{9, 0.5 1.5 3}, {0.5 1.5 3, 2.25}}],          {x, y}]]     Fx[x_] = CDF[NormalDistribution[10, 3], x];      I wish to evaluate and plot a function ϕ which has the following definition :               ϕm[q_] =        (1/(1 - Fx[q]))*Integrate[Integrate[y*(x - q)*f[x, y], {x, q, 25}], {y, 2, 15}]      It can be done it in two ways. Either by using `NIntegrate` or by using the above double integral.               phim = Interpolation[ParallelTable[{q, ϕm[q]}, {q, 1, 25}]];     Plot[phim[q], {q, 2, 25}]      Using NIntegrate yields a completely different result.               ϕTs =        Table[         {n, 1/(1 - Fx[n]) NIntegrate[(x - n) y f[x, y], {x, n, 25}, {y, 2, 15}]},          {n, 1, 25, .5}];     ϕs = Interpolation[ϕTs, InterpolationOrder -> 1];     g2 = Plot[ϕs[x], {x, 1, 25}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]      Why is that so?
