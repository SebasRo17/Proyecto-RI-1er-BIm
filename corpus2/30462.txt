Bug existed in version 7 and is fixed in version 10.0.0 * * * I have a rather ugly _Mathematica_ expression (edit: shown below) that I would like to simplify with a time constraint; simplifying without a time constraint or memory constraint does not return as long as I've had the patience to wait (a couple of hours). The problem, which I have not seen before, is that when I execute               Simplify[ expression, TimeConstraint -> 3]      I get an output that contains things like > >     ...10000 E^(29599743/514000) Removed[$$Failure]... >   The only warning message I receive during execution is > >     Simplify::time: Time spent on a transformation exceeded 3.` seconds, >     and the transformation was aborted. Increasing the value of > TimeConstraint option may   >     improve the result of simplification >   Is this a known issue? I can't find anything about it. I expect when using `TimeConstraint` that I will not get the simplest answer back, but I also expect to get a usable answer (which this is not). If you think it would be helpful to see the expression I'm trying to simplify, I can post it here. The simplest example in which I've had this problem has a `LeafCount` of `651` and `ByteCount` of `17312`. **EDIT** On the suggestion of @JacobAkkerboom, I am adding some more information so someone can try to reproduce the effect. Here is a compressed version of `expression`. > > > expression=Uncompress["1:eJxTTMoPSmNiYGAoZgESATmlxWnMIB4rkAjJzE0thkhyAImgxJLM/LzEnMzEyQoMnsJAEUNzYzNDQ0MDS2NzUwMIgCgH6Q7IL08tKmYEslwzf////x/Vlsz/cCF0xSA+YUc84Q5hygwEKUV1PaZKT6CxnjxAEZgbwe5kJWQBJycDQ6bFLnV1NFdmcsEtRVEP8lAmEw4H4bNo/Xnbn5kNH34xYQ0OLBoMjgFtYmSE2YTP7MJrq5hIMlvgDobZ+DV8UAYGEzYNIG5AZuY/jKgn7Oqp3w4yeEoCRYxMTAxNDMyMkGMOWzIbTQODPg1AMjzBEG9YqMGYqc+AYdRoDA+NGAabUIk/8ghFiicfKBoNLUwQEQmOXmIdeyAW6liwiqo0RpjtzvnFGVjUg+QzL7ADLcCiEl+4gzWCEgo4GPxd0thQdGQm3sZRx5EQwqMJf0glfHgKCs7MIzKtIVSSktYg5SkzSRkrs/7wt/+eQkARYwNTQ3NTcwtDI7wNN4KJD57VCHtAnuvXf3CDDZZZsFhYiQhKUrItwcYiKI9kMoS80kINMLARhHVfff3nP7i9ixxeFAUbllQFKTHA3scaPqPlwNAoB9CSE85+DvakTrDUIBifoLaTJzeQMDQ2RU2ko2lnEKcdUkPkctGr/55iQBFjy9H+0XBIANgKDyxG/QQp/UKC3WiORRl/wdpYRyqd0GJptHU7YhMmeuuWzP4R9eq5QdBHJK/dDgDIdwSQ"]; >   As mentioned, I get the problem simply by running               Simplify[ expression, TimeConstraint -> 3 ]      (or any other value of `TimeConstraint` I've bothered to check) `expression` contains standard arithmetic operations, the constants `E` and `Pi`, the operations `Cosh` and `Sinh`, and three variables named `y`, `z`, and `OD` (and yes, I should make `OD` lower case, but it's hard for me to see optical depth as anything but capitals). **FURTHER EDIT** I have now reproduced the problem in an expression without a time constraint. The new `expression1` has a `LeafCount` of `186`, so it's not really that complicated. > > > expression1=Uncompress["1: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"]; >     Simplify[ expression1 ] >   This returns nearly instantly with three instances of `Removed[$$Failure]`. Since there is no `TimeConstraint` set here, I have no idea what the problem is. I submitted a help request to _Mathematica_ , and I'll let you know if they give any useful response. In the meantime, thoughts are most welcome. Especially if you can tell me if the problem exists (or not) in other versions of _Mathematica_. I am running 9.0.1 on Mac OS 10.8.3. Thank you to Mr. Wizard for verifying the problem exists in MMA 7 on Windows.
