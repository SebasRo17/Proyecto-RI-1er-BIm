I have setup a remote kernel on my Mac, which connects to a more powerful Linux 64Bit Desktop. Mathematica is setup fine on the Linux machine. CUDA is also working fine and `NVIDIA_DRIVER _LIBRARY_PATH` and `CUDA_LIBRARY_PATH` are set just fine, although they are not the default paths. When I connect from my mac using the mathematica frontend the connection via remote kernel is initialized fine and I can do my calculations, but CUDA is not working. Taking a closer look shows, that the paths mentioned above are not set properly any more. This can be seen by checking GPUTools`Internal`\$NVIDIADriverLibraryPath and GPUTools`Internal`\$CUDALibraryPath. On the linux machine I set the paths manually using /etc/profile file. It is my understanding that the remote kernel being setup to call the `math` command should just start a mathematica terminal session. Starting mathematica via terminal using the `math` command on the linux machine works just fine and has the paths setup correctly. What am I missing?
