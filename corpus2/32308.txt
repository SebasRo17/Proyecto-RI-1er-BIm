I am creating some simple graphs of functions defined by ordered pairs. Students are learning about "operations on functions", in this case, adding functions. If I have two functions defined by ordered pairs, how do I add them? I know this must be a simple list processing thing, I would appreciate any help. I.E.               functiong = {{-5, -5}, {-3, -3}, {1, 1}, {2, 2},  {5, 5}};     functionf = {{-5, 4}, {-3, 2}, {1, 2}, {2, 5}, {5, 5}};      I want to have the sum....               sum = {{-5, -1}, {-3, -1}, {1, 3}, {2, 7}, {5, 10}};      Easy to do manually, but if I modify the lists to create new examples, I'd like to have _Mathematica_ "add" those lists for me.... **Edit** Below, an example of the kind of question I see in the textbooks the students are using. They are told that what they see is function $f$ (red) and function $g$ (blue) and asked to draw $(f+g)(x)$ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hSUjq.png) My question is answered, but now that the context is clear, I would of course welcome any further suggestions on ways to easily create similar (and perhaps more interesting , but not harder!) problems.
