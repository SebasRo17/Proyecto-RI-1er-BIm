1. I have a hosting package with Just Host that I use for my Wordpress blogs. Is this the same as having a “web server” when referencing web app development? I live-chatted with tech support and they said is has apache installed and I can configure mysql and python. I'm planning on programming my app in python. Do I need something else from another service?   2. Do I need to setup a “developer environment” on my mac just to build my MVP?. I’ve read that I need to download MAMP and this will give me apache and a virtual server, is that true? I’ve download, MAMP and python. My web app will require a database but I’m not sure what to download for that.   3. Is anyone willing to review my idea and give me a sense as to what I need to do and if it would be obtainable or realistic that I could do it myself? My exposure to the tech community is limited (html/css) but I know i can compelete my goals with a few helping hands.  Its learned that people don't know your starving unless you ask for a plate.. so ladies and gents can someone please feed me?
