If I have an idea for a website that's really good, but I myself am not experienced enough to execute it well single-handedly, but I get it going with a team of people (guess that's called a start-up), should I be afraid of Google or Microsoft noticing my site, thinking to themselves _That's genius-- we have a thousand times their resources, let's do it better than them_ and hanging me out to dry?
