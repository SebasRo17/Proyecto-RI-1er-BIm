My department specializes in converting customer data into our database schema so that they can use our software. Right now, we have C# applications that take an `IDataReader` (99% of the time it is a `SqlDataReader`), perform some cleaning and mapping, insert it into a `DataRow` object, and then use a `SqlBulkCopy` to insert it in to our database. Sometimes (especially when the source database contains images as `varbinary` objects), this process can really bog down with a SQL transfer from the server to the app to just then turn right around and go back to the server. I feel that if we re-wrote some of the conversions as SSIS packages it could speed things up a lot. However the biggest stonewall I keep running into is when my boss, in Not Invented Here fashion, pushes back and says "What if Microsoft drops support for SSIS? We will have all this obsolete code and we will be screwed." This is not the first time that I have hit a "What if they remove that feature...?" answer from my boss. I don't have the time to write the conversion the old way, self-teach myself SSIS, and also write it the new way to demonstrate/test the benefits (None of us have used SSIS so there would be a period where we would have to learn how to use it). What should I do in this situation? Stop pushing the new technology? Wait till he leaves the department (I am the 2nd most Sr. person in the department after him, but it could be years before he quits/retires)? Find a new way of getting him to stop being afraid of 3rd party tools?
