I am looking for an architecture diagram of a computer virus. Does anyone have a link to a good example? **Edit** Looks like I am getting hammered with downvotes. I agree that there is no single architecture for a virus. But somethings must be included for a program to be a virus. Example for components in the SAD:   * Replication method   * Trigger   * Payload   * Hosts targeted   * Vulnerabilities targeted   * Anti detection method **Edit 2** Found a good example here: http://static.northpole.fi/download/1318959037124281/w32_duqu_the_precursor_to_the_next_stuxnet.pdf
