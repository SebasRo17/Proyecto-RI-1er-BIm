I am trying to think of the best way to do the following: I have a list of tasks stored in the database. A task has a priority assigned to it. You can change the priority of a task to reorder the order they should be carried out. I am thinking of something very similar to Pivotal Tracker. So imagine we had the following:               1 Task A     2 Task B     3 Task C     4 Task D     5 Task E      We decide that E is now the most important task               1 Task E     2 Task A     3 Task B     4 Task C     5 Task D      I need to update all 5 tasks to give them a new priority. If Task B then becomes more important then A I would I would have               1 Task E     2 Task B     3 Task A     4 Task C     5 Task D      I need to update Task B and A only. What ways would go about structuring this in a DB? I imagine that you would have a differnt projects stored in the same table that would have there own weight. Would it be better to point a Task that takes place after it (a bit like a link list). This is just a brain dump really. Just was wondering how you would go about implementing something like this.
