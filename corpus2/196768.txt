Please tell me why the same piece of code behaves differently in C++ and JAVA. **Ok first I implement a function to calculate the factorial of an Int RECURSIVELY** In JAVA:               int f(int x)         {                  if(x==1)return 1;             return(x*f(x-1));         }      System.out.println(f(5)); -----> outputs 120, ok that makes sense. JAVA METHOD 2:               int f(int x)         {                  if(x==1)return 1;             return(x*f(--x));         }      System.out.println(f(5)); -----> outputs 120, ok that makes sense too. But here is a twist in C++: C++ METHOD 1:               int f(int x)     {         if(x==1)return 1;         return (x*f(x-1));          }      cout << f(5) ; -----> outputs 120, ok now keep reading! C++ METHOD 2:               int f(int x)     {         if(x==1)return 1;         return (x*f(--x));          }      cout << f(5) ; -----> outputs 24. This is surprising. But Why?? I have tried tracing this multiple times and have failed. It makes sense in java because each recursive call gets its own piece of memory and pre decrement operator -- will decrease and yield the decreased value. Why does it work as expected in JAVA but not In C++?
