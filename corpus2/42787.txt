I am using `ListPlot` to display from 5 to 12 lines of busy data. The individual time series in my data are not easy to distinguish visually, as may be evident below, because the colors are not sufficiently different. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PiMMh.png) I have been trying to use `PlotStyle`, `ColorData`and related functions to get better colors. I would rather not have to specify a specific list of colors because the number of plot items varies from test to test. I created a toy plot to experiment with - the problem is illustrated by lines "F" and "G", which seem to be almost the same color. `PlotStyle` -> `ColorData` doesn't seem to work. Is there a simple way to do this?               ListPlot[Table[i*Range[0, 10], {i, 1, 5, 0.5}]      , Frame -> True, Joined -> True, PlotRange -> All      , PlotLegends -> SwatchLegend[Characters["ABCDEFGHIGKLMNOP"]]      , PlotStyle -> ColorData["TemperatureMap"]  ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wdi0O.png) It looks like               ListLinePlot[Table[data2*i, {i, k}], PlotStyle -> Thick,      ColorFunction -> Function[{x1, x2}, ColorData[c1][x2]]]       from another question may be the answer. I didn't see that before. I'll try it out. I don't think I really understand `ColorData`. Meanwhile, if anyone has generally enlightening comments, I would appreciate them.
