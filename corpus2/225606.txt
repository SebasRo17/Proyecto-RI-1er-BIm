In a team of developers, how do you get the developers to feel pride in their code and write good code (I realize this is subjective and everyone is different, but there is a point when I write code that i can say, this is a good piece of code that I am happy to show off). To often I hear we have no time to write good code and all that matters is getting the defect fix closed. How do I change this outlook and make the coders create code they can be proud of. This seems to be more prevalent in the younger coders, not all but most.
