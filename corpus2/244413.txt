I'm building a Date/Time class with a "configurable quarter" system as follows.   * User specifies which month the quarter starts at (config)   * Set of functions to deal with quarters (next quarter, prev quarter, etc)   * All quarter functions respect the config Now this class is primarily to be used for fiscal quarter calculations. So assuming I have this class with a configurable "quarter" system, would I need another parallel set of functions for calendar quarters too? What are the applications for calendar quarters anyways? By calendar quarters I mean where Q1 is Jan-Mar, and Q4 is Oct-Dec. By fiscal quarters I mean whatever standard your Country uses (in India Q1 starts in April)
