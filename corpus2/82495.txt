I am creating a service to be exposed on the internet. One of those things you would normally say "Web 2.0", but that I want to expose as a SOAP webservice, with desktop clients. I know that it may sound a little bit outdated, but despite the apparent "uncool" factor, is there any real reason why this approach shouldn't work? Yes, I will buy a VPS for this thing, it's an experiment for now - but who knows the future. I am just wondering, well, what you think of it :) Andrea
