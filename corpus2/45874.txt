For my calculations I need `JacobiCN[s,k]` for `s` near 0 from the left and `k` near 1 from the left. The function $(s,k) \mapsto \mathrm{cn}(s,k)$ is smooth on $]{-1},0[ \times ]0,1[$, yet Mathematica 7 gives me very different plots for `k=0.999` and values of `k` above:               Plot[JacobiCN[s, 0.999], {s, -1, 0}]     Plot[JacobiCN[s, 0.9990001], {s, -1, 0}]      ![<code>k=0.999</code>](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bjf67.png) ![<code>k=0.9990001</code>](http://i.stack.imgur.com/voEAV.png) WolframAlpha does not seem to have this problem. Is this a numerical artifact in Mathematica 7 that you can circumvent somehow, or do I have to reimplement $\mathrm{cn}$?
