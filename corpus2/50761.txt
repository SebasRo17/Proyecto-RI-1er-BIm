It appears that `Import[ url , "XMLObject" ]` is more forgiving of improperly formatted XML than `ImportString[ string, "XML"]`. For example, Mathematica is happy to do this               popNamesXML =        Import["http://uscode.house.gov/popularnames/popularnames.htm",          "XMLObject"];      but complains about this               popNames =        URLFetch["http://uscode.house.gov/popularnames/popularnames.htm"];     xml = ImportString[popNames, "XML"];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WJ3IB.png) and barks about utf8 encoding for this               ImportString[popNames, {"HTML", "XMLObject"}]      In the `Trace` of the first snippet it appears these options are being passed to `XMLGetString`:               {"NormalizeWhitespace"->True,"IncludeNamespaces"->Automatic,      "ValidateAgainstDTD"->Automatic,"IncludeEmbeddedObjects"->None,      "AllowRemoteDTDAccess"->True,"ReadDTD"->True,"IncludeDefaultedAttributes"->False,      "AllowUnrecognizedEntities"->Auomatic,"PreserveCDATASections"->False}      But passing these to `ImportString` or directly to `XMLGetString` still results in the same errors. This answer may be of interest but does not seem to be the problem, though I could be wrong. I tinkered with the suggestion there without luck. Does anyone know if/how I can make `ImportString` behave nicely here?
