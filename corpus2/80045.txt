I was recently rejected from a college that had previously accepted me, on the grounds that I spent a year of high school in a foreign country and the college wasn't interested in recognizing education received in another nation. Because of this a very generous scholarship has dried up, and and financing an education is doubtful. I'm also hesitant to become a part of a system that has demonstrated what I consider to be blatant xenophobia. What I want to do is say "Screw college", strike out on my own, and do something amazing, wow everyone, and become a self made millionaire. The reality of the situation is that I'm two weeks out of high school, I have about the equivalent of an Intro to Programming course worth of self-taught experience (although I am driven to learn and improve), I still need to pay bills, and I have a sneaking suspicion that any employer is going to have a hard time taking me seriously. As I understand it, it's a fairly popular belief that you can make it without a degree, but how does someone like me do that? Would anyone take me seriously if I walked into their office and said "I have no formal education and a minimum of skills, but I want to work and I want to learn. Please give me a job."?
