I am working on the design phase of a paper folding project. I have a few queries in this. Part of the problem statement says " A web can contain one or more ribbons in it. It can also contain a group of ribbons folded together inside it." How do you model the association for this? I found two solutions i) Maintain two associations, one between the web and ribbon and the other between the ribbon   and the Group class. This way, the web contains only ribbons and when you process the ribbons, you'll have to check whether it is part of a group. Note that the behaviour of the ribbon will change if it is part of a group ii) Introduce a new class called Childelemnt and associate it to web. Both Ribbon and Group will share the interface of Childelement. Which one do you think is better? If you have any other solution, please let me know. Thanking you all in advance, Pradeep
