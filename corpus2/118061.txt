Like many other people, I use Eclipse with the excellent PyDev plugin (available in the Eclipse Marketplace) to develop my Python projects. And like most people with the same setup, I came to PyDev without any prior Eclipse experience. What other tools, plugins, features, etc are there in Eclipse that could be useful for us Python developers? And/or, said another way, how could we become more proficient and make a better use of the Eclipse IDE for Python developing? I'll start adding my own 2â‚¬cents: EGit, or similar plugins for CVS, SVN, etc.., are good for integration with a version control system / repository. (even if I admit I'm usually just writing git command lines in the terminal).
