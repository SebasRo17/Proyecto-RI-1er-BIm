Not sure if this is a bug or a typo but for the first example of the `ARMAProcess` in _Mathematica_ 9 we have:               data = Select[WeatherData["Champaign", "Temperature", {2012, 8}],                    FreeQ[#, Missing] &][[All, 2]];     temp = TemporalData[data]     eproc = EstimatedProcess[temp, ARMAProcess[3, 3]]      `EstimatedProcess` hangs, whereas if I just send the data (with `RLink`!) to R's `arima` solver (with `order=c(3,0,3)` so it is an ARMA model), it solves instantly, and all further analysis looks the same as the example, so it isn't given a bad solution or anything. Is there something wrong with the documentation (reminds me of the issues of trying to do optimization without using `?NumericQ` variables). Any thoughts? Really want to use this feature...
