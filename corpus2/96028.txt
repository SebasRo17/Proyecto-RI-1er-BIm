I am new freelancer mostly on web development and my first project used (X)HTML/CSS/PHP/MySQL/jQuery for a small custom social network like system with search engine/contact form ready/admin system. I charged this project on hourly basis about $10/h Again this was my first freelance job and i really think that the price was way too low. So how would you suggest to me to move on with the charges?
