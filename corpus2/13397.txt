Tell me if this sounds familiar: > something something something... as seen in figure 1-1 on the next page... It's in practically every book I've ever read about programming. So when I was writing a small instructional booklet on how to use some in-house software, which had images of the screen that the user will be on at this certain step I wrote something like "The screen that pops up looks like the one shown in figure 1-1 below." But I'm thinking: I'm used to that style of writing, but if my target audience is the 'average person' are they going to be confused? So, more generally, are there any common practices in technical books that should be avoided when writing documentation for average people?
