I'm a self-tought programmer living in a small town. Except for the occasional meetups at the other end of the country, I rarely talk face-to-face with other programmers. I'm well aware of the merits of pair programming, feedback, discussion with other programmers and all... What do you do to get in contact with other local programmers? p.s. If you live near Loenen (gld), Netherlands, I'd like to have contact ;)
