Alright, so I'm doing my first "real" C# project. I'm chugging along, enjoying myself, nice little language I've got here, fairly easy to use, la ti da. Then I get to the point that I realize there's no simple way of setting up friend classes for unit testing. Well. This is unfortunate. I dig around and find that I can jump through some burning hoops and expose everything to another assembly with:               [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("AssemblyName")]      But... this is a fairly minor in-house app that I've just going to a single binary and doesn't really warrant multiple assemblies. What other options - if any - does C# offer?
