I would like to solve numerically an equation which involves a numerical function constructed by fitting some data:               data := {{0, 1}, {1, 1}, {.2, 3}, {.4, 5}, {.6, 2}};     try[x_?NumberQ, y_?NumberQ] := (auy = y;     solution = FindFit[data, A (aux - auy) + B Exp[aux - auy], {A, B}, aux];     myFit[aux_?NumberQ] = (A (aux - auy) + B Exp[aux - auy]) /.      solution; Return[myFit[x]])          NSolve[y - try[1, y] == 0, y]      I tried with this code but it does not function (various errors). Does anyone know how to help me? thank you in advance!
