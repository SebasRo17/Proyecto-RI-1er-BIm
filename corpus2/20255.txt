You are just starting a new project and you have these two technologies to choose from, Java and .NET. The project you are working doesn't involve having features that would make it easy to choose between the two technologies (e.g. .NET has this that I need and Java does not) and both of them should work just fine for you (though you only need one of course). Take into account:   * Performance    * Tools available (even 3rd party tools)   * Cross platform compatibility   * Libraries (especially 3rd party libraries)   * Cost (Oracle seems to try and monetize Java)   * Development process (Easiest/Fastest) Also keep in mind that Linux is not your main platform but you would like to port your project to Linux/MacOs as well. You should definitely keep in mind the trouble that has been revolving around Oracle and the Java community and the limitations of Mono and Java as well. It would be much appreciated if people with experience in both can give an overview and their own subjective view about which they would choose and why.
