Ok so not really a programming question... but it is very relevant for any non-US Apple Devs. - Basically, iTunesConnect lists my last payment as $248 NZ (I live in NZ, I signed the basic US tax contract that says I do not live in the US). The payment I received in my bank account a while ago was $221. That's about a 10% difference, maybe because of some type of tax? However, I was under the impression that I should not be getting taxed, and that it was up to me to declare and pay the tax in my own country. - So for any other non-US iOS devs - do you also see this 10% difference - if so, where does the 10% go to (NZ, US, or my bank?). If not, what am I doing wrong, and how should I be doing it? Any help is much appreciated! Thanks :)
