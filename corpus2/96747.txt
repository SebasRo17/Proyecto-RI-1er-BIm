I just started a new programming job and have been told that I am doing well. However, I'm worried about being laid off because of the economy and how the company is faring. Currently, I'm quietly going about the job as normal and hoping I don't get let go. But I'm worried that isn't a good answer. Is there anything I can do to help create job security? (Besides writing terrible mortgage code that only I can maintain, thus forcing(?) the company to keep me)
