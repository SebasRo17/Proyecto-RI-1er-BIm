Suppose the following DTO class. Which of the two getters breaks encapsulation least?               class Foo         {         public:             /*Return the most primitive type. Caller do not need             to worry about what Array is*/             const RecType* dataBeginGet() const;             const RecType* dataEndGet() const;                  /*Return a reference to the Array.              Caller do not need to call two methods before iteration             */             const Array<RecType>& dataGet() const                 {return m_data;}              private:             Array<RecType> m_data;         };
