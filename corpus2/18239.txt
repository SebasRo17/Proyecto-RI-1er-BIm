I sometimes wonder how CEOs or Founders of companies like Microsoft and Oracle manage the overall technology movement and product link-up. Take for example Oracle, it started with the database only and now, when you open their official site, the bibliography opens. Take for instance, Oracle database 11g. The core database is continuously improving and new features are being added. At the same time you need to keep a vigil on the current market trends, needs and competitors. Does Larry monitors each and every activity of technology advancement? What about new ideas and innovations? Who is responsible for these? Another example that puzzles me is .NET. With a new thing launching every second day, who is the .NET father and who suggests these guys to add classes for this and that. Who gives direction to the overall product movement and also integration with the other products? This is simply a beauty. This seamless integration or communication between the products and the technology as a whole is remarkable. (Not a biased view). Few years back I read a book titled: _Microsoft Secrets_. The author writes that at Microsoft, even the very senior person has to code because until and unless you are able to code, you can't better run a software company. I sometimes think Ballmer codes or not and what about Bill? Is he coding another OS at home?
