I am trying to Integrate the following Integral (all of the variables are reals) $$\int Exp(-(\cos^{-1}\left[\frac{\text{n}_0 (\text{v}_0-\text{x}_0)+\text{n}_1 (\text{v}_1-\text{x}_1)+\text{n}_2 (u \text{v}+\text{v}_2-\text{x}_2)}{\sqrt{\text{n}_0^2+\text{n}_1^2+\text{n}_2^2} \sqrt{(\text{v}_0-\text{x}_0)^2+(\text{v}_1-\text{x}_1)^2+(u \text{v}+\text{v}_2-\text{x}_2)^2}}\right]/m)^2) \, du$$ The formula, simplified, in Mathematica input:               Integrate[Exp[-(ArcCos[(a + b*u)/(c*Sqrt[d + (e + b*u)^2])]/m)^2], u]      If I simply enter that into Mathematica, it instantly returns the same expression. If I enter it as an Integral with set limits (0 and t), it calculates on and on and on.... How do I go about this? Is there any tricks that can be applied to   1. Find out if there is a closed Form for this (obviously including erf terms)   2. Get an Approximation for the Integral (For example using series)   3. Make Mathematica take more time trying to find a closed form for the indefinite Integral/antiderivative?
