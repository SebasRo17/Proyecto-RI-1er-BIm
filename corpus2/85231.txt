Here is the issue. I am a senior developer, and one of the start-ups I designed the system (management system/database/web) a long time ago, have grown and need software updates. I have left their system to another developer long time ago, but apparently he has left the job, and so they are asking me if I can suggest them where to find a new one. The problem is that the company has no clue that the IT is not cheap. They expect multiple features to be added for 40$, so that's an issue. Actually one of the reasons why I left the project when I did. Lots of expectations, little pay, also I know those people outside work, so I decided to avoided stressing the nonwork-relationships and left the project gracefully. Today they asked me for an advice, and I told them that the feature list they want is probably going to cost some if they'll get a senior developer for the job. So I guess their best bet is to find someone who loves coding and has just finished the school. Which would give someone a chance to code for money which is good for a student, and at the same time, allow the student to get some hands on experience. Then again, the system is not exactly 20 line console program, there is an MSSQL database, ASP.NET web page and content management system with all the AJAX stuff and some other things. So student straight out of school could have some problems with that. But, I thought about the issue some more, and I think that junior developer is a tricky deal, without mentoring, he can either screw up royally, or just do what's asked. Also, it seems no one is coming to interviews at all, which is weird, or maybe not. What should I suggest them?
