I am in the very, very early stages of writing an Amiga 500 emulator, and would like to include the hardware documentation either alongside my source code or in a separate `doc` package. As one example, here is the copyright notice from the Commodore Amiga A500/A200 Technical Reference Manual: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4nOx4.png) That doesn't sound promising. Other documents I'd like to include are the Motorola 68000 Programmer's Reference Manual, the AmigaDOS Technical Reference Manual, and perhaps others in the future. Do I need to tackle these documents one-by-one, or is there a "Yes you can" or "No you can't" umbrella that covers all of them? If there is a broad-brush answer, it does not need to be specific to my documents in particular. Thanks in advance!
