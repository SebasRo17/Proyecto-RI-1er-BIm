I am designing a small application that is really justa gui for a command line using vb.net. Question 1. Should messages(msgbox) to the user come from the UI or should messages come from subs and functions that the UI calls. Question 2. Should subs and functions throw new exceptions to the UI or should they be containd in the sub/function Question 3. Should if statements be used at the UI level or should users input be passed to subs and functions for if statement processing ?
