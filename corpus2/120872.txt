Here's the problem I'm facing: * * * **Quote From Project Manager:** Hey Spark, I'm assigning you the task of developing a framework that could be used for many different iOS applications. Here are the requirements:   * It should be able to detect the thickness of the thumb or fingers being used to manipulate the UI.   * With this information, all elements of the UI should be arranged & sized _automatically_.   * For a larger thumb, elements should be arranged nearer the center of the screen.   * For a smaller thumb, elements should be arranged nearer the corners of the screen.   * For a larger thumb, all fonts should be smaller. (We're assuming an adult in this case.)   * For a smaller thumb, all fonts should be larger. (We're assuming a younger person in this case.) **Summary:** This framework is required for creating user-friendly user interfaces programmatically. The framework should be developed in such a way that we can use for as many projects as needed, so it must also be very developer- friendly. * * * I am the developer given this task, so my questions are as follows:   * How can I explain that these requirements are a little ridiculous?   * How can I explain that it would be better to concentrate on developing actual projects?   * How can I explain that even if this were possible, I wouldn't recommended developing such a thing?   * How do I say NO to this project politely, gently, and respectfully?   * How can I explain that even for a developer with 3 years of experience, this might not be possible?
