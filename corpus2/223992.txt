What is the preferred way to document the contents of and logic behind dynamically generated data structures in Python? E.g. a dict which contains the mapping of a string to a list of lists of strings? I find it hard to transport the meaning and algorithmic workings of the data elements through Python code alone. It is unsatisfying and sometimes counterproductive to try to shape the code which erects such a dict into a form which tells another programmer easily about the structure of a dict entry. Similarly, placing a comment with an example entry is anything but optimal in my eyes.
