I'm producing a binary distributable for my Java project. I'm releasing it in two ways:   1. Maven Central   2. Zipped distributable on Google code My project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. I use a small number of third-party parties, one of which is MIT licensed. I believe it's my obligation to make users of my project aware of the license contents, based on the following text from the license: > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in > all copies or substantial portions of the Software. How am I best to reference this within my source and my distributables? I'm currently thinking:   1. My source files needn't reference anything. They just include my Apache 2.0 boilerplate notice.   2. I add a LICENSE.txt file at the root of my project including the Apache 2.0 license text.   3. For my zipped distributable, I need to also add _something_ that indicates a component is MIT licensed. Perhaps a NOTICE file?   4. For my Maven Central distribution, I needn't do anything as my artifact just declares its dependencies, but doesn't actually include them. Does this seem like a valid plan? If so, can anyone advise how to accomplish point 3.
