I'm a C# programmer, and I don't really think I can create a software, for example: if I have a task to take a WAV and play it, I'll just use the .NET SoundPlayer class. if I need to present a picture I'll just use a picturebox. I'm not even sure how .NET handles the tasks, does it over treat it and takes a lot of memory? what do I do in cases .NET doesn't support? for example, if I want to play a WAV as mentioned, that's great. but if I want to play mp3 file, the only thing comes to my mind is look for a different library on the internet that supports it. I see a lot of programs out there and just don't understand how they do it. even if it's a simple task like having a folder's thumbnail like it's showed in Windows Explorer (as shown here: http://public.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p_RvwMDp6PkWP- X_nOZbscmJTL1y32Vzd8pG0QCJbo3Wn-38GlzzclueXc- jT7-mbIX1B-d3ySoRWlzRk1aPWxw/HiloMediaPane.jpg?psid=1) I have no idea how it can be done. Also, when given a complicated task, say make a path-finder algorithm or anything that isn't a basic task, I'm blank and have no idea what to do. I feel like I'm missing something, and I'm sure a lot of people out there feel exactly like I do, what advice could you give them?
