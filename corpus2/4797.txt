When doing               Plot3D[Max[p^2-q^2,0],{p,0,1},{q,-1,1},PlotStyle->White]      the result looks like this (with Mathematica 8.0.0.0): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uhghv.png) As you can easily see, at the "kink" where the function starts going above 0, Mathematica leaves a gap in the surface. Why does it do that, and more importantly, what can I do about it?
