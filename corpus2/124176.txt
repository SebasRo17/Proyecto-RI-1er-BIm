Suppose I have a loop in C++ or C# that goes like this:               while( true ) {         doSomething();         if( condition() ) {             break;         }         doSomethingElse();     }      This is commonly called "infinite loop". Yet it is not technically infinite - it will stop once control flows through `break`. What's the term for such loop - that has "loop forever" loop control statement and "break" inside?
