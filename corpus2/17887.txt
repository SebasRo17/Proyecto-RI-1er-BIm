I want to find the `ImageSize` or at least dimensions of any control object irrespective of it being an image or an any other control such as `Button`s,etc. This is my code for button: `button = Button["ew", Null, ImageSize -> {100, 50}]` `ImageDimensions` provides size of images only and not of control objects. So, initially, I rasterized my control object using `Rasterize`. And then displayed the image dimensions. However the image dimensions is not exact value.               rastButton = Rasterize[button, RasterSize -> 100]       bt = Button["ew", Null, {ImageSize -> {100, 50}}]       rastbt = Rasterize[bt, RasterSize -> 100]       ImageSize[rastbt]       ImageDimensions[rastbt]       (*  Out[272] = {100, 52} *)          bt = Button["ew", Null, {ImageSize -> {100, 1}}]     rastbt = Rasterize[bt, RasterSize -> 100]     ImageSize[rastbt]     ImageDimensions[rastbt]     (* Out[272] = {100, 17} *)      I also believe `Rasterize` provides error values when I call `Rasterize[button][[2, 2]]`. Is this a bug? Is there any workaround to estimate the size of control objects? Ultimately, the purpose of estimating the size is to place the control object very accurately in a grid layout within specified co ordinates.
