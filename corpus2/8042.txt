Suppose that I have the following list, called `test`:               test = {{{a1}, {a2, a3}}, {{b1}, {b2, b3}}, {{c1}, {c2, c3}}};      Now suppose I have an arbitrary function `g`. I would like to map `g` onto `test` such that I obtain the following list:               {{{a1}, {g[a2], g[a3]}}, {{b1}, {g[b2], g[b3]}}, {{c1}, {g[c2], g[c3]}}}      This code is incorrect:               Map[g, test, {3}]      from which I obtain:               {{{g[a1]}, {g[a2], g[a3]}}, {{g[b1]}, {g[b2], g[b3]}}, {{g[c1]}, {g[c2], g[c3]}}}      Can you please help me? Thank you.
