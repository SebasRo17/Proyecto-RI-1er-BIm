What topics/abilities are generally accepted as vital-to-know of any programming language?

Or if this was for learning a foreign (non-programming) language, "Verb conjugation" might be one. I've found this, which is a helpful start: http://www.indiangeek.net/wp- content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm
