While examining alternatives to Exim/Dovecot for a dedicated mail server, I came across the lamson project, a python-based MTA. I also found the following fork of the project: https://github.com/moggers87/salmon Quoting from the docs at the fork: > Salmon is a fork of Lamson. In the summer of 2012 (2012-07-13 to be exact), > Lamson was relicenced under a BSD variant that was revokable. The two > clauses that were of most concern: > >   1.

I am familiar with the BSD license but have never seen it modified in this way. I am curious what the implications of this kind of license would be for other developers using the code, especially in paid commercial projects (thinking something like subscription-based webapps here). Assuming the license were revoked, could the user be liable for monetary damages, or would a scenario like this be equivalent to a cease-and-desist, in which case whatever functionality the library was providing would have to be reimplemented? **To Clarify** : Usual caveats with regard to answers are assumed. I ask out of curiosity only and have no intentions on acting or assuming legal risk via the advice posted.
