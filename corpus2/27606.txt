My file. Txt has only two columns, where the 1st column is the time that the data was generated by the 2nd column has decimal values ​​1-100. Example:               19/06/2013 at 14:31:43 ------ 75 .19     19/06/2013 at 14:31:54 ------ 62 .46     19/06/2013 at 14:32:04 ------ 55 .62     19/06/2013 at 14:32:14 ------ 48 .28     19/06/2013 at 14:32:24 ------ 33 .15      I would like to plot this data on a graph that represents the axis yo time on the x axis while the decimal values ​​... these graphics could be in columns in which the maximum value is 100.
