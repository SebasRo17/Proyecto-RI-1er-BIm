I'm looking for something akin to FxCop, but for databases. Basically, I want to have a tool where I configure my database standards (naming conventions, field types, or more complex custom rules). Then, I want to incorporate that tool into my continuous integration process so that any violations are flagged immediately. We support both Oracle and SQL Server so tools that address either of those is good, but one tool that supports both would be better. Do tools such as this exist or perhaps there is some better method or type of tool that I can utilize to help me achieve this goal?
