I am trying to understand a non-linear system of equations, and find their steady states and dynamics. I am noob to understanding _Mathematica_ (I am using version 6, but I have access to the latest versions in the lab), and I wondered if some kind soul would be able to help me with some of the code. The system is below:               Clear[PBC];     PBC = {       d'[t] == (1/z) (α - β (d[t]/Y[t]) - γ L[t] - δ ψ[t]  - τ Y[t]) + ε (d[t]/ Y[t]) d[t],       L'[t] == (j (Y[t]/f) - e)/N,       ψ'[t] == p L[t] - \[Xi],       Y[t] == (v + b + α - β ( d[t]/Y[t]) - γ L[t] - δ ψ[t])          (ψ[t] + (1 - s) (1 - ψ[t]) - m z)/(1 - (1 - τ))     }     Clear[PBCSS];      PBCSS = Solve[PBC[[1 ;; 3]] /. {g_'[t] -> 0, g_[t] -> g}, {d, L, ψ}] // Simplify     Clear[PBCEigenSystem];     PBCEigenSystem = D[Transpose[PBCSS][[2, 1 ;; 3]], {{d, L, ψ}}] // Simplify) // MatrixForm      I know that I have done some no-no's (already edited in the code above I think), but the code seems to work. However, I am getting some problems with the output. For one, it does not solve all the system. I included some parameters for a numerical solution, but even if you take away the parametrization, it gives the same error as it does not solve for all variables (I have more choppy code to get some solutions for a large n number of iterations, I do not get it for steady states). Furthermore, I seem to be getting an error when I try to get the eigenvalues of the matrix. Also I have been trying to put a Manipulate handle on the steady states and eigenvalue estimation to see where the bifurcations are but I get errors. Any help will be most appreciated!
