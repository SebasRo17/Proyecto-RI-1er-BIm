I originally thought of creative commons when while reading a book about wordpress (professional wordpress), I learned that I should also specify that the product is provided > ... WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of > MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE and they recommend GNU GPL. How do I write a license or select 1? btw, what does `MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE` mean actually? Isn't without warranty enough?
