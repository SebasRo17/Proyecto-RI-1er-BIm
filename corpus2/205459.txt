Suppose you have the following:                    +--------+     +------+          | Animal |     | Food |          +-+------+     +----+-+            ^                 ^            |                 |            |                 |       +------+              +-------+       | Deer |              | Grass |       +------+              +-------+      `Deer` inherits from `Animal`, and `Grass` inherits from `Food`. So far so good. `Animal` objects can eat `Food` objects. Now lets mix it up a bit. Lets add a `Lion` which inherits from `Animal`.                    +--------+     +------+          | Animal |     | Food |          +-+-----++     +----+-+            ^     ^           ^            |     |           |            |     |           |       +------+ +------+     +-------+       | Deer | | Lion |     | Grass |       +------+ +------+     +-------+      Now we have have a problem because `Lion` can eat both `Deer` and `Grass`, but `Deer` is not `Food` it is `Animal`. With out using multiple inheritance, and using object oriented design, how do you solve this problem? FYI: I used http://www.asciiflow.com to create the ASCII diagrams.
