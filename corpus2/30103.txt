I was trying to do some C++ coding that can send files from my laptop to my webmail account. It took me about 10 minutes to realize that there is no easy way to do this. Look into these links:   1. GMAIL: http://code.google.com/apis/gmail/oauth/code.html   2. YAHOO: http://developer.yahoo.com/mail/ I am trying to understand why PHP or Python or Java support exist but no C++. No flame wars, I love all programming languages and their creators equally but I am curious to understand the logic behind such implementation choices.
