I've created a few open-source projects in the past, and had some success. The process was generally the following: I'd start alone, create something that works, promote it, and finally (maybe) get some contributions. I have less that to contribute to open-source now, but I still have ideas and can still code :) So I wonder if there is a place or a way to meet people (online), discuss ideas and design, and then start working together on the project? The reason I'm thinking about an online way to do this, with strangers, is that while I do have programmer friends, we only very rarely have the same needs and interests at the same time. It seems to me that it would be easier to find such in match in the online global community. Any insight?
