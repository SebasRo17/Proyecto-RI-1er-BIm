Controls, such as those appearing in `Manipulate` constructs, are by default rendered depending on the operating system. Wrapping everything in `Style[..., ControlsRendering->"Generic"]` makes sure that the controls' appearance is independent of the operating system (right?). My question now is split into three parts:   1. Does the rendering depend on the version of Mathematica es well? Specifically, is there a difference between versions 7, 8 and 9?   2. Is there a way to estimate how the controls will be rendered for another operating system? I.e. can I get a rough idea (I'm using Windows 7) how my `Manipulate` will look like on a machine with, e.g., Mac OS X 10.7? It would be enough for me to find out if any of the sizes of things like `Slider2D` or `SetterBar` objects change drastically. Does the `ImageSize` option for `Slider2D` ensure a consistent size even on different operating systems?   3. Can one define a function that makes sure that the default rendering is used on machines with windows, and the `"Generic"` style is used for non-Windows computers?
