We're going to do some peer reviews for our iOS projects. We're kind of inexperienced at reviewing each other's codes. The iOS developers attending the reviews will be from other projects, since generally one person handles one client project in the company. I know there are some questions on SO about the things you're looking for when you're reviewing someone else's code. I want to ask this question specifically for iOS projects. I mean, besides the general points for code quality, what are the things that you consider when reviewing an iOS code?
