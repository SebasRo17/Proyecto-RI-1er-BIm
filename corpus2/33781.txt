I want to write recursive function for calculating the arithmetic mean of a vector. For $X(n)=\\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\\}$, the formula is ${\rm Mean}(X(n))=((n-1)\, {\rm Mean}((X(n-1))+X_n)/n$. My program works in my R-language version, but here in _Mathematica_ it takes in account only the last two number. How can I fix my code?               Meen[x_] := (        If[Length[x] == 1,           Return[x],          n = Length[x] - 1;           y = x[[1 ;; n]];           result = 1/(n + 1)*(n*Meen[x[[1 ;; n]]]  + x[[n + 1]])]        )          X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};     Meen[X]      > >     {9/5} >
