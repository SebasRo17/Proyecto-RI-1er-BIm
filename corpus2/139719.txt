While searching for jobs online I noticed that most PHP web developer jobs ask you to know about algorithms and data structures.While I don't know PHP yet I have started to learn it in order to obtain a job in that field. While I have seen some similar questions on the forum I don't feel like the answers satisfied my needs. I already have some knowledge of the quicksort algorithm and how to use a stack from when I was working in Java and Javascript , but I am guessing it is not enough.What I would like is a list of the most common used algorithms in web development.
