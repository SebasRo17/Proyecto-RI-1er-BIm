I want to start doing freelance work, but no matter how I look at it, it seems like the best way to get customers and to have work most of the time, you have to already be in the freelancing game. Most freelancers I've talked to have had the same customers over the years or got new customers because their satisfied clients referred them. What I'd like to know from the successful people here that work as freelancers is how do you start doing business when you haven't yet set foot in freelancing? I want to start small, creating websites that won't require me to hire other people other than maybe a designer I already know. (I'd like to create desktop applications as well, but I think I should keep that for later when I'm more experienced) . I thought about localized Google ads or visiting companies and meeting the people in charge there, but I wouldn't know which kind of businesses to look for or if it's even a good way to approach this. Anyone care to share their personal startup experiences / advice that can help future freelancers?
