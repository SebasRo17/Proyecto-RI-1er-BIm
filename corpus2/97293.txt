I have an idea for what i believe would be a profitable Apple app store application. I also know that i don't have sufficient knowledge to complete it from start to finish and need help from more experienced iOS developers. Is there a standard NDA you have used and liked that would allow you to discuss details of the application with a 3rd party having a reasonable comfort that your idea won't be stolen?
