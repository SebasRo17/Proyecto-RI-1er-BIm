During an interview I was asked given the following: A real estate application that lists all houses that are currently on the market (i.e., for sale) within a given distance (say for example the user wants to find all houses within 20 miles), how would you design your application (both data structure and alogirithm) to build this type of service?      Any ideas? How would you implement it? I told him I didn't know becaue I've never done any geo-related stuff before.
