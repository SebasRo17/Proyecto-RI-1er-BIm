I have a simple _Mathematica_ expression               Solve[{a(a-1)Sqrt[1+a^2+b^2] == b(a^3-1), b(b-1)Sqrt[1+a^2+b^2] == a(b^3-1)}]      which returns (on version 8.0, and also version 9.0) > >     {{b -> -(a/(1 + a))}, {a -> 1, b -> -I}, {a -> 1, b -> I}, {a -> 1, b -> > 1}, >      {b -> 0, a -> 0}, {b -> I, a -> I}, {b -> 1, a -> -I}, {b -> 1, a -> > I}} >   The first of these solutions does not seem correct. For example, putting `a=2, b=-2/3` does not satisfy either of the equations. On the other hand, if I add the `"VerifySolutions"` option to `Solve` I get the right answer:               Solve[{a(a-1)Sqrt[1+a^2+b^2] == b(a^3-1), b(b-1)Sqrt[1+a^2+b^2] == a(b^3-1)}           , VerifySolutions -> True]      returns > >     {{a -> 1, b -> -I}, {a -> 1, b -> I}, {a -> 1, b -> 1}, {b -> 0, a -> > 0}, >      {b -> I, a -> I}, {b -> 1, a -> -I}, {b -> 1, a -> I}} >   Is this the expected behaviour? It seems a bit odd to have to add an option to `Solve` to make it check that the solution returned actually satisfies the original equations.
