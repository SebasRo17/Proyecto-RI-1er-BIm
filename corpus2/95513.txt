Is it true that to know how many visitors visit my website, some kind of tracking code had to placed within that page itself, and there is no other way around it? Even if we use something like Google Analytics indirectly they are also placing some kind of tracking script within our pages right? Or is it true that even there are no tracking script within my page, someone (some authority?) will have access to this info?
