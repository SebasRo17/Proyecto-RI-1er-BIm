Have a quick question on how to best structure something for my Java project: I'm a user. I can work at one or more places. At those workplaces, I have one or more roles. For each of these roles, I work a shift. I either came up with: My workplaces have shifts, my shifts have exactly 1 position (what position did I work when I worked my shift? It varies day to day..) or Workplaces have positions, each position has shifts I think the 2nd is more natural but keep going back and forth / unsure of what has more of an advantage both now and for the future. It's hard for me as I can argue both I guess? Thanks!
