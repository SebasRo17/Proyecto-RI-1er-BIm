Are there major differences between assembly language and higher level languages when it comes to coding and/or managing projects? Obviously it takes more statements in assembly language to carry out a particular operation than in most other languages, but are there differences that affect how a project needs to (or should) be run based on targeting assembly language (specifically x86/x64 assembly language)? To the extent that there are differences between assembly language and other languages, it seems reasonable to guess that at least some of these are advantages for the other languages. Can anybody point out specific disadvantages of assembly language, and ways to mitigate those disadvantages? One specific example would be staff availability. Has anybody had trouble finding experienced assembly language programmers, and if so, what steps can be taken to mitigate this problem?
