I'm wondering if it's possible to write and release a library based on the ASIO SDK under the LGPLv3. More specifically, the ASIO license says something I'm not sure how to interpret (2.2) : > The Licensee has no permission to [...]. This includes re-working this > specification, **or reverse-engineering any products based upon this > specification.** Which sounds like it could conflict with LGPL's: > You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken > together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the > Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging > such modifications Also, 5.a) is kind of bugging me : > Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the > Library, uncombined with any other library facilities The way I see it, my Library will have no use, point or effect on its own, when uncombined with the ASIO SDK. Will I still have to release an uncombined dummy piece of software to respect 5.a) if I choose LGPL?
