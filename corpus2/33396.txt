Problem I have following code, when n<=10^5 it's not slow, but n>2*10^5 it's became very slow. I think maybe some temp value greater than 2^31-1, so make compile invalid. Could you give any idea make it can be compiled? As far as possible not to use recursive algorithm.               pe14 = Compile[{},        Module[{n1, len, maxLen = 0, res = 0},         Do[n1 = n;          len = 1;          While[n1 != 1,           n1 = If[EvenQ@n1,  n1~Quotient~2, = 3 n1 + 1];           len++           ];          If[len > maxLen, maxLen = len; res = n],          {n, 1, 10^6}];         {maxLen, res}         ]        ];          pe14[] // AbsoluteTiming
