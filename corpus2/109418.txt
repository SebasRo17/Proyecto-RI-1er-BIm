I am a bit puzzled by the whole technical interview process. I have been on a few interviews recently and I keep hearing certain phrases during the interviews. And I want to get more insight into the mind of the interviewer and the process itself. Can anyone please shed some light into this? What do they really want? I am convinced that it is not the actual correct answer to the problem one is presented with because getting the right answer hasn't gotten me a job. How do they "get a glimpse into my thought process"? EDIT: I am adding this to the question because I think I might help. During the interview when you are writing code on the white board and they ask you to explain the process or approach are they expecting me to act like a player on who want to be a millionaire? Do I need to explain every little detail or reason for doing something?
