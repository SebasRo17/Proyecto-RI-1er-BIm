I have heard a lot and read about the Javascript server side language i.e Node.js, and saw many comparisons in favor of Node. I don't understand what makes it better or faster, or how it even relates to something as mature as Java Servlets. But Servlets are built on top of a multithreaded programming language as opposed to Node.js. Then how can node.js be faster? If suppose 1000K users query for a database records, then shouldn't Node.js be slower than Servlets. Also Don't servlets have better security compared to Node.js?
