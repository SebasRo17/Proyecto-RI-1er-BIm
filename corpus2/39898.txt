When I declare the function $f$ as follows:               f[n_] := Sum[x/Sum[Sqrt[y], {y, 1, x}], {x, 1, n}]/n      the input               Limit[f[n],n -> Infinity]      does not yield an answer, in fact the evaluation is terminated after a few seconds. If I now write               Limit[f[x], x -> Infinity]      I get an answer of $0$. Why is that, according to the manual entry of "Sum" we have > The iteration variable i is treated as local, effectively using Block. If it matters, I use the version 9.0.
