Suppose I have a function say $f=x^2$. What I would like is a list (or even better, a list with a grid) which resembles `{{1,1},{2,4},{3,9}, ...}`. Ideally one should be able to specify the starting point, end point and step interval between values. This seem like such a simple idea I don't know why I am struggling with it...
