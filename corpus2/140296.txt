My family is looking for a programming/computer science tutor. Personally, I want to learn Java or some other brand of web programming. I am best described as a PC "power user." I have never programmed in the past and would like a good jump start. I am a very quick learner and do not expect the tutor to have to teach me the ultra basic stuff that I can learn myself. My son also needs a programming tutor. He just got into Carnegie Mellon as a computer science major. Having done only robotics and mathematics in the past he is very nervous that he does not have the same level of knowledge as his future classmates. I need some help coming up with a list of questions to ask potential tutors and some criteria to judge them by. Thanks! Edit: So far I have come up with just the obvious... >   1. Where did you receive your education? >   2. What languages are you familiar with? >   3. How long have you been tutoring? >   4. What made you decide to become a tutor? >   5. What software projects have you worked on? >   6. What work references can you give me? >   7. How much do you charge? >
