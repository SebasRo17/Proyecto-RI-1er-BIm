Over the years of using Mathematica, I find myself doing something along the lines of rewriting this: $\frac{[A^-_F]}{[A^-_U] + \frac{[H^+][A^-_U]}{\kappa_1}}$ as this: $\frac{[A^-_U] + \frac{[H^+][A^-_U]}{\kappa_1}}{[A^-_F]}$ on a constant basis. In other words, just switching the numerator and the denominator of a fraction. Copying and pasting is kind of a drag, especially when you have to do it many times, and Mathematica can be kind of persnickety when it comes to highlighting things. Is there a built in keyboard shortcut that can invert fractions automatically? If not, is there a way for me to build a custom keyboard shortcut in order to do so?
