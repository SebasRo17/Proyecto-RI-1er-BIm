> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  My Dad is impatient with the pace of my learning to program. What do I do? I am 14 and have been studying programming for 4 months now (3 months Python, 1 Month of Ruby). I haven't been pushed by my parents to do it, I took it up on my own. Whenever I try to show something I made to my dad, he says he finds no value in it. At first, I wrote simple text games, like a text version of rock paper scissors, roulette, blackjack, etc. When that got too easy, I tried to make them as advanced as possible. I made a roulette game in Ruby based off `instance_eval` and `method_missing`. I showed them to him, and he said that was "childish" to make games. After games got too easy, I have started extending the features of the languages, I made a module for a "Changeable Range" in Python, where one could just write:               j = crange.CRange(5)      then               j.shift(10)      to shift the start and stop up ten and               j.reverse()      to create a reversed range. I showed it to him and he said "There is no value in that." Is there a way to explain to him that there is value in my programs, or am I just moving at a very slow pace in my learning?
