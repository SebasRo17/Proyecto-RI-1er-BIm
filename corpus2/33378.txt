_disclaimer: for simplicity sake, brackets will refer to brackets, braces, quotes, and parentheses in the couse of this question. Carry on._ When writing code, I usually type the beginning and end element first, and then go back and type the inner stuff. This gets to be a lot of backspacing, especially when doing something with many nested elements like:               jQuery(function($){$('#element[input="file"]').hover(function(){$(this).fadeOut();}));      Is there a more efficient way of remembering how many brackets you've got open ? Or a second example with quotes:               <?php echo '<input value="'.$_POST['name'].'" />"; ?>
