When a user browses some page and then switches a language, then the following actions should occur:   * If there's a translation for a page he's browsing now, then do redirect to that page.   * If there's no translated version of that page, then do redirect to a home page. So for example, a user browses `/about-us` page then he switched to German language, then he should be redirected to `/uber-uns` if a translation of `/about-us` in german exists. Currently I have a structure like this,               CREATE TABLE `pages` (            `id` INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT       `language` varchar(3),       `urlSegment` varchar(250),        `content` TEXT          ) DEFAULT CHARSET=UTF8;      What relationships/columns should be added to achieve that?
