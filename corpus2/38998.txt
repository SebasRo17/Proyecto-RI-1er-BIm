I am totally new to _Mathematica_ , and I have never used a similar program, apart from perhaps Excel (and I didn't even use Excel on a professional level). So I want to create a mathematical model which will give me an estimation on when Moore's law will end, using my input. It won't be anything revolutionary, but I want this to be my first _Mathematica_ project (I'm in high school, and I suspect I'll be using _Mathematica_ more in university). I'm having trouble even navigating around in _Mathematica_ , I'm wondering where I can find the tools to start modeling? I know they exist, as seen here, but where can I find the function or functions I need to make my own model?
