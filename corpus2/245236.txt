I am converting a project from C to mixed C/C++. It is going quite nice, and the new features are really lightening the work. The platform is an ARM SAM4, compiler is arm-none-eabi-g++. This is not a safety-related equipment, but still could be left running for months and is not supposed to restart sporadically. The original C project has managed quite nicely to solve problems without a single `malloc` call, allocating statically all needed data. For example, arrays with unknown size are allocated to the maximum expected size. Now I am considering can I get away with using `new`. For example, all STL containers hold their content in the heap. Just adding a new element to a `vector` can cause de-allocation of a whole region of the heap and allocation of another one. Will there be fragmentation issues? Related: What is memory fragmentation?
