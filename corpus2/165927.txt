**Previous related questions:**   * Code bases for desktop and mobile versions of the same app   * Git branching and tagging best practices **Question:** I have split my repo into three directories (swing, android, and common) as suggested by @KarlBielefeldt in response to my previous question. Now I am jumping back and forth between developing my Android port and tweaking/adding features to my original Swing app. All of my commits are linear (fast-forward) and only my commit messages give hints indicating whether I'm working on my Swing app or my Android app. Is there a better way to keep track of the work flow in my git repo?
