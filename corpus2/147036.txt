Kind of a yes / no question and why? **Is it the responsibility of the software developer to understand what the customer meant with his/her request or is it the responsibility of the customer to properly explain his/her request to the developer?** The situation at work is currently "the customer already explained us, what he wants. It's your responsibility to understand the request, not ask more questions". While English is not my strong suite, all the requests are written in obscure English with misplaced words and hard to understand sentences, some requests assume previous understanding of the system on my part. I'm the 3rd or 4th developer of the system (the last developers quit the job) and that might be the reason the customer expects some understanding on the developers side. The system itself is quite messy both in the UI and source code level. This looks like monkey coding to me - code and hope you get the request right, while not actually understanding the request. I'm actually thinking about quitting the job, but haven't yet, given I'm not sure about who's right and who's wrong.
