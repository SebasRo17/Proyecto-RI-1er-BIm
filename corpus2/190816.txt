I am developing an application where I draw large number of lines (color is given as black) and update them where I need to remove them from screen. I thought of making their color to match with the background so that I can make them hide. It seems to be simple and works but in the practical sense I have 10000 points and almost more than 20000 lines to be drawn and as most the line overlap or cross each other it is so disgusting the view. So I need some kind of function to actually remove those selected lines between two known points from screen. Even I have a problem with the background color I can match the exact background default color of the applets. Can anyone suggest me solution or the color?
