I have two sets of data in the form               a={{.1,2},{.2,3},{.3,4},{.5,6}}          b={{0,8},{.1,4},{.2,7},{.3,1},{.5,10},{.6,3}}      Both data sets have even spacing, although the `b` dataset has significantly many more data points at higher and lower values of `x`. How do I convolve these data sets? `Convolve[a,b]` only works if I use just the `y` values of the datasets. Is there a way to convolve this data while still keeping these `x` values?
