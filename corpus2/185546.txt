I am working on a module which is dependent on other module for some functionality. Now the dependent module provides a lot of functionality and I need only few of them, hence got the idea to create an abstraction of the same in my module which is again be a singleton only. My question is when to abstract out and when to use the modules singleton class directly? Is there any guidelines for the same? Or its depend upon project to project?
