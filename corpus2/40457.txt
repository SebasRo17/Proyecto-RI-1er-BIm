I have an opportunity to work in a company that looks good from the outside but has something that bothers me. It doesn't use commercial technologies. The main language that will be used is Java but the company doesn't use all known technologies like Spring, Struts, Hibernate etc. Instead it has its own technologies that do pretty much the same. Can you tell me what are the pros and cons about working in such a company?
