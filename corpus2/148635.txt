Suppose I want to implement `MVC` in JavaScript. I am not asking about MVC frameworks. I am asking how to build it _in principle_. Let's consider a search page of an e-commerce site, which works s follows:   * User chooses a product and its attributes and press a "search" button.   * Application sends the search request to the server, receives a list of products.   * Application displays the list in the web page. I think the _Model_ holds a `Query` and list of `Product` objects and "publishes" such events as "query updated", "list of products updated", etc. The _Model_ is not aware of DOM and server, or course. _View_ holds the entire DOM tree and "subscribes" to the _Model_ events to update the DOM. Besides, it "publishes" such events as "user chose a product", "user pressed the search button" etc. _Controller_ does not hold any data. It "subscribes" to the _View_ events, calls the server and updates the _Model_. Does it make sense?
