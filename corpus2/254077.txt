I am trying to make an my own OS. This is for educational purpose only, so that I get to understand the internals as well as get a good idea of low level programming. I have some prior application development experience in C#/python/C++/C. I am a noob in assembly language(very less experience and knowledge). I understand that in writing an operating system,we can't go without assembly language. Currently, I have just printed a string in assembly language in the boot sector using qemu and BIOS interrupts.   What I want is that, can someone specifically point out the steps that I need to follow to make my operating systems run C programs. So that, I can start writing my OS in C.   Any other piece of advice to help a newbie, regarding the same is also welcome. Although, I have looked into many os development related tutorials/websites, I can't seem to find this information anywhere.
