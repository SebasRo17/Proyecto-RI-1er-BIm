Recently, I've become deeply interested in Haskell. While attempting to learn new concepts (e.g. the forall keyword and ST monad) and Haskell's type system in general, I continually run into concepts from category theory and lambda calculus. So, I wonder:   1. What other branches of mathematics are important to a strong understanding of Haskell's type system?   2. Can I forego a rigorous study of these maths and instead focus on certain pertinent concepts? (e.g. quantifiers in lambda calculus.) If so, which concepts are essential? I'm hoping to pick up Types and Programming Languages soon, however, please suggest any alternative reading resources you feel appropriate.
