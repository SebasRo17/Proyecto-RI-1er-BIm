I'm junior programmer and I would like to know how professionals write their code or which steps they follow when they are creating new software. I mean, which steps they follow, which programming methodology, software architecture design application software, etc. I would like to find a tutorial where they explain from the beginning which steps I have to follow from The Idea I have in my mind to the final version of the application in any language. Or perhaps how is your programming steps or rules that you used to follow. Because everytime I want to create the an application I spend few time on the design and a lot of time coding (I know, that's not good).
