I've read in many places (heck, I've even written so myself) that garbage collection _could_ (theoretically) be faster than manual memory management. However, showing is a lot harder to come by than telling.   I have never actually **_seen_** any piece of code that demonstrates this effect in action. Does anyone have (or know where I can find) code that demonstrates this performance advantage?
