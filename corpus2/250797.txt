Over the last few months, I've been making a Windows Phone 8.1 Runtime application. I have little experience with this (although a decent amount of other programming experience), but I've managed to make my way through. Now, however, I've hit a wall. What I need to do is, from the mobile app, send a query to some sort of web service, which will do some things with the query based on a database and return a result. The problem is I have zero experience with any sort of web service, and although I am fairly confident in my ability to work out how to do it once I know what I'm doing, the last few days I've been running into the issue of what exactly I should be doing. There's a lot of options that I can hardly distinguish between, and not a lot of introductory explanations to which one should be used where. There's also this issue which keeps coming up: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/windowsapps/en- US/9ab43a4c-499a-4f2e-81e5-c1ab5acbe9bf/wcf-add-service-reference-not- supported-for-windows-phone-81-xaml-applications?forum=wpdevelop So in all, I'm left not really knowing in what direction I should be heading. On the web service-side, should I be making a WCF application? ASP.NET? On the phone-side, should I be accessing the web service using an HttpClient? StreamSocket? Something else? Does it matter? Really, what I'm asking is -- what are the differences between these options, and which ones will work for what I'm trying to do?
