If I write                    count=0;          fib[0]:=(count=count+1; 0);          fib[1]:=(count=count+1; 1);          fib[n_] := (count = count+1; fib[n-2] + fib[n-1]);      Then I can type for example                    fib[5]      and then                    count      and I can see how many times the "fib" was used to compute fib[5]. How can I write this as a function that gives me this number immediatly? So for example f[n_] := ... ?
