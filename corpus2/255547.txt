Suppose I have a class which takes a parameter of type `T` and a collection of parameters of type `U` in the constructor. The following solution works:               struct Q     {         Q(T t, std::initializer_list<U> us);     };      Creating an instance of this class would then be: `Q q {t1, {u1, u2, u3, u4} };` But this looks kind of unclean to me. Is there a better solution than this one?
