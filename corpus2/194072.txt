I am planning on building a system where users "subscribe" to "records". Records are updated on a schedule, several times a day. When records are updated, the user should be notified that these records have been added/updated. I don't want each user to have their own copy of the records due to storage space and the overhead of inserting many records, one for each subscriber, each time the schedule runs. However, each user will need to add metadata against each record they are subscribed to. Such as notes and flags that the record has been read etc. Can anyone give me any advice or how to structure such a system or where I can learn more about this sort of application architecture? Is this the correct place to ask? At the moment, I'm not even sure what to Google for ;)
