Please stare at this structure for a second :) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uZaWg.png) I should create such a thing all at run time. What are the values that we pass in at run time? the string values you see after "#" are passed in so for example AnimalBio, ClinBio, HumanGenome,etc... So I am thinking of declaring some methods like               void AddDeclaration(string str) ;     void AddSubClass(string parent, string child);      such that when I call them they will create those XML-ish tags for me with the values I pass in such as HumnaBio. These are around 15000 items that I am gonna add... What is the best approach that you would suggest for doing this? Do you think using XMLDocument class is the best way of doing it? or do you think I should go with StringBuilder class and add these as strings, or other ways of doing it? Thanks.
