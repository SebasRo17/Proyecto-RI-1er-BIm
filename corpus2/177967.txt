Are there some theoretical reasons for that (like that the type checking or type inference would become undecidable), or practical reasons (too difficult to implement properly)? Currently, we can wrap things into `newtype` like               newtype Pair a = Pair (a, a)      and then have `Pair :: * -> *` but we cannot do something like `Î»(a:*). (a,a)`. (There are some languages that have them, for example, Scala does.)
