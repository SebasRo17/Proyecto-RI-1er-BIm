I have two tree data-structures that I made in C++ , and they give a response for range queries/point queries in that program. I am using Ubuntu. I need help in understanding the way to compare the performance of these two data structures (for answering the query in that program) in external memory. How can I do this? I searched a lot on the Internet, and I didn't find any clear idea on how this is done. I know I can measure disk I/O, memory consumption, CPU usage, etc. using Ubuntu's dstat, and iostat commands. I need some accurate and professional way to do this.
