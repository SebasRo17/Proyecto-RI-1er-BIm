In OOP there is the Open/Closed principle that states that > "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for > extension, but closed for modification". Taking in consideration that in Ruby it is to possible to reopen a class, don't you think that this breaks the Open/Closed principle? When do you think we should favor reopening classes instead of just extending them? What do you think that are pitfalls in reopening classes?
