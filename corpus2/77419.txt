I have been working with .Net for 7 years. ASP Web Apps, Windows Forms, Windows Services, mostly done in C#, but some in VB.Net. And as we started to work with .Net 1.1, we stayed on .Net 1.1. Recently I did a few projects in .Net 4.0, which I'm sure are not different from those done in .Net 1.1, and I guess they can be easily compiled in .Net (haven't tried it, though). I see that there are some new tricks and methods, and obviously the framework has grown quite a bit...   1. I wonder if there is any difference from 1.1 to 4.0, in code, techniques, language abilities (you don't have to list them, just point out your favorites if there are any), etc?   2. What would you recommend I should do to learn those new things created in latter frameworks than 1.1?
