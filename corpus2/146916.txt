For the longest time (about 5 years out of school now), I've been fairly motivated enough to go to work each day and do actual quality work. Lately I've been losing a ton of motivation. I'm starting to realize that this is really affecting my performance at work for the last several months now. I just don't enjoy doing this anymore. It's just too tedious (especially my current project). I think I might be able to work on easier projects or just do maintenance type work (like fixing bugs or things that don't require an elaborate design document). I think I could be fine doing that sort of thing instead. I really have no idea what is causing my loss of motivation. It just sort of happened recently and now I find myself really struggling to even work on my current task. Help? Maybe I should finally just quit and start working on an iPhone app or something. lol.
