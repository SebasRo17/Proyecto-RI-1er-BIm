I got two classes.   * busiObj(created from ancient flat files)   * key(provides means to tell busiObjs apart) key has a c'tor that takes a busiObj               public key(busiObj foo)     {         bar = foo.someThing;         [...]     }      I want to create the key in the c'tor of the busiObj               public busiObj(...)     {         myKey = new key(this);         [...]     }      However: Why on earth does it work?   I firmly expected the compiler to throw something like:   "You cannot reference an object that is currently being made, duh". So: How is it that I can reference an object while it is still being constructed?
