According to the manual, Hyperlink “represents a hyperlink that jumps to the specified URI when clicked”. OneNote produces hyperlinks that begin with onenote://. In Mathematica, creating a hyperlink to a OneNote page does not work. It returns a message: “The file that you tried to open was not found…” According to the manual again, “non-file URI open in a web browser”. When I paste the onenote URI in my web browser, it opens the target. 1) Can you confirm this bug in Mathematica? 2) Does anyone know of a workaround? * * * Steps: 1) In OneNote right click on a page label and select Copy Link to Page. The clipboard contains something like: > onenote:///XXXX#Compound%20expressions,%20Get%20and%20Goto&page- > id={7D74D7D4- E640-4217-9575-877E08975BED}&end 2) Create a text cell, put some text, select and press `Ctrl+Shift+H`. Paste the OneNote hyperlink. 3) Click in the hyperlink. * * * **Update** Following this answer, running               Hyperlink["test", MathLink`CallFrontEnd[ FrontEnd`SystemOpen[      "onenote:///\\\\myComputer\\The%20Notebook&page-id={7D74D7D4E640-4217-9575-877E08975BED}&end"]]]      creates a hyperlink that jumps correctly when it is created. If one clicks on the hyperlink, then nothing happens. On the other hand, running               Button["test", MathLink`CallFrontEnd[ FrontEnd`SystemOpen[      "onenote:///\\\\myComputer\\The%20Notebook&page-id={7D74D7D4E640-4217-9575-877E08975BED}&end"]]]      creates a button with that works correctly. I will report this as a bug to Wolfram (in the no so near future). * * * **My workaround** For the sake of …, I'll post this workaround. It produces a hyperlink-looking button.               Button[Style["test","Hyperlink"], MathLink`CallFrontEnd[ FrontEnd`SystemOpen[       "onenote:///\\\\myComputer\\The%20Notebook&page-id={7D74D7D4E640-4217-9575-877E08975BED}&end"]]       , Appearance -> None]
