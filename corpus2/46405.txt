Combinatorica has a heuristic edge-coloring function `EdgeColoring`. When I execute it on a graph, the result is a list of integers. My guess is that an integer $i$ at position $j$ in the list corresponds to coloring the edge $e$ at position $j$ with the color $i$. The Combinatorica documentation is helplessly scarce, and it's hard for a beginner to understand how to visualize the colored graph. Am I supposed to use `ShowGraph`, or `Highlight`, or something else? For example, consider the following.               << Combinatorica`     g = CompleteGraph[4];     c = EdgeColoring[g];      The output is now `{1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1}`. How do I print out the graph with the colors on the edges showing?
