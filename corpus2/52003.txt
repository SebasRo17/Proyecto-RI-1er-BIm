Toady, I encountered a problem while trying to classify certain data. I have the coordinates of six points.               data = {{0.349661, 0.380297}, {0.858156, 0.8442}, {0.906745, 0.171579},      {0.0847783, 0.277227}, {0.198453, 0.40206}, {0.941614, 0.347187}};      I want to perform some operation on the x coordinate. The operation is as follows. If the x coordinate in one of the following ranges               {{0.0423892, 0.141616}, {0.141616, 0.274057}, {0.274057, 0.603909},       {0.603909, 0.882451}, {0.882451, 0.924179}, {0.924179, 0.959049}}      The new x coordinate will have the value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respectively. I tried the following:               judge = {{0.0423892, 0.141616}, {0.141616, 0.274057}, {0.274057, 0.603909},         {0.603909, 0.882451}, {0.882451, 0.924179}, {0.924179, 0.959049}};     Which[Sequence @@             Flatten@Table[{judge[[i, 1]] < # < judge[[i, 2]] &, i}, {i, 1, 6}]] /@      data[[All, 1]]      However, it failed. I discovered the mistake was               Table[{judge[[i, 1]] < # < judge[[i, 2]] &, i}, {i, 1, 6}]      I got > >     {{judge[[i, 1]] < #1 < judge[[i, 2]] &, 1}, >      {judge[[i, 1]] < #1 < judge[[i, 2]] &, 2}, >      {judge[[i, 1]] < #1 < judge[[i, 2]] &, 3}, >      {judge[[i, 1]] < #1 < judge[[i, 2]] &, 4}, >      {judge[[i, 1]] < #1 < judge[[i, 2]] &, 5}, >      {judge[[i, 1]] < #1 < judge[[i, 2]] &, 6}} >   rather than > >      {{judge[[1, 1]] < #1 < judge[[1, 2]] &, 1}, >       {judge[[2, 1]] < #1 < judge[[2, 2]] &, 2}, >       {judge[[3, 1]] < #1 < judge[[3, 2]] &, 3}, >       {judge[[4, 1]] < #1 < judge[[4, 2]] &, 4}, >       {judge[[5, 1]] < #1 < judge[[5, 2]] &, 5}, >       {judge[[6, 1]] < #1 < judge[[6, 2]] &, 6}} >
