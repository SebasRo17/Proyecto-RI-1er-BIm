I am trying to grow my project, and I am vaccillating between some examples. Some options seem to be: **1\. open sourcing the project to draw volunteer developers.** _Pros_ This would mean anyone can try and make some money off the code that would motivate them to contribute back and grow the project. _Cons_ Existing bigger could easily copy and paste my work so far. They can also replicate without having access to the code, but that would take more time. I also thought of using AGPL license, but again, code can still be copied without redistribution. After all, enforcing a license costs a lot of money, and I cannot just say to a possible copycat that it seems you copied my code, show me what you got. **2\. Keep the project closed source, but create some kind of a developer program where they get revshare** _Pros_ I keep the main rights for the project, but still generate interest by creating a developer program. Noone can copy code easily, just with some considerable effort, but make contributions easy as a breeze. I am also seeing many companies just open source a part of their projects, like Acquia does not open source its multisite setup, or github does not open source some of its core business. _Cons_ Less attention from open source committed devs. **Conclusion** So option 2 seems the most secure, but would love some feedback.
