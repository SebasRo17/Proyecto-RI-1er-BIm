Lets say you have a button objects on a form with a click event (c#/.Net). How is the event handler normally named throughout the industry?   * fooButton_Click   * fooButtonClick (or if you like Hungarian)   * btnFoo_Click   * btnFooClick When visual studio creates the event handler it defaults to underscore + EventName. This seems to violate the norm of using camelCasing and UppderCamelCasing instead of separating words with underscores. Is there any reason to change it, or practically everyone following what Visual Studio does?
