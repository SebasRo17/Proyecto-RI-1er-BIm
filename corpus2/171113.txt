I have attended to many SOA related sales pitches and presentations through the years. SOA projects have died because of lack of interest or because of grandiose scopes. The very buzzword has lost momentum. Has someone seen SOA implemented ? Or is it a kind of utopian vision one must strive for ? Do one have to believe in SOA without touching it or having seen it ?
