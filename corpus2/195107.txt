One of our team member duplicates code. Code duplication causes confusion among my team members reading his code, it causes bugs down the line when the duplicated segment is fixed in one location and not the others and it bloats the size of his code-base. I have discussed with him not to duplicate code. But he show excuses that it will delay our projects deadline if he refactors all the places where he made code duplication. How better can I deal with him?
