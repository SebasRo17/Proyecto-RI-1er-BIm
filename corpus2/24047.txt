I am about to start my first professional career position as a software developer, and I'm likely going to be writing a lot of Java code. I don't know that much about what specifically I'll be writing, and besides, I have fairly broad interests when it comes to code anyway. For reasons not worth discussing, my last internship had me coding only for the Java 1.3 and 1.4 SDK's. Also, my university education has focused mainly on algorithms, data structures, and other theory, not language features or libraries. So, with the above in mind, what features, classes, etc. in the current version of Java (what number are we on now, anyway?) would be worth my time to read up on and why? What have I missed since 1.4.2 that makes your life as a programmer easier? Examples and stories of how you discovered a particular package or some such and put it to use would also be great.
