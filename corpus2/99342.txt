I am working over a OCR Application where I need to select a option based on user text input.               Ex:     Available Options:     ["python", "ruby", "java", "clojure", "haskell"]          Input: kava     Output: java          Input: ruby     Output: ruby          Input: clujuro     Output: clojure          etc..       my application is python based, is there a algorithm already exist to solve this problem.
