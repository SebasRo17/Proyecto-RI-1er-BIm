Currently we have code stored on a shared network drive and do not use any kind of VCS. The code stored on our shared network drive is always being backed up. We would like to keep things as close to they are now as possible, while using some kind of VCS software. I am envisioning a centralized workflow with each developer having a local copy of the code on his/her machine. We don't do any branching or working offline. Typically when we spin off a new version we would just copy the current working directory to a new directory. I believe we would continue doing this and just create a repository for the new version. I would rather not get into an argument over which VCS is better, just hoping to get some opinions for which is best suited and most applicable for what we are trying to do.
