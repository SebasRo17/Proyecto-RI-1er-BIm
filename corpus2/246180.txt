How could an expert system tell following scenarios apart? How could we include some meaning of a sentence, if at all?               A machine needs 1 day to produce x units, and,           we know that two machines like the first would need 1/2 day for x units.       However, if:               a truck transports a container from a to b in 1 day,            but two trucks won't transport the same container in half the time.      But how to establish a logical rule to exclude attaching a truth value to the second sentence? Hoe to process sentences that depict a process that can not be divided in pieces (that means, include the meaning of 'divisible'/'non- divisible'), and therefore, an expert system can't assign automatically a time value to a process that has to be performed. The enhanced expert system would then be able to avoid scheduling failures.
