I want to run some function with different parameters, parallel on 4 cores (i5). When I run it without using `Parallelize`, processor has ~25% utilization. It's a little time consuming (a couple of minutes), so I tried run it 4x with different parameters on each core. I tried: `Parallelize[{f[a1,b1,c1],f[a2,b2,c2],f[a3,b3,c3],f[a4,b4,c4]}]` (also with different methods like: "FinestGrained"/"CoarsestGrained"/"EvaluationsPerKernel" -> 1) and still, total utilization of cpu is 30% top).   1. Each variant is processed within a few minutes, at least 4 minutes.   2. In Parallel Kernel Status window all 4 kernels have status _busy_ , after the start of the calculation. I used Parallelize earlier and it worked just fine (~100% utilization).  So, what is the reason? My configuration: Mathematica 9.0.0/Win8 x64/i5 2500k, 4GB RAM
