In version 8 I was a frequent user of the "Use shortcut keys to easily type〚 and 〛" trick. In version 9, when I try to make the necessary change to `KeyEventTranslations.tr`, the `\\[LeftDoubleBracket]` and `\\[RightDoubleBracket]` get immediately changed to doubled single-brackets (`[[` and `]]`). And indeed the shortcuts work, but they insert the doubled single-brackets instead of the single double-brackets. How can the brackets' doubleness be preserved in `KeyEventTranslations.tr`?
