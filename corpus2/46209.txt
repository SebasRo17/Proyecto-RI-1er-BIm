I'm trying to do some symbolic calculation like this: > Substitute (11.2) into the last two of equations (11.1) and, in turn, > substitute these into the first of equations(11.1), ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fwgvD.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/u3IVZ.png) I want to obtain a fourth-order differential equation that is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxy.png) I have read some material in official documentation, but i still don't know how to do this in _Mathematica_. Can somebody help me about this, or just tell me to which book/website I should refer so that I can do the calculation in _Mathematica_.
