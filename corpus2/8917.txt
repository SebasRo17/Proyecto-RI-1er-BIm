I've been using SVN for sometime and have been making an awkward, but soon to be rewarding transition over to git. Theres quite a few side / small projects that I'm working on which 90% will never see the light of day. As well - I also have my weekly school assignments / projects, and finally client projects that I have on the go. I've been rolling the idea or question of how or what the best way would be to back up my projects. The solutions I've sought out so far: **github** which offers an outstanding service - I'm ok with my work being open source, however It's the school work and client work I might not want the public to be open to. github, of course has a payment plan - but let's face it, im a poor colleage student doing what I can to at least put KD on the table! Theres the **USB thumbstick** that I can take around with me, work off of or back up, but that requires it to be around constently. Theres **Dropbox** , but thats a little overkill since it already is a form of a version control system, as well - I have quite a few things on the go - putting everything within dropbox would eat a lot of space Finally, theres a **private server**. I have a mac mini setup as a media server and I was thinking that I could backup to that. Anyways - what are your guys thoughts, how do you handle backing up projects, not only for version control but for the everyday backups.
