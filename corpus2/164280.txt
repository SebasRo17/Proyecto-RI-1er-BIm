I have recently seen a .NET MVC solution in which the markup in the `.aspx` views which appear to have a Controller as their model i.e the controller seems to be providing the data for the view, and the `.ascx` user controls they contain use a separate model. I'm new to MVC and I wanted to find out about a few things I'm not clear on. An example of how the code is implemented: `UserDetails.aspx` view has markup that shows it's using the `UserDetailsController.cs` as the model. It contains `RenderPartial("User_Details.ascx", UserDetailsModel)` and passes it the `UserDetailsModel`. Is this the standard/correct way of implementing MVC? Or just one way to implement it? I also noticed that the classes used as Models appear to be Service classes that have `[DataMember]` and `[DataContract]` attributes on the class name and properties - what is the advantage of this implementation?
