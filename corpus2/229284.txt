I'm somewhat new to programming (I'm a mechanical engineer by trade), and I'm developing a small program during my downtime that generates a (solidworks) part based on input from various people from around the plant. Based on only a few inputs (6 to be exact), I need to make hundreds of API calls that can take up to a dozen parameters each; all generated by a set of rules I've gathered after interviewing everyone that handles the part. The rules and parameters section of my code is 250 lines and growing. So, what is the best way to keep my code readable and manageable? How do I compartmentalize all my magic numbers, all the rules, algorithms, and procedural parts of the code? How do I deal with a very verbose and granular API? My main goal is to be able to hand someone my source and have them understand what I was doing, without my input.
