The Chebyshev polynomials T_n of the first kind are a certain set of orthogonal polynomials. They can be defined by T_n(cos(x))=cos(nx), the first of them are   * T_0(x) = 1    * T_1(x) = x    * T_2(x) = 2x^2 - 1    * T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x    * T_4(x) = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1    * T_5(x) = 16x^5 - 20x^3 + 5x    * T_6(x) = 32x^6 - 48x^4 + 18x^2 - 1   * T_7(x) = 64x^7 − 112x^5 + 56x^3 − 7x A plot in the cartesian plane looks like this, seen on Wolfram Mathworld: ![Chebyshev polynomials](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3eflY.gif) On the same page, I found a beautiful polar plot of those polynomials: ![Chebyshev spiral](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UZrTD.gif) There they wrote, referring to "Graphica 1" by Michael Trott: > A beautiful plot can be obtained by plotting T_n(x) radially, increasing the > radius for each value of n, and filling in the areas between the curves > (Trott 1999, pp. 10 and 84). A version without filling, posted by Paul Kemper: ![Chebyshev spiral without filling](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DsFYf.jpg) I would like to understand the way that plot is generated. The filling doesn't matter to me, I just would like to know how I could plot such a polynomial radially. As the domain ranges from -1 to 1, I should take pi as a factor. Does anybody know a formula to display those functions in polar coordinates in such a way with increasing radius?
