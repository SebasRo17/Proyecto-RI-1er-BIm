I'm currently learning C via 'C Primer Plus' as recommended by a lot of people here and I'm finding it very interesting - the in-depth explanations of how and why we do certain things in C are great rather than just being told what things do and going no further... I feel as though all I can do with C at the moment is maths, which isn't terribly inspiring when trying to picture putting various applications together in my head (besides calculators (-_-)). I'm only about half way through the book so it hasn't covered things like the if statement yet, but I'm just taking it easy - I already know a fair amount of programming concepts since I'm fairly capable in PHP. My question is - are there any tutorials are interesting bits of source code people can link me to that will inspire and educate me beyond the loops/variables/operators/etc universal programming features that will give me an insight into programming say.. with Windows API? Or things along those lines? I found PHP fine to learn since I already knew html/css which obviously handle the front-end of my web applications, as well as the reverse - getting input data from forms, interacting with a database etc, but with C I don't know anything other than 'backend' and standard I/O stuff. Many thanks to those that can link some interesting resources - a lot of sites seem to be fairly old, which is fair enough (what, with C having been around for coming up 40 years?), but I'm not programming for 40 year old computers so...
