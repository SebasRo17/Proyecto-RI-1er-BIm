## Memory refresher/My understanding: A 2-3 tree is a balanced search tree that allows two types of nodes.   1. 2-node: Normal node with two children.      * LChild < Parent and RChild > Parent   2. 3-node: Node with two parents and three children.      * Parent1 < Parent2     * LChild < Parent1, Parent1 < MChild < Parent2, RChild >Parent2 A 2-3 tree is always balanced, and grows when the root raises the height of the tree by one. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%E2%80%933_tree My question is then as follows, **given n distinct keys, how many different 2-3 trees can one construct?** My math skills are poor, so if anyone knows how I should "math" in order to approach an answer, then that would be awesome! :)
