There does not appear to be any documentation on how to use `Method` in `Eigensystem`, or at least not in Version 9.0.1 of Mathematica (unless I'm looking in the wrong place). The documentation page for `Eigensystem` just gives a single example of using an Arnoldi shift as               Method -> {"Arnoldi", Shift -> -4}      and the internal implementation page at `tutorial/SomeNotesOnInternalImplementation#5107` just says that `Eigensystem` uses an ARPACK Arnoldi solver for iterative computing of the first $k$ eigenvectors. The documentation page on `Method` likewise makes no mention of what options are available for use in eigendecomposition problems. Is there any documentation on what possible syntax options are available for `Method` in the context of `Eigensystem`?
