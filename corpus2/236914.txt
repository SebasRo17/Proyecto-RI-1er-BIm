So I have been messing around with thingiview since I wanted to have a 3D viewer for the models on my site. It works great and everything except one problem. It's nothing wrong with thingiview, it is the fact that since the model is loaded into the browser, that means the model could also be copied. So my question is, is there a way to prevent a 3D model file that is loaded into thingiview, which uses three.js from being copied freely. The only idea I can come up with that is copy proof is to have snapshots generated and then the user could just view the snapshots, but that sucks compared to being able to actually view the file. So any ideas?
