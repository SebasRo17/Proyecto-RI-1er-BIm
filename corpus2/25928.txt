a simple example Text Cell Style with a inline Cell (DisplayFormula)               Cell[TextData[{"inline mode ",Cell[BoxData[FormBox[RowBox[{"f", "(", "x", ")"}], TraditionalForm]], "DisplayFormula", FormatType->"TraditionalForm"], " "}], "Text"]      setting in Options `DefaultNewInlineCellStyle` is `DisplayFormula`. If setting in Options `DefaultNewInlineCellStyle` is `Text` this would not happen. I think someone would also encounter the situation: Converting between TraditinalForm and StandardForm sometimes auto-add or remove some ().

However, maybe the same to `\\(`. As Silvia's former suggestion, I should just not use `DisplayFormula` in inline cells. But I still need to check: would some other inline styles generate such double `\\(`s?
