I have the following :               public class doCheck(){              public void performCheck(){             try {                 perform all checks......             }             catch(Exception e){                 logger.error("Exception occured in class doCheck in method performCheck");                 thrown new MyNewException(e.getMessage());             }         }     }      Is it safe to log the class and method name?
