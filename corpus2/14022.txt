I am considering publishing a Mathematica notebook, used for analysis of some data, as a “supporting information” file alongside a research paper. What are the common practices for doing so, and what should I consider in making this choice? In particular, I am wondering:   * Is the `.nb` format suitable, or should I transform it into a CDF?   * Or is it better to include a PDF of the Mathematica notebook (thus readable by anyone), attaching the notebook itself inside the PDF (thus allowing Mathematica owners/users to use it directly)?   * Do I need to audit/edit the content of the file to remove any metadata that could leak?
