Trying to make a better-looking globe model, I start off with something like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ddScb.png) To enhance the 3D effect, I want the lines further from the eye to be "grayer" than the lines closer to the eye, as if there were a little fog inside the sphere. I thought I might get there by replacing the great-circles with semi- transparent wafers, but it didn't work. It seems as though I hit some kind of internal limit on the number of semi-transparent objects I can create before they become opaque. Here is the original code with polygonal great circles (minus the RGB-XYZ axes):               ClearAll[e, o, g, \[Epsilon]];     e[1] = {1, 0, 0}; e[2] = {0, 1, 0}; e[3] = {0, 0, 1};     o = {0, 0, 0}; g = 1.25; \[Epsilon] = 1/10000;     ClearAll[polycircle];     polycircle[n_: 360] :=        Line@Table[{Cos[2 \[Pi] i/n], Sin[2 \[Pi] i/n], 0}, {i, n + 1}];     ClearAll[globeGrid];     globeGrid[bands_: 6, figure_: polycircle[]] :=       {Table[         Scale[Translate[figure,  Sin[(k \[Pi])/2] e[3]],           Cos[(k \[Pi])/2]]         , {k, -((bands - 1)/bands), (bands - 1)/bands, 1/bands}]        , Table[Rotate[Rotate[figure, \[Pi]/2, e[1]], k \[Pi], e[3]]         , {k, 0, (bands - 1)/bands, 1/bands}]};     ClearAll[showFrames];     showFrames[figure_:polycircle[]] := Show[{           Graphics3D[{          Opacity[0.05], Sphere[], Opacity[1.0]          , globeGrid[6, figure]          }]   }       , Axes -> True       , PlotRange -> {{-g, g}, {-g, g}, {-g, g}}       , ImageSize -> Large];     showFrames[]      To improve it, I replace the polycircles with partially transparent wafers, which are very thin cylinders at low opacity:               ClearAll[wafer];     wafer[opacity_: 1/24] :=       {RGBColor[1, 0.71, 0]        , Opacity[opacity]        , Cylinder[\[Epsilon] {-e[3], e[3]}]        , Opacity[1]};      The results were disappointing               showFrames[wafer[]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6KVNx.png) **EDIT:** I tried a tube               polytorus[n_: 100] := Tube[polycircle[n], 0.01];     showFrames[polytorus[48]]      it's too slow to be interactive, but it has a better 3D effect. Still looking for a better answer. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFlZm.png)
