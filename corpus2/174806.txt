I am new to AJAX and trying to understand a question I've been given: A HTTP request is generated by a form which contains some drop-down list. When the form is submitted, a new web page is displayed with some relevant text information (which is dependent on the list item selected). Now, the same parameters are sent to the server via an AJAX request, and the same text information is returned. Q. What tasks would the client-side JavaScript have to do to ensure a valid request was constructed and sent? Any useful links or quick explanations greatly appreciated.
