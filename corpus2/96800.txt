I have a boss that is not very technical. He can write some basic SQL, speak some dev lingo, but all in all not a pro dev. I get into trouble often, by giving him a lot of detail and asking him to make a decision as to which direction he wants to go. For example, recently he asked for a bunch of changes to go into a product. Then took 80% of the changes away saying he is not ready to release these yet. But then, I speak to our lead developer and he tells me to just push it all. This way we avoid having to manually merge code that we do want pushed vs code we do not want pushed (by push I mean move from dev to QA, forward merge). So, the lesson is...do what's easy. Don't tell the boss that you are pushing up all the stuff. This doesn't seem ethical to me, but this is what the solution turned out to be. So, where do I draw the line? Do you feel that hiding details is unethical or just a normal job function of a developer? I ask only highly experienced developers answer this question (10+ years). I know there's skilled guys with less experience, but I want experience to speak in this case, not just skills.
