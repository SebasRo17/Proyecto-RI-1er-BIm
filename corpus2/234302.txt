I have an applications that queries a database, then renders a asciidoc template with data from the db, and converts the asciidoc to pdf. Now in the data there are certain characters that need to be escaped in order to not the mess up the formatting of the pdf. I have two options on where to do this:   * **Option A** : in or near the code that does the db query. Plus: escaping done only once. Minus: db code needs to know about the output syntax.   * **Option B** : in the template. Plus: escaping done where the formatting syntax belongs. Minus: Escaping possibly done more then once. I am leaning towards Option B, but I would be interested in what others think would be the best thing to do.
