I've been thinking about making a generator for managing subscriptions with options for a couple different payment processing services, it is something that I would use. Are there any existing examples of this, or any thoughts on a generator. I thought it might work like the scaffold function, similar to the authentication function in nifty-generators. EDIT: Also, It seems that there should be a lot of security concerns when implementing payment processing, having a consistent and common way to generate this would let me make sure best practices and security are followed the same in all my apps.
