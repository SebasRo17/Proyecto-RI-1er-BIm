I am trying to connect to a SQLite database and since there is no officially supported driver; I decided to use the sqlite-jdbc driver and port the respective code into Mathematica. However, the DriverManager refuses to connect to the database, the error message is:               Java::excptn: A Java exception occurred: java.sql.SQLException:      No suitable driver found for jdbc:sqlite:C:/sqlite/test.db     at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:602)     at java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:207).      The driver & the code that I am trying to port is at: https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc and the respective lines that I am having issue is:               ....     Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");          Connection connection = null;     try     {       // create a database connection       connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:sample.db");     ....      I noticed the code uses a Class.forName() and I used the JLinkClassLoader to load the same class. Here are my efforts so far:               <<JLink`     (*location of the driver jar*)     AddToClassPath["C:\\drivers\\sqlite"];          LoadJavaClass /@       {"java.sql.Connection", "java.sql.DriverManager",  "java.sql.ResultSet",        "java.sql.Statement", "java.sql.SQLException","org.sqlite.JDBC"}          LoadJavaClass["com.wolfram.jlink.JLinkClassLoader"];     cls=Class`forName["org.sqlite.JDBC",True,JLinkClassLoader`getInstance[]];          (*Errors out with the message above*)     DriverManager`getConnection["jdbc:sqlite:C:/sqlite/test.db"]      I used `DriverManager.getDrivers()` and it shows me that only the sun.jdbc.odbc driver has been loaded; so the error message is justified. I am at this point not sure how to proceed /debug the issue and will greatly appreciate any assistance. If you have any suggestions, I will be very grateful.
