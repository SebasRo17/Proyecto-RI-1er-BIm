Consider the list               mylist = {b(a/bc t)^r, a/b(b t)^r, a (c/d t)^r, ...}      where a, b, c, t, etc., are real numbers between 0 and 1. I want to sum each term in the list over r from 1 to infinity. Since my list is very long, _Mathematica_ takes a long time if I evaluate               Table[Sum[mylist[[k]], {r, 1, âˆž}], {k, Length[mylist]}]      Instead, I would like to write a function which I can apply to the list such that for each element, `x^r -> x/(1-x)`? I think this would be a lot faster than _Mathematica_ computing a geometric series for each element.
