I have a collection of about 40 notebooks where the options for ParametricPlot and ParametricPlot3D have:               Compiled->False      and I need to switch any/all instances to               Method->{Compiled->False}      Is there a way to do this via Mathematica v.9? One challenge is that I do not know all the notebooks which may or may not have this. Perhaps Mathematica is not the proper tool and this is more of shell scripting exercise? Any thoughts on the best way to approach this would be greatly appreciated. Cheers, t. PS - Mac OS X, Mathematica v.9 (latest update)
