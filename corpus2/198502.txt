I'm about to start working on a new commercial PHP project with a friend that will be licensed and sold as a script to run on your own shared hosting account or server. Looking at the statistics (http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl- php/5/all) 50.3% of PHP 5 installations are still PHP 5.2 or lower (43.5% being php 5.2). With this in mind, is it wise to ensure new software still supports PHP 5.2 given that such a high proportion of installations arent going to support modern PHP features such as namespacing and the likes of Composer.
