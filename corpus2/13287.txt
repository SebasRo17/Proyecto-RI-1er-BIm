Since the consensus is usually that `NDSolve` speeds fares badly against compiled code such as c++ ODE solvers using GSL say, is it possible to make up for this lag by using Mathematica's `Compile` functionality? Somehow compiling your ODE to make it execute quicker or some such? If not is there a way to use something like MathLink? And finally, is it really true that c++ ODE solvers outperform Mathematica 8 `NDSolve` in terms of speed?
