I have a list of data (measured per day) that I want to use as imput for another equation (say f). The problem is that the input I need for f needs to be a continuous function of time. Is it possible to change my data into a function? I would either like a function that is linear increasing or decreasing between the different timesteps (like the line you get when you use `Joined` in `ListPlot`) or a stepwise function that immediately jumps to another value the next day. I tried using `Interpolate` but then when I measured 0, I get negative values which is not possible for my measured values. Hope someone could help me. Simplified example:               tmin=1;     tmax=6;     data = {{1, 3}, {2, 0}, {3, 0}, {4, 5}, {5, 7}, {6, 10}};     ListPlot[data, AxesLabel -> {"time(day)", "data(mm)"}, Joined -> True]          f = Interpolation[data];     Plot[Evaluate[f[t]], {t, tmin, tmax}]      If you evaluate this: the first plot is the result I would prefer for my function, the second plot is not what I want as the values drop below 0. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nxFAO.png)
