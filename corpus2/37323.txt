Suppose that $u(x,y)$ is a function, and $x=r \cos t$, $y= r \sin t$, then we can define a new function $v(r,t):=u(x,y)$ with $x,y$ replaced by the above equations. It is quite easy to compute $v$'s derivatives, for example $\partial_{rr}v(r,t)$ can be computed in MMA as               v[r_, t_] := u[x, y] /. {x -> r Cos[t], y -> r Sin[t]}          D[v[r, t], {r, 2}] // Simplify      The output of which looks like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mhhqB.png) Then, my question is how to define a new rule, to make the output above look like: $$ \sin^2tu_{tt}+\sin(2t)u_{rt}+\cos^2tu_{rr}. $$
