So as both a full-time programmer and hobbyist as well (developing my own things for personal use and maybe to sell one day), I feel that me purchasing a big white board to hang in my room at home or something would be very useful. Does anyone here have one as well, to use for high level designs (UML, Architecture, etc.) and things like very early UI mockups, etc.? If you guys do have them, which ones have you bought? I can't seem to pin one that would be good for home use and I'm not sure of the pricing/other things. Thanks!
