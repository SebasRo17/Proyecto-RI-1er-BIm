I'd like to know how can I call Mathematica functions from Python. I appreciate a example, for example, using the Mathematica function **Prime**. I had search about MathLink but how to use it in Python is a little obscure to me. I tried to use a Mathematica-Python library called _pyml_ but I hadn't no sucess, maybe because this lib looks very old (in tutorial says Mathematica 2 or 3). So, someone knows a good way to write python programs who uses Mathematica functions and can give me an example? **Old Edit:** _Maybe this edit can help someone who wants to use mathlinks directly._ _To another solution, please see the answer accepted._ Using the _Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/Links/Python_ I could had sucess in compiling the module changing some things in setup.py. _My architechture is`x86-64`._ 1-Change the `mathematicaversion` to `8.0`. 2-Changing the lib name `ML32i3` to `ML64i3`. 3-Copying the file `Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux-x86-64/libML64i3.so` to the path pointed in setup.py `library_dirs = ["/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/" + mathematicaversion + "/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/Linux/CompilerAdditions"]`. 5-Compiling the source with `sudo python setup.py build`. 6-Installing the lib with `sudo python setup.py install` 4-Editing the file `/etc/ld.so.conf` and putting the line ` include /usr/local/lib`. 5-Creating a directory in `/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/mathlink` with the lib `libML64i3.so`. 6-Running `sudo ldconfig` I had tested the scripts `guifrontend.py` with `python guifrontend.py -linkname "math -mathlink" -linkmode launch` and `textfrontend.py` with `python textfrontend.py -linkname "math -mathlink" -linkmode launch` and worked fine. Looks like I almost. But the script               >>> from mathlink import *     >>> import exceptions,sys, re, os     >>> from types import ListType     >>> mathematicaversion = "8.0"     >>> os.environ["PATH"] = "/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/" + mathematicaversion + ":/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"     >>> e = env()     >>> sys.argv=['textfrontend.py', '-linkname', 'math -mathlink', '-linkmode', 'launch']     >>> kernel = e.openargv(sys.argv)     >>> kernel.connect()     >>> kernel.ready()     0     >>> kernel.putfunction("Prime",1)     >>> kernel.putinteger(10)     >>> kernel.flush()     >>> kernel.ready()     0     >>> kernel.nextpacket()     8     >>> packetdescriptiondictionary[3]     'ReturnPacket'     >>> kernel.getinteger()     Traceback (most recent call last):       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>     mathlink.error: MLGet out of sequence.      breaks in the last command and I don't know why. How can I fix this?
