With popular software out today like Node.js, Celery, Twisted, and others boasting about being asynchronous, what does it mean? I've gone through the basic Node.js tutorials and written a few Node.js scripts, but still don't feel comfortable with the topic. Please note that I haven't had I had any formal introduction to the topic.   1. How exactly does asynchronous software work?    2. What are the pros and cons?   3. What are callbacks?   4. Lastly, how does a synchronous web server perform vs. an asynchronous web server?
