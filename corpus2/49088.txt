I am trying to solve a polynomial equation of higher order with non-integer exponents. When the order of the system is greater than 4, FindRoot provides a correct solution that is not found by NSolve. Here is a minimal example: In:               Clear[k,sol1, a, G, j, l, equ];     a=0.3; G=4;     equ := k^(G(1 - a)) == (1-a)/G Sum[(G-j+1) a^(j-1) k^((G-j)(1-a)), {j, G}];     NSolve[equ, k]     sol1 = FindRoot[equ, {k, 1}]     equ /. sol1      Out:               {{k -> -0.0654054 + 0.0537165 I}, {k -> -0.0654054 - 0.0537165 I}}     {k -> 0.881805}     True      How can that be? Thanks for any help! PS: for G<4 everything is fine, for G>4 the same problem seems to persist
