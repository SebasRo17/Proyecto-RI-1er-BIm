The situation is this - we took an intern for a summer with a mind that if he will catch up during summer, we will keep him as a part time junior developer.   We took him after his first year in university, so his knowledge was way too low to be involved into real projects(actually he programmed only in university), so my task was to push as much stuff as I can to have him ready for joining real projects in September. As long as we are remote developing team, we gave him possibility to have its internship remotely, with flexible hours. So two months passed and I'm not impressed with his progress. I gave several tasks to implement, access to learning resources, recommended start paths and so on, agreed that he will report every couple days, we had pair sessions from time to time, reviewed his code together and etc. Anyway, it looks like he spent less time writing code than I expected and before I would say that he didn't performed well enough to join our team, I was thinking may be that is my fault, may be I was pushing too much stuff, that is important in real life projects (like unit testing, structuring code, database stuff, etc.) and not enough fun stuff, that would hook up him on programming and that is the reason he spent less time than I hoped. So I have ~20 days left and I can use them to inspire him with programming, question is with what and how?
