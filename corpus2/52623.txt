I started seriously taking a look at Lisp this weekend (by which I mean I have only been learning Lisp and not reverting back to projects in C#) and must say I love it. I have dabbled with other functional languages (F#, Haskell, Erlang) but haven't felt the draw that Lisp has given me. Now as I continue to learn Lisp, I have started wondering why non-functional languages don't support first-class functions. I know that languages such as C# can do similar things with delegates and to an extent you can use pointers to functions in C/C++ but is there a reason why this would never become a feature in those languages? Is there a drawback to making functions first- class? To me, it is extremely useful, so I am lost as to why more languages (outside the functional paradigm) don't implement it. [Edit]I appreciate the responses so far. Since I have been shown that many languages now support first-class functions now, I'll re-phrase the question to be why would it take so long for languages to implement them? [/Edit]
