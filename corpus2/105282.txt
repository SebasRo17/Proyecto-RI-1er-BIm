Currently I'm in my dream job in a research lab as the only developer in a multidisciplinary team. I'm getting a little bit worried because I'm forgetting about coding in a team (I don't have legacy code, I maintain my own code, I handle my own agenda, etc). Although I try to follow some of the the best practices like continuous delivery, TDD, and SCRUM just for me I think I'm losing my ability to work in a team of developers. I've joined an open source project and began into the code katas and code golf. But these won't polish my team player profile. What would be your suggestions to sharpen my team player skills? _Update:_ Yes, my communications skills are now better and I can talk to PhD's like never before. Like @Nicholas and @Erick said, someday I will be facing a developing team (maybe in my current job, maybe not) and I want to keep current with those practices that makes a good developer a better team member, like pair programming or code review.
