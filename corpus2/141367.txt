I'm researching ways to build a web service to periodically traverse a predetermined list of web pages (of another external website) to detect if a page's content has changed from   1. editing of the page, and   2. deletion of the page. The end goal is to have this web service post push-notification events to mobile devices. FYI, I've searched and read "Questions with similar titles" here. Thank you for sharing your answers.
