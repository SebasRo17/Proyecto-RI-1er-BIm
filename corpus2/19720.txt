I try to find an answer of a very difficult question. The question is: > How many developers and how many software companies are there in the world? For example if I check the Statistic Austria page I can see that in Austria there are 8383 companies with 35522 employees defined as "Computer programming, consultancy and related activities" and another 4102 companies with 15171 employees defined as "Information service activities". This statistic is good, but it is only for Austria. Is there a similar for Europe, USA, Worldwide?
