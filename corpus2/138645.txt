I'm a self taught programmer, and although I know many people feel math isn't necessary, I find that in many examples of algorithms I come across talk about (what sounds to be) some pretty complex mathematics. I would love to eventually have a solid understanding of the math that a good, university educated computer scientist should know. I don't really remember any math past algebra 2. With that being where I left off, what should my starting point be? What math topics should I research, and in what order? I'm looking to build a curriculum for myself that will be pretty easy to take on from where I left off and continually learn until I have a similar understanding to that of what a university would provide.
