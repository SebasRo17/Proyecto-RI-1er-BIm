I believe these three expressions should give the same answer of `-1/Sqrt[3]`, but the first gives `+1/Sqrt[3]` whereas the second and third give the correct value, using _Mathematica 8_. What am I doing wrong?               ThreeJSymbol[{a, 0}, {b, 0}, {c, 0}] /. {a -> 1, b -> 1, c -> 0}        ThreeJSymbol[{a, 0} /. a -> 1, {b, 0} /. b -> 1, {c, 0} /. c -> 0]       ThreeJSymbol[{1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, 0}]
