I have to minimize a function where the evaluation of one parameter set takes very long (around 5sec) and discovered alongside, that `NMinimize` seems to call this function multiple times with the exact same values. As an example, consider the code               f[x_?NumericQ] := (Print[N[x, 10]]; x^2);     NMinimize[{f[x]}, x, Method -> "RandomSearch"]      The first couple of lines of the output are:               -0.829053     -0.829053     -0.829053     -0.829052     -0.329053     -0.329053     -0.329052     -8.85837*10^-9     -8.85837*10^-9      6.0428*10^-9      Am I missing something? The same output is also produced by setting `PrecisionGoal -> 3` and `AccuracyGoal -> 3`, thus we can rule out that the numbers in the output are just identical representations of different numbers.
