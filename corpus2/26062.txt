Given a `TabView` panel like this one               TabView[{       DynamicModule[{x = False}, {Checkbox[Dynamic[x]], Dynamic[x]}],       "foo"}]      I would like to reset the value of `x` to its initial value (`False`) every time the first tab gets selected - that is, I basically want to "reset"/"reload" the tab on each selection. Also, the variable(s) in question should remain _local_ variables on a per-tab basis, if possible. This is, I hope to avoid a solution declaring `x` globally. Any help very much appreciated (either on reloading the whole tab or on setting specific dynamic variables).
