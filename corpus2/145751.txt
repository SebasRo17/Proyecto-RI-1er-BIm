C# style suggests using CamelCase in identifiers to delimit words. Lisp tradition suggests using-dashes-instead. Has there ever existed a programming language where using spaces in identifiers was not only allowed, but a commonly used idiom when employing multi-word identifiers? It's possible to have identifiers with spaces in some Scheme implementations, but it's not a widely seen practice. Here's an example:               Petite Chez Scheme Version 8.4     Copyright (c) 1985-2011 Cadence Research Systems          > (define |hey there| 100)     > (define |x y z| 200)     > (list |hey there| |x y z|)     (100 200)
