If this has already been asked, feel free to redirect me and I'll close this. I gave my current employer notice to quit my job a few months ago, and they haven't been able to find anyone to replace me. I'm able to leave the job in another month, and the company has started to ask me if I'd be willing to continue working on a contract. I've considered registering myself as a sole proprietor and doing some additional work for them, if they're willing to pay me silly amounts of money. If I were to do this, it would be done professionally, with a contract and a lawyer to write up the contract. But that brings up a problem; I'm not sure exactly what should be in the contract. Is there anyone who has experience with this and could suggest what should be covered by the contract, or things that I might overlook until they bite me in the ass? On an additional note, but more specific to my situation, I'm currently working for this company in a foreign country. If I decide to do additional work for them, it will be from my home country. Is there anything that I should be careful of, since the company isn't located in my country? I'm wondering how realistic or financially viable it would be to hold a company located in a foreign country to a contract. If it's not realistic or doesn't make sense financially, I might be better off not accepting the work. Alternatively, skipping the lawyer and contract and just going on trust might be okay, but I'm still weary of doing this even though I've worked with the company for a few years.
