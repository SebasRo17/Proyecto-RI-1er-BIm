Firstly, I'm not exactly sure if this question is a better fit over here, or on workplace.SE. So forgive me if it is in the wrong place. We are interviewing some candidates for a development position, and currently they are not in our city. We would like to give them simple coding tests to see how they will perform on the typical issues that we face in our daily work. Are there any specific tools geared towards this? Right now we are using Skype and I feel this tends to decrease the performance of a lot of developers since they tend to be shy, and often can't work when someone is directly staring at them. The problem with sending them the test questions by email are as follows:   1. It is not possible to know what their thought process is, sine we just see the end result. There is no discussion, or clarification of the question, which is an Important step.   2. There is no guarantee that the problems were solved by the candidates themselves. They could send it to a smarter friend, and we wouldn't be able to know. How are these problems usually solved?
