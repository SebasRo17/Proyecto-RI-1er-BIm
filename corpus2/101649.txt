I've been programming for a few years and I began in Java, and in my time I've found many different sources claiming Java to be an inferior language in some way or another. I'm well aware that each language has it's strengths and weaknesses, but a lot of things I've read about Java seem to be dated. The most often cited reason for Java being inferior is that it is much slower than other natively compiled languages, like C++ for example. Many people criticize the game designer Notch (who developed Minecraft) for using Java because of its apparent lack in the performance department. I know Java was much slower back in the day, but there have been many improvements since, especially JIT compilation. I would like to get some objective opinions of Java as a language today. So my question has 4 parts.   1. Performance. a. How does Java's speed today compare to C++? b. Would it be possible to create a modern AAA title using Java? c. In what areas specifically is Java slower than C++, if at all? (i.e. Number-crunching, graphics, or just all around)   2. Is Java now considered a compiled language or interpreted language?   3. What are some major shortcomings of Java that have been addressed since the early days?   4. What are some major shortcomings of Java that have yet to be addressed? Edit: Just for clarification purposes I'm not making this Java vs C++, obviously on average c++ will be a little faster than Java. I simply need something to compare Java to in terms of maturity as a language at this point in time. Since c++ has been around forever I thought I would be a good point of comparison.
