I am seeing a weird behavior on exporting at least one type of file (here, a QuickTime movie) to files with long names. If I do this:               In[19]:= Export["Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipisicing-elit.dat", {42}]     Export["Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipisicing-elit.mov", {42}]     FileNames["Lorem*"]      it hurts:               Out[19]= "Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipisicing-elit.dat"     Out[20]= "Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipisicing-elit.mov"     Out[21]= {"Lorem-ipsum-dolor-s#123C8BE.mov", \     "Lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet-consectetur-adipisicing-elit.dat"}      The `.dat` file has the correct name and the `.mov` file hasn't, even though `Export` tries to make me think it has. My questions are:   * This is not on a MS-DOS box, but with Mathematica 8.0.0.0 on Mac OS 10.7.3 (64-bit kernel). Can you comment if other versions/operating systems reproduce this issue?   * Although I find nothing with Google, is this a known bug and is there a fix?
