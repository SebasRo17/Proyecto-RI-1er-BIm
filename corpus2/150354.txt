I've been checking out Berkeley DB and was impressed to find that it supported a SQL interface that is "nearly identical" to SQLite. http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17076_02/html/bdb- sql/dbsqlbasics.html#identicalusage I'm very curious, at a high-level, how this kind of interface might have been architected. For instance:   * since values are "transparent", how do you efficiently query and sort by value   * how are limits and offsets performed efficiently on large result sets   * how would the keys be structured and serialized for good average-case performance
