I would like to know the ideas that are being used for explaining to the client the limitations of the language used for enhancement of the existing project. Given a scenario was that the project existed in VC++ 6.0 and the client had asked for enhancement that could include transparency (alpha) component in the color part (currently using `gdi`). I found out that `gdiplus` library supports such feature but could not find it for MSVS 6.0 since its already being outdated (could not even find the msdn files for it) did not have support for gdiplus. I had to explain it to my client, so created an application in the newer MSVS and included both `gdi` and `gdiplus` and drew some objects using both the libraries side by side. So gave him an idea that the following point could be fixed if we migrate it to the newer version of code. Since client being a developer himself understood it. But there are cases when the clients are not developers and bearing no knowledge about programming. In such cases it is difficult to explain the problem.
