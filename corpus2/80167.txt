I understand plagiarism and paraphrasing fairly well when it comes to writing a research paper, but those equivalent areas in programming seem foreign to me. I've looked up the topics online, and surprisingly there is not as much material on the subject as one would have expected. When writing code and having to implement something I've never implemented before, I'll go online to look for an example. I try to read through the documentation beforehand, but sometimes I find it challenging to follow. So if that fails, I will search for the topic online and be presented with dozens of examples (whether they be on someone's personal blog or a Q&A site like SO). Now I'm usually presented with 5-10 lines of code. I have and will NEVER copy- and-paste that into my own code, but I still worry about copying it down verbatim. I find it hard to reword a certain piece of code, especially when there are only so many ways to do so. I make sure to rename variables, change formatting, etc. - but is this enough? I've always wanted to understand this topic, but now that I'm working with a new language and in a corporate environment I think that it is especially pertinent. If anyone could explain or link to a good explanation elsewhere, I would greatly appreciate that! **tl;dr** I don't understand how much you have to change and reword 5-10 snippets of code found online to avoid plagiarism. What if there is very little that you can change?
