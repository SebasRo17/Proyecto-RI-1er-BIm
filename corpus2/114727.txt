Having used an IDE for the last 3-4 years, the other day a few of my coworkers and I came to a fairly sad realization that we had forgotten some basic Java methods/functions because we always relied on our IDE (Eclipse/STS/IntelliJ) to complete them for us (such as what a function takes in terms of parameters), is this a sign that our skills are deteriorating, that we're over relying on IDEs? (This whole discussion came about us talking about taking the Oracle Java 7 EE certification test and looking over a few practice questions, questions such as, what parameters does function X take, etc) If so, how do you guys fight off this sort of thing? Just re-read books and stuff? I myself can't imagine not coding with an IDE because in all honesty, it does make me code a lot faster with things such as auto complete, etc while some of my co-workers suggested we code sans IDE for a few months. I do realize that sometimes one doesn't need to know everything about a function, but I do remember a college professor telling us that IDEs are terrible because when the time comes that you need some sort of function, you'll have to waste time looking it up instead of just banging out the code from rote memory.
