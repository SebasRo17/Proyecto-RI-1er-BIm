All programs I have seen organize their data memory into one or more call stacks (usually fixed size, but sometimes not), the heap, and static memory. Lately thread-local static storage has been added to this as well. Have there been any attempts to organize data memory layout in a radically different way, e.g. without the call stack? Or organize memory in a different way that accomplishes the same thing?
