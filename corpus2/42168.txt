My question is about finding a object in a specific part of a image. For example, I use this image: As you can see, you will se two persons walking on the field. I only want to find the second person on the right site of center line ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yF0XY.gif) If I use the following script, Mathematica find both.               Show[Image[picture1, ImageSize -> 600],       Graphics[{Red,         Table[Inset[ToString[i],           PixelValuePositions[foto17, {0.07, 0.09, 0.1}, .05][[i]]], {i, 1,           Length [           PixelValuePositions[foto17, {0.07, 0.09, 0.1}, .05]]}]}]];      Is there a way to select a specific part of a image? Fore example, something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uI59o.gif)
