I came across Instagram's API client written in Python. In their class **InstagramAPI**, they bind the methods to a function in **bind.py**. When called, the function returns an instance of the class **InstagramAPIMethod** and execute the request call.   1. What are the advantages of doing it this way? (over directly creating instances of **InstagramAPIMethod** in **InstagramAPI** )?   2. What will happen if the methods in **InstagramAPI** are called numerous times? Will it create new a instance every call? Note, the only advantages I thought of are (probably I'm off track):   * The class doesn't/shouldn't care what the implementing class is.   * If a particular method is not called, we will never create an instance.
