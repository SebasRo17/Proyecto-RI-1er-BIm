Recently, I have been tasked with more high-level planning assignments due to the lead developer of my team leaving. I hate long-term planning. My brain just doesn't naturally seem wired for it, and I am not interested enough in it to spend the time to learn it (it is hard enough to keep up with the programming side of the picture). Can one still be a good programmer without being a high-level planner, too? As a senior programmer, is one expected to be good at planning out the entire product and picking a date of completion?
