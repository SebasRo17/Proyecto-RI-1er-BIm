I am generally a PHP Developer that deals in a few different MVC frameworks. I am being tempted (like most) to break out of my comfortable LAMP environment in pursuit of a "prettier" and "more simple" language, attached to frameworks that are becoming more and more popular. I agree with most arguments to switching to a (the) ruby framework or a python framework, and would trade out PHP for Python in the LAMP acronym any day of the week. But as I've found in trying to get started with these, it's not quite that simple... In my attempts to figure out the spaghetti of dependencies, versions, and install procedures, I've found that while final development time/simplicity is a benefit, in my mind it is almost overshadowed by the complexity of deployment... Especially being use to the copy/paste deployment to the ever numerous lamp hosting services. I am specifically speaking of   * Ruby on Rails   * Django (python) To those that work in these platforms, was your initial experience similar? if so how did you overcome it?
