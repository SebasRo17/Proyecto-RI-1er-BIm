Please consider the following:                Manipulate[Plot[Sin[x (1 + a x)], {x, 0, 6}], {a, 0, 2}];      Now, I would like to change the background colour to yellow. I tried the following, but in this case the nice looking rounded corners of the manipulate element get lost:               Panel[#, Background -> Yellow] &@      Manipulate[Plot[Sin[x (1 + a x)], {x, 0, 6}], {a, 0, 2},        Paneled -> False]      Maybe somebody has a better idea. **EDIT** The background colour of `Manipulate`is by default grey. ![<code>Manipulate</code>](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mz8fw.png) In addition the graphical element in which the `Manipulate` is embedded has rounded corners ![rounded corner](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ICUH7.png) which I would like to keep. Applying my approach will change the colour but I loose the rounded corners.
