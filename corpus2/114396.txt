I am writing an app at the moment that has some pretty extensive business logic based around dates. I have several hundred thousand records to test and testers who want to see how those records are handled, which has worked well so far, however, some edge cases are difficult to replicate. The reason is that most of the logic is related to today's date, in one way or another. What is the best way to handle this with both unit testing and for traditional testing? The only way I can really think of is allowing for today's date to be faked and fixed.
