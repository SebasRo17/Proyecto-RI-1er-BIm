I would like to run external command from _Mathematica_. For this I need to have bash environment configured via reading the content of `${HOME}/.bashrc` file. When I execute the following code in _Mathematica_ notebook               ReadList["!echo $PATH", String]      the content of `PATH` variable is not set as it is in `${HOME}/.bashrc`. The same happens when I explicitly load bash configuration file               ReadList["!source ${HOME}/.bashrc; echo $PATH", String]      (strictly speaking the above command makes no effect!). So the question is: is it possible to load the configuration stored in `.bashrc` file in _Mathematica_ external call under the Linux system (of course without explicitly setting e.g. mentioned `PATH` variable is not a solution for me)?
