Someone has already applied for the the vacant position, and is qualified for it. The only thing that is under doubt, is his poor typing skill (using 2 fingers and slowly). Should we consider this as a highly negative point? Or in general, should developers know how to type fast? Also I want to know how fast a touch-typist can type? Mine is 69 wpm with 95% accuracy (690 lpm)
