c = 1.1111;      y[x_] = x - c Sin[x]      NSolve[y[x] == 0, x]      The method has procured no result. Successive derivatives were plotted in an attempt to fix the problem.               Plot[{y[x], y'[x], y'''[x]}, {x, -Pi, Pi}, PlotStyle -> {Thick}, GridLines -> Automatic]          {y[0], y'[0], y''[0], y'''[0]}      This function has a root, a small value of first derivative,and an inflection point respectively@ _x=0_. Method fails due to vanishing first and third derivatives. Is it correct? It appears Newton's iteration fails as derivative value @ _x=0_ is extremely small as next iteration value seeking tangents do not intersect x-axis, failing to converge to a root there. What workaround do we have here? Is (old fashioned) Regula Falsi option available to solve this? This relates to my comments the recent thread:"How to get a solution for the following equation?"
