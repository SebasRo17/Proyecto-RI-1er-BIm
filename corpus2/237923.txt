Say you have a Car class. Properties that make sense for a Car class might be:               var make;     var model;     var year;     var turnOn; // a function      But the `turnOn` function is very complicated and ends up needing a static variable and a couple sub functions:               var isTurningOn; // too specific to be a class variable     function turnOn() {         // 30 lines to start the engine         // 30 lines to start the air conditioner         // 30 lines to start the radio     }      So now we have a function that maybe isn't really suitable to be made into its own class and it's polluting the Car class with a variable that only the `turnOn` function ever uses. Plus the function contains sections of code that should be made into their own functions. So what do you do in situations like this?
