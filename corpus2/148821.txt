I am developing an application in which I have a Class containing various methods. The problem is that i need to call most of the methods on form submission. For that reason, I have to create a new file on each form submission. On every file, I have to create an instance of the same class and then call the appropriate method. Is there any better way to call methods in such situation so that I don't have to create multiple files having similar functionality in php? I surely don't want to use any framework.
