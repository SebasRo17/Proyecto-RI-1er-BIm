I have 3 forms. Form 1 has information inserted into Form 2. After clicking a button on Form 2 to get to Form 3; on Form 3 I pull data and put it on Form 2. The problem with this is that I don't know how to get a single instance of Form 2 so that I can keep the data from Form 1 after pulling data from Form 3. This is a WinForms application. Any help would be much appreciated. I have looked into the Singleton way of doing it but everything I research seems too confusing to follow. Thanks!
