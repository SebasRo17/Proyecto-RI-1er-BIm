My apologies in so much as this is probably in large part a problem of me not being aware of the necessary mathematics but since this should be a common issue in machine learning and Mathematica now seems to have tools in this area, I'm hoping there is some simple way of doing this. Say I have some data set together with knowledge of how it changes when I vary some parameter               \[Mu] = 0;     data = Table[     RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[\[Mu], \[Sigma]], 10^3], {\[Sigma], 1, 100, 1}];      How can I find things like the Fisher Information Matrix? Of course I'm assuming that I do not know that this data set is obtained from the normal distribution. The idea is that this is just some black box which generates a data set and I can study how the data set changes when I change various input parameters.
