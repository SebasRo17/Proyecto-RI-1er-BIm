Given some list, e.g., `{5, 3, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 2, 2, 0, 1, 4}`, I need to limit the duplicates, if any, to an arbitrarily chosen number. The excess duplicates are to be chopped from the end of the list, order of list must be otherwise untouched. For example, with a limit of 2, the above example would become `{5, 3, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 5, 4, 2, 0, 4}`. List can contain pretty much anything that would make sense. I'm using               Module[{o = Ordering@#},        o[[o]] = Join @@ Range /@ Tally[#[[o]]][[All, 2]];        Pick[#, UnitStep[#2 - o], 1]] &[yourListHere, dupeLengthLimitHere]      which is fairly quick, wondering if there's a better can-opener for this.
