I am learning OpenGL API bit by bit and also develop my own C++ framework library for effectively using them. Recently came across Blender software which is used for graphics creation and is in turn written in OpenGL itself. For my part time hobby of graphics learning, I want to just create small-small movie or video segments; e.g. related to construction engineering, epic stories and so on. There may be very minimal to nil mouse-keyboard interaction for those videos, unlike video games which are highly interactive. I was wondering if learning OpenGL from scratch is worth for it or should I invest my time in learning Blender software? There are quite a few good movie examples are created using Blender and are shown in its website.   Other such opensource cross platform alternatives are also welcome, which can serve my aforementioned purpose.
