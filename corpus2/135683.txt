I have an argument with a collegue of mine regarding the C++ guidelines to follow. He currently designs all his libraries that way:   * He uses inconsistently uppercase and lowercase letters in his filenames   * Some of his headers don't have any extension I believe that having no extension is something reserved for C++ standard files and that using uppercase letters is error prone (espcially when you deal with code which is meant to work on both Windows and Linux). His point is that he follows `Qt` conventions (even for code that doesn't uses Qt) and keep saying : "If Qt does it that way, then it can't be bad." Now I try to keep an open-mind, but I really feel bad when I have to work on/with his libraries. Is there a common established set of rules regarding this ? Does the standard tell something about it ? Thank you very much.
