I keep learning new keyboard shortcuts for Visual Studio and I find some of them increase my productivity a lot. I was wondering what keyboard shortcuts in VS you found useful and why. I know I could find a list of shortcuts online somewhere, but I don't think that would be as beneficial to me as asking here since there are so many shortcuts and I think my eyes would just glaze over trying to read that list. Here are some that are extremely useful to me: **F12** \- Goes to the definition of any class or method. It has saved me so much time searching code files once I found that one out. **Ctrl+M, O|L** \- Expands/Collapses regions in C# or tags in XAML files. I love this feature in XAML files since I can't use Regions in them to make my code easier to read **Ctrl+R, E** \- Builds a property's Get/Set methods for me. That, combined with a few macros, makes building accessor methods a lot less painful **Ctrl+E, D** \- Fixes the whitespaces in code files I also created my own keyboard shortcut to CloseAllOpenFiles since VS2010 moved the Close button on open files and I can no longer keep my mouse in one place and spam-click to close all my open files. Why would they they think its a good idea to put the close button on each tabs and make the tabs various widths....
