I recently turned all possible error-messages on with `error_reporting(-1);`, on my PHP project. Of course, right away I got alot of messages. For example: > **Notice:** Undefined variable: foo in /.../file.php on line **205** So I started updating my code to get rid of all the notices. Mostly, by adding `isset($foo)` and making the `$foo = NULL;` So, I'm wondering. How important are these notices really? I mean, if the `$foo` variable is not set, then it should be false/null/not-set by default..so technically the code works?! If I would get rid of all notices, then does it make the process faster or slow it down (because I'm adding more code, `isset($foo)`, `$foo = NULL` etc)? How do you guys deal with these notices, or do you even pay attention to them?   I guess, the most important question is: Should the code be written so strict, that it would never generate any notices or warnings?
