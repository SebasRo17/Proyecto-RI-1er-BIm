It's now about 4 years of development that I'm using, hearing, talking about, and implementing hash tables and hash functions. But I really never understand why it's called hash? I remember the first days I started programming, this term was kind'of **cumbersome terminology** to me. I never figured out what is it, **based on its name**. I just experimentally understood **what it does** and **why and when should we use it**. However, I still sometimes try to figure out why it's called **hash**. I have no problem with **table** or **function** and to be honest, they are pretty deductive, rational terms. However, I think better words could be used instead of hash, like **key** , or **uniqueness**. Don't **key table** or **uniqueness table**. According to my dictionary, hash means:   1. Fried dish of potato and meats (highly irrelevant)   2. # symbol (AKA number sign, pound sign, etc.) (still irrelevant, maybe just a mis-nomenclature)    3. Apply algorithm to character string (still has nothing to do with **uniqueness** , which is the most important feature of a hash table)   4. Cut food   5. Another term for hashish Does anyone know why it's called hash?
