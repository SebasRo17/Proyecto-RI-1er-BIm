A number is 5-smooth if its only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. Example: > >     1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, â€¦ >   Interesting thing is that as they become larger and larger, they are sparser and sparser, with respect to all natural numbers... Now, how to make a visual illustration of that fact (becoming sparser)? I was thinking of lets say a 300 x 1000 rectangle, where each pixel means a natural number, and red is 5-smooth, blue is otherwise. This would work for first 300,000 numbers. Here is a collection of programs in various language regarding 5-smooth numbers: link Including this:               HammingList[N_] :=        Module[{A, B, C},          {A, B, C} =            (N^(1/3))*{2.8054745679851933, 1.7700573778298891, 1.2082521307023026} - {1, 1, 1};         Take[Sort @ Flatten @            Table[2^x * 3^y * 5^z ,              {x, 0, A}, {y, 0, (-B/A)*x + B}, {z, 0, C - (C/A)*x - (C/B)*y}],           N]];      and               HammingList[20]      > >      {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, > 36} >                 HammingList[1691] // Last      > >     2125764000 >                 HammingList[1000000] // Last      > > > 519312780448388736089589843750000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 >   Appreciate any idea and/or insight.
