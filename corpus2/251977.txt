How would you statically type the following JavaScript program               function c(str) {       c = eval(str);       return c(str);     }      I'm not trying to start a flame war but I'm genuinely curious. I've always assumed that dynamic languages allow more programs to be written because of examples like the above. But if a statically typed language is Turing complete then it should be able to express the equivalent of the above program. So where exactly does my reasoning break down because this seems paradoxical to me? My reasoning is that this is obviously a function that can not be typed in a statically typed language and still allow the generality that the above code allows for.
