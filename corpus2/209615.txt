There were 3 developers at this GIS tracking company, but now there's 2. Last week my boss was fired. Today, new developers will be coming in for interviews. They'll be coming in from a placement agency. I don't really know how to be on this side of a hiring interview. Any advice or sample questions I can ask? Company Background: The 2 of us wear many hats. We are the MySQL DB admins, we write C# web services including APIs, there's C# back end processes that generate reports and issue alerts, and we also have a few VB6 projects that I personally am hoping to replace. Our web app is just under 10K lines of javascript, almost 2K lines of HTML and just under 4K lines of CSS. We don't use a lot of frameworks or libraries aside from jQuery and Bing Maps. I've been here a year as just a developer and at no place have I ever worked with any sort of management responsibilities. What kinds of questions can I ask that can really show me that somebody knows how to develop in these languages? I'm really drawing a blank here.
