I write utility programs (converters, compression tools, etc.) with simple UIâ€™s, which I put for sale of for free download on the Mac App Store. I write these programs in English, and usually add a French localization (which I do myself). By comparing the distribution of sales per country between a localized app and nonlocalized one, I can estimate how much the French localization boosts my sales. (The apps themselves are pretty generic and not country-specific, which makes the comparison possible.) For example, on nonlocalized app A, my sales in France are 2.5% of all sales, while on localized app B, sales in France amount to 10%. This means _localization increased my overall revenue by 8.4%_.[1] My question is: **does someone have an estimate of how much localization is worth for each language?** (according to this metric, i.e. potential added revenue) This would be a great help to prioritize new localizations (which I cannot do myself). * * * [1] And not, that's not 8.5%.
