I have a warehouse management app that I have written that handles batching of orders for batch picking, scanning of items for packing and accuracy. Part of this app is a Dash or control panel that the different managers in the warehouse work out of. It shows who's picking, packing, who's available, how many orders are available to be batched and a BUNCH of other details and controls. Right now i have an ajax call that checks a time stamp that runs every 30 seconds or so to see if the page should be updated (a change made on another managers workstation). A manager does something that should be shown on all other workstations that are viewing the "dash". Maybe they batched some orders and pickers that were available are no longer available. Right now when the change is made i update a timestamp saved in a database. On the html page the timestamp that was in the db at last page load is saved in a hidden div. The javascript takes that timestamp and checks the database at an interval if its different the page updates. Its a bit more complicated than this as sections of the page get changed not the whole thing but the description sums up the process. This works but i don't like it. It requires a database hit from each workstation every 30 seconds. Seems overly complex. I am looking for some thoughts on how I might push a change as it occurs and minimize or eliminate some of the database interactions. Thoughts?
