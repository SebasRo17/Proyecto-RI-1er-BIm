I am struggling with architecture on a new project. I am using the following patterns/technology.   * CQRS - anything going in goes through a command   * REST - using WebAPI   * MVC - asp.net mvc   * Angular - building a spa   * nhibernate I belive this provides some great separation and should help keep a very complex domain from growing into a giant set of services that mix queries with other business logic.   * The REST services have become non restful. They are putting methods in rest that are "SearchByDate", "SearchByItem" etc.    * Service Methods that execute commands are called with a "web" model class, a new command is built in the service and executed, I feel like there is a lot of extra code.  I expected this to be much different but I wasn't around to keep things on track. Finally my questions are this... I would have liked to see `PUT Person (CreatePersonCommand)` but then I realized that isn't restful either is it? the put should be a person entity not a command. Can I make CQRS and REST service work together or am I going about this all wrong? How do I handle service methods that don't fit into a REST model. I am not performing CRUD on the object but rather executing some business logic. I.E. I don't want the UI to be responsible for how a shipment is "unshipped" I want the service layer to worry about that.
