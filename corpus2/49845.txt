I have been working on C++ backend large scale apps for over 5 years. I'm doing TDD, using STL and Boost etc. I decided I need a change and about year ago started learning Ruby, and few months ago I started playing with Rails, HTML5 and CSS. I don't know JavaScript yet, I'm focusing on Rails now. What can I expect on an interview for a Ruby on Rails backend developer job? How can I present myself to take advantage of my C++ experience? I'm on a senior level now and I can't start from intern position. I consider myself really good in C++, I know also some Scheme, some Python and quite a bit of Ruby. I'll have one small Rails app ready and 1 simple Gem published before I'll start applying. Plus quite a few personal C++ projects. I have a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering and I'm completing master degree in CS in June 2011.
