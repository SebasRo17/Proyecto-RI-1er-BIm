Many users have asked how to add `KeyEvent`s to speed/improve keyboard input. This is just a random example. The technique is always the same. It requires that you _manually_ modify `KeyEventTranslations.tr` (an important system file). It always struck me as a bit odd that even power users propose to manually do this. Surely this system file is loaded into _Mathematica_ at the start of a session (or not?), so it is perhaps possible to _programmatically_ add the necessary KeyEvents to an already running _Mathematica_ session. Of course in this case the new key bindings will only be temporary, but this might even be preferable in some cases. So the question is: is it possible to _programmatically_ add the necessary `KeyEvent`s to an already running _Mathematica_ session, without changing the `KeyEventTranslations.tr`? Alternatively: can we program _Mathematica_ to backup `KeyEventTranslations.tr` and programmatically modify it? I know this is possible, I just wonder if someone has done it. And perhaps automatically reload the new version so that it takes effect right away? * * * **The art of Quitting.** I take the occasion to post another item related to "saving keystrokes for your retirement": It recently came to my attention that many/most users when they want to quit the kernel, type `Quit[]`. Well...the good news are that you just need to type `Quit` (saving two keystrokes).
