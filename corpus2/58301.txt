We're looking at converting a software package from Windows over to the browser. It's a back office system consisting of Ledgers, Stock Control, Order Processing, etc and it's written in a legacy language (Dataflex). The project consists of 200+ database tables, 100+ reports, 300+ Views, 100+ Dialog boxes and 200 or so Selection Lists. I'm really struggling to get my head around the technologies that I'll need to use to convert this to a more modern web based programming language / framework. Even simple screens (Entering a stock location) seems overly complex. With the current language, I can drag a bunch of Fields to a form (a-la VB), wire in a tiny bit of database code and I've got a screen that'll allow me to find, delete, edit and change records easily. 10 minutes of development, tops. Has anyone got any suggestions on how I can move from my current VB style programming language to one that allows similar functionality on the web? Has anyone got any ideas how I go about working out how many man hours it's going to take to convert this sort of project to a new language on the web? What Web Framework options are available, and how do I decide between going with something like Rails vs going with something like ASP.Net? We've a tonne of code wired to OnClick and OnChange events. (I know this is bad). What strategies can I take with regard to converting this to the web? I'll admit - I'm hopelessly confused by some of the newer syntaxes used by modern languages. Is there any language that allows me access to the database without having to subclass everything through IEnumerable and various weird Typecasting things. Has anyone done anything like what we want to do? What were the pitfalls? Sorry about the vagueness of the question. I'd be more specific but don't know where to start. Delete away if I'm asking the wrong thing or in the wrong place.
