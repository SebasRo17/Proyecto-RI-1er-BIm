I am trying to plan a framework for relational algebra using the Dataset capability of Mathematica 10. In the work of Date and Darwen, there are two concepts known as TABLE_DEE and TABLE_DUM. TABLE_DEE is a relation with a (column) header but no rows, whereas TABLE_DUM is simply: Dataset[{}] How might I create a TABLE_DEE with Dataset--a table with headers, but no data? I feel this would allow a framework for performing orthodox relational database operations.
