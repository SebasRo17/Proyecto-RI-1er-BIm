I happened to read an interesting article the other day that talked about building mobile applications using Javascript and HTML5. One interesting point they brought out was how this approach worked across multiple platforms, different hardware (ex. screen size) and software (ex. iPhone, WP7, Mac, Windows). I also noticed something interesting posted on Microsoft's Build Website for their upcoming conference. They seem to put a lot of emphasis on HTML5 and JavaScript. It does seem ideal to develop a single application (of course it would still require minor modifications) and have it work on tablets, PCs, mobile devices, TVs or pretty much any internet-capable device. Is this a shifting trend? Obviously it's no fun learning a technology just to find out a year later that it's getting shut down. In my opinion it seems rather difficult as it stands to do certain functionality like animations or data-binding (my favorite!) with HTML5 and JavaScript when compared to Silverlight. In this case the tools alone make it a better choice (Expression Blend and Visual Studio 2010). I am concerned though because it has been getting easier to do things on the web that just a few years ago didn't seem possible. Is there still a place for technologies like Flash and Silverlight when it comes to developing applications or should we be aiming to gear our apps toward web-specific technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript?
