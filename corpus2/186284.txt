I have a class in which I want to disallow other programmers from overriding one of it's methods, since it requires special knowledge of the inner workings of the class. Since I personally know how the class works, I would like to be able to make an exception and actually DO override the function in one derived class. Is this a common problem to which there is a standard solution, or does the fact that I feel like I have to make an exception like this mean I should rethink my approach? Edit: I didn't mention languages, since I was looking for a general answer, but since it was requested, this came up using PHP.
