What language, in your opinion, allows the average programmer to output features with the least amount of hard-to-find bugs? This is of course, a very broad question, and I'm interested in very broad and general answers and wisdoms. Personally I find that I spend very little time looking for strange bugs in Java and C# programs, while C++ code has its distinct set of recurring bugs, and Python/similar has its own set of common and silly bugs that would be detected by the compiler in other languages. Also I find it hard to consider functional languages in this regard, because I've never seen a big and complex program written in entirely functional code. Your input please. Edit: _Completely arbitrary clarification of hard-to-find bug: Takes more than 15 minutes to reproduce, or more than 1 hour to find cause of and fix._ Forgive me if this is a duplicate, but I didn't find anything on this specific topic.
