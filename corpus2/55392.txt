I've just installed Workbench 2.0 and I am trying to use it with Mathematica 10. Following the examples in the help I created the sample Test project. When I hit run it does the following.   * Spawns a new Mathematica app.    * Opens a blank notebook.    * Workbench sits on 19% for about a minute.  After that I get the following error message. ![The Mathematica Notebook front end could not be launched.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGbK5.png) I have reinstalled Mathematica + Workbench from scratch but still the same. Also the blank notebook spawned is not in the `Directory[]` for the code. So that's a bit pointless. * * * As a workaround I have Mathematica launched and I've manually SetDirectory[] to my project, but it just seems a bit annoying I can't just work out of the workbench.
