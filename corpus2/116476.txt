There are those tags which have immediate effect (< br >) and those which affect what is between them ( < a > < / a > ). Closing tag is **verbose** , and I believe also **redundant** :               <tag parameters> ... </tag>      ## verbose Compare to LISP's s-expresions.               (tag parameters)      ## redundant Ending tags are not even necessary. These language are context-free and this is not possible there:               <tag1> <tag2> </tag1> </tag2>      Basically these should be equivalent:               <tag1> <tag2> </> </>     <tag1> <tag2> </tag2> </tag1>             ## questions Are ending tags there to aid readability? What is purpose of redundancy in closing tags? I want to understand inside the logic behind desing of this. Thanks. :)
