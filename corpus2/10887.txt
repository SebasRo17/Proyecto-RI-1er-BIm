I have a sequence of 100 lists. A sample list, list[1], looks like this:               list[1]=Table[{N[i/10], 25 - (i - 2)^2, 25 - (i - 8)^2}, {i, 1, 10}]          {{0.1, 24, -24},       {0.2, 25, -11},      {0.3, 24, 0},      {0.4, 21, 9},      {0.5, 16,16},      {0.6, 9, 21},      {0.7, 0, 24},      {0.8, -11, 25},      {0.9, -24,24},      {1., -39, 21}}      I would like to see where the 3rd column, $list[1][[*, 3]]$ is maximized. The 8th Row in this example. Then I want to note the value of the first column in the 8th row, namely $list[1][[8,1]]=0.8$. Then I would like to delete all records where the 1st column is > 0.8, i.e. where $list[1][[*,1]]>list[1][[8,1]]$ . In this example, since the numbers are monotonic, that means the last two rows get deleted. I'll be left with:                   {{0.1, 24, -24},       {0.2, 25, -11},      {0.3, 24, 0},      {0.4, 21, 9},      {0.5, 16,16},      {0.6, 9, 21},      {0.7, 0, 24},      {0.8, -11, 25}}      Then, I would like to see where the 2nd column, $list[1][[*, 2]]$ is maximized. The 2nd Row in this example. Then I want to note the value of the first column in the 2nd row, namely $list[1][[2,1]]=0.2$. Then I would like to delete all records where the 1st column is < 0.2, i.e. where $list[1][[*,1]]<list[1][[2,1]]$ . In this example, since the numbers are monotonic, that means the first row get deleted. I'll be left with:                   {       {0.2, 25, -11},      {0.3, 24, 0},      {0.4, 21, 9},      {0.5, 16,16},      {0.6, 9, 21},      {0.7, 0, 24},      {0.8, -11, 25}}      I guess both transformations are identical so if I know how to do one, I can do the other. I just mentioned both simply because it might be feasible to do both in one shot and that code might teach me more than learning the code for a single transformation. Also, I have a hundred different lists and I'd like to be able to do this transformation to all 100 of them in one shot, using Table or something. Thanks, PS: I have read advanced help but I can't seem to figure out how to get the shaded grey background on certain text so I have instead put $$ to get things like $ list[1][[*, 2]] $ as latex math above in my question to appear distinguished from the rest of the text.
