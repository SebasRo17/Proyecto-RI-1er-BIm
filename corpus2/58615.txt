I have a matrix               A = {{5, 4, 2}, {4, 5, 2}, {2, 2, 2}}      The eigenvalues are `1, 1, 10` and I need to find the eigenvectors. Solving for `1` would result in two eigenvectors. Using _WolframAlpha_ I get `(-1, 0, 2)` and `(-1, 1, 0)` This comes from `x3 = -2 (x1 + x2)` For instance I could have: > >     x1 = 1, x2 = -1, x3 = 0 >   > > or >   >   >     x1 = -1, x2 = 1, x3=0 >   and > >     x1 = 0, x2 = -1, x3 = 2 >   > > or >   >   >     x1=-1, x2=0, x3=2 >   How to properly order those values?
