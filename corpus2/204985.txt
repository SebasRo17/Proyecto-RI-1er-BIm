I'm currently working on a Computer Science degree, and I want to build my own Web Server library. The problem? Every search I've done on interacting with web sites points to "Use this library that was built by someone else" - instead of explaining the basics of sending and receiving information. I'm not asking for a lot - I just want to enter a single alpha-numeric character on a web page, hit a button, and have that one byte of information sent to a C++ program, without the aid of a non-standard library.
