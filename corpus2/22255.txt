I want to monitor a long calculation that is triggered by the release of a `Slider`. While one can indicate running calculations when the main evaluation loop is controlled by a queued `Button`, the same cannot be done with more direct `Dynamic` approaches. A bit of trial and error actually confirms that only `Button` and not any of the other controls (`Slider`, `Locator`, even `EventHandler`) can be evaluated non-preemptively. This works as expected, displaying a `ProgressIndicator` while the long calculation is performing:               long[] := Module[{a = .3}, Do[a = 3.5 a (1 - a), {i, n}]];     {active, x} = {False, 1};     {Slider[Dynamic@x, {0, 1}],       Button["Update", (active = True; long[]; active = False;), Method -> "Queued"]}     Dynamic@{If[active, ProgressIndicator[i, {0, 10^6}], "..."], active}      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vF9QG.png) The same cannot be done using a `Slider`. The update command was put in the second argument of `Dynamic`, more precisely in the slot which is evaluated when the controller is released. As you can see, it still evaluates `long` (the string is printed) but it does not switch `active` and consequently it does not display the `ProgressIndicator`.               long[] := Module[{a = .3}, Do[a = 3.5 a (1 - a), {i, 10^6}]];     {active, x} = {False, 1};     Slider[Dynamic[x, {(x = #) &, (active = True; Print["evaluating..."]; long[];           active = False) &}], {0, 1}]     Dynamic@{If[active, ProgressIndicator[i, {0, 10^6}], "..."], active}      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dHwsE.png) No amount of `TrackedSymbols :> {...}`, `ContinuousEvaluation -> False` or `SynchronousUpdating -> False` helped. **Is there any way to force $f_{end}$ in Dynamic[$x$, {$f$, $f_{end}$}] to be evaluated in a queued fashion, not preempting (its own) previous commands?** As a sidenote: It would be interesting to look into the implementation of `Button` as it definitely stands on something different than `EventHandler`. Does anyone has some insight on this matter?
