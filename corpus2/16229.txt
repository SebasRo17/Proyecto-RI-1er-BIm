I'm having trouble with RevolutionPlot3D with two variables. I have this parabola                ContourPlot[0 == y^2 + x + y + 5, {x, -15, 5}, {y, -10, 10}, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}]      but when I try to do RevolutionPlot3D with the equation               RevolutionPlot3D[{(y^2 + y + x + 5)}, {y, -5, 5}, {x, -5, 5},                      RevolutionAxis -> {1, 0, 0}, PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}]      it won't work, because x should be an Theta. How can I have something similar to               RevolutionPlot3D[{(y^2 + y + 5)}, {y, -5, 5}, {\[Theta], 0, 2 \[Pi]},                       RevolutionAxis -> {1, 0, 0}, PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}]      with a second variable?
