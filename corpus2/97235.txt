I am experimenting with marking assignments for a programming course using unit tests. Is it likely to harm the learning process if I publish some of the tests I use as part of the problem statement? I figure that reading the code will be good practice and provide a more accurate problem statement than I can deliver in words... but I'd like to hear about any drawbacks. I would change the exact numbers that I expect to put in and get out of the tests, and the assignments are more about testing introductory OO concepts than whether they correctly approximate Pi, i.e. I'm not concerned that showing some possible answers would give away too much.
