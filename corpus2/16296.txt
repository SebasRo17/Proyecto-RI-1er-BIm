I have always wondered about this and perhaps experienced folks here can comment on this. I always read that big established software companies such as Google, Microsoft, etc are always wary of hiring software engineers/(or other related professionals) who don't exactly meet the job requirements, and would rather turn down a close "Yes/Maybe" decision. There's also the general perception that start-ups are generally more willing to hire such "less-than-perfect" employees. But to me this sounds counter- intuitive: start-ups are generally much smaller and resource constrained so they would actually need a "10/10" hire while established companies with bigger teams and more resources would be willing to take a (small) risk on a hire. Anyone have any comments on this from first-hand experience? Thanks,
