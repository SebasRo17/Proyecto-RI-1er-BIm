I am trying to solve the following equations for the coefficients `c1` and `c2`.               w[x_] := c1*(1 - x)       a[x_] := c2*(1 - x)      Given the constraints:               Solve[(1 + w[x]*a[x]) == (1/x) && w[0] == wmax && a[1] == 0 , {c1, c2}]      Mathematica gives me:               {{c1->wmax,c2->1/((x-x^2) wmax)}}      However when plugging the formula for `c2` into `a`, the condition `a[1] == 0` is not satisfied. Instead of being zero, `a[1] == 1/wmax`. How can I convince `Solve` to generate a `c2` that truly makes `a[1] == 0`?
