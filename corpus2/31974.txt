I have some variables : Subscript[S, 1], Subscript[S, 2]...etc. But they are defined in a for loop like `For[g = 1, g < 4, g++, Subscript[S, g] = g];` Later, I need to print each of the variable name, i.e `Subscript[S, 1], Subscript[S, 2]`...etc. But I can't find a systematic way to do this. `For[g = 1, g < 4, g++, Print[HoldForm@Subscript[S, g]]];` doesn't work because it prints `Subscript[S, g]` always. Any idea? Just look at the code:               For[g = 1, g < 4, g++, Subscript[S, g] = g];     Print[Subscript[S, 1]]     Print[Subscript[S, 2]]     Print[Subscript[S, 3]]     For[g = 1, g < 4, g++, Print[Subscript[S, g]]];     Print[HoldForm@Subscript[S, 1]]     Print[HoldForm@Subscript[S, 2]]     Print[HoldForm@Subscript[S, 3]]     For[g = 1, g < 4, g++, Print[HoldForm@Subscript[S, g]]];     For[g = 1, g < 4, g++, Subscript[S, g] =.];      And this is the result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jEDSy.png)
