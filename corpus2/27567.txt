Imagine I have the following matrix: `X={{0,0,0},{1,0,1},{1,1,1},{1,2,1},{3,3,3}}`. I want to select the sublists that are greater or equal than this list `T={0,1,1}`. Greater in the sense that `X[[]]-T` has no negative entries. The output should look like `R={{1,1,1},{1,2,1},{3,3,3}}`, since all elements of the sublists are equal of greater than the elements of the list T compared element by element. Thanks for help! Thanks for the quick answers. I have searched myself meanwhile and found this one:               Higher[C_] := Select[B, NonNegative[Min[#[[]] - C[[]]]] &];      Does it seem right?
