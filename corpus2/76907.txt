I work at a bank and I developed an in-house web application that helps keep track of past due loans and all the interaction between the bank and the customers. I was recently told by an outside consultant, who frequents many different banks, that each one of these banks would die to have a loss mitigation system like the one I built. I just read Joel's response to a similar question about copyright ownership. In his example he said that even though **_Joe was hired to write the code, he still owns the copyright._** So, do I own the copyright to this app and can I resell it to other banks? ### Update 05/20/2011: Thank you all for your honest feedback on this issue. I have always understood that software written at work by an employee as belonging to the employer. I was stunned when I read scenario described by Joel, and thought I would ask your opinions. It's nice to know that I have always held the same beliefs as you... the code belongs to the employer.
