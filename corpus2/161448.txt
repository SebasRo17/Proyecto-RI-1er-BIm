I'm looking to steer my career of Computer Scientist a little more into robotics. I've been analyzing and junior embedded positions might be a good opportunity to start. However, searching through I've seen other similar titles. My questions are:   1. Is Embedded Engineer and Firmware Engineer pretty much the same role? Please give quick examples of each if not.    2. Which other titles/positions would allow me to get started on Robotics as a developer? I could be more specific if I had the knowledge, but for now I want to get closer to the field so anything as a developer would help greatly.
