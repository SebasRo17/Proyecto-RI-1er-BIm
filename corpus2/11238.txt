The `PolyhedronData[]` structure is wonderfully rich. I would like to create data for my own polyhedra, not any of the many that Mathematica provides. Is this possible? I wouldn't need every property, but I would like it to function the same way, e.g., `PolyhedronData["MyPolyhedron", "VertexCoordinates"]` would return a list of vertex coordinates, etc. I can hack up `MyPolyhedronData[]`, but I would prefer to use `PolyhedronData[]` if possible. Thanks for ideas!
