I have an image with a few bright pixels with the remaining ones very dark. The difference is in orders of magnitude. I want to binarize this matrix (corresponding to the image) making all values zero besides the few bright ones. The function Binarize does what I want but it accepts only an image as an input. So indeed I can use the plot of the matrix as input but that messes up things because the image includes the axis, labels etc... How can I do this? Any help will be appreciated.
