I am trying to solve the BVP problem: $ u''-u'=-6u^5+(8+4a)u^3-(2+4a)u, u(0.001)=1, u(10)=-1, u'(0.001)=-0.001$               eps=0;     phi6inst = Map[First[      NDSolve[{u''[x] -           u'[x]/x == -6 u[x]^5 + (8 + 4 eps) u[x]^3 - (2 + 4 eps) u[x],         u[0.001] == 1, u[10] == -1}, u, x,        Method -> {"Shooting",          "StartingInitialConditions" -> {u[0.001] == 0,            u'[0.001] == -0.001}}]], {0}];     Plot[Evaluate[x[t] /. phi6inst], {t, 0, 10}]      Yet there is no solution found to this problem...               NDSolve::berr: "There are significant errors {0.,5.91741*10^-7} in the boundary value residuals. Returning the best solution found. "      I do not know where to start...
