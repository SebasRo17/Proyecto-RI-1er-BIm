It is not surprising that `DeleteDuplicates[{5,5.}]` returns `{5,5.}` because `DeleteDuplicates` uses `SameQ` by default, and `SameQ[5,5.]` is `False`. However, `Equal[5,5.]` is `True`, but `DeleteDuplicates[{5,5.},Equal]` still returns `{5,5.}`. It is interesting to note that `Union` works properly, in that `Union[{5,5.},SameTest->Equal]` returns `{5}`, as expected. Is this a bug, or am I missing something? I'm using version 9. **Update:** I realize that using the function `#1==#2&` will get it working, thanks for pointing this out. However, my question really is "Is this a bug, or am I missing something?". To illustrate this further, consider the following:               f[x__]:=Equal[x]     DeleteDuplicates[{5,5.},f]     (* {5} *)      In what capacity are `f` and `Equal` different? Or what is leading `DeleteDuplicates` to treat them differently? They both take an arbitrary number of inputs, which is what I originally thought was the problem.
