I'm not sure if i should ask this question here, or on SO ... i'll cross post it to SO if this is the wrong place. My group at work has been trying to come up with a good process that we can use with TFS. I'm just wondering if some of you guys had some successful strategies with using TFS across multiple sites using multiple branches. One specific issue that we have is probably our release engine. On the simple side, a developer should be able to check in his/her changes into the DEV Branch, and then ok certain date (say a freeze date) the DEV Branch will be "reverse integrated" into the Main Trunk (QA) in which then the changes will be pushed to the Production branch. The issue arose when a user check into the DEV Branch, but he doesn't want those changes to be moved into QA (because maybe other portion of the code is not done yet) ... any thoughts on that? thanks in advanced
