I want to know the formula for the general term of the following recurrence system. I guess it can be written with `Floor` or `Mod`. How can I find it?               RSolve[{a[n + 5] == a[n] + 6, a[1] == 1, a[2] == 3, a[3] == 2, a[4] == 1, a[5] == 1}, a[n], n]          DiscretePlot[-2 + (6 n)/5 +        2/5 Sqrt[28 + 53/Sqrt[5]]         Sin[(2 n \[Pi])/5 - ArcTan[15/Sqrt[85 + 38 Sqrt[5]]]] +        2/5 Sqrt[28 - 53/Sqrt[5]]         Sin[(4 n \[Pi])/5 - ArcTan[3 Sqrt[5 (85 + 38 Sqrt[5])]]], {n, 1,        20}]      **Updated** I would like to have the formula for the general term without using recursion just as               RecurrenceTable[{y[n + 5] == y[n] + 1,        Sequence @@ Table[y[i] == i, {i, 5}]}, y, {n, 1, 30}]      can be written               n - 4 Floor[(n - 1)/5] /. n -> Range@30
