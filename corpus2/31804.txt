Is there a simple way to copy mathematical expressions between _Mathematica_ and _Maple_ (or at least in one direction)? I mean only expressions built from numbers and predefined mathematical functions, whithout any patterns or programmatical constructs like `Function`, `Map` or `Nest`. Ideally, I want functions with different definitions to be automatically adjusted, for example the _Mathematica_ expression `EllipticF[Pi/6, 1/4]` should be converted to the _Maple_ expression `EllipticF(1/2, 1/2)`.
