I am having some trouble to understand how the `RootLocusPlot` works (options, drawing and etc.) Here is an example               RootLocusPlot[      TransferFunctionModel[-((k(s-5/2)(s-2)))/((s-4)(s-1)),s], {k, 0, 10},      PlotRange-> {{-10, 15}, {-5, 5}}, AxesOrigin->{0, 0}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wmrno.png) I have no problem to draw the RL by hand despite the negative gain (note that there is a problem with $k=1$ when closing the loop). When I use _Mathematica_ to do the same thing, the output does not seem right even when I increase/decrease the range of `k`, the number of `PlotPoints`, the scale and etc. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
