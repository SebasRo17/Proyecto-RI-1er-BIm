I am trying to write a web application that interacts with a service that would run scripts at the system level. Something like a website that you can schedule a job, the service will run the job with the given inputs, write the outputs to a database, and inform the website of its status. A few questions: How is this typically done? Do I write to a "JOBS_QUEUED" table in my database and have the service check that? How can I pass a "% done" back to the web page? Is there a name for this type of thing? Not sure if it matters, but I am working with Ruby on Rails right now.
