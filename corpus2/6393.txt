Try the following:               z = Exp[2 \[Pi] I / 5]          Z = { { z, 1 }, { 0, 1/z } }          Simplify[MatrixPower[Z, 5]] //MatrixForm      Of course, this should return a 2 x 2 identity matrix. Instead, we get:               {{1, 1 - (-1)^(1/5) + (-1)^(2/5) - (-1)^(3/5) + (-1)^(4/5)}, {0, 1}}      That is, _Mathematica_ doesn't seem to understand that summing these roots of unity gives zero. Is there some way to make it realize this?
