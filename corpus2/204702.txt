After learning the basics of computing simple die throwing games and calendar applications, I want to explore simple graphics - drawing and moving around geometric objects is ok to start with, eventually adding pixel graphic of course. I've taken an introductory Java course but would rather do it in C++, Python or a combination of them (that's what we will eventually be using in school). I also want to learn the principles behind it, not just blindly applying incomprehensible syntax to make the compiler happy. Some posts seem to imply SFML is a solid choice, so I thought I'd get a book covering it and work through it, but there only seems to be ONE book on SFML available, and that one hasn't been reviewed at all. Not in the mood for a $30 gamble, so I'm feeling kind of lost! How should I approach learning basic graphics programming?
