I've used some older languages before C# and I always felt the need to comment what I was doing so it is clear for anyone who reads the code. But now that I use C# decently, I often feel that it's a pain to write most of the comments because I feel like I state the obvious. So unless I do complicated formulas or algorithms, I'm not sure how I should comment. Microsoft has reached such a readability in C#, I'm mesmerized. Do you have the same feeling? How do you write your comments so they are not pure redonduncy? Have you changed your commenting habbits / best practice?
