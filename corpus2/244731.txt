Please allow me to use this example/metaphor to describe an algorithm I need. **Objects**   * There are 5 thousand pennies.    * There are 50 cups.   * There is a tracking history (Passport "stamp" etc) that is associated with each penny as it moves between cups. **Definition** I'll define a "highly diffused" penny as one that passes through many cups. A "poorly diffused" penny is one that either passes back and forth between 2 cups **Question** How can I objectively measure the diffusion of a penny as:   1. The number of moves the penny has gone through   2. The number of cups the penny has been in   3. A unit of time (day, week, month) Why am I doing this? I want to detect if a cup is hoarding pennies. **Resistance from bad actors** Since hoarding is bad, the "bad cup" may simply solicit a partner and simply move pennies between each other. This will reduce the amount of time a coin isn't in transit, and would skew hoarding detection. A solution might be to detect if a cup (or set of cups) are common "partners" with each other, though I'm not sure how to think though this problem. **Broad applicability** Any assistance would be helpful, since I would think that this algorithm is common to   * Economics   * The study of migration patterns of animals, citizens of a country   * Other natural occurring phenomena  ... and probably exists as a term or concept I'm unfamiliar with.
