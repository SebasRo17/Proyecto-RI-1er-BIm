I have a (hopefully small) problem with some numerical integration algorithm, more specifically I want to integrate the imaginary part of a complex valued function, e.g. `f[u_]:=Exp[-iuK]` with $K\in\mathbb{R}$. As mentioned I am only interested in `Im[f]`, in the example `-Sin[u K]`. Now if I integrate with Mathematica               NIntegrate[f, {s, Min[roots[[ 1 ]], roots[[ 2 ]]],                     Max[roots[[ 1 ]], roots[[ 2 ]]]}, AccuracyGoal->aGoal,                      PrecisionGoal->pGoal, WorkingPrecision->wPrecision ];      I get two different results depending on `f`:   1. if I use `-Sin[u K]`, it returns `somenumber`   2. if I use `Im[f]`, it returns a list `{ somenumber }` Those two have to be treated differently and that crashes my program. I have a few questions: Why does Mathematica sometimes return lists, and sometimes values? How can I distinguish between a list and a value, i.e.               If xyz is a list then        do something      else        do something else     end      Any other ideas how one could avoid these different return "types"? The manual and anything I found hasn't been useful so far.
