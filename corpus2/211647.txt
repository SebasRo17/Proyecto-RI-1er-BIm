Using C# and WPF I have a situation where my data is organized hierarchically. I am using a treeview to represent this :   * Group_01      * Object_01        * Material_01          * Texture       * Material_02          * Texture_02   * Group_02      * Object_02        * Material_03          * Texture_03 I would like to be able to switch the order of the hierarchy, for example be able to create the data starting from the Materials and know all the objects that use that particular material   * Material_02      * Object_01        * Group_01     * Object_02        * Group_02 What is it the recommended data structure to organize the data? And how I could switch easily between any of these visualizations?
