I am trying to implement Scrum and have some basic questions. I understand creating stories to implement end user functionality, but where does a "meta- task" like collecting requirements for the stories in the first place come from? Is this even before the story process begins? I guess I am struggling with the fact that a project starts up at some point, and then tasks like "get requirements" and "create user stories" are needed, but those are also part of the project and need to be captured somewhere. Do they fit into Scrum stories? Are they part of a sprint? It seems like they should be, but creating stories for them seems recursive...I hope that makes sense. Thanks!
