Suppose I have an extremely tedious equation to differentiate and want mathematica to help do the differentiation and solve. Consider a less tedious equation: $$y (x,z) = sin \left(\frac{1}{x} \right) - \frac{1}{x} - z $$ Can mathematica find $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} $ at $x=0.3$ by performing implicit differentiation on both sides and solving for $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} $? Now suppose we try implicit differentiation: $$ sin (y) + y = sin \left(\frac{1}{x} \right) + xz$$ I want to find $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} $ at $x=0.3$, $y=0.4$ and $z=0.5$ It should give a value of $5.94$. Tried this, but didn't work:               sin [y] + y == sin [1/x] + x z     D[y[x_, y_, z_], x] /. {x -> 0.3,  y -> 0.2, z -> 0.5}
