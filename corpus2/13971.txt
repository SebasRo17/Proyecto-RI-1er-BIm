I am having some trouble with this function               Subscript[f, \[Pi]] = {0.0924, 0.00025};     Pade[x_, n_, m_] :=Sum[Subscript[a, i]*(x)^i, {i, 0, n}]/(     1 + Sum[Subscript[a, i]*(x)^(i - n), {i, n + 1, n + m}]) /.      Subscript[a, n + m] -> Subscript[a, n]/(2 Subscript[f, \[Pi]][[1]])      Then, this function works ok but all x values but 0, which gives back               In[226]:= Pade[0, 0, 1]     During evaluation of In[226]:= Power::indet: Indeterminate expression 0^0  encountered. >>     Out[226]= Indeterminate      However it works ok if I do               In[228]:= Pade[x, 0, 1] /. x -> 0     Out[228]= Subscript[a, 0]      Any idea why is this? Indeed the kind of indetermination, 0^0 it's freaking me out, theres no such a power law in my function definition, so I don't have a clue of why is this happening ...
