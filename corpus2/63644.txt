I work in a small software development company. I just received a NDA and IP contract to sign, but it doesn't have an expiry date.   1. Does this mean that it's a lifetime agreement with the corporation?   2. Lacking an explicit expiry date, is there an implicit date at which the contract expires?   3. If/when I leave the company, does the agreement still stand? If so, how long?
