I see more than a few developers soliciting 5-star ratings and good reviews for their App store apps, in their blogs, websites, app store descriptions, even dialogs that pop-up in the app after you've used them for awhile. What do people consider to be the ethical guidelines regarding such review and ratings solicitations? What's over the line? (Besides obviously evil stuff, such as paying to have someone forge multiple negative reviews about your competitor's apps, etc.)
