In one of my server application I have a class that look like,               class A     {        static int _value = 0;        void DoSomething()        {              // a request start here               _value = 0;              _value++;              // a request end here        }        // This method can be called many time during request        void SomeAsyncMethods()        {              _value++;        }     }      The problem is SomeAsyncMethods is async. Can be called many times. What I need when a request start set _value = 0 and then asynchrosnously increment this. After end of request I need the total. But the problem is that another request at the same time can access the class.
