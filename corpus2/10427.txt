I like Mathematica, but it's syntax baffles me. I am trying to figure out how to minimize the whitespace around a graphic. For example,               ParametricPlot3D[{r Cos[t], r Sin[t], r^2}, {r, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]},       Boxed -> True, Axes -> False]      ![3d bounding box on](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jGpvA.png) Puts the 3d bounding box at the limits of the view. But if I don't show the 3d bounding box, ![3d bounding box on](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jGpvA.png)               ParametricPlot3D[{r Cos[t], r Sin[t], r^2}, {r, 0, 1}, {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]},       Boxed -> False, Axes -> False]      ![3d bounding box off](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E8skr.png) there is all this white space around the actual object. Is there some way (syntax) that can put the view just around the visible objects? # Edit in response to answers Ok, from the below answers, I have two solutions; 1) use ImageCrop, or 2) use `Method->{"ShrinkWrap" -> True}`. However both of these options do a little something strange to the plot I want (maybe it is just a problem with the plot itself). So the actual plot I am after is,               Module[{r = 1, \[Theta] = \[Pi]/2, \[CurlyPhi] = \[Pi]/6, \[Psi] = \[Pi]/12},     Framed@Show[      Graphics3D[       {        {Arrowheads[.025],         Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {1.1, 0, 0}}], Text["x", {1.2, 0, 0}],         Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 1.1, 0}}], Text["y", {0, 1.2, 0}],         Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1.1}}], Text["z", {0, 0, 1.2}],         Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, r {Cos[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]],            Sin[\[Theta]] Sin[\[CurlyPhi]], Cos[\[CurlyPhi]]}}]},        {Specularity[White, 50], Opacity[.1], Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, r]}        },       Boxed -> False,       ImageSize -> 600,       PlotRange -> 1.1 {{-r, r}, {-r, r}, {0, r}}       ]]      ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/emm3z.png) Which has too much whitespace. If I replace `Framed@Show[` with `Framed@ImageCrop@Show[` I get, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUCNY.png) which actually crops some of the (hemi)sphere. If just use `Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True},` in the `Show` options, I get, ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WhX2Y.png) which looks almost correct, but the `x` and `z` textboxes have now not included. Seems like I can't win!
