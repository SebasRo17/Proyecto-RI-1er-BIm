When I do the double sum using the sigma notation I get $$1 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k = n}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(k+2)k!}$$ $1 + e - \cosh[1]$ When I do the sums as below, I get the expected answer.               1 + Sum[Sum[1/((k + 2) k!), {k, n, Infinity}], {n, 0, Infinity}]        $e$ Why the difference? **Edit** for those who might like to see the only identity I could find:               Defer[1 + Sum[Sum[1/((k + 1)! + k!), {k, n, Infinity}], {n, 0, Infinity}]]
