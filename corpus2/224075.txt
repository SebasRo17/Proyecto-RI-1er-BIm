Sellers on large sites like Amazon and Newegg need to provide names, descriptions, and images for their products to be displayed on the e-commerce sites. These sellers could have 10000+ products to sell, each with their own unique name/descriptions/images. I can't imagine that e-commerce sites would have their sellers upload each product individually through some standard HTML form. Especially when a product can have multiple images, this method of uploading just seems too inefficient. I'm guessing these sites allow sellers to upload via an API that the e-commerce site provides so that the uploading task may be automated with a script, but how exactly is this accomplished? Through JSON? JSON works great with text strings, but JSON doesn't allow for file uploads (so images can't be uploaded?).
