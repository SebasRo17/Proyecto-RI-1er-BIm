Consider the following data:               data1={73.9377, 54.4122, 53.0826, 24.1936};     data2={76.828, 49.1673, 45.7883, 18.9015};      I defined my own BarChart as follows:               MyBarCharts[list_]:=       BarChart[        list,        Frame -> {{True, None}, {True, None}}      ]      When applying MyBarCharts to `data1` and `data2` I get (not really surprising) two different (with regard to the coordinate system) plots. Now I would like to have for both plots the exact same coordinate system. I know that with `Histogram` it works as follows:               Histogram[     data2,     PlotRange -> Part[PlotRange /. Options[Histogram[                                            data1,                                            PlotRange -> Automatic                                            ],PlotRange], 2],     Frame -> {{True, None}, {True, None}}]      But the implementation of that approach in MyBarChart does not give the desired result. Has anyone an idea?
