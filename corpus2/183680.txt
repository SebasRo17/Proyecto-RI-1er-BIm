**Context** I'm currently working on a personal project involving functional reactive JavaScript, and I've come up with an odd question. Note that this question is not JavaScript specific, but that is the context in which I am asking it. **Scenario** When filtering a collection of data, you end up with a smaller set of data. Therefore, correctly filtering your data earlier (rather than later) ends up optimizing your later code, as it does not need to iterate through the portion of data which will not be used. (think filtering before mapping, instead of visa-versa) However, I was wondering if there's a scenario in which sorting provides similar benefits, or if sorting is generally used as a way of formatting data to be displayed, so that an end user may more easily absorb it (sort by name, city, state, etc). **Question** When is sorting your _data_ more desirable than sorting the corresponding _views_ of that data?
