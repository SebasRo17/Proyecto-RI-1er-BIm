At my current job (been here for 6 years). The VP of the company has decided he wants to make me the lead developer. I believe this is being done because my current boss who is a BA was pin holed into that position, its not something he wants to be doing. I asked him what the responsibilities are and he mentioned I will be dealing with bugs, coming up with estimates and also still involved in coding. Right now its myself another senior developer and a junior. The junior and the senior doesn't know nearly as much as I do about the company specific components and business rules. I can't see myself doing both, to be honest it sounds like two separate jobs. Bugs take time to research and figure out the validity, etc. Writing emails back and forth to the project managers. And I still need to be responsible for coding?? My question is do lead developers usually manage tasks/people AND also code?
