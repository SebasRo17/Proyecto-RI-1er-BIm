I have this set of three data points and want the natural cubic spline functions for them:                 dat = {{-.0247500, .5}, {.3349375, -.25}, {1.101000, 0}};      I tried:                 f = SplineFit[dat, Cubic]      Using another approach and code, I get the two cubic functions (I am trying to verify the correctness) as:               -0.481347 + 0.753113 x - 0.0338047 x^2 - 0.455282 x^3          -0.506486 + 0.978281 x - 0.706073 x^2 + 0.213767 x^3      Is there anyway to see these results and the intermediate results to derive the two cubics using Mathematica (I tried looking at documentation and could not make sense of it)?
