I am looking for a conference or training which will give me a broad exposure to enterprise level software architecture. I've been with the same company for 10 years and we've grown to the size where we really need to lay out a framework for the applications which support our company's business. The organic growth over the last 10 years has left us with a tightly coupled and fairly messy set of applications. We need to do a better job at componentizing our business entities and have more rigorous control on the interfaces between those entities and our business processes. I'm looking to get a broad, yet practical exposure on design patterns to support that architecture (SOA, messaging, ESB's etc). I'm hoping to gain insight from folks who have direct experience with implementing or working with what would be considered an enterprise class architecture.
