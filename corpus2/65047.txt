I was having a small talk between teammates about how you choose a programming language for use in a project which lead me to think that there are many criteria to choose one in the beginning of a project but no real standard. Do you chose a programming language for the syntax and semantics? Or do you choose one because it has the best support to do certain things? Or because you have better libraries? Or do you choose it for the paradigm? What criteria do you use to choose one language when you are going to do a project?
