Eventually you need to depreciate parts of your public web API. However I'm confused on what would be the best way to do it. If you have a large 3rd party app base just yanking old versions of the API seems like the wrong way to do it as almost all apps would fail overnight. However you can't keep ancient web api's available forever as it might be outdated or there are significant changes that make working with it impossible. What are some best practices for deprecating old web api's?
