I have no idea what is happening here. I'm using Mathematica 10. I mistyped "FriendNetwork" as "FriendsNetwork" and got a weird result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GDRMp.png) The option "FriendsNetwork" is not even listed in the help entry for the SocialMedia function. How is that even possible? I rerun the query multiple times and it gave the same result. I checked my facebook feed and I don't see that image anywhere and I don't know of a friend who would have such a photo. Can someone try this themselves and check the result?
