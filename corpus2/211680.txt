My previous question is here - A question about storing passwords This question is somewhat related to my previous one but with some new doubts. Take for example Windows. I've heard that Windows stores passwords in NTLM hashes somewhere inside the registry (if I'm not wrong). There are programs that crack the NTLM hashes to recover the passwords (brute-force method) in- case you've forgotten them or just want to hack someone's PC. Why don't they just replace the NTLM hashes in the registry with something common like - NTLM hash of 'password'? This was just an example for your understanding. I'm trying to learn, how large programs store, change or verify passwords without any hacker/attacker being able to read them?
