I'm doing some android development in a relatively inexperienced group, and all of the data used by our application is managed in a database. There are several instances where we'll need to pull info from the database using the identifying information/PK of the user who is currently logged in. Because the only info from the user that is important is the PK (IE we don't need an entire class to represent the types of users or any associated data), and because this ID is important throughout the scope of the application and will not change once it is defined, we considered storing the ID/PK of the user in a global on successful login. Is the use of a global variable in a circumstance like this bad practice? Is there a better way to handle it?
