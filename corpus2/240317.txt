Let say you are building an app and you are using the latest library verion from a third party (say `ver2.jar`). Then you saw an example written 2 years ago, but that example uses the `ver1.jar` Now in `ver1.jar`, there is `web.method1()`, but in `ver2.jar` there is no such method. Instead, in `ver2.jar` you have `web.getOtherMethod.method1();` You ran your app with `ver2.jar` and found a lot of missing classes, and lots of errors. So what are you going to do to solve the incompatibility? I think the version problem is really a nightmare because it is unstructured and you do not actually understand what is going on. Also, why changed the location of the method in `ver2.jar` so differently like that?
