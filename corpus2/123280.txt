When I picture a really well functioning software team in my mind, one of the visions I have is of a developer showing off to a small group of devs some cool, clever UI that they just came up with based on something that they were just playing with. I'm afraid that while we're doing great at being creative writing expressive, well architected, high quality code - we aren't pushing any creative boundaries when it comes to effective user interface. What's an effective strategy for encouraging developers to push their boundaries with user interface? Edit: I'm looking for something "lab oriented", like for instance pair programming sessions focused on some problem or other.
