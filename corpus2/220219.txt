I have the following class with the following function (some implementation details have been skipped):               public class TitleScreen : GameScreen     {          public Texture2D titleScreen;              public override void Draw (GameTime gameTime)         {             ScreenManager.SpriteBatch.Draw (titleScreen, new Rectangle (0, 0, ScreenManager.Game.Window.ClientBounds.Width, ScreenManager.Game.Window.ClientBounds.Height), Color.White);         }     }      This class is associated with a class "ScreenManager", which is associated with a Game, which is associated with a Window. As you can see, I navigate through several classes in order to obtain the bounds of the Window so I can draw it. My question is: Is that a bad practice? Am I coupling the TitleScreen class with Game and Window? It would be better to implement a function in ScreenManager to return the Width and Height of the window?
