> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to prepare yourself for programming interview questions? I am going for c#-sql server job and I was looking for some link where I could download some questions and answers to have look at.Googling I have found many but because there is no download you have to click and navigate for each question and answer which makes the process very intense. Do you know a link where I can download some good c#/sql server questions? Also I am told I will be given a programming task. I have no idea what that might be. I hope is not some silly math algorithm that I know I will fail or some bubble sort stuff that I have never used in my c# programming life. Any ideas or examples people have been asked? Or is there a place where managers go to get this stuff? It's not a case of cheating but I find some questions not really pratical in the real world. typical silly question for a c# in my view is What's the difference between a stack vs heap? Now tell me whether as a c# programmer you are really bothered about the stack and heap. If you do some unboxing the compiler will tell you have an error.etc.. Why they keep asking that question.Even the agency the other day asked me that question. thanks a lot for any suggestions
