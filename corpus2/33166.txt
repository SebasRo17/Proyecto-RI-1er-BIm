I am trying to calculate speed of viscous fluid in a rotating hollow sphere. The sphere is rotating round z axis. The fluid is incompressible. I used Navier-Stockes equations. The only boundry condition I have, is rotational speed of sphere. My code:               v = {vr[r, ϑ, ϕ], vt[r, ϑ, ϕ], vf[r, ϑ, ϕ]}          eq =  Curl[Cross[v, Curl[v, {r, ϑ, ϕ}, "Spherical"]], {r, ϑ, ϕ}, "Spherical"] +            Curl[Laplacian[v, {r, ϑ, ϕ}, "Spherical"], {r, ϑ, ϕ}, "Spherical"]          NDSolve[{eq[[1]] == 0, eq[[2]] == 0, eq[[3]] == 0, vf[1, ϑ, ϕ] == Sin[ϑ],      vr[1, ϑ, ϕ] == 0, vt[1, ϑ, ϕ] == 0}, {vr, vt, vf}, {r, 0, 1}, {ϑ, 0, Pi}, {ϕ, 0, 2*Pi}]      Mathematica displays an error: > NDSolve::ivone: Boundary values may only be specified for one independent > variable. Initial values may only be specified at one value of the other > independent variable. >> I have no idea what is wrong, so if anyone can help me, I'll be very happy. Thanks.
