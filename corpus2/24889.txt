Having been hired as a developer (5-6 years experience), I suggested to my employer that I also take a formal responsibility for our work with automated testing. Basically I find it interesting and stimulating to work in TDD-like ways, and want to drive this culture in the company I work in. **But, what would you call this type of job position?** I would like to specialize more in automated testing and TDD, and improve my chances of getting really interesting such jobs in the long term. So what would be a good title for this? My fear is that I would eventually come off as a QA testing engineer, which I would say is misleading since I work mainly as a developer. Suggestions: Software Engineer in Testing?   Testing Architect and Developer?   Automated Tests Developer? Anything better?
