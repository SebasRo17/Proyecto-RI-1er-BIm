Peter Weinberger in an interiview mentioned a language called Poplar > What’s interesting is that at the same time that we were doing AWK, there > was a project at Xerox PARC called Poplar … maybe called Poplar. Anyway, > whatever it was called, there was this project at Xerox PARC, which had > fairly similar goals. That is they were going to take these files consisting > of a lot of characters and you break them apart in various ways and you > process them using some language and you pass them on. And they put a lot of > work into clever ideas. It was a functional programming language. ... And it > was supposed to be user friendly and in addition you wrote the program sort > of here and then you worked an example on the other side of the page and the > compiler checked that the program worked the example the same way you had. > So that you had some feeling for what the program was doing Is there more information about this language? Or it's just the Parc's internal project that never left their laboratories?
