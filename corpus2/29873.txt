I have coded a model that contains several parameters. The parameters can be changed interactively by the user using an interface contained in a DynamicModule[]. There are several "basic states" of the model, i.e. several sets of parameters that can be chosen as default. The user can pick the defaults by pressing appropriate buttons in the interface. For example:               DynamicModule[{a,b,defaultParameters,userParam},       defaultParameters = {Hold[a=1;b=1;],                            Hold[a=2;b=2,]}            Button["Default 1",ReleaseHold[defaultParameters[[1]]]]       Button["Default 2",ReleaseHold[defaultParameters[[2]]]]     ]      At several places in the code, I take advantage of the set of parameters being "saved" in the variable `defaultParameters`, as it is quite convenient to set all parameters in a single statement: `ReleaseHold[defaultParameters[[n]]]`. In reality, there are many more parameters than just `a` and `b`. Now to my question: When the user is changing the model interactively, I want him to able to save the current state of the model as another default set. However, I do not know the correct combination of `Hold`, `Evaluate`, etc to make it work. I want something like               Button["save parameters",userParam = Hold[a=Evaluate[a];b=Evaluate[b];]]      but this doesn't do the trick. In the end, I wish to be able to call the parameters with `ReleaseHold[userParam]`.
