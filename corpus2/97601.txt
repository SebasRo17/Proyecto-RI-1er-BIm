I'm a totally blind programmer who would like to learn .net. It appears that the Visual Studio express additions are not accessible since the scripts that come with Jaws for Widnows, the screen reading software I use requires the VS object model to make Visual Studio accessible. This is not available in the express additions, so the scripts may partially work or not work at all. None of the options mentioned in this question apply to me and I don't want to spend $500 or more to buy Visual Studio professional when I may never use it for a job. If I take the time to try out the express versions and run into issues is there any way to contact Microsoft without my questions/feedback being lost in a black hole?
