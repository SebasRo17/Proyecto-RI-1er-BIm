I know Javascript for some time, although I am not a heavy user, I know it the first from the time when Netscape was my browser. I pretty much understand the main things, but since JavaScript approach to OOP is prototypical I have some problem grasping it. One problem to add to this it seems that things can be done in more than one way, and here is where books don't help much because they put all the examples on the table making it hard to keep the pace. What I need for start is only one way of doing it, if someone can help me with the simplest code possible an example where I can see how the prototypal OOP model works? To be helpful the code should have an inherited object, to access a parent's property and its inherited properties and a parent's function, to overwrite a parent's function and and have an instance of a multiple inheritance where an object inherits two other objects.
