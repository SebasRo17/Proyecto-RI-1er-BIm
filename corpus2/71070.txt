I am preparing a presentation about Python for my company, and would like to show Python's awesomeness to developers using Java or Ruby ! I guess it will be very simple to write shorter and cleaner looking stuff than in Java, however I've never coded in Ruby (well only a few stuff with rails, but I don't know the language) ! **PLEASE NOTE** : This topic **IS NOT** about which language is the best. I just want to convince people that don't know Python at all, or even -for some- think that it is weird, that it is worthy of interest as well (as much as Ruby, Java, etc... are). And for this, I need input from people that know Ruby (or Java) and Python ... I'm looking for an easy to understand code snippet or application that would shows where Python shines. I was thinking of a couple of list comprehensions, because I think it is really great. Some operator overriding, because that looks dead simple in Python, maybe some metaclass programming, and/or why not a doctest/sphinx example ... Any other/better suggestions ? PS : the people are backend web developers
