One of my friends has just completed his college degree and is ready to join the programmers' world. Today he has two offers, one with new projects every time, and another with software maintenance. The remaining factors are not important to him, what he wants to know is which option is better? My experience goes with second option because my first job was the maintenance one and **I could learn how my fellow programmers made mistakes while coding** . But I soon switched to a new job which required me to create new project every time. I enjoyed both but I must admit that my first job has given me a more advantage today. But it's not necessary that my experience can give benefit to him. But I want to know what is general approach? If I have to give him final verdict on these two, what should I tell him? _**Edit_** Everybody deserves one up vote here, I am really learning a lot from you guys.
