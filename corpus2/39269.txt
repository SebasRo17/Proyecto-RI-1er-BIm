I have a set that looks like:               s = {{1, 2, 3} -> 9, {4, 1, 9} -> 9, {3, 7, 3} -> 1};      Now, I want to replace each element of the set by the lhs of "`->`". The result should look like this:               s = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 1, 9}, {3, 7, 3}};      ## The problem: I only want to **modify** the list `s` **without creating a new list**. This is why `Replace[]` and `Map[]` cannot be used in this scenario. Thank you in advance!
