I want all the lines in my plot to be a consistent style, let's say thick and black for the purpose of this question.               ContourPlot[y - x^2, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1},      ContourStyle -> Directive[Thick, Black, Opacity[1]],       FrameStyle -> Directive[Thick, Black],      PlotLegends -> BarLegend[Automatic]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h0YqV.png) However, the border of the legend bar is thin and grey. How do I change its style to match? I couldn't find any relevant options in the `BarLegend` documentation.
