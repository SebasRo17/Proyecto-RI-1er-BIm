So this is my second ASP.NET MVC 4 project. It's decided that for this one we will use this template and it was said in a way that I felt really stupid for not knowing how exactly this template will help us and what exactly we gain by using it. I'm used to using HTML/CSS for the UI combined with jQuery. Now it seems that instead of jQuery we will be using bootstrap which as far as I understand is just another JS library created from twitter, so if that's it then this part is clear. What I really need to clarify for myself is what exactly this theme is used for, what is offering, why one would want to use such a theme? From what I see in the live demo maybe it's just a stack of premade controls that you can use in the front end along with bootstrap.js and maybe I'm just confused because on the page is shown as much as possible just for presentational purposes. If that's right, still I wonder where I can find info for the current theme, the controls that it offers and the functionality that I get and not least - how to use it. But still those are just my assumptions. What I really need is a clarification on what exactly is this theme for, what is the advantage using it, is there a good tutorials about how to use such themes in the context of ASP.NET MVC 3+. Also any additional info about this theme and generally on using themes in ASP.NET MVC will be much appreciated.
