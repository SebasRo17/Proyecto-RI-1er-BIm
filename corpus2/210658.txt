Working in a field called "revenue assurance" I basically build systems to validate other systems. After a while in this market it seems to me that all these "validations" are verifying either a process from my customer's environment or the data used by these processes. With this in mind I am considering using such definition to orientate sales people and even architects working on the products. However, researching this topic I couldn't find a definitive answer although haven't dismissed the possibility either. Is everything one of the two then?
