Using an app "Get My IMEI" I was able to retrieve an invalid IMEI for my bluestack emulator however I can't see how I can change it. The guys at XDA developers forum are talking about it, but it's an old post so I wanted to know if it is possible now? I am building an app that uses IMEI validation and bluestack is the device I use for development on Eclipse. It's way faster than the normal method and I don't need to keep track of the apk version installed or clean it like I would do if I used my physical device. If the device IMEI is already stored in the database I have no problem. The problem is when I have to register the device to the service (front-end) I need a valid IMEI. I know the IMEI can be spoofed like the mac address or the ip but it's just some extra security feature that is added. * * * _I asked the same questionat Stack Overflow but the guys didn't think it had anything to do with programming. So I added the context of what I am trying to do so at this point I don't even know if the question was rejected because I mentioned XDA._
