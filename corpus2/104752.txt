I am finalizing development of a desktop Java application that communicates with an outside web server, and now I need to start seriously considering deployment. This application will run on a large touchscreen all-in-one workstation running Windows 7. It will be located in a public-area and thus must be LOCKED-DOWN Hanibal Lecter style. Early in the project nobody really concerned themselves with this fact just assuming that we can buy some magical software for Windows 7 that will automatically take care of all this, however I am finding now that this looks to be a LOT more complicated than my manager ever thought. I need to: \- Lock down the standard hot-keys (ALT+TAB, ALT+CTRL+DEL, etc...)   * Prevent the user from opening ANY programs other than the kiosk application and its spawned executables   * Prevent the user from closing the application   * Start the kiosk application on startup (this can be done without kiosk software)   * Auto-login to Windows on reboot (Windows Updates, power failure, bratty kid pressing the power button, etc...)   * Administrator passcode escape sequence for routine maintenance by desktop support professionals. To my dismay I am having a really hard time finding software that contains the whole package and am finding numerous swaths of competing information on the best way to do this. I am not necessarily looking for free or open source software and am willing to pay for software that can help me achieve this. Have any of you ever wrote kiosk software before and if so what approaches have you taken to do this?
