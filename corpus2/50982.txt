Could I create a third slider that controls two other sliders? I would like to master slider to move slider `k` from min to max, at which point, the master slider should be half way across. Slider `j` should then "engage", and run from min to max, by which time, the master slider should be at max. I should also like to hide sliders `k` and `j`, so that only the master slider is visible. Is this possible?               r = 100; Manipulate[Plot[{If[k < E, Log[Log[x]/Log[k]], 0],     If[k == E,Log[Log[Log[x]/Log[j]]], 0], Log[x], Log[Log[x]], Log[Log[Log[x]]]},      {x, 1, r}, PlotRange -> {{0, r}, {0, Log[r]}}, PlotStyle -> {{Blue}, {Blue},      {Red, Dashing[0.005], Opacity[0.3]}, {Red, Dashing[0.005], Opacity[0.3]}, {Red,      Dashing[0.005], Opacity[0.3]}}], {k, x^(1/x), E}, {j, x^(1/x), E}]      # Update This is the closest I can get. Not perfect, but better ...               r = 100; j = x^(1/x); Manipulate[Plot[{If[k < E, Log[Log[k, x]],      Log[Log[Log[k - E + x^(1/x),x]]]], Log[x], Log[Log[x]], Log[Log[Log[x]]]}, {x, 1, r},       PlotRange -> {{0, r}, {0, Log[r]}}, PlotStyle -> {{Blue}, {Red, Dashing[0.005],      Opacity[0.3]}, {Red, Dashing[0.005], Opacity[0.3]},{Red,Dashing[0.005],      Opacity[0.3]}}], {k, x^(1/x), 2 E - 1}]      # Update 2 From Belisarius' great code below:               r1 = 1; r2 = 100; j = 3;      Manipulate[Plot[{NestList[Log, Log[x]/Log[(1 - Mod[s, 1]) x^(1/x) + Mod[s, 1] E],      Floor[s + 1]][[Floor[s + 1]]], NestList[Log, x, j]}, {x, r1, r2},     PlotRange -> {{r1, r2}, {0, Log[r2]}}, Axes -> False, Frame -> True], {s, 0, j}]      Title changed to make it more fitting to question. Apologies to Martin John Hadley and bill s for misleading original title: **Create master slider in manipulate & hide others** _this was my first thought on how to approach this problem_. Thank you for your excellent responses, though.
