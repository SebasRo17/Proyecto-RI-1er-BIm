I am preparing to start a 3rd year project using Java. The object is to create a P2P application where users can write text, draw and edit at the same time. The connection between them must be P2P. At this point I still don't know details about design etc. and I'm just doing some reading. I have made a simple network application before but that was clients/server. What should I look into in order to understand how to create a P2P network? Do I need to use JXTA or, for a small scale application, it's better to make my own protocol? PS. I posted the same question on Stack Overflow, but it was closed. Hope this is a better place for it. **Update** JXTA proved a bit too complicated for my needs. As a result I ended up using JGroups, which proved very simple to work as well as efficient enough for my needs.
