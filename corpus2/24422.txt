Here's an exercise from a calculus text by _Larson_ and _Edwards_ : > Find the rate of change of the distance between the origin and a moving > point on the graph of $y = x^2 + 1$ if $dx/dt = 2$ centimeters per second. Here's one way to solve it:               eq1 = d[t]^2 == x[t]^2 + y[t]^2;     eq2 = y[t] == x[t]^2 + 1;     {eq1, D[eq1, t], eq2, D[eq2, t], x'[t] == 2};     Reduce[%, {d'[t], d[t], y'[t], y[t]}]      Is there another way to solve it that might be considered more idiomatic?
