I've finished a first working, releasable version of a testing framework. Prior to release, I want to apply a proper license to it. Normally I'd choose something like GPLv3 but here I am pretty unsure. If I put the testing framework under GPLv3, does that mean users won't be able to test their commercial applications without also putting them under the GPL? Would a license like the MIT be a better fit? I've just had a look at several popular testing frameworks (JUnit, Jasmine) and none of them uses the GPL. **EDIT** Forgot to mention the project is open sourced.
