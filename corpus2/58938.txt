I'm a newbie in image processing using Mathematica. I'd like to compose an image $A$ over an image $B$ into an image _C_ such that $\quad C[i,j] = B[i,j]$, if $A[i,j]$ is white $\quad C[i,j] = A[i,j]$, otherwise It would work if I could do `Min` on each pixel: $\quad C[i,j] = \min(A[i,j],B[i,j])$ but `Min` does not seem to work component-wise. Perhaps I could turn white in $A$ into transparency and then compose over $B$. How can I do this?
