I type the following into _Mathematica_ :               DSolve[q''[x] + 2 x/(x^2 - 1) q'[x] - 4*q[x]/(x^2 - 1) == 0, q[x], x]      It gives me the result               q[x] -> C[1] LegendreP[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[17]), x] +        C[2] LegendreQ[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[17]), x]      Suppose I take `C[2]=0` and `C[1] =1`, and then I try the following command:               FullSimplify[      D[D[LegendreP[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[17]), x], x], x] +        2*x/(x^2 - 1)*D[LegendreP[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[17]), x], x] -        4*LegendreP[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[17]), x]/(x^2 - 1)]      This is evaluating the LHS of the diff eq at the solution, as provided by _Mathematica_ , and yet the result I get is NOT zero: I get               (1/(2 (-1 +         x^2)^2))((9 + Sqrt[17]) LegendreP[1/2 (-1 + Sqrt[17]),          x] - (19 + 3 Sqrt[17]) x LegendreP[1/2 (1 + Sqrt[17]), x] +        2 (5 + Sqrt[17]) LegendreP[1/2 (3 + Sqrt[17]), x])      I was wondering if someone knew how I could make it fully simplify the result to give me zero, as numerically evaluating it gives extremely small numbers.
