I don't know much about Tortoise SVN, but have been using it for a while. I understand that it is capable of managing concurrent users on same file, but how does it do that? I am working on a file that another user is using concurrently and he committed couple of times before me, Now my files doesn't have the changes he made. Every time i end up in such a situation I gets a conflict and I am stuck. So is there something else I should do instead of just `committing` and causing `conflict`? Is it safe to do a `update` first and then `commit` ? Will I lose my local changes in this case? Please don't beat me up if this is something basic, a link to some tutorial will be useful in that case :)
