When you work with ORM which implement UnitOfWork pattern (NHibernate's Session, Entity Framework's ObjectContext, etc.), there are two types of data services methods: those which save/commit changes and those which just modify model properties. In some time it becomes difficult to support this mess: when you call a method you are not sure, whether it will save changes or not (if it doesn't you need to do it in some of outer methods). How can I solve this problem? The only idea I have is a special naming. For example, AddCustomer for saving method and FillForAddCustomer for non-saving method. Any other ideas?
