I have a problem with the `DSolve` function and its usage:               solOC1 = DSolve[{y'[t] == (r - (1 - x[t]/X0)) y[t], x'[t] == -C*y[t], y[0] == Y0,                      x[0] == X0} /. {Y0 -> 1, r -> 1, X0 -> 1, C -> 1}, {y, x}, t]      The Professor of our Institute coded it some months ago and this was the result:               {{x -> Function[{t}, Sqrt[3] Sqrt[Tanh[1/2 (-Sqrt[3] t - 2 ArcTanh[1/Sqrt[3]])]^2]],        y -> Function[{t}, -(3/2) (-1 + Tanh[1/2 (-Sqrt[3] t - 2 ArcTanh[1/Sqrt[3]])]^2)]},       {x -> Function[{t}, Sqrt[3] Sqrt[Tanh[1/2 (-Sqrt[3] t + 2 ArcTanh[1/Sqrt[3]])]^2]],        y -> Function[{t}, -(3/2) (-1 + Tanh[1/2 (-Sqrt[3] t + 2 ArcTanh[1/Sqrt[3]])]^2)]}}      But when we run the script now we get a bvfail:               DSolve::bvfail: For some branches of the general solution, unable to solve the conditions.>>      I have no idea what is causing this. Any suggestions how to handle the problem ? Sebastian
