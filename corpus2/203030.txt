I've been using Python since version 2.2. I do pick up new language constructs like for example `with` statement or dictionary/set comprehensions. However, I've realized that even though I'm being consistent with PEP-8, for existing constructs I'm using old style, rather than new style (for example `except Exception, e` instead of `except Exception as e`). Is there a resource which would have either most current style guide, or even better a list of changes in Python's coding style?
