I often find myself embracing "now is better than never" when I'm advancing the DRYness of a design. Typically, I find that I need to cultivate an understanding of the One Authoritative Location for a piece of knowledge in the context of a system of other pieces of knowledge. Thus, I tend to design the system 'now.' Conversely, this practice causes me to build fairly far in advance, despite a reasonable chance that I ain't Gonna Need It. How do these two patterns square up? What practices do you use to ensure that they play nice? How do you teach them together without creating confusion?
