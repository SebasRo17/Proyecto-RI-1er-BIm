For instance, lets say we have an nginx config pointing at foo1, foo2, and foo3, as well as a haproxy config pointing at foo1, foo2, and foo3, and finally, a deployment tool pointing at the same respective servers. How does one reconcile this? Build some sort of configuration generator for nginx and haproxy based on the hosts? It seems as though this would make grepping difficult and potentially hinder readability of the configuration files in general.
