I have an android application with a custom content provider set up to load data asychonously. The database is a local file so I'm not sure if I needed to set up a content provider at all. Sometimes I just need to do something like get a name back from a short list by id. Is it ok to mix the content provider pattern with simple direct database calls, i.e open, query, close type of code blocks?
