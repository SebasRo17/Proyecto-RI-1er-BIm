I have seen other developers using static classes as namespaces               public static class CategoryA     {         public class Item1         {             public void DoSomething() { }         }         public class Item2         {             public void DoSomething() { }         }     }          public static class CategoryB     {         public class Item3         {             public void DoSomething() { }         }         public class Item4         {             public void DoSomething() { }         }     }      To instantiate the inner classes, it will look like the following               CategoryA.Item1 item = new CategoryA.Item1();      The rationale is that namespaces can be hidden by using the "using" keyword. But by using the static classes, the outer-layer class names have to be specified, which effectively preserves the namespaces. Microsoft advises against that in the guidelines. I personally think it impacts the readability. What are your thoughts?
