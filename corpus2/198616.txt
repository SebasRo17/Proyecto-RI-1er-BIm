I'm releasing an open-source jQuery plug-in that is free to use, modify and redistribute as long as you don't directly or indirectly charge your customers. Your software doesn't need to be open-source, it just need to be free. If you charge your customers, you need a commercial license. I'm not sure about the licensing. http://www.turnjs.com/ is a plug-in that is similarly licensed and it is `Non-comercial BSD license`. But I can't find the definition for this license online. Can anyone help me determining the best license for me based on my description? Thanks.
