Sorry if the title sounds a bit clumsy. The scenario I am trying to describe is during my academic years I have mostly coded in C/C++. Few small projects were done but no large scale work was done. From there on, after entering industry, I rarely code in C++ but whenever I do, I use its features as deep as my understanding. Now, should I even consider myself a C++ programmer and count every year since I first started coding as my number of years in C++.
