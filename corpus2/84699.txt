Preface: I work mostly in Python, and Web Dev languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery, PHP) I'm proficient at coding but I want to get better. In larger more advanced projects my programming skills break down. The more code there is the more trouble I have fitting all the pieces together. I understand syntax well, and I can catch and correct errors fairly easier. But the more advanced it gets the more I struggle. I believe I have a good understand of the basic and nuts and bolts of programming and I understand what's going on, but when it comes to larger projects, especially ones with heavy math involved my confidence flags and I start making mistakes. It's not that I can't do it, I'm just not used to doing it. Does anyone have any advice for someone who knows programming, but wants to get better? The only tutorials I can really find are beginner basic type stuff. Basically what I'm saying is I want to be confident when I'm tackling advanced projects, but I can't because I have little experience dealing with difficult situations.
