I have been unable to explain the behavior of `Graphics`Mesh`ConvexHull[]` on the following (highly simplified) example:               pts = {{-1/6, -1/18}, {-4/31, 1/9}, {-1/26, -12/73},            {1/6, 2/37}, {1/26, 12/73}, {4/31, -1/9}};          Graphics`Mesh`MeshInit[];          idx = ConvexHull[pts];          idx2 = Most[First[FindCurvePath[pts]]];          GraphicsRow[{Graphics[Line[pts]], Graphics[Line[pts[[idx]]]], Graphics[Line[pts[[idx2]]]]}]      I get the following result on my system (version 8.0.4 on Linux, if it matters): ![convex hull attempts on my points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LnKJm.png) As you can see, `ConvexHull[]` does not seem to work properly on my set of points, while `FindCurvePath[]` has no problem. However, I had wanted to use `ConvexHull[]` because it consistently orders points in an anticlockwise manner (or at the very least it seems to), while `FindCurvePath[]` sometimes orders points clockwise. I can break down and just implement the Graham scan myself, but I'd prefer to understand why the hidden convex hull routine is not behaving in the manner I expect.
