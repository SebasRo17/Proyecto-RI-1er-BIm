I'm starting to introduce mobile web apps to my company but my not-so-techie boss is worried about web security issues on mobile devices. I'm new in the mobile world but as a web developer I know the basics about web security (like the best practices listed in OWASP) but I don't know if there's anything else that could make my mobile web app vulnerable specifically for mobile web browsers. Also, I need an internet article readable from not-so-techie bosses that could help me convince him how secure our mobile web app could be if I apply the common web security best practices. Can you help me with this? PS. I'm using Java as my backend and jQuery Mobile as my frontend.
