I need your opinions and suggestions about storing documents in a DMS system. I think the DMS should save its own copies of the documents, not their original path on the disk. So, the DMS should have its own space to write on. But what about the way they're stored? Do they have their own extension different from the original one? What about the algorithm that stores them? What about the algorithm that retrieves them? What do you suggest??
