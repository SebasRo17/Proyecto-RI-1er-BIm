I want to log messages that I send to the screen, even temporary ones. By setting `$Output` appropriately, it is possible to log `Print` messages, but not `PrintTemporary` messages:               oldout = $Output;         logfile = FileNameJoin[{$TemporaryDirectory, "example.log"}];         log = OpenWrite[logfile];         $Output = Append[oldout, log];     Print["Log message printed on screen."];     PrintTemporary["Log message printed temporarily on screen."]; Pause[1];     $Output = oldout;     Close[log];     Print["Contents of file:"];     FilePrint[logfile];      gives > Log message printed on screen. > > (Log message printed temporarily on screen.) > > Contents of file: > > "Log message printed on screen." Perhaps this is not surprising, but if you start Mathematica in non-gui mode (i.e., "MathKernel" on MacOsX), the `PrintTemporary` output stays permanently on the screen. How can one direct the output of `PrintTemporary` permanently to an additional output stream?
