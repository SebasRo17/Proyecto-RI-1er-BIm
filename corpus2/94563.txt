I understand an "idiom" to be a common operation or pattern that in a particular language is not simplified by core language syntax, such as integer increment:               i = i + 1;      In C++, this idiom is simplified by an operator:               ++i;      However, when someone uses the term "idiomatic", I am not sure how to understand it. What makes a piece of code "idiomatic"?
