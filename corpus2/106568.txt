Our organization is considering integrating unit testing into our software development workflow. I've heard lots of anecdotal stories about how it encourages better, easy to maintain, and well-planned code. As a programmer, I understand the benefits. However, in order to build consensus around using unit testing in projects that might affect customers, I would like to demonstrate its value quantitatively, in terms of saving hours of developer time. Does anyone in the community have any historical data or experience they would be willing to share as quantitative evidence in my case for unit testing?
