So far, when I was working in Linux, I would open my _Mathematica_ files from the terminal by typing:               mathematica filename.nb &      But now, I got a mac, and when I try it says               -bash: mathematica: command not found      So, I have to open the _Mathematica_ files by going to Finder and double clicking the file in a Finder window, which is annoying! I tried to google it, and I expected that it would be easy to find info about it, but I did not find any. Can anybody help me?
