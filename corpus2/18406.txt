It has been six years since I have been coding. Coding into all kinds of things like ActionScript, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Ajax, XML HTML, ASP, etc. I have used arrays, maps, linked lists, sets, etc and wherever I worked people like me. But whenever I am interviewed it is very likely that people ask me question on hashes, trees, stacks, and queues. Some questions are on juggling some sorting algorithms. I don't know if I should really know them or should I stop calling myself a programmer. There is something in me which also tells me even if people who are asking all these questions select me, they will never be making me work of these things. Am I really required to know all this?
