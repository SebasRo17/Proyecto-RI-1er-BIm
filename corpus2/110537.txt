I have built a Ruby gem, which allows programmer (or whoever) to change wording on their Rails website. When the edit mode is activated, every text on the website will have an edit icon. User can click on that edit icon and change the corresponding text immediately. It works with text, attributes of any element, select element, and string in Javascript. Now I don't know how to describe it succinctly. Right now the description is "WhowishWord facilitates the process of changing wording of a website". I think the description is bad and vague. Maybe there is a regular keyword for this kind of task (changing wording) that I do not know. Could someone help me, please?
