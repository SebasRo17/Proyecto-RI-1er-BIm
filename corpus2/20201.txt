As a developer who spends most of my time in either Java or Javascript these days, I have this fantasy about a language that blends the two of them together. I'm always missing something from one or the other. I know neither is perfect, but to me, they both can be considered the mainstream, modern decendants of C. I know the popular opinion is that they are completely different languages with only superficial similarities (obviously the name, but also lots of syntactical similarities, especially at the statement and expression level). However, I think that in theory anyway, it should be possible to create a new language, which is essentially a superset of both Java and Javascript (non- strict, of course). Sure there would be challenges in making a language that is loosely typed in some places and strongly typed in others, compiled in some places and interpreted in others, etc.... but my gut feeling is that none of these would be show stoppers (except for those with open minds and good imaginations). Aside from issues of "where they run" (browser vs. server side, etc)....what are the issues that would come up, especially on the syntax side? How could you handle the situations where the two languages would otherwise conflict? What would it look like? I can appreciate it if you just think "it shouldn't be done" or "what a nightmare working in that language", but I'm hoping for responses from people with open minds and that have more to say than that...
