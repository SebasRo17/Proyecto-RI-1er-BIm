I am planning a 3d file viewer with option to view 3d files (both geometry and mesh viewer). I would also like to put an option to convert between geometry and mesh. I am well versed with c++/qt. But novice in the field of 3d programming. What would be the ideal 3d engine, any open source projects already existing, matching my details? And why it would be a good example of what I plan to do?
