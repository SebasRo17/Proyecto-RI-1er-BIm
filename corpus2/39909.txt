Please excuse me if that question is too basic but I couldn't find anything in the documentation or on here. If you consider the following `Graphic` I would like to know how to detect which primitive is being clicked,               Graphics[{Disk[#, 0.5]} & /@ {{0, 0}, {1, 0}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/06rIn.png) and for example change the color of the clicked `Disk`, change its radius or get the coordinates of its center or anything related to its geometry. I am aware that `EventHandler` is my friend but as the questions states, I have no clue how to detect which primitive is being clicked (except by using `Mouseposition` and compare it to the centers). I am also aware that my question is somehow poorly researched but I feel like I'm blocking on a basic notion.
