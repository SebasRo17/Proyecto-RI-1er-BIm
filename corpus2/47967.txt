This is my first question on any stack-exchange site and I'm also very new to using _Mathematica_ software so please excuse/correct me if I mess up. I would like to take a list of functions of a single variable {$f_1, f_2, f_3, \ldots, f_n$}, and plot the minimum value that each of these functions takes on at any point over an interval $[x_0, x_f]$. So far this much is not so difficult (or has not been the difficult part for me to figure out). However, I would like for each of the intervals over which any function $f_i$ is the minimum to correspond to it's own color (like how Plot usually attributes different colors to different curves when you plot multiple functions) and further I'd like to include a legend that clearly denotes which function from the list corresponds to which color. I can do the first part fairly easily using the following:               Z[x_] = Min[x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5]     Plot[Z[x], {x, 0, 2}, PlotLegends -> "Expressions"]      ![Plotting the minimum value of a list of multiple functions ](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L7gbl.png) I would like something that would color the segment of the curve where $x^5$ is the minimum function in the list one color and the segment where $x$ is the minimum function in another color and denote the color representations on the legend on the right. I can plot each of the functions separately with the color-coding system like so:               Plot[{x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5}, {x, 0, 2}, PlotLegends -> "Expressions"]      ![Plotting multiple functions with color-coding and legend](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1TTnX.png) And in both cases the " PlotLegends -> "Expressions" " flag/option (not sure what the terminology is for _Mathematica_ functions) does nicely generate a legend as I'd like it. But I don't really have a sense of how to combine the two. Thanks in advance for the help, and while I didn't find any other questions that might help answer (or partially answer) this question please correct me if I missed any.
