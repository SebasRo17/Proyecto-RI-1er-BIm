I occasionally `ssh` into machines that have _Mathematica_ installed. I then operate _Mathematica_ through the command-line interface. Often, the command-line interface isn't the ideal way to operate _Mathematica_ , but it does have incredible convenience and speed advantages. Is there a ncurses library (maybe even a 3rd party one) to add additional functionality when accessing _Mathematica_ through `ssh`? ### Edit List of ideas for additional functionality   1. Cursor clicking support, so I don't have to use the arrow keys   2. Ability to rerun command (`Shift`+`Enter`)   3. Support for Save As
