`ParallelDo` only parallelizes by the innermost variable. Is it possible to distribute the calculation over all the points (all the variable) separately? let me demonstrate:               CloseKernels[]; LaunchKernels[6];     ParallelDo[Print@Row[{i, j, k}, ", "], {i, 2}, {j, 10}, {k, 10}]      This only runs on two kernels, because `i` only has two values. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oFMJq.png) Method `"FinestGrained"` is of no help either. As a workaround I can do               WorkUnits = Flatten[Table[{i, j, k}, {i, 2}, {j, 5}, {k, 5}], 2];     ParallelDo[With[{i = w[[1]], j = w[[2]], k = w[[3]]},       Print@Row[{i, j, k}, ", "]       ]      , {w, WorkUnits}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eKh1W.png) But this seems very clumsy. **Is there a more elegant way to parallelize the calculation over all variables, not just the first in a`ParallelDo`?**
