Seriously... I need more time, and I can't find it. I've got my **main project** and I spent most of my time on it. I'm trying to, BUT I got a **lot of** minor projects, old projects support. I'm **very interested** in self-improvement because I'm still being sort of a young programmer and I spend lot of time discovering new technologies. Also, I'm part of some of linux distribution core teams (after all I'm a linux newcomer) and I'm spending time for it too (my main project is win-only though). I'm getting better in all directions. But slowly, because I'm doing everything at the same time ... Many times, I feel like this : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KrhC6.gif) And I don't want to leave the stuff I'm interesting in, I just need more time... But there is no more time. I also have my private life, working at home and working at work isn't so easy. Living at work is also not the solution. So finally I'm searching for a way to optimize (Hard optimize) my TODO list because the time is not a thing you can increase.
