I have about 8 web applications (all of them ASP.NET based), and I want to implement multiple language support for all of them and have an architecture that I can leverage on new web applications down the road. I would also like to try to centralize the admin piece (where all the text translations and other language specific resources reside), do you know of any tool or architectural pattern that might be useful in this case? The only robust solution I can think of is to have a web application that manages the language support resources and all the other web applications connect to this centralized app/service, but I'm afraid that this solution will have a performance impact on all applications if not implemented the right way. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions.
