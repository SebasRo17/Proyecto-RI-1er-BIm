I have a plot whose legend, when placed at the bottom, is two lines rather than one:               Plot[{x, x^2}, {x, 0, 5}, PlotRange -> {0, 5}, PlotLegends -> Placed[Abs /@ {Subscript[a, 2]/Subscript[a, 1], Subscript[a, 3]/Subscript[a, 1]}, Below]]      If I do the same thing without the absolute value signs, it plots in a row as I'd like:               Plot[{x, x^2}, {x, 0, 5}, PlotRange -> {0, 5}, PlotLegends -> Placed[{Subscript[a, 2]/Subscript[a, 1], Subscript[a, 3]/Subscript[a, 1]}, Below]]      I'm guessing the absolute value signs make this slightly too wide, but putting the two legends side by side would clearly fit into the plot. I've spent a while digging through the documentation and cannot figure out how to do this - help would be appreciated!
