I need to send automated emails to customers whose language I am not sure about. 90 % are french and would probably not be able to read mails in english. The other 10 % would probably be able to read in english and clearly not in french. I don't know what their language is. I investigated the multipart/alternative that looked promising, give the mailer several variants and he selects the best one. ( see: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1766.txt ) Unfortunately no mailer seems to care about that, they always show the last part... did someone manage to make multi-lingual mail with automatic selection of the best version for the users? Is there some kind of trick to know? Do you have another solution?
