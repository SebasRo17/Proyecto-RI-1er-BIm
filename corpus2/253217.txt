I have a situation here, where I have a loop that loops x amount of times. The value x is determined by the user. Everytime it loops, I want it to wait for a button click before continuing the loop. ie. something like this (pseudocode):               loop(x times){     Button b;       wait until a click       when clicked{         b.onclicklistener{           setText(x);         }       }     }      I am using this for an android app, so with Thread.wait()/Thread.notify() what I learned was that it interrupts the main UIthread, so I cannot use that. So what I believe the only two options that I can use to kind of "pause" the loop is CountDownLatch.await() or AsyncTask (I don't know what that does, have not researched about it) Would CountDownLatch.await()/CountDownLatch.countDown() be the best methods and class to use in this example, or should I look into AsyncTask?
