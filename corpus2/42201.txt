`PieChart` has the nice functionality of highlighting a single pie when you click on it. It is then sticking out a little. See the following example:               PieChart[{1, 2, 3}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KyWA5.jpg) Now, if I click on the green Pie it starts to stick out. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XiKzF.jpg) Is there any way of achieving this programmatically? I browsed through the Options of `PieChart` but couldn't find anything. I want to automatically create a number of plots with highlighted sections and save them automatically without having to click on them manually each time.
