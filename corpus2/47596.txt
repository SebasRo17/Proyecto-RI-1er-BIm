I have the expression $\frac{1}{15} \left(-(-1)^n-5\times 2^{n+2}+3\times 2^{2 n+1}+15\right)$ which I want to calculate mod _m_ for a very large _n_. My current method is to ask for this exression in **FullForm** :               Times[Rational[1,15],Plus[15,Times[-1,Power[-1,n]],Times[-5,Power[2,Plus[2,n]]],Times[3,Power[2,Plus[1,Times[2,n]]]]]]      And to conver all `Rational`s and `Power`s to `PowerMod`s manually:               Mod[Times[PowerMod[15,-1,m],Plus[15,Times[-1,PowerMod[-1,n,m]],Times[-5,PowerMod[2,Plus[2,n],m]],Times[3,PowerMod[2,Plus[1,Times[2,n]],m]]]],m]      However, this is kind of time-consuming and I'm sure there's a better way. Is there any sort of 'smart' find-and-replace function I can apply to do something like this?
