The following,               table =        TableForm[ConstantArray[0, {3, 3}],         TableAlignments -> Right,         TableHeadings -> {None, {"One", "Two", "Three"}}]      generates a table with headings: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aPbJo.png) I see that its `FullForm` is               TableForm[       List[         List[HoldForm[\[Placeholder]], HoldForm[\[Placeholder]], HoldForm[\[Placeholder]]],         List[HoldForm[\[Placeholder]], HoldForm[\[Placeholder]], HoldForm[\[Placeholder]]],         List[HoldForm[\[Placeholder]], HoldForm[\[Placeholder]], HoldForm[\[Placeholder]]]],         Rule[TableAlignments, Right],         Rule[TableHeadings, List[None, List["One", "Two", "Three"]]       ]     ]      and I could parse this to retrieve the value of `TableHeadings`. But is there a more canonical approach? I found that for plots, one can use `Options[plot]`, but I couldn't find a counterpart for tables.
