I'm presenting a software design for approval today and as I'm going through the hundreds of pages of design documentation, cherry picking what's important, I'm unsure if I should start with the activity diagrams or use cases. I was thinking of having it stacked like so:   * Activities Diagrams   * Use Cases Diagrams   * Sequence Diagrams   * Class Models I've spent the last 7 months of my life creating this and I want it to be presented in the most logical order and done with.
