I just want someone to clarify the following questions as Demis Bellot had announced a couple of weeks ago that ServiceStack would go commercial. Refer link below. https://plus.google.com/app/basic/stream/z12tfvoackvnx1xzd04cfrirpvybu1nje54 (Please note that when I say ServiceStack or SS I refer to all associated SS libraries such as ServiceStack.Text, etc.)   1. If I have a solution already developed using ServiceStack today will I have to purchase a license once SS goes commercial even if I don't upgrade the SS binaries to the commercial release version?   2. Will previous versions of SS (prior to commercial licensing) always be opensource and use the same license as before?   3. If I fork SS today (prior to commercial licensing) on Github, would it be illegal to maintain that after SS goes commercial?   4. If the answer to question 2 is yes, then would I still be able to fork a previous version after SS goes commercial without worrying about the commercial license (all the while maintaining and releasing the source to the public)?
