I'm developing a **Multi-lingual** website which is being developed in custom `PHP` and using `MySql`. To implement the multi-language support, I've come to think of this approach (steps below). Please criticize and give your opinion and suggestions on the implementation technique. You can also suggest any better solution, if any. **METHOD 1**               1- Store the user preferred language id/code in `Cookie` (on first visit, the default language code).     2- The **database** will have a table named `languages` with the following columns:          ---------------------------------------------      lang_id | language | lang_place | lang_text     ---------------------------------------------         1    | eng      | menu[1]    | Home         2    | eng      | menu[2]    | Options         3    | eng      | menu[2][1] | My Account         4    | eng      | menu[2][2] | Settings         5    | eng      | menu[2][3] | Logout         6    | eng      | menu[3]    | Orders                              .                         .              So on for other languages      **METHOD 2**               1- Same as of method 1     2- The **database** columns will be:          ---------------------------------------------      lang_id | language | lang_data      ---------------------------------------------         1    | eng      | {                               "menu1":"home",                             "menu2":{                                   "name":"options",                                 "button1":"my account",                                 "button2":"settings",                                 "button3":"logout"                              }                           }                              .                         .              So on for other languages      I highly appreciate your help in this regard.
