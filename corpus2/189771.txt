We have a very large, 10 year old LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) web application that is out of control and poorly written due to a large number of patches and possible hundreds of programmers. If we were to do a re-write, what are alternatives to the LAMP stack? One of the reasons behind LAMP was that it's easy to develop and cheap. Now the company can afford to spend more time/effort/money on a new system. I thought about Java or C++ with Oracle? Is there a common 'Enterprise' stack companies use? Many thanks.
