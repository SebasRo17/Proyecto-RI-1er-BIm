I'm learning now Java from scratch and when I started to learn about instantiating objects, I don't understand - in which cases do I need to instantiate objects? For example I'm studying from TutsPlus course about it and there is example about "Rectangle" class. Instructor says that it needs to be instantiated. So I started to doubt about - when do I need to instantiate those objects when writing Java code?
