I am authoring a lot of plugins for the content management system that I am writing. I believe it to be of utmost importance that script files (especially if they're plugins) should load quickly, which leads to me to the question that I've asked today? **What's more important for plugins, minimizability or readability?** Let's imagine that we live in an ideal world where code is always perfect. Should a plugin (which being perfect, the author doesn't expect the end user to read) be designed so that it takes up as little space as possible, or so that it readable by the end user. For example, I'm writing a piece of code that spits out HTML and appends it to the body. I have replaced every instance of the tag 'div' with '!' and then used `String[replace](/\!/g, 'div')` to save four characters (therefore bytes?) for each declaration of a div element. _NB,`[replace]` is also a declared variable so that when it is minified it will read something to the effect of `String[r](/\!/g,'div')`_ Am I caring too much about download speed or should care a bit more about readability. (IMO, most minifying techniques are easily reverse-engineered, but is it bad practice?) * * * **Edit** Thanks for all the answers, you guys are great!
