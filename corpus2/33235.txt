I, for one, only add debug code (such as print statements) when I'm trying to locate a bug. And once I've found it, I remove the debug code (and add a test case which specifically tests for that bug). I feel that it's cluttering the real code and therefore has no place there unless I'm debugging. How do you do it? Do you leave the debug code in place, or remove it when obsolete (which may be difficult to judge when that is)?
