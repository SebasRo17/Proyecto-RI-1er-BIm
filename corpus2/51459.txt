fitresulty21 =        NonlinearModelFit[ydata21,          {funfit[y, σ, A, B, x1, d, d/2], A > 0},          {{x1, 20}, {σ, 3}, {A, 200}, {B, 2000}, {d, 110}},         y];      Above is the code that I am using to develop a fit to data that is not included here. The result of the fit with the data looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i1xYC.jpg) While the data does go slightly below 0 at points, I would like the fit to be constrained to be greater then 0 at all times, but I am unsure how to do that. Any other advice about how I might generally improve this fit is also welcome. The model `funfit` comes from the code:               f[x_, w_] := UnitStep[ x + w/2] * UnitStep[ w/2 - x];     PSF[x_, σ_] := PDF[ NormalDistribution[0, σ], x];     u[x_, A_, B_, x1_, d_, w_] := B - A*(f[x - x1, w] + f[x - x1 - d, w] + f[x - x1 - 2*d, w])     funfit[y_, σ_, A_, B_, x1_, d_, w_] := Convolve[u[x, A, B, x1, d, w], PSF[x, σ], x, y];
