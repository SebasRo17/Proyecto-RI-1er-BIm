I just banged my head against the table for some 20 minutes looking at a totally weird bug in PHP, and then I realized there's octal. The <%(*&#> octal. In short, I padded some literals with zeros so the code would be aligned, I know, big mistake. Forgot about octals. The question is, does anyone use octals for anything other than file permissions? (I personally prefer `chmod ugo+rwx` but I understand that if they have to be programmaticaly generated, it's useful to use octals.) But are they useful in any other situation?
