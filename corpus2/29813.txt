Here's the recursive function I'm using:               DH[n_, k_, s_] := Sum[Binomial[k, k - j] DH[n/m^j, k - j, m + 1], {m, s, n^(1/k)}, {j, 1, k}]       DH[n_, 0, s_] := 1      Now, on paper, if I expand out the recursion of DH by hand, I know that               DH[n,1,1] == n.        I also know, expanding by hand, that               DH[n,2,1] == 2 Sum[Floor[n/k], {k, 1, Floor[n^(1/2)]}] - Floor[n^(1/2)]^2      Can Mathematica do that for me, especially for larger values (like, say, `DH[n,8,1]` or `DH[n,10,2]`)? I would like to type in `DH[n,2,1]` or `DH[n,3,1]` and get those sums, but right now, I just get a recursion depth exceeded error and no answers. * * * * * * **The following is a note, not part of the original question** Computing `DH[n,2,1]` by hand, For Mr. Wizard: _Here's our starting formula_               DH[n,2,1] = Sum[Binomial[k, k - j] DH[n/m^j, k - j, m + 1], {m, s, n^(1/k)}, {j, 1, k}]      _apply`s=1, k=2` and remove the `{j,1,k} Sum` by manually looping `j` from `1 to k`, with `k=2`_               DH[n,2,1] = Sum[ Binomial[2,1] DH[ n/m, 2-1,m+1 ] + Binomial[2,2] DH[n/m^2, 2-2, m+1],         {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _apply binomials, simplify trivial arithmetic_               DH[n,2,1] = Sum[ 2 DH[n/m, 1,m+1] + DH[n/m^2,0,m+1], {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _Swap in`DH[n,0,s] = 1`_                DH[n,2,1] = Sum[ 2 DH[n/m, 1,m+1] + 1, {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _Inspection should make clear that`DH[ n/m, 1, m+1 ] is Floor[n/m] - (m+1) + 1`_               DH[n,2,1] = Sum[ 2 (Floor[n/m]-m) + 1, {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _Distribute the`x2`_               DH[n,2,1] = Sum[ 2 Floor[n/m] - 2 m + 1, {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _Extract the`1` from the sum_               DH[n,2,1] = Floor[n^(1/2)] + Sum[ 2 Floor[n/m] - 2 m, {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _Use the triangle number formula`(n)(n+1)/2` to pull `-2 m` out of the sum as `-2 ( Floor[n^(1/2)] (Floor[n^(1/2)] + 1))/2`_               DH[n,2,1] = Floor[n^(1/2)] -2 ( Floor[n^(1/2)] (Floor[n^(1/2)] + 1))/2 + Sum[ 2Floor[n/m],      {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _Cancel the`2s` outside the sum, and move the `2` inside the sum out front_               DH[n,2,1] = Floor[n^(1/2)] - ( Floor[n^(1/2)] (Floor[n^(1/2)] + 1)) + 2 Sum[ Floor[n/m],      {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _Multiply the terms in parenthesis outside the sum_               DH[n,2,1] = Floor[n^(1/2)] - Floor[n^(1/2)]^2 - Floor[n^(1/2)] + 2 Sum[ Floor[n/m],         {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      _get rid of cancelling terms, and we are left with_               DH[n,2,1] = -Floor[n^(1/2)]^2 + 2 Sum[ Floor[n/m], {m,1,n^(1/2)}]      ...which is what I wanted to show. Check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_summatory_function and you should see that is indeed the equations for D(n) when using the hyperbola method. That page mentions a generalized Divisor function, D_k(n). The k in that function corresponds to the k here - this recursive expression applies the hyperbola method to D_k(n) for any k, a whole number. By way of comparison, I have simplified `DH[x,4,2]` to               1 - Floor[x^(1/4)]^4 +       Sum[           4 (Floor[x/(u^3)] + Floor[Floor[x/u]^(1/3)]^3)           - 6 Floor[ Floor[x/(u^2)]^(1/2)]^2 +           12 (Sum [Floor[x/(u^2 s)], {s, (u + 1),        Floor[Floor[x/(u^2)]^(1/2)]}] +           Sum[Floor[x/( u s^2)] - Floor[Floor[x/(u s)]^(1/2)]^2, {s, (u + 1),         Floor[Floor[x/u]^(1/3)]}]) +           24  Sum[ Floor[x/(u m s)], {s, u + 1, (x/u)^(1/3)}, {m, s + 1, (x/(u s))^(1/2)}],        {u, 2, x^(1/4)}]      I haven't gotten up the gumption to go higher, as it's a bit exhausting to work through - thus my question.
