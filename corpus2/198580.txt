I'm not asking for legal advice; just some rough guidance. I have a host application in Java that uses the Rhino JS engine to execute JavaScript. That JavaScript can then make calls into other Java libraries, some of which might be licensed under the GPL. I distribute my hosting app, the JS files as source and the unmodified Java libs. I have released all of the JavaScript as open source. Am I also required to release my Java hosting apps source?
