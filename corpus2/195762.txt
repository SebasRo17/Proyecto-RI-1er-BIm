I've worked at several places with 2-10 developers and each place has struggled in the area of tracking if the company has an account on a given web site or service. We're always left wondering...   * What's the username   * What's the password (Obviously you don't want to store this, I'm not looking for something that does)   * What's the account number   * Who created this   * When was it created   * What email is our account registered under **What do you guys use to track this kind of thing between multiple developers?** I've setup at least a dozen accounts for the company I currently work for and I don't have any documentation to show the next guy what's been done. Ideally I'm looking for a web solution that will be locked down within our VPN.
