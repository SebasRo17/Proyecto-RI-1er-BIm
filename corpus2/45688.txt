in the package I'm writing I have a list of global variables which should not be visible from a notebook. Here's an extract of the package:               Begin["`Private`"];          (* Global variables *)     volumeTheorical = "Not calculated value";     absoluteErrorTheorical = "Not calculated value";     relativeErrorTheorical = "Not calculated value";     volumeReal = "Not calculated value";     absoluteErrorReal = "Not calculated value";     relativeErrorReal = "Not calculated value";     reserves = "";          volumeFitted[radiusFitted_] :=  volumeOfFittedTheoricalSphere[pointsCleaned[radiusFitted], radiusFitted];     pointsCleaned[radiusFitted_] :=   cleanPoints[generatePointsHemiSphere[radiusFitted]];     realPointsAdjusted[Diameter_, Anticlinal_, ConstantZ_] :=  cleanAdjustPoints[pointsCleaned[Diameter/2], Diameter, Anticlinal, ConstantZ];     constantH := 40;      and finally:               End[];     EndPackage[];      Anyway when I open a new notebook, after:               SetDirectory[StringJoin[NotebookDirectory[]]];     Needs["VolumeReserves`"]      If I start to write, for example, constantH...the kernel shows me it already has it set to 40. Instead I'd like it not to be visible, so that any user can define it's own constantH and use it for something else...how can I hide them? Thanks
