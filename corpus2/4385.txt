How can I calculate only those permutations of `Range[n]`, that satisfy certain rules? I don't want to filter the result after calculating all the permutations but adding some rules during the calculation of the permutations. I will explain better.               Permutations[Range[4]]={{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 4, 3}, {1, 3, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4, 2},        {1, 4, 2, 3}, {1, 4, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3, 4}, {2, 1, 4, 3}, {2, 3, 1, 4}, {2, 3, 4,      1}, {2, 4, 1, 3}, {2, 4, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2, 4}, {3, 1, 4, 2}, {3,       2, 1, 4}, {3, 2, 4, 1}, {3, 4, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 2, 1}, {4, 1, 2,        3}, {4, 1, 3, 2}, {4, 2, 1, 3}, {4, 2, 3, 1}, {4, 3, 1, 2}, {4, 3,        2, 1}}      I want to wash out permutations where at the second position is 2 for example, but not after the calculation of all the permutations but during. I want all the permutations with some particular rules. I need that because I have to filter permutations with an high rank in principle. The rules I need are of the following kind: "#[[1]] not equal to 4". The code below is very slow for range=10. I need to arrive to range 64.
