As I get it, **having an error (even a typo like or missing ";") in your whiteboard code will often cost you some interview points**. Avoiding that will inevitably make one proof-reading code again and again (losing time and possibly neural energy / concentration) or even using a simpler (and thus less effective) algoritm -- and both these ways are "costy" again! So, **why not just fast write code** as elegant and effective as you would having a (unit) testing framework at your disposal **and then just normally test it it (just on the whiteboard)** ? Has anyone tried / seen this approach? Is the whole idea worthy? **[this also applies to the pen-and-paper case of course]**
