Hello I find in programming I come across this problem usually (especially when dealing with certain frameworks) where I would like once piece of code to execute once and only once however the provided method e.g (something like an onComplete function) that I wish to place this instruction in will in reality execute multiple times. I am just wondering does anybody know of the best way that would get around this problem, one programmer friend of mine told me to use a flag (boolean) to check whether or not this code has already run but I feel like this is not a suitable solution and I would not like to introduce global variables for the sake of checking a condition once and only once. Has anybody ever come across a problem like this before, I am wondering is there any good practice out there to keep in mind when dealing with code like this. Thanks
