`InputAutoReplacements` is an obvious choice for formatting isotope names in text cells. I'd like to be able to type `"1H"`, for example, and when I hit the space bar have it replaced with `Row[{Superscript["",1],"H"}]` inline. But my initial attempts at this have not been productive. Is it possible to use string patterns in `InputAutoReplacements`, such as the pattern in the following `StringReplace`?               StringReplace["14C",        n:NumberString~~atom:(CharacterRange["A","Z"]~~Repeated[CharacterRange["a","z"],{0,1}]        ~~WordBoundary) :>         ToString[Row[{Style[Superscript["",Style[n,Smaller]],                            ScriptBaselineShifts->{Automatic,.4}],atom}],                 TraditionalForm]]      I expected that entering that pattern into the Option Inspector (Global preferences for `InputAutoReplacements`, using `RuleDelayed`) would cause occurrences of `"1H "` typed into a text cell to raise the "1" to a superscript. Nothing happens. You might imaging that formatting the superscripts according to the above rule by hand is tedious.
