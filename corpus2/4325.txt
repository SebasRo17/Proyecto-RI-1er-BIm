I have never had the opportunity to work from home on certain days, but I would definitely like to try it if I can. What are the pros and cons? I'll list a few that I can think of. Pros:   * You don't need to do any work. (That's a JOKE)   * You can be a lot more productive. No commute, relaxed, no meetings, no interruptions Cons:   * Less of a team effort.   * Other team members can get held up due to having to wait for information for an off-site member Apologies if this has been asked before - I did a search but couldn't find a pros and cons discussion. Edit: It appears The Oatmeal has already covered this! :-)
