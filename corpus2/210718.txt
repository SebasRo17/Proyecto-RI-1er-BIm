What specific conditions or requirements should you create your own array over using `std::array`? Here is my background: I'm developing a small simple library that a small group of people will use and _hopefully_ build upon. The current structure allows for both `std::vector` and `std::array` using `iterators`, however, a lot of the people do not like and cannot seem to use `std::array` and find the notation confusing to work with the library. I have attempted to make my library work for better for `std::array` however, it dawned on me that maybe I should provide my own and adding in the functionality needed? For example: `library::array<int, 2> myArray; myArray.fill(1, 100);` and I thought it would be a good project in order for me to develop my skills, particularly in `templates` and other `sorting` algorithms.
