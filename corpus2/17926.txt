Here is the example:               Simplify[x + y, x + y == a]     Simplify[x + y, x + y == 5]      Mathematica 9 output:               x+y     5      I expect the complexity of `a` to be lower than complexity of `Plus[x,y]`, and the result of the first line should be `a`. Even if I specify `ComplexityFunction` explicitly:               Simplify[x + y, x + y == a, ComplexityFunction -> LeafCount]      I still get `x+y` as a result. It's however obvious that `LeafCount[x+y]` is greater than `LeafCount[a]`. Why does Simplify ignore `x+y==a` but uses `x+y==5`? How can I define the former assumption in a right way?
