A user posted this question on StackOverflow which was closed as off topic: > 3 people are playing a game with a standard 52 card deck. Each player is > given 2 cards each, possible cards and their values being $\mathrm A = 1$, > $2=2$, $\ldots$, $\mathrm J=11$, $\mathrm Q=12$, $\mathrm K=13$. A player > wins if the sum of his cards is greater than both of the sums of the other > player's cards. What is the winning probability for each player? I am curious to see this problem receive the kind of solution that David gave here. Allowing _Mathematica_ to do as much of the thinking for you as possible, how can this be solved?
