I have been offered a job from campus in the Enterprise s/w domain. I'm at loggerheads with myself deciding if I should take up the job, since I'm generally interested in consumer s/w esp in companies that encourage open source contributions. My question is if i'll find it difficult to later(maybe after a year or two) change my domain and move onto B2C (Business to Consumer) software companies. Will my past experience with enterprise software stand against me?
