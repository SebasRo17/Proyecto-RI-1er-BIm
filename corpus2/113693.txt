I have been doing some browser automation testing recently using Selenium (and Watin a bit too) and have reached a point where I am looking for recommendations on controlling the environment I'm testing. For example, if I have a test that registers a new user on site (or similar database dependent task); how do people ensure that the test does not persist or at least is able to be repeated without always changing the test itself? I'm seeking recommendations for ensuring my integration/acceptance tests using Selenium can be ran without having to worry about changing them or the environment manually.
