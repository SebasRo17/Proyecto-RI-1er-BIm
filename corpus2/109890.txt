Long and short is really in the question title. For a language which compiles to an intermediate language like MSIL or Java byte-code, if there's concern about something like reverse engineering or hacking to disable security features, should AOT (ahead of time) compilation be considered rather than just obfuscation? Obviously, there's a bit of wiggle room in this question as there's no one answer I wouldn't imagine, but when would you start looking at performing an AOT compilation before distributing something versus sending it out obfuscated?
