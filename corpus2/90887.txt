i am glad to say that we are going to make Advanced Electron Forum (anelectron.com) an Opensource project, since we have a lack in developers and we think that this will make the development wheel turn much much better, we are going to post the source code to public in github, but we are not sure about the license that we are going to use, GPL gives too much freedom we don't want, the only thing we want to prevent the user from doing is the forking, we don't want any forks or redistribution of the code without permission, so what to chose ?
