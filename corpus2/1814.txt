Along my career, I had to deal with users who think their computer could think: > My computer hates me! or > He just do this so he could laugh at me! This is often a joke, but some users are serious. It's easy when I know the causes of the problem, but when it's unexpected behavior it's more complicated. In those cases, I usually turn it as a joke, putting that on the fault of moon phases and tide, but they are likely to prefer their explanations. Do you have any tricks to deal with those users?
