This is my query:               totalCntLByCnty =    {#[[1]], #[[2]] } & /@ SQLExecute[conn, "     SELECT  COUNT(*), c.description     FROM name_loc f     INNER JOIN countries       c ON f.fk_cnty_id  = c.id     INNER JOIN identifiers     i ON f.fk_ident_id = i.id       GROUP BY f.fk_cnty_id     LIMIT 5     "]      I get this: I got: `{{2, "ANDORRA"}, {33, "UNITED ARAB EMIRATES"}, {14, "ANGUILLA"}, {1, "ARMENIA"}, {78, "ARGENTINA"}}` Normally I would not use 'limit 5' I'm using it now to limit the return for this question. I need to build a barchart where the name of the country returned is automatically used as a legend at the bottom of the chart, and count (vertical axis) is just 'Total's'. I do not or can not use something like:               ChartLegends -> Placed[{"ANDORRA", "UNITED ARAB EMIRATES", "ANGUILLA",      "ARMENIA", "ARGENTINA"}, Bottom]      Because the name of the countries will change depending upon certain search criteria. I will be using either a bar chart or a pie chart to display the data. My question is: 1) How can I generate the chart so the legend uses the name returned from the "#[[2]] list? 2) Is there a better chart or way of displaying this data? I am using Mathematica 8 Thank you for any help.
