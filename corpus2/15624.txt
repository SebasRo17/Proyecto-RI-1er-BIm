I have the following piece of code:               Plot[StateResponse[        nss,        {0.01 UnitStep[t - tstep], 0, 0, 0, 0}, {t, 0, tstop}] // Evaluate,      {t, 0, tstop} ,      PlotLabel -> "State Variable Open loop response to 1% step in Dd"]      which gives me a five variable plot. I want to export this plot to excel to compare with some other data but can't get `Export` to format the exported _Mathematica_ data as I want, i.e. in six columns. Can anyone help on this?
