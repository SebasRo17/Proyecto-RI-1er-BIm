From the Jargon File: _brain fart: n.   The actual result of a braino, as opposed to the mental glitch that is the braino itself. E.g., typing dir on a Unix box after a session with DOS._ I've been working with JavaScript and Python lately and have made errors like typing, in Python,               function foo(argument1, argument2):      This isn't pure JavaScript, but it also doesn't work in Python. One of my recent posts, http://serverfault.com/questions/506403/why-is-my- root-url-serving-up-a-404-under-apache/506452?iemail=1&noredirect=1#506452, was about why a pure, simple, working, and rather small DocumentRoot contents were not showing. The answer was that I made a mistake that I do not remember making in years of dealing with Apache: I had included commas betweek ServerAlias entries, and that was why the (perfectly appropriate) DocumentRoot was giving a ServerError. (And did I mention that I've been spending a lot of time coding where separating by ", " was the appropriate way of separation?) Is this sort of thing just non-negotiable? Or are there ways to mitigate and compensate for them?
