I have been reading various Web application optimizing articles and many of them suggest to remove unused CSS rules. Currently, I have a page which has jQueryUI css, Bootstrap CSS, Datatables CSS and couple of more. All together they translate to about couple of thousands of rules ( my estimate ) and am quite sure I am using only 20-30% I asked my friend in UK who has very high speed broadband, to check the page load time and he says, like for every other page on his connection this one too loaded in a second which is quite suggestive that rendering time seems insignificant to the page load time. How much improvement is expected in removing unused CSS rules? Is it really worth it?
