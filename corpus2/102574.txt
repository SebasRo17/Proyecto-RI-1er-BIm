![youtube ie6](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ef2UO.png) When Facebook, Youtube, and even Microsoft themselves say that they've "dropped support for IE6", what do they really mean? Youtube still functionally works fine in IE6. If they mean that they've dropped support for visual appearance and fancy features, then their point is moot. Web developers have degraded IE6's appearance and fancy feature set since the dawn of time. So what does all this IE6 bashing from top companies mean for us web developers today? There's no big website that has dropped dropped _functionality_ support for IE6 because they're scared that they would lose the 5% or so customers that are still using it. Until the day Google itself blocks IE6 from searching, thereby lowering IE6's market share to near 0%, I don't see how this "support dropping" accomplishes anything.
