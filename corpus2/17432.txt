Let's say I have three files containing:               File 1:     x y z     1 4 6           File 2:     x y z     2 5 9           File 3:     x y z     5 4 8      My goal is to import the data from a file only if in this file `y == 4` (so here I would want to import files 1 and 3). Is there a way to do that with functional programming? The only solution I can think of currently is to loop through all the files, check if `data[[2, 2]] == 4`, and append this data to a list if true. Is there a better way to do that? And if I have to loop, is it better to import all the files as lists and then discard the lists that do not match `y == 4`? Or is it better to import only the files matching `y == 4` in the first place?
