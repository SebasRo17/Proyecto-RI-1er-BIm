How do you make enterpriseCDFs save the state of buttons sliders, listpickers etc? I manipulated a CDF and saved it on exit but all the buttons etc were reset when I started it again. I've made a simplified example: If you execute the last line it produces a toggler bar and a button in a single output cell. I export that cell as a stand alone enterprise CDF. When I open it in cdf player, toggle a few buttons, save, close and reopen, the state is reset to the original first three buttons pressed. Is it possible to get the state of the buttons to be remembered across saves?               data[n_] := Range[n];     series = {1, 2, 3};     cdf =        DynamicModule[{},          Grid[{           {TogglerBar[Dynamic[series], Range[6]]},           {Dynamic[              PopupWindow[Tooltip[Button["Show data"], data[series]], data[series],                WindowSize -> All,                WindowTitle -> "data",                 WindowElements -> {"VerticalScrollBar", "HorizontalScrollBar","StatusArea"},                ScrollingOptions ->                   {"HorizontalScrollRange" -> Automatic, "VerticalScrollRange" -> Automatic}],               TrackedSymbols :> Full]}},           Alignment -> {Top, Top}],           SaveDefinitions -> True];     cdf      I also tried exporting with the command:               CDFDeploy[NotebookDirectory[] <> "testCDF.cdf", cdf,        "Method" -> "Standalone", "Target" -> "PlayerPro"];      with same result (not sure if target needs to be playerpro though; the aim was for it to be an enterpriseCDF state-savable with the standard player.
