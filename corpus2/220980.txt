I'm working on my own application and I'm stuck. I have to implement a feature but I can't find a good approach to implement this feature. I was thinking about it for a couple of days, and no good thoughts came. Searching the Internet didn't give me any inspiration. I need to move on, but I want to know, what's the best:   * Think more, wait more, and keep on searching for the best approach   * Stop wasting time and start with poor design, covering everything with tests What do you think? As I said before, I'm working on my own application. I don't have any deadlines, but I also want to finish coding the app asap.
