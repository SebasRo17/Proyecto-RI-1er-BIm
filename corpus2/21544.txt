Is there a way to find a limit of a multivariable function, like $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} f(x,y)$$ with _Mathematica_? When $f$ is continuous, we can use $$\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} f(x,y)=\lim_{(x,0)\to (0,0)} f(x,0)$$ or something similar, which could be implemented with code like               Limit[Limit[f[x,y],y->0],x->0]      When $f$ is not continuous, like for example $$f(x,y)=\begin{cases} \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} & (x,y)\neq (0,0)\\\ 0 & \text{else} \end{cases}$$ we could make at least a small control with something like               Table[Limit[f[x,y] /. y -> k * x, x -> 0], {k, 0, 5}]      which gives us a list of the limits $$\lim_{x\to 0} f(x,k\cdot x)$$ Taking $f$ to be $$ f(x,y)=\begin{cases} 1 & \exists \alpha \in \mathbb{Q} \text{ such that } x=\alpha \cdot y\\\ 0 & \text{else}\\\ \end{cases}$$ gives us a function where this won't work. So, is there a way to compute those limits (or getting the result that the limits don't exist) in _Mathematica_?
