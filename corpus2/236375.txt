I connected iPod with Arduino using serial (UART) connection. Arduino sends 0-1023 number (so it's two bytes) as it's samples light sensor value. I'm asking about advice about simple and reliable communication protocol.   1. Do I need magic constants to start/stop communication.   2. Maybe I need sent data of small chunks. Now I have:               while (1)     {        data = getData() ;         // two bytes of 0-1024        Serial.write((data) & 0xFF)) ;         Serial.write((data) & 0x300)) ;      }      Any suggestion how to implement simple and reliable protocol ?
