I have developed a Django application for a company. Now I am about to ship it to my customer. After reading through online articles and books, I understood that securing the source code of any web application is a challenge. Is there anything that I can think to secure my Django applications's source code? This will be my last chance to try. My customer has servers that runs on Windows and Linux. Please help. Efforts made till date:   I tried different techniques like variable mapping in the code, url designs and even folder protection in the server. Now the latest attempt is that I created a VM of my application with username and password being private. This VM will be maintained by me. This approach has its own pros and cons. Any suggestions? Saas is not a solution to my problem as my application should be deployed at the customer's server and served through intranet.
