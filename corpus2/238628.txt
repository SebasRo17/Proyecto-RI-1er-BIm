I have three simple classes. `LoginController`, `UsersCatalog` and `User`. `UsersCatalog` has an array of `User`. I have to represent a simple process of login. `LoginController` has a method `login(username, password)` that simply calls a method `authenticate(username, password)` with the same parameters. Now, it's obvious that the method `authenticate` seeks for a matching `User` object and returns it. The question is: **Is it necesary to represent the seek algorithm?** Isn't representing the seek algorithm too much low level? In the other side, the access to `User` class is inside the seek algorithm, so if i don't represent it, then i don't represent the access to the `User` class. This is part of a wider question. There are any criteria for how deep is enough to represent an algorithm in UML squence diagram?
