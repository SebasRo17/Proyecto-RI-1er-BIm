I come from growing up on dos/windows and the more I got into programming and development the more I invested time/effort into linux distributions. I had a choice between an IBM and a Macbook. I went with the Macbook to get some experience but I am not really sure where to start? I find myself wanting to install virtualbox and boot up linux. Any advice for a new Mac user who wants to get back up to speed with programming efficiently?
