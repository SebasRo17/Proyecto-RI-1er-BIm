I'm fairly new to _Mathematica_. I'm trying to test my C++ implementation of a fourth order Runge Kutta method for Newton's equations of motion. I want to test my integrator when the applied force is dependant on the position. I tried to implement Newton's equations of motion in _Mathematica_ as below:               iMass = 4     iVel0 = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0}     iTime = 1.0     iMagn = Dot[iPos, iPos]^0.5     iForce = ((12.3/iMagn) - 1.2)*Normalize[iPos]       (* Applied force is 12.3 / distance from 0 0 1.2 minus 1.2 and pointing towards 0,0,0 *)     iAccel = iForce/iMass     iVel = iVel0 + Integrate[iAccel, time]     iPos = {0.0, 10000, 0.0} + Integrate[iVel, time]}]      _Mathematica_ ran for a couple of hours until I aborted the calculation. How can I get _Mathematica_ to integrate Newton's equations of motion when the applied force is a function of position?
