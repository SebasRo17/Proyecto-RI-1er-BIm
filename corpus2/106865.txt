So I was talking to a friend and he mentioned > Using WAC I can write Javascript code that will compile and run in iOS, > Android, BB etc and there is this programming language that lets you write code that is _multi-platform_ : http://haxe.org/doc/intro I was wondering why these hasn't got that much attention yet because the idea is so good. So in a sense, what is probably wrong with these ideas in a real-world perspective(real deployable projects)? **EDIT:** So I have probably misused some terms so here are some clarifications. It goes something like, for example, I write code in one language, then I can run it in iOS and Android devices, both of which have their native programming languages. That means I have an app that I can run on both device without having to code any Java or Objective C That's the best I can do for clarifications because I myself am a little confused T_T
