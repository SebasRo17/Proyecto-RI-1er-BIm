**Short Question**   Does it fly in the face of the Pythonic view to reuse / repurpose python modules for projects out side of their intent? **Background**   Over the past several months I have been working on a project that uses the Python unittest module to run manual system tests. Please see questions 1 2 and 3 for greater detail on my project and some of the hurdles I have had to overcome. I would like to know, in general, if it acceptable to reuse modules for other purposes? Most of the comments I have received have been along the lines of "this is not a unittest", or "you should write your own testrunner". My push back on that, is if a module does 90% of what you need it to do with litte to no modification and contains additional (knowingly unneeded) functionality why on earth would you write your own module?
