I have a matrix which is constructed element by element through some iterations, and thus can be non-square. If it's not square, then I want to make it square filling with `0`. **Is there a function to determine if a matrix is square?** I was thinking of something like this:               (* If determinant of matrix is possible, then fill with 0s, else do nothing. *)     If[Det[matrix]=Indeterminate,Fillwithzeros[matrix]]      I'm pretty sure `Det[matrix] = Indeterminate` is not a correct way to express my thoughts, so maybe you could help me out with my syntax or even suggest a better way to do it :D Thanks!
