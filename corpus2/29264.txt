The default `CellEvaluationFunction` is `Identity` but one can quickly see that this is handled specially as an equivalent function, `(# &)`, does not work at all the same. The sole example in the documentation uses `ToExpression` but this also does not work the same, returning only the output of the last line in the Input Cell:               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], CellEvaluationFunction -> ToExpression]      Now in one cell:               2 + 2     5 + 7      > >     12 >   My question is then: What is the _real_ default function that correctly handles multi-line input/output including the `Out[xx]=` cell labels?
