I have a list which looks like:               test = {{0.01,3}, {0.001,3.1}, {0.002,3.2}, ..., {0.01,7}, {0.001,7.1}, {0.002,7.2}, ...,                  {0.01,10}, {0.001,10.1}, {0.002,10.2}, ..., {0.01,13}, {0.001,13.1}, {0.002,13.2}}      What I would like to do is for every value of the second coordinate that is close to a centre value (near `3`, `7`, `10` or `13`) I only want to keep the ones (pairs) that have the smallest value of the first coordinate. After this transformation the list would become:               {{0.001,3.1}, {0.001,7.1}, {0.001,10.1}, {0.001,13.1}}      Note that when I have entered a break in the test list there is also a spacing in the 2nd coordinate values, so the list runs from say `3 - 3.5` and then skips to `7 - 7.5` and so on; it is not a continuous count. Also, the values of the first coordinates are not equal, as those given in the example above, so the list may end up looking like               {{0.001, 3.1}, {0.005, 7.2}, {0.00001, 10.3}, {0.007, 13.4}}      which is still a correct result.
