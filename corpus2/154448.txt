I have been working on PHP and MySQL based web application for more than 5 years now. I started my career as an Intern, and worked my way up through Jr Developer and Software Developer to Sr. Software Engineer (Team Lead), and that's what I am nowadays. I was looking at the link at Wikipedia regarding who is a lead programmer. The link states the following: > A lead programmer is a software engineer in charge of one or more software > projects. Alternative titles include Development Lead, Technical Lead, > Senior Software Engineer, Software Design Engineer Lead (SDE Lead), Software > Manager, or Senior Applications Developer. When primarily contributing in a > high-level enterprise software design role, the title Software Architect (or > similar) is often used. All of these titles can have different meanings > depending on the context. My current job responsibilities are more or less like a _Development Lead_ and to some extent near _Software Architect_ because I usually design the core structure of new products, and manage 2-3 project simultaneously while assisting other teams regarding the structural design of their projects. I am usually on call with clients along with project managers. I code most of the time when my team is stuck somewhere, has a heavy workload, is integrating some third party API, etc. Does what I do qualify for a **Development Lead** title in accordance with my above mentioned job descriptions?
