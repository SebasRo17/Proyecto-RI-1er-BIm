I'm reading about ASP.NET (VB.NET) and I want to built my professionally website. I'm wondering though; I'm still using the basics so I'm really just a novice, but how much should I rely on Visual Studio to create my elements? Should I make my own text boxes and have my own login routine, or should I just use ASP.NET's login features? I know eventually you have to use your own classes and such which is where the real coding comes in, but I'm not sure how relaible, flexible and secure the pre-wrote elements are? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
