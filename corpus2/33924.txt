One way to plot a sequence of numbers on a logarithmic number line is this:               LogLogPlot[0, {t, 8, 16}, Axes -> {True, False},       Ticks -> {{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}}]      ![logarithmic number line values 8 to 16](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xf4bo.png) How can the line be bent into a circle, or how can these values be plotted on a circle? ![logarithmic values 8 to 16 on circle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7vscl.png) The `ParametricPlot` function plots a circle around the coordinates when using `[{Sin[2 u], Cos[2 u]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}]` and `Graphics[Circle[]]` draws a circle but I can't figure out how to put `Ticks` on them.
