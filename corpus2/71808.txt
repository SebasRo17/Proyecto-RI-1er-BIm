I have been blessed with an amazing workplace and my colleagues are really understanding.. However this is my first programming "gig" and i know some people aren't so lucky, Especially those who run their own company! (I've seen my boss work unhuman hours and go way beyond out of his way to make a customer happy.) The ugly truth is when your contracted by a big corporation, as we have been, you learn quickly that corporations don't care for clean readable code, programmer happiness, best practice or maintainability.. And they will call you on weekends.. At 3AM.. with 1 weeks worth of work they need for a meeting at 7AM!   1. How much pressure is normal for a programmer?   2. How much pressure should a programmer be under?
