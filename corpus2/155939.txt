I was told that in order to support AES256 encryption inside my Java app that I would need the JCE with Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files. I downloaded this from Oracle and unzipped it and I'm only seeing 2 JARs:   * `local_policy.jar`; and   * `US_export_polic.jar` I just want to confirm I'm not missing anything here! My understanding (after reading the `README.txt`) is that I just drop these two into my `<JAVA_HOME>/lib/security/` directory and they should be installed. By the names of these JARs I have to assume that its not the Java Crypto API that cannot handle AES256, but it's in fact a **legal** issue, perhaps? And that these two JARs basically tell the JRE " _yes, it's legally-acceptable to run this level of crypto (AES256)._ " Am I correct or off-base?
