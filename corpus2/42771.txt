I have a large table of triplets whose structure is:               list=Table[{a,b, RandomReal[]}, {a,1,100}, {b,1,100}]      I would like to search through the list by looking for the closest entry labeled by `{a,b}` to a given input `{x,y}` and return the associated third item in the triplet. To give an example, if I have               {x, y} = {10.2, 5.1}      I would like to return the triplet               {10, 5, c}      Where `c` is the associated random real in the table. I have tried using `Nearest`, but the structure of the table does not seem compatible with search.
