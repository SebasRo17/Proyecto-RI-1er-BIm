The book "Data Structures in C" (Horowitz and Sahni) suggests that in the following code the pointer pf is behaving as a dangling reference:               float f,*pf;     pf=(float*) malloc(sizeof(float));     *pf=2.6;     pf=(float*) malloc(sizeof(float));      The reasoning they give is that after the last line there is no way to retrieve the storage in which 2.6 was stored. However, wikipedia defines a dangling pointer as               Dangling pointers and wild pointers in computer programming are pointers that do not point to a valid object of the appropriate type      In the code above pf does not satisfy that definition - it points to a valid object of appropriate type. Is pf a dangling pointer, or something else?
