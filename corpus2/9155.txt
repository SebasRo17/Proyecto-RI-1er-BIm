I want to use MathLink to call a function I wrote in C. However, similar to an integrator, it takes a function pointer as an argument and applies it on numbers depending on the other arguments. I know how to pass lists of reals and so on, but can you also pass pointers to functions defined in Mathematica? In the end, it should look something like this:               f[x_,y_] := x*y; Install["mycprogram"]; MyCFunction[f,1,2]      `f` is a function that takes two doubles and returns a double. It's fairly simple and should always be some combination of polynomials, fractions, `Log` and `Exp`.
