I am obsessed with good code practices, clean code and most of all secure. I often find myself searching for the best way to do something, constantly asking for code review and looking for ways to improve my code. In practice I can manage (been doing PHP for a couple of months) but the theoretical part is my weak spot. I know what most of the concepts mean, I understand them but if someone would ask me to explain something I often find it difficult. This means that if I were to look for a job and the interviewer would ask me questions, they would immediately think I don't know much about the subject. Is this going to be a big disadvantage for me? Should I seriously start to learn the theoretical part more?
