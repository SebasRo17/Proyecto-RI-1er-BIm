## Background: This question came to mind after I ignorantly came to the conclusion that I was driven to go into game development, because it is the only place I can do creative development without the hinderance of clients wanting things tweaked, or security needing to be extreme, or deadlines pushing away research. I'm not talking about all cases, I'm talking about "in the end", where I've found my "final" kind of job. Game development I speak of here is indie development, where original intuitive design is important. As far as I know, this form of game development is the only way a person with only a bachelors can do research level development [AI, original UI (like voice commands / NLP), advanced graphical development]. With a phD I understand i could do any research, but I'm still unsure that is the path I wish to take. ## Question: What type of jobs or industry can allow someone with only a bachelors degree to do virtually unhindered creative research and development? This is subjective, so I'm mainly looking for opinions and RL accounts.
