If you `Solve` an equation, you obtain _all_ solutions. But If you `NMinimize` a function, you only get one minimum. The question is: is there a way to obtain all minima of a given function? Example:               Solve[((x - 2) (x + 2))^2 == 0, x]     Print["____________"]     NMinimize[((x - 2) (x + 2))^2, x]     NMinimize[ {((x - 2) (x + 2))^2, x >= 0}, x]      yields               {{x -> -2}, {x -> -2}, {x -> 2}, {x -> 2}}     ____________     {0., {x -> -2.}}     {0., {x -> 2.}}      You can see that for `Solve` you obtain all solutions, even with their multiplicity, but in the minimization, you only obtain one solution.
