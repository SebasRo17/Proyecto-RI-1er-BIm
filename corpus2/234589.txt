### Background I am coding two closely related Java projects. The first project is Single Facility Simulator, which simulates a very simple supply chain with a single facility. The second project is Supply Chain Simulator, which simulates more complex supply chain networks, i.e. multiple facilities arranged as a graph with directed edges between some pairs of facilities. The first project is a "toy" project in the sense that I am using it to test and refine the high-level design of the project. The second project is the "real" project that I am interested in for work purposes. The high-level design of the two projects is the same, although there are some differences, for example a `Demand` object in the "toy" project only needs to generate a demand value per time period, whereas a `Demand` object in the "real" project needs to generate a demand value per facility per time period. ### Question Currently, the "toy" project lives in its own Git repository. As I begin implementing the "real" project, should I fork the "toy" project, or should I implement the "real" project as different packages in the same space as the "toy" project?
