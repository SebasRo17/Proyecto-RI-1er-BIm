Not sure if this is the correct place for this question or SO - mods please move if necessary. I am going to have a go at creating GoL over the weekend as a little test project : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life I understand the algorithm, however I just wanted to check regarding the implementation, from maybe somebody that has tried it. Essentially, my first (basic) implementation, will be a static grid at a set speed. If I understand correctly, these are the steps I will need:   1. Initial seed   2. Create 2d array with initial set up   3. Foreach iteration, create temporary array, calculating each cells new state based on the Game of Life algorithm   4. Assign temp array to proper array.   5. Redraw grid from proper array. My concerns are over speed. When I am populating the grid from the array, would it simply be a case of looping through the array, assigning on or off to each grid cell and then redraw the grid? Am I on the correct path?
