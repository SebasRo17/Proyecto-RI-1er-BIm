Recently, I posted the following question on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7197337/using-asp-net-membership-provider- with-an-existing-user-database As you may notice, I ended up answering my own question stating that it looked like writting/implementing a "Custom Membership Provider" was the way to go. Literally, a few minutes later, I stumble across this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7222306/simple-login-attempt-counter-using- mvc-3-and-ajax/7222407#7222407 I try to answer and get a comment back that .Net Membership provider is "terrible on many levels". I'll admit, this is the first time I'm using Membership provider but it sure looked slick to me. I haven't seen anything that backs up the "terrible" claim so before I implement something "terrible", I was hoping to get some feedback from the community.
