I wish to plot a function and add a red, horizontal grid line at the height of the Euler-Masheroni constant. I am successful in ploting the line at Exp[EulerGamma], but I am having difficulties with getting it red Code:               ListLinePlot[robinplot, PlotRange -> All, GridLines -> {{}, {Exp[EulerGamma]}}]      I have used this code but it only makes my robinplot red:                ListLinePlot[robinplot, PlotRange -> All, GridLines -> {{}, {Exp[EulerGamma]}}, PlotStyle->{Red}].      How can I get a red line at height Exp[EulerGamma]?
