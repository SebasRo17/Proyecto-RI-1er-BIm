How do I correctly sub-license a library that is under the MIT license. I am using and extending the library. The MIT license states that I am free to sub-license the library. Can I simply state:               <Software library> is copyright <original author> and licensed under the MIT license.          <orignal license>          Extensions to <Software library> are copyright <me> and licensed under the GPL license,      or commercial license if applicable.          <GPL, or commercial license>
