Recently some people said that I was wrong when I explained why one cannot insert a `Number` object into a list declared as `List<? super RationalNumber>`. (This assumes that `RationalNumber` is a subclass of `Number`) My explanation was that in `List<? super RationalNumber>` the `<? super RationalNumber>` stands for an unknown super class of `RationalNumber`. This means that `<? super RationalNumber>` indicates that a valid object for `List<? super RationalNumber>` is an object that extends an unknown super class of `RationalNumber`. Since an unknown super class of `RationalNumber` is really unknown (e.g. it can be an interface `X` instead of `Number`), there is not guarantee that `Number` is a sub-class of `X` i.e. implements `X`, so `Number` is not a valid substitution of `<? super RationalNumber>`. What is wrong with this explanation? Edit: Note that I am asking for what wrong with the way I explain, my explanation. Not another explanation for the original question. Thanks.
