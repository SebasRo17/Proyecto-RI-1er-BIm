When they ask you to choose the programming language you are comfortable with **before** an interview, is it to ask questions about the programming language or to check how well you code in it? Like for example, if I don't know what `iterator`s are in Python but I'm comfortable with Python because of its in-built facilities, should I use Python or not? I might have studied everything about Haskell for ages but it takes me longer to write code in Haskell (imagine writing an AVL tree in Haskell). Is Haskell a good choice then?
