I am looking to find the the average path length of 1000 random graphs with the following degree distribution, a few of the vertex degrees are included below               {2, 12, 5, 1, 12, 3, 6, 4, 2, 6, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 7, 9}      Now, I have done this with finding the mean global clustering coefficient in a very straightforward way:               Mean[GlobalClusteringCoefficient /@         RandomGraph[         DegreeGraphDistribution[           {2, 12, 5, 1, 12, 3, 6, 4, 2, 6, 3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 7, 9}],          10000]]      This did the job quite well for `GlobalClusteringCoefficient`, but is there a way to do this to get the average path length of all 10000 random graphs? My intuition was using `GraphDistance`, but it only works as a per vertex basis -- for it to work, it needs a complete graph or else it calculates the distance as infinity.
