I am writing a small game where a sea vessel (like a battleship) can be moved in a 2D place based on orders that it receives. I wanted to know if someone can help direct me to a post or example code that will help me move a ship from one location to another based on the speed and new vector. So, if I had a ship that is moving in a south westerly direction (say 120 degrees) and it receives new orders to turn to a new vector of 020 degrees, how can I calculate the turn. I don't want it to just turn on a dime and head in the new direction. I want it to make the wide turn (as if it were in water) and then when it reaches the new vector, start heading in that direction. Any help would be appreciated.
