When looking for candidates you often want to have people with direct experience with the technologies and platforms you are using today. However, that may not always be a possibility. The particular requirements may involve niche tech, outdated tech, or your team has already drained the local area of everyone with that particular tech (not everyone works in Silicon Valley, some of us work and live in some smaller metro area for reasons unrelated to the profession). So often that can leave you with hiring people who are "off-platform" like Dot-Net people for a Java project, or Cobol programmers for an iPhone app (or vice versa). Or even just a language switch, from Visual Basic to Scala or JavaScript to C. My question is what qualities, attributes, and experience would you look for as in interviewer to indicate that the candidate can successfully switch platforms or languages, and what are the indicators as to the level of success and timeframe. Also, decent "war stories" related to this would get a solid upvote from me.
