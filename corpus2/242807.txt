URL is an URI which identifies a resource by location. _Resource representation_ is a view of resource's state. This view is encoded in one or more transferable formats, such as XHTML, Atom, XML, MP3 ... URIs associate resource representations with their resources a) So I assume URI identifies a _resource_ and not _resource representation_? b) I've read that relationship between an URI and _resource representation_ is _one to many_. Assuming we're talking about URL, how can a single URL address more than one _resource representation_? thank you
