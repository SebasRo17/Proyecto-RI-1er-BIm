I have _Mathematica_ code split into two notebooks. The first part is supposed to run and output a list of numbers into a text file, using `Export`. The second part uses `ReadList` to read numbers from the text file, into a list. I don't like having to convert the list into text and then convert it back to a list. Is there any other way of exporting data which might make it faster for _Mathematica_ to import it again as a list? Edit: Suppose the list output from the second notebook has variables and numbers, is storing the result in a text file still ok? For such a case, here is an example of the output list (the way it looks on the text file):               {1}     {75 + 2*Subscript[x, 10] + Subscript[x, 11]}     {-201 - 4*Subscript[x, 10] - 3*Subscript[x, 11] + Subscript[x, 12]}     {157 + 2*Subscript[x, 10] + 3*Subscript[x, 11] - 3*Subscript[x, 12] + Subscript[x, 13]}     {-Subscript[x, 11] + 3*Subscript[x, 12] - 3*Subscript[x, 13] + 10*Subscript[x, 14]}     {-Subscript[x, 12] + 3*Subscript[x, 13] - 12*Subscript[x, 14]}     {-Subscript[x, 13] + 2*Subscript[x, 14]}      If I need to store expressions, which output format is more apt ?
