I am considering the creation of a fork to a small project licensed under GPLv2, and I have some very specific questions I did not manage to answer in my research on various sites and foras. When I fork the code, I am forced to release the new project under the same license (GPL) as I will do, but could I also decide to release it under a dual license, one of them commercial? When forking the project, do I automatically own the copyright of the whole thing? This is relevant when, for example, deciding a future change in the license, or to be able to enforce the GPL license to a 3rd party Thanks!
