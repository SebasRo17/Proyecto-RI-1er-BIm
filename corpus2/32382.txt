I have to plot the line 1 + 4 t, 2 + 5 t, 1 + 12 t and the polygon with points {2, 3, 4}, {1, 4, 5}, {3, 3, 3} in the same graph to see if the line goes through the polygon. I was able to get them to plot separately but I cannot get them to plot together. This is what I typed in:               pic1 = ParametricPlot3D[{1 + 4 t, 2 + 5 t, 1 + 12 t}, {t, 0, 12}];     pic2 = p = Polygon[{{2, 3, 4}, {1, 4, 5}, {3, 3, 3}}]     {Graphics3D[{Pink, p}]}     Show[pic1, pic2, PlotRange -> Automatic]      But I get the error: > Coordinate {Skeleton[3]} should be a triple of numbers, or a Scaled form. How do I fix this?
