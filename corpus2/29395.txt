There are several test suites referenced at csrc.nist.gov designed to test a (pseudo-)random byte sequence for randomness, and discover possible skews, correlations, patterns, or other hidden non-randomness in it. Are there implementations of any of them or other similar test suites in _Mathematica_? Or some precompiled libraries (including _Java_ or _.NET_ modules) that can be invoked from _Mathematica_ running on _Windows_?
