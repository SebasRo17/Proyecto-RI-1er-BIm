I'm currently a student going to an 8 month internship this January after my first year of studies and I'm planning on expanding my programming skills maybe during weekends or weeknights. For around 2-3 years, I've been learning as much as I could just because I enjoyed programming so much when I started 2 years ago. Some things I know include:   * source control   * Java   * Python   * C   * C++   * Bash   * Linux The problem is that I only know the basics of the above, nothing in depth (except Java) and I'm wondering what would benefit me more in the future when I finish my studies. Should I learn something new? (I've been wanting to take a crack at SICP) Or should I expand on something that I know right now (I enjoy programming low level) and build something useful and big? FWIW, I'm going to use Java(JSP, servlets) and SQL for my internship.
