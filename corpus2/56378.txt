I'm trying to find the minimum length of a confidence interval for the variance from a sample iid with normal distribution. I tried               Solve[      CDF[ChiSquareDistribution[n - 1], (n - 1)/k1] -         CDF[ChiSquareDistribution[n - 1], (n - 1)/k2] == 0.95 &&         (n - 1)/(2*k1) - (n - 1)/(2*k2) == (n/2 - 3)*Log[k1/k2], {k1, k2}]      When running the command I get: > Solve::inex: Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients > or the system obtained by direct rationalization of inexact numbers present > in the system. Since many of the methods used by Solve require exact input, > providing Solve with an exact version of the system may help. Is there a way to make this work?
