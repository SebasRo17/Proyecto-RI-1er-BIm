We know that Mathematic doesn't natively support Windows Authentication connect. But as we can see in this post, the problem can be easily solved when your Mathematica is in Windows version (I have just made it). The company that I work is now changing to Windows Authentication, and the problem is that I use both **Mac** and Windows. ## Question: There is someway that I could connect into SQL Server database using Windows Authentication from my Mac Mathematica? So I could pass my Windows Domain/User and Password together with the jDBC connections string? PS: I don't want to use Windows version of Mathematica in my Mac by Parallels, this will be my last shot.
