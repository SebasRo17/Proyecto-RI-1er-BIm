I with 2 other friends are new to web development. We are learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and are creating simple websites to get a feel of different things. And as HTML is only a markup and not a programming language we have very different styles evolving. I mean whenever we look at each other's code, we tend to put a good amount of time in understanding why the other one does that. Now we want to build a larger website together and my question is- Is that a problem having very different styles in a team for web development(specifically)?
