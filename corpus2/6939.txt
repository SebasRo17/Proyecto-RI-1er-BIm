Does mathematica support MDS? Or, are there any libraries that support it? Basically, I have points and a distance function defined between them, and I want to plot them in 2D space, trying to minimize the error (stress) in the distance. This is what MDS does. R has support for MDS, but I can't find similar methods in Mathematica, which I think is strange because this seems like a really common thing to want to do...
