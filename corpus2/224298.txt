My team uses Mercurial for version control. Our development / version control routine is:   1. all been committing to the same branch   2. pulling for changes and rebasing our commits locally before pushing back to the hosted repository This keeps everyone in sync. And the latest code (even unfinished code) is than grabbed from the tip of this branch and put into our test environment. I've been tasked with creating a management process where we can more cleanly extract "completed features" into the test environment. I've advocated that we begin to `branch->pull-request->merge->close branch` process, but I've been told that `branching` is not an option, and that the project director would prefer too be able to _manually select commits representing completed features/bug fixes_ and only include those commits in a deployment to testing. I am not sure what terminology besides `cherry-pick` in GIT / HG that would represent this process, and if it would even be advisable as the commits would no-longer have a proper revision history as it's my understanding that `cherry-pick` just pulls changes into the current working tree as uncommitted changes _correct_?
