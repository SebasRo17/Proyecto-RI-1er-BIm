I've been working in this new company for almost half a year now and I'm beginning to realize that I made a terrible mistake when I proposed my salary. This is my first "real" job, previously I've been working freelance, and for a short amount of time for a small local IT company. When I moved here, I wasn't sure how much was I supposed to ask for. I did a lot of research and settled on amount about 20% higher than an average developers' starting salary in my country. Now I'm attending interviews (as a trainee so far) and I got to learn something more about salary capabilities of my employer. I learned that almost twice as much as I make would be "acceptable". That's because the company was started by an American fellow, and while we are based in a less wealthy country, more generous pay is acceptable. Additionally, I saw that I'm a better programmer than I thought I was (based on comparing my performance with others and reviews by others). I already did one thing towards this: some time after a new guy came in to work with me (paid the same as me), I realised that I'm clearly a better developer and I boldly asked for a raise (which I got, after being lectured that raises only happen during reviews). What do I do here? I'm at a loss.
