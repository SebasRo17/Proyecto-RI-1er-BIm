I'm attempting to use NDSolve on a 2D boundary value problem with initial conditions. Upon running my code, I get the following message: _"NDSolve::ibcinc: Warning: Boundary and initial conditions are inconsistent."_ After much head-scratching, I can't seem to find my mistake. It seems to me that my initial condition is consistent with my boundary conditions:               k = 1 / (5*(Pi^2));     soln = NDSolve[       {       (* PDE *)       D[u[x, y, t], t] == k*(D[u[x, y, t], x, x] + D[u[x, y, t], y, y]),            (* initial condition *)       u[x, y, 0] == y + Cos[Pi*x] Sin[2*Pi*y],            (* boundary conditions *)       u[x, 0, t] == 0,       u[x, 1, t] == 1,       (D[u[x, y, t], x] /. x -> 0) == 0,       (D[u[x, y, t], x] /. x -> 1) == 0       },      u,      {x, 0, 1},      {y, 0, 1},      {t, 0, 1}      ]      Any advice is greatly appreciated, Rick
