I am new to JavaEE and am faced with a tight situation here. I have to develop a Java application for (CRUD) handling records and saving and loading an XML concerning that record. Obviously, I won't be asking you to do this for me. What I would be asking you is to give me some hints/pointer. Initially I thought JAXB would be enough for this but after putting a lot of time learning it and implementing the program I realized that it just can create the XML and read it but for update, delete I would have to do something else. Even if it wasn't for update and delete features requirement for my project I would still think that by just using JAXB is not a good implementation. I was wondering if "REST with Java (JAX-RS) using Jersey" should do the trick for me. ?
