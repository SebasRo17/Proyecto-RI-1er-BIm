I'm new to the programming world and also a little bit confused. My brother would like to work with me on some program. I'm a graphic designer so he asked me for UI and all it's elements. I would really help him as much as it's possible so I have found Expression Blend for Visual Studio. At first it looked great but after few minutes I've started to understand that I totally don't know What to do with my project. Lets assume that I have already made an Interface. Even made in Blend. Now, how can I give it to him so he could implement the UI? How to export and how to give it to him. For example, He works on separate PC and I need to export the project and give it to him for implementation. I know everything about Graphic Design but nothing about coding. I know that he uses Visual Studio :) I have been working in a web company so my workflow was very easy. It was only to send well prepared PSD file. With Blend I don't know what's next after the design part is finished.
