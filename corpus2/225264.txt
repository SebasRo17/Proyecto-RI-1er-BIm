I like to learn everything about computer technologies, but if you look at the popular list of tags of StackOverflow for example: ![Stack Overflow popular tags](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yfbDk.png) There's no way on earth i'm ever going to understand them all. I more or less know what each is about (except for ruby-on-rails, ajax, javascript, php and jquery), but I don't know the _details_ , although I'd like to, **just to have an idea of how it works and what it is useful for**. So I think, "let's narrow it down". I'm interested in web development, but I don't work in this, so I need to learn on my free time. However, if you go this post How to Get Started with Web Development You'll see that people suggest a **huge** number of technologies: PHP, JavaScript, MySWL, DJango, Ruby, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, jQuery And... well, I don't even know what each technology is about, or even **how they relate to each other**. (Why do people suggest using PHP + MySQL all the time?) So my question is this: given a particular topic ("web development" for example), and given a particular problem, or maybe just an _idea_ ("I want to build a website that asks anonymous users for input and then let other users rate that input" for example), how do I get started? How do I know what technology is best for my problem? I can't just start with, say, PHP, and then realise midway "oh wait, this technology is useless for my problem".
