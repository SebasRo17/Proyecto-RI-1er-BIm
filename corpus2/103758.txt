I spend a fair amount of time reading programming blogs, and it seems to be a popular belief that having business knowledge adds value to a programmer. I can see the reasoning for this:   * Understanding the business helps programmers make wise decisions   * Might encourage less "taking too long making everything perfect" and more "getting things done"   * etc. I'm currently an intern at a major company. I've learned loads of great technical things during my time here and I've definitely developed as a programmer. However, I feel like I don't understand my team's place in the ecosystem as well as I understand the technical stuff I'm actually doing. To remedy this problem, I'm planning a meeting with my manager. This seems like a great opportunity to learn about my company/team and become a more valuable contributor. I'm trying to come up with a list of questions to ask. So far I'm thinking of things like:   * Who are all of our customers?   * Could you describe our company's relationship with other companies? I want to make the most of this time to learn about the company and my team's role in it. So, what "business aspects" of my team are most important for me to learn about? What kinds of things should I ask about? Notes about my team:     * Much of my team's work is for internal use in the company   * Not a "customer oriented" team in that sense, though our customers are other teams in the company   * Much of my team's work consists of enhancing tools (adding features rather than developing whole new products) p.s - this question is similar to this question, but is different in the sense that I'm not asking what I need to know about business in general, but what I should learn about my specific company and team
