I'm new to git. I'm using a development platform called automation studio. This development tool creates all sorts of files and directories which it needs to maintain runtime and IO information for the target processor. These informations are specific for each project. Therefore these file should not be under version control because they are provided and maintainded by the platform. Otherwise one cannot run the automation studio without these files. I put the names of these files and directories in an .gitignore file. Then I cloned myrepository to a bare repository on a server. Then I cloned back to mynewrepository on my local machine. Unfortunatedly in mynewrepository all files and directories listed in .gitignore were missing. Therefore the automation studio platform failed to work. How can I exclude these files and the content of these directories from versioning but keep the them all in the repository in order to clone back a fully working project for automation studio?
