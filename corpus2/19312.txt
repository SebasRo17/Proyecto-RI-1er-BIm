I am trying to make a chart where the x-axis has a log scale and the y-axis is in reverse order. I tried to use `LogLinearPlot`, and I tried to combine it with `ScalingFunctions`. My code was:               LogLinearPlot[1/x, {x, 1, 1000}, ScalingFunctions->"Reverse"]      But this failed. So I tried using `Plot` and `ScalingFunctions`:               Plot[1/x, {x, 1, 1000}, ScalingFunctions -> {"Log", "Reverse"}]      That gave me an error as well. I noticed that `ScalingFunctions` works just fine when applied to the y-axis, as in:               Plot[1/x, {x, 1, 1000}, ScalingFunctions -> "Log"]     Plot[1/x, {x, 1, 1000}, ScalingFunctions->"Reverse"]      However, when I apply `ScalingFunctions` to the x-axis, it will give an error; for example:               Plot[1/x, {x, 1, 1000}, ScalingFunctions -> {"Log", Identity}]      Can anyone tell me what to do to get a reversed y-axis and a logarithmic x-axis at the same time?
