I am working on a Java application, and I see that Run time exceptions are handled in many places. For example,                      try {                            //do something                  }catch(NullPointerException e){                      return null;                 }      My questions is, when is it a good practice to handle Runtime exceptions? When should exceptions be left unhandled?
