The developers of the Dart language tell that there is a virtual machine that executes statements written in Dart language. What is the difference between an interpreter and a virtual machine that executes a language? Until now the virtual machines that I knew, like Java Virtual Machine, Common Language Runtime, and Dalvik all execute bytecode that has been previously compiled from a programming language. How does it work a virual machine that executes directly a programming language?
