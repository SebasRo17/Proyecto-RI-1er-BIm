If your following the standard DVCS methodology of having a production branch and a development branch, I'm really interested in what do you do with the default (mercurial) or master (git) branch?   * Do you delete it (not recommended by several guides)?    * Do you use it as production?    * Do you use it as development?    * Or do you leave it empty and have separate dev and production branches? Note: I'm really interested in Mercurial specifically, but any other DVCS or just general rules would be ok
