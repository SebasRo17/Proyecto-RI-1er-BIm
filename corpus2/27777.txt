I would like to make the edges and vertices of a `Graph` interactive, a simple demonstration is to change their colors:               DynamicModule[{col = Green},      Dynamic@Graph[{         EventHandler[          Style[1, col],             {"MouseClicked" :> (col = col /. {Red -> Green, Green -> Red})}],         2, 3, 4, 5},        {1 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 4,         EventHandler[          Style[2 -> 5, col],             {"MouseClicked" :> (col = col /. {Red -> Green, Green -> Red})}]         }]]      The above code generates a graph that has two clickable objects (one edge, one vertex) however they both change color when one of the objects is clicked. I suspected this is due to my `EventHandler` code and the events would trigger whenever the **Graph** is clicked. The color change event is not thrown, however, if one of the other edges/vertices is clicked so I'm a bit stuck. As an aside, I used `Rule` instead of `DirectedEdge` which seems to work although I don't know if this is the _right_ way to make a graph.
