I ask this from everyone's perspective. If you are in America and you outsource to offshore programmers, are you disloyal to your countrymen? If you are in India and you outsource to offshore programmers, are you disloyal to your countrymen? This question applies to all programmers and people in a position to hire programmers. I happen to be American, and so for me this means outsourcing to other countries like India and Mexico. With unemployment so high here at home, am I being disloyal to my fellow programmers, my countrymen, by outsourcing to other countries? This is a real dillema for me. Yes, either way I am providing for someone's family (either the American's or the Indian's). But if I outsource to offshore programmers, am I contributing to the problems here at home? As my business grows, hiring questions like this are becoming more urgent for me to figure out. I want to do the right thing. Also note that this question is _NOT_ asking "Is outsourcing effective". This question is "all things being equally effective, is it disloyal" . . . Also note that disloyal might not be the best word, but you get my meaning. Feel free to edit or make suggestions to make this question better.
