I understand how (in theory) to get images to be a specific size in inches, but when I follow the documentation, all of my output seems to be scaled down by a factor of a bit less than 70% (e.g., `ImageSize -> 72x8` gives an image size of about 5.5 inches rather than 8). How do I ensure that my images print at a specified size in inches? Are there settings or additional options beyond those described in the documentation for `ImageSize` that I need to use? * * * In context, what I'm trying to do is print a generated graphic from within a Manipulate using a button using               Button["Print",  NotebookPrint[pat]]      or perhaps something like               Button["Print", NotebookPrint[Show[pat, ImageSize -> 72 patzise]]]      and I'd ideally like to apply whatever settings are needed to get a properly sized output, without messing with global or notebook level settings.
