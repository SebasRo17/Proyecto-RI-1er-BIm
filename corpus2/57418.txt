Basically, I have a very good knowledge of plain old SQL coming from Classic ASP programming. Over the past couple of months, I have been learning C# and today was my first full day at MVC 3 (Razor) which I am loving! I need to get back in to Databases and I know that writing SqlCommand everywhere is obviously outdated (although it is nice I can still do it!). I used to go to a great usergroup as an IT Pro and the developer stuff went completely over my head, however I do remember a few things which kept coming up such as LINQ... However, that was some time ago and now the same people on Twitter are saying how out dated it is. I have tried to do research on both and I am clueless as to what direction I should go in, or when to use one over another (if learning both is a good thing). I am more so confused as I thought EF was a part of the .Net Framework, however, reading through the quick start guide, I had to download a component using Nuget. ... Basically I am out of my depth here and just need some honest advice of where to go!
