I have a 3d plot with oddly angled tick marks. Whether it's due to the viewing angle being unexpected or some other reason, the tick marks on the bottom axes are angled up along the sides rather than in to the plane. In order to fix this, I'd like to manually change the tick angle back to what it should be, but I can't find the setting that controls tick direction. Any help? Edit: Here is a simple example that illustrates the problem: suppose I plot               Plot3D[x + y, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      At first, the tick marks on the x and y axes are in the x-y plane. However, if I rotate the point of view, I fairly quickly (around `ViewPoint -> {2.22811, -2.31877, 1.05302}`) find that the ticks switch from being in the x-y plane to pointing up along the z axis. I want to stop it from doing that, so that the ticks stay in the x-y plane for other choices of ViewPoint. This really seems like the sort of thing there ought to be a setting for.
