I am just graduating from a computer science degree (tomorrow is my last exam). I have been thinking about job hunting this semester but I wanted to focus on my studies and part time job so I am a bit late on the job hunt. I want to find a job in a city that I have very little professional network in. **How would you go about job hunting in a new city?** I do not live there yet and I cannot easy go there so that makes finding places to apply a bit trickier. Normally I would ask people that I studied and worked with but I have few contacts in the city I want to work in. Where would you look to find jobs? I have been using   * Craigs-list   * My Universities job listings (but they are mostly focused on the east coast)   * This government job listing page Anyone have any great job finding resources?
