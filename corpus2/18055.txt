I simulate a simple experiment, a coin flip. What I do is accumulate the mean of the results up to the i-th experiment. What I can't figure out is why the computed means do not asymptotically approach 1/2. What did I do wrong? The code:               n = 10^4;     c = Table[{i, RandomInteger[]}, {i, 1, n}];     s = 0;     m = {};     For[i = 1, i <= n, i++,       s += c[[i, 2]];       AppendTo[m, {i, N[s/i]}];     ]
