I feared programs that require installation a lot. They leave traces behind the registry even after un-installation, plus, some uninstallers are poorly- programmed (that means, some programs cannot be uninstalled). That applies to Windows. The good side of installers, they create shortcuts and file associations. However, the Komodo on Linux uses a shell script to setup and can be safely uninstalled by deleting the folder. Do you think installers should be all abolished? Do you think the effect of installations should be replaced by shell scripts? Do you think all computer games should be portable? Should the "scan the /Applications/${AppName}/Information folder and list app icons" design should be used for future desktop environments?
