I have been working on freelance sites for a good 4 or 5 years, bending over backwards to build a decent portfolio and generate great ratings. I take huge pride in my work (web applications). I'm completely lost because when I think what would happen if I suddenly lost my freelance account it isn't a pretty picture. I have literally no idea where else I could advertise my services apart from google paid advertising. Any suggestions? I'd of course be more than willing to pay for marketing and such. I've been searching google for ages and can't find much advice on where to advertise to secure good clients for web development work. I say good clients because I mean actual business owners, not somebody else who is outsourcing to me (where do they find clients?). I'd appreciate any help.
