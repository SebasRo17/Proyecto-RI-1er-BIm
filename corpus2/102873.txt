I'm just coming into my final year of university so I'm going to start looking for jobs as a software developer and I just wanted to know just how important it is to be able to design good looking interfaces and produce good quality content in a software development job? I'm only asking because I struggle to be creative due to my dyslexia but If given a design to do (i.e. a picture or description of some sort) I am able to do it to a high standard, Will this affect my career options?
