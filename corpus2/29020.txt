I would like to define a function based on the output of the following DSolve call: `DSolve[{b Varx^2 - 2 b Varx x'[t] + b x'[t]^2 + m x''[t] == 0, x[0] == x0, x'[0] == V0x}, x[t], t]` I've tried to do the following: `x[t_] := DSolve[{b Varx^2 - 2 b Varx x'[t] + b x'[t]^2 + m x''[t] == 0, x[0] == x0, x'[0] == V0x}, x[t], t]` It showed the message: `$RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 256 exceeded.`, so I believe I'm not doing it the right. Any ideas?
