I have a small toy script in Mathematica that I am trying to use to evaluate the pdf of $Y$ where $Y=X^2$, and $X$ is uniformly distributed in $[0,a]$. The script is,               assum = {a > 0};      Subscript[P, X][x_] := If[Inequality[0, Less, x, LessEqual, a], 1/a, 0];          Y[x_] := x^2          Subscript[F, Y][y_] := Integrate[If[Y[x] <= y, 1, 0]*Subscript[P, X][x],         {x, -Infinity, Infinity}]          Subscript[P, Y][y_] := D[Subscript[F, Y][y], y]      It shows the correct form of the pdf:               In[192]:=     Simplify[Subscript[P, Y][y], assum]          Out[192]=     Piecewise[{{1/(2*a*Sqrt[y]), y > 0 && a^2 >= y}}, 0]      However, it doesn't evaluate the expression correctly:               In[194]:=     Simplify[Subscript[P, Y][a*(a/2)], assum]          During evaluation of In[194]:= General::ivar:a^2/2 is not a valid variable. >>          Out[194]=     D[1/Sqrt[2], a^2/2]      The session, in pretty printing looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i1Wqj.png)
