I do thank you Vitaly and Celtschk. I should have disclosed my ultimate goal earlier so as to receive the best help.While the previous suggestions were very helpful, I think I realize I ill-posed the question earlier I am trying to find the values of A and B that will maximize function f on the domain `{x,0,100},{y,0,100}`. I have had trouble using Maximize or NMaximize, etc. So I am trying to find x and y in terms of A and B, which will maximize the function. this function f has two parameters A and B in it with constraints such that $ 0< A < 100 $ and $A < B \le 100$. My actual function is: Mathematica Input: * * * (B^3 - B^2 (x + y) + x (A^2 - y^2 + A (-x + y)) + B (x^2 + x y + y^2 - A (x + y)))/(A - B)^2 * * * $$ (B^3 - B^2 (x + y) + x (A^2 - y^2 + A (-x + y)) + B (x^2 + x y + y^2 - A (x + y)))/(A - B)^2\bigl) $$
