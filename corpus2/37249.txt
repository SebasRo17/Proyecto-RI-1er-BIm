I wonder if there is any simple way to split a list into its disjoint sublists, e.g. from               list={{a,b},{e,f},{b,c},{c,d},{f,g,h}}      get a result               listdis={{{a,b},{b,c},{c,d}},{{e,f},{f,g,h}}},      so that one gets disjoint sublists such that any element can be connected with another element through other elements inside that list (like a disjoint chains of elements). Obviously sublists are of any length.
