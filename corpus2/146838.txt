I have to run certain number of statements (which are executing .exe) in a loop.                ForEach(object obj in ListOfVersions)         {           Step 1: call Exe1 Args=obj.somevalues           Log Step 1 completed for obj                Step 2: call Exe2 Args=obj.somevalues           Log Step 2 completed for obj                Step 3: call Exe3 Args=obj.somevalues           Log step 3 completed for obj         }          Step 4: call Exe4      Is there any specific design pattern available to use for above situation.
