I just have a simple Question: Should/could my boss decide/dictate what kind of IDE i should/must use for my development? Background: I have been developing software for 10 years, using diffent IDE's for diffrent languages. But, for the last years I have settled with using Eclipse. This is mostly because I use it both for Android (Java) and PHP and Web development. I know its not the newest, and does not got all the new cool features that other IDE's got, but I feel quite comfortable with it, and I specaially like the SVN plugin and Android tools it got. I'm kind of new in this company and the choice of IDE have always been my own decicions when working for other companies. My previous employers have never tried activly to change my choice of IDE. But, my new boss want me to change to something called PHPStorm, which I have tried, and found a bit to "busy" for me. It just got too much features for me. My boss says he don't want to force me, but uses every chance he got to mention the PHPStorm, and seems a little annoyed because I still use eclipse. That is the feeling I get. In my opinion, what kind of IDE I use is not "his table". It should be my personal choice. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm being arrogant ? It does not help that all other team members have moved to PHPStorm (away from intelliJ, netbeans, etc). My boss want "One-Ide-Too-Rule-Them-All". This way the code will become more consistent and we can learn from each-other he says. That said, I like my boss, so this is strictly a IDE issue. So, yes, I feel a bit annoyed about the situation. What do you think, how would you feel, what would you do in this situation ?
