I've encountered the following problem. There is the identity that the special functions `EllipticK[x]` and `EllipticE[x]` satisfy: $$K(x)E(1-x)+E(x)K(1-x)-K(x)K(1-x)=\frac{\pi}{2}$$ _Mathematica_ does not seem to know it so I included it into assumptions:               $Assumptions = EllipticK[x] EllipticE[1 - x] + EllipticE[x] EllipticK[1 - x] -                    EllipticK[x] EllipticK[1 - x] == Pi/2      If I now evaluate               Simplify[EllipticK[x] EllipticE[1 - x] + EllipticE[x] EllipticK[1 - x] -             EllipticK[x] EllipticK[1 - x]]      I will get `Pi/2`, fine. The problem is that I want this identity to be used not only symbolically but also numerically, i.e. for example I would like _Mathematica_ to simplify               Simplify[EllipticE[2/3] EllipticK[1/        3] + (EllipticE[1/3] - EllipticK[1/3]) EllipticK[2/3]]      down to `Pi/2`. Not only It does not happen when I just stated this identity symbolically but even direct evaluation with this assumption does not yield desirable answer. Namely,               FullSimplify[      EllipticE[2/3] EllipticK[1/         3] + (EllipticE[1/3] - EllipticK[1/3]) EllipticK[2/3],       Assumptions ->        EllipticE[2/3] EllipticK[1/           3] + (EllipticE[1/3] - EllipticK[1/3]) EllipticK[2/3] == Pi/2]      returns               EllipticE[2/3] EllipticK[1/        3] + (EllipticE[1/3] - EllipticK[1/3]) EllipticK[2/3]      How can I get `Pi/2` there instead?
