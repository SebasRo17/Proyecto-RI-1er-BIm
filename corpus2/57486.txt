I just noticed that MMA (8 and 10) in Windows 8 on my machine does not display the title of any palette. For ex. Basic Math Assistant palette appears without title. Same with user-defined palettes Can you confirm this or it is just my Win 8? If it is just me, as I suspect, can anybody suggest any setting change to Win 8 that I may perform in order to show titles in palettes? Titles in notebooks are ok.
