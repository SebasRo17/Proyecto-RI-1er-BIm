I am unable understand following error message: Coordinate index 0 is out of range for the enclosing GraphicsComplex. How to fix it? Attached data here: pts and polygons. See also end of question.                Graphics3D[GraphicsComplex[pts, Polygon@poly], Boxed -> False]      returns following error :                Coordinate index 0 is out of range for the enclosing GraphicsComplex.      Data:               pts={{0, 1, 2}, {1, 0, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {5, 4, 7}, {8, 9, 10}, {9, 8,        11}, {12, 13, 14}, {13, 12, 15}, {16, 17, 18}, {17, 16, 19}, {20,        21, 22}, {21, 20, 23}, {24, 25, 26}, {25, 24, 27}, {28, 29,        30}, {29, 28, 31}};          polys= {{0, 1, 2}, {1, 0, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {5, 4, 7}, {8, 9, 10}, {9, 8,        11}, {12, 13, 14}, {13, 12, 15}, {16, 17, 18}, {17, 16, 19}, {20,        21, 22}, {21, 20, 23}, {24, 25, 26}, {25, 24, 27}, {28, 29,        30}, {29, 28, 31}};
