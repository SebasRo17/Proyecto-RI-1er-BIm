I want to learn to program in a 'future-proof' manner, if you like. Whilst Windows dominates the desktop OS marketplace (for now), obviously there is a lot of value in learning its languages/frameworks/API's and so on - this might be subject to change as new devices emerge or Windows shoots itself in the foot (over-friendly previews of Windows 8 don't look too appealing...). Would I be right in thinking that having a solid knowledge of C/C++ for back- end logic/low level programming and the like, combined with an extremely portable language like Java for GUI's and so on, would be a good basis for software development that will prove useful on the most amount of systems? - I'm talking desktop PC's, tablets, phones.
