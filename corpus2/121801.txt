This question is in conjuction with **How would you approach developing a Hotel Reservation System?** The solution to a system with different interfaces (or clients I should say) is to go with developing a Web service and have other systems interact with it. I never had the requirement for developing a Web service so I am bit short on it. All I understand is that **A web service is a system or application that performs some operations which may include modifying, sending or receiving data over a network using HTTP protocol**. (Let me know if the understanding is wrong) Now, from the other question it's clearly understood that I need to develop a web service but I have no idea as to how should I go about it. My language of choice is C# and .NET Framework. **Question** : How do we develop a webservice and which tools, technology and framework should I use for the same using C# language? **Question** : How can I interact with this from a desktop WPF application, website and mobile app.
