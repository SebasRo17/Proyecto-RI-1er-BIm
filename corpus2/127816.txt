I'm trying to add a scheduling feature to my web scraping application that will let the user schedule scraping jobs so he can, for instance, perform a job every Monday, or every 2 hours or stuff like that. On one end, I could make a very simple scheduler that let you pick a specific date and time and pick a time interval that would indicate how often to execute the job starting at the specified date and time. So if, for instance, I pick Dec 31 at 2:00 pm and choose 1 day as my interval, the job would run every day at 2:00 pm starting Dec 31. But what if he wants to run the job every Saturday and Sunday, or three times a day on Sundays? On the other end, I could embed some kind of scripting language that will let the user use any logic he wants, but this would be overkill for me and for the user. He _doesn't_ need to run a job every day of the month that is prime number or anything like that. So this is a common sense question, not a programming one. How would you implement this, or, do you know any similar kind of scheduling job in any other kind of application? I looked at the scheduler in my antivirus but this one is extremely plain and simple.
