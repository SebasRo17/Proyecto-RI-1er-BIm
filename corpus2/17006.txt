All, I am looking for help to create a notebook to be executed via terminal in MAC OSX. The notebook uses the front end. This is what I have so far               #!/Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/Mathematica -script          UsingFrontEnd[NotebookEvaluate["/Users/MyFolder/MyFile.nb"]]      When I run the script in snow leopard Mathematica opens a new notebook containing the above code displayed in quotes, when run in lion I get a window saying the notebook cannot be opened. I will be very grateful to anyone who can point me in the right direction as to how to proceed. Many thanks
