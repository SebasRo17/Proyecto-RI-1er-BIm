I have               a["tree"] := "oak"     a["flower"] := "rose"     a["dog" | "cat"] := "animals"      I want that the last definition of `a` behaves differently like in               b[x_ /; x == "dog" || x == "cat"] := If[x == "dog", "wow", "miau"]      but want to do this with `a` Is there a way to write something like               a["dog" | "cat"] := If[ (* passed parameter *) == "dog", "wow", "miau"]
