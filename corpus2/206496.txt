I created login form. When user clicks on login button this form shows up with some fade effect (jQuery). What I want to do is to display error message in this form when user inputs invalid data. Before showing any messages, PHP must read data from database, therefore page must be reloaded and when page is reloaded this form fade away. How can I display error message in this login form without reloading page? (I have lots of code so if you need any part of code I will provide)
