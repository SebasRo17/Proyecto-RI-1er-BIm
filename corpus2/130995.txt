I want to make the step up from developer to enterprise architect. I have 13 years experience in various environments, from SME line of business apps to investment banking enterprise systems. I'm certified in a number of technologies, including Java/.NET/SQL. What should I focus on over the next 12 months that will hold some weight with potential employers and lend credibility to my application for an Enterprise Architecture role, absent experience? I am currently looking at TOGAF 9.1. Are there other competing or supplemental methodologies I should research?
