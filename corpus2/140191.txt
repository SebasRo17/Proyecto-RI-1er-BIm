I have 300-500 images and other files that my program uses. I realize I have two options:   1. Save them in a binary format such as BMP which is loaded dynamically.   2. Save them in a C source file such as XPM which allows it to be compiled into the program, but it also can be loaded dynamically. Assuming both are just as easy to implement and I don't require dynamic loading, what are benefits of each method? How would the loading/startup speed compare?
