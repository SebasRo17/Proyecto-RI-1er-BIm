Say I have a bunch of files with nearly same filename, eg. data_timestep1, data_timestep2, ... The data itself in one file is ({x1, y1, z1, absolute field value 1}, {x2, y2, z2, absolute field value 2}, ...), **ASCII table data format** Now I want to put all data from all timestep files into one single file in the form: ({x1, y1, z1, absolute field value 1, timestep1}, {x1, y1, z1, absolute field value 1, timestep2}...,{x2, y2, z2, absolute field value 2, timestep1}, {x2, y2, z2, absolute field value 2, timestep2}...,) so all vectors that belong to unique x, y, z position should be able to be read and sorted by the timestep value, to do FFT Thanks for your tips
