I have a very basic question. I am trying to code the LHS of the differential equation: $$\Big[\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\frac{d}{d\theta}\big(\sin\theta\frac{d}{d\theta}\big)-\frac{m^2}{\sin^2\theta}+n(n+1)\Big]f(\theta)=0$$ into _Mathematica_. As you can see, in the first term, the differential operator is nested and is to properly act on the function $f(\theta)$. I tried to use `#1`, but (lol) I don't know how to use it! This is what I have:               Sin[θ]^(-1) D[Sin[θ] D[#1, θ], θ] - m^2*#1/Sin[θ]^2 + n (n + 1) #1      What next?! **Also** : I don't want to just stick in `f[θ]` into where I have `#1`, because eventually I would like to be able to make change of variables!
