I would like the answer to explain what impact, if any, does the type of company/industry have on the rigor, depth and breadth with which software engineering is practiced. The best would be some links to support the answer with references. As a control point, let's declare an assumption that a company which follows the SWEBOK or CMMI (any level) is doing 100% (the best) whereas one which does not follow anything at all is 0% (worst). Would it be possible to find out what companies or what industries score highest, average, and lowest? **EDIT:** CMMI (any level) refers to any organization which is CMMI certified. **EDIT 2:** The middle paragraph specifies that a company which follows some rigorous software engineering standard should score higher than a company which doesn't. **EDIT 3:** The SWEBOK is not only organizing content. It does much more, i.e. the **SWEBOK characterizes the contents of software engineering body of knowledge**. The **SWEBOK promotes a consistent view of software engineering worldwide** which is the main point. It is aimed at both practitioners and academics, individuals and organizations. For example, see the CSDP and consider companies who hire them. These are the companies that follow the SWEBOK. **EDIT 4:** Note that the answer should tell us about industries or companies that follow some rigorous software engineering standard in the prescribed depth and breath, and those who don't. What is the correlation between the type of company/industry and their software engineering rigor? Throwing in a bunch of links for reference would be great.
