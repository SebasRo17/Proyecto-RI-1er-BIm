I want to scale the $x$ axis of the plot by $x^0$ and the $y$ axis by $\tan x$. Is this possible ?                Plot[Tan[x], {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> Automatic]      EDIT: Actually wanted to know that how to include the axes name like in the below picture mentioned by (x and y) and the curve whiched is defiend in the picture by $f(x)=x^2$? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qYMvu.gif)
