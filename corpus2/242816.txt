Apple launched its new programming language Swift at WWDC14. In the presentation, they made some performance comparisons between Objective-C and Python. The following is a picture of one of their slides, of a comparison of those three languages performing some complex object sort: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wcdXk.jpg) There was an even more incredible graph about a performance comparison using the RC4 encryption algorithm. Obviously this is a marketing talk, and they didn't go into detail on how this was implemented in each. I leaves me wondering though:   1. How can a new programming language be so much faster?    2. Are the Objective-C results caused by a bad compiler or is there something less efficient in Objective-C than Swift?    3. How would you explain a 40% performance increase? I understand that garbage collection/automated reference control might produce some additional overhead, but this much?
