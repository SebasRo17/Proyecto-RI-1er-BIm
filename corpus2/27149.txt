I've passed the last week searching a way to numerically integrate this multi- dimensional integral in the complex plane **at the poles and avoiding the singularity at z=0:** $$ \oint_{C}\oint_{C\ auound\ the\ poles\ only}\frac{z_{1}z_{2}}{z_{2}^{-1}p+(1-p)z_{1}-1}e^{\frac{1}{z_{1}}+z_{1}+\frac{1}{z_{2}}+z_{2}} \, \mathrm{d}z_{1}\mathrm{d}z_{2} $$ where C is a circle of radius 1 centred at 0 and $p\in]0,1[$ and I used this topic Finding residues of multi- dimensional complex functions to compute this integral.   The fact is that when I give the whole integral to Mathematica, I don't have the contribution of the poles because the contour cannot be deformed due to the singularity. So I'm trying to find a way to exclude the singularity of the contour, maybe with a small contour around z=0 using piecewise or something similar (see the figure here http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6499/v2uq.png where red=singularity and green=poles) to get only the contribution of the poles.   Thank you for your answers. _Mathematica_ code               NContourIntegrate[f_, par : (z_ -> g_), {t_, a_, b_}] :=        NIntegrate[Evaluate[D[g, t] (f /. par) /. t -> t1], {t1, a, b}]            Clear[Pinfz1];       Pinfz1[p_?NumericQ, z2_?NumericQ] :=        NContourIntegrate[1/(2*I*Pi)^2*z1*z2/(p + (1 - p)*z1*z2-z2)*E^(1/z1 + z1 + 1/z2 + z2),         z1 -> Exp[I t],         {t, 0, 2*Pi}]            Clear[Pinfz];       Pinfz[p_?NumericQ] := NContourIntegrate[Pinfz1[p, z2], z2 -> Exp[I t], {t, 0, 2*Pi }]
