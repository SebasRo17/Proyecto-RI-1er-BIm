Coming out of a project using Linq2Sql, I suspect that the next (bigger) one might push me into the arms of Entity Framework. I've done some reading-up on the subject, but what I haven't managed to find is a coherent story about how SQL Server Data Tools and Entity Framework should/could/might be used together.   * Were they conceived totally separately, and using them together is stroking the wrong way?   * Are they somehow totally orthogonal and I'm missing the point? Some reasons why I think I might want both:   * SSDT is great for having 'compiled' (checked) and easily versionable sql and schema   * But the SSDT 'migration/update' story is not convincing (to me): "Update anything" works ok for schema, but there's no way (AFAIK) that it can ever work for data.   * On the other hand, I haven't tried the EF migration to know if it presents similar problems, but the Up/Down bits look quite handy.
