I am trying to solve an advection equation. I want to force constant spatial step size (x dimension) with the “MethodOfLines” option, whereas I want to use initially fixed time step size 0.01 then decrease the time step size to be (0.001, 0.0001) when the minimum value of u(t,x) is less than (-6, -7). I tried the following code, and adopt ImplicitRungeKutta method to integrate with respect to time. I even can not set time step size in the ImplicitRungeKutta method. I try this               WhenEvent[{u[t, x]<=-6}, stepsize -> 0.001];     WhenEvent[{u[t, x]<=-7}, stepsize -> 0.0001];      But how can I combine this event trigger in my time integration method? Anyone can help me?               mdfun = First[u /. NDSolve[{D[u[t, x], t] ==        0.5 D[u[t, x], x, x] + u[t, x] D[u[t, x], x],       u[t, -Pi] == u[t, Pi] == 0, u[0, x] == Sin[x]},      u, {t, 0, 10}, {x, -Pi, Pi},      Method -> {"MethodOfLines",        Method -> {"ImplicitRungeKutta", DifferenceOrder -> 2,          "ImplicitSolver" -> {"Newton", "IterationSafetyFactor" -> 1}},        "SpatialDiscretization" -> {"TensorProductGrid",          "MinPoints" -> 100, "MaxPoints" -> 100,          "DifferenceOrder" -> 2}}]]      Then Plot it               Plot3D[Evaluate[mdfun[t, x]], {t, 0, 10}, {x, -Pi, Pi}, PlotPoints -> 100, PlotRange -> All]
