I am trying to use mmreader to upload a video into MATLAB. I am trying to follow the example in the documentation, however at the line               move(1:nFrames) = struct('cdata',zeros(vidHeight,vidWidth,3,'uint8'),'colormap',[]);      I get the following error:               ??? The following error occurred converting from struct to mmreader: Error using ==> which Argument must contain a string.          Error in ==> VIDEO2 at 16 mov(1:nFrames) = struct('cdata', zeros(vidHeight, vidWidth, 3, 'uint8'),'colormap',[]);      Any ideas what may be wrong?
