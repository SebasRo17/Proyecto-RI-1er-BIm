I took a job working as an IT guy (SQL programming, helpdesk, etc.) because I had need of a job (to pay back student loans accumulated from school). I'm very happy to have a job, but I eventually want to be a c++ programmer. I'm studying my c++ textbooks in my spare time and starting to do some projects with my newly acquired SQL skills. But the question that keeps rolling around in my head is "will I be a SQL programmer for the rest of my life now?" In your experience, will spending a year or two at my current job be a detriment in getting into C++ programming?
