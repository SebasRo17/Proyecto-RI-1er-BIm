Today at work one of my colleague reviewed my code, and suggested me to remove set-only property and use method insted. As we both were busy with other stuffs, he told me to look at `Property Design` section from "Framework Design Guidelines" book. In the book writer just asked to avoid > Properties with the setter having broder accessibility than the getter And now I'm wondering why it is not recommended to have set-only property? Can anyone clarify me, please?
