This question is related to the previously asked question Legends in combined Plot and ListPlot. Since _Mathematica_ 9 introduced new option `PlotLegends`, I was tempted to use built-in facility. (With the previous versions, I used the LevelScheme package). Consider a data set               A = {#, #^2} & /@ Range[100];     B = {#, #^1.8} & /@ Range[100];      and its theoretical prediction               A1 = x^2;     B1 = x^1.8;      I want to plot them together using `ListPlot` and `Plot`, respectively. And show them together with a single, combined legend. Also, I want to have user defined markers (e.g, filled-diamond, size = 15, joined -> false and so on) and set the style of the plot (e.g., Red, Thickness[0.01], Dashed and so on). I wonder if these requirements can be achieved by the built-in `PlotLegends` in _Mathematica_ 9. ### Edit The code below is what I tried, but I could not get the desired result.               MakeExponent[x_Integer] := "\*SuperscriptBox[10," <> ToString[x] <> "]"     tick = {10^#, MakeExponent[#]} & /@ Range[-10, 10, 1];          A = {1/#, #^2} & /@ Range[100];     B = {1/#, #^1.5 - 1} & /@ Range[100];     A1 = {1/#, #^2} & /@ Range[100];     B1 = {1/#, #^1.5 - 1} & /@ Range[100];     ALegend = Style[ "Legend A", 12, Black, FontFamily -> "Courier"];     BLegend = Style[ "Legend B", 12, Black, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"];     A1Legend = Style[ "Legend A1", 12, Black, FontFamily -> "Courier"];     B1Legend = Style[ "Legend B1", 12, Black, FontFamily -> "Courier"];     AMarker  = Style["\[FilledCircle]", 10, Orange];     BMarker  = Style["\[FilledDiamond]", 10, Purple];     A1Marker  = Style["\[LongDash]", 15, Blue];     B1Marker  = Graphics[Line[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}}]];     XLabel = Style[ Sqrt[x^2], 17];     YLabel = Style[t^2 , 17];      And then I tried               pic1 = ListLogLogPlot[ {A, B, A1, B1},       Axes -> False,       Frame -> True,       Joined -> {False, False, True, True},       PlotStyle -> {, , Blue, Red},       FrameLabel -> {XLabel, YLabel} ,       PlotMarkers -> {AMarker, BMarker, ,},       PlotLegends ->        Placed[         PointLegend[          {ALegend, BLegend, A1Legend, B1Legend},          LegendMarkers -> {AMarker, BMarker, A1Marker, B1Marker},          LegendMarkerSize -> {30, 10},          ], {0.8, 0.7}         ],       FrameTicks -> {{tick, None}, {tick, None}},       FrameTicksStyle -> 16     ]
