I would like to define a relationship between 3 variables first and then later when I have filled two of the variables with a number, I would like to extract the value of the last value. For example:               a * b == c; (* Somehow define this *)     Attributes[GetValues] = {HoldAll}     GetValues[known_] := With[known, {a, b, c}]          GetValues[{a = 2, b = 3}] (* => {2, 3, 6} *)     GetValues[{a = 2, c = 10}] (* => {2, 5, 10} *)     GetValues[{b = 10, c = 10}] (* => {1, 10, 10} *)      Only two of the variables will be defined at a time and there should always be only one possible value for the last variable, if the other two values are valid. You could possible to this with either `Solve` or `Reduce`, but how?
