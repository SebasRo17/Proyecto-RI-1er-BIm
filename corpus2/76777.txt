I am a Java programmer willing to learn smalltalk. As of now I am working within the Pharo environment. Trying to switch from Java to Smalltalk is being a bit of a headache, honestly. I would like to learn Smalltalk with the help of a code base available but I believe that there aren't many Smalltalk example projects available on the web. So are there any particular websites that involve learning Smalltalk (Pharo) based on some simple examples? Currently I am taking the help of Pharo By Example doc but I feel it is just not sufficient for me. I am looking for more some code examples in Smalltalk.
