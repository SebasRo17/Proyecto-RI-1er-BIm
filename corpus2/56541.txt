I have been using my intuition to solve errors in my _Mathematica_ scripts. But when calculations got more complex and I started getting errors involving code in more participating scripts (a script needs another one which needs another one, etc.), I searched for a way to find a _file_ and _line number_ or something and I found: How to find line where error occurred in Mathematica notebook? and The clearest way to represent Mathematica's evaluation sequence both of them more appropriate to the notebook (UI) environment. I can probably use a notebook and try to run my script there; but I wonder if there is a better way to work purely command line. Any ideas? (I am using _Mathematica_ version 9)
