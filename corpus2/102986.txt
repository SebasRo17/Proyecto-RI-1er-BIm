I'm a reasonably experienced programmer trying to learn web developement. I'm trying to develop a client-side web application which uses svg or canvas for graphics. I've decided I'd like to write the application code in Coffeescript. I don't know either Javascript or Coffeescript. How necessary knowing Javascript to Coffeescript web development? Am I likely to hit some gnarly problem which requires me to understand Javascript? Can I work happily with Javascript APIs from Coffeescript? **Edit** : I could easily learn the basics of Javascript in a week. I'm more concerned that Javascript seems to have a lot of hidden sharp edges. In the strangest language feature question on StackOverflow Javascript is one of the most common languages. It has an unusual object and class model. It has non- obvious name scoping rules. I find it takes more than a week for me to really know a language. I'm going to work on a small simple project to learn web development. Would I be better off to use Javascript or Coffeescript? I think in the long run I'll prefer Coffeescript but I'm willing to start with Javascript if that I'm going to need a thorough understanding of Javascript to use Coffeescript.
