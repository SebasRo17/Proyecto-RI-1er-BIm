I find font size of Text cells too small and I like displaying them with background colour... I've read this question and learned about `Menu/Format/Option Inspector...` where I managed to change font size, but it affects all cells. I would like to change separately Text, Input and Output formatting and to save these settings as default for displaying any notebooks. So, when I next time select a cell, then go to `Menu/Format/Style` and choose Text or Input or Output; it applies **my** default formatting for Text, Input, Output or anything else. Is this supported with `Option Inspector` or some other tool?
