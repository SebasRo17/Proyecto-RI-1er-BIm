I am integrating with a Financial Management System (FMS). I have a class that prepares a set of objects (each of these objects is called a TransactionEntity). These are then passed to the FMS.      I give particular importance to correct terminology. What should I name this class that prepares the transactions? I am thinking TransactionSomething. Example TransactionBuilder, TransactionFactory etc. But I don't think these names are correct.      For the record, I use .Net but I don't think the framework should have an impact on this.
