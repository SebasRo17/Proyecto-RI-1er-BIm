I can convert an expression with the head of Times,for example, `12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5` to `{12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5}` by using the code belowï¼š > ReleaseHold[HoldForm[12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5] /. Times -> List] I have a list which contains a lot of such expressions,here is an example: > listSample={12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5, 12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5, > 12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5, 12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5, 12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5, > 12*12.5*13*13.5*14*14.5} I still want to convert all the heads `Times` to `List`,but I failed when tried to Map `HoldForm` to each listItem,because it alway evaluates first. Here is my code: > ReleaseHold[HoldForm[#] /. Times -> List]&/@listSample I want to get this result: > {{12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5},{12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5},{12, 12.5, > 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5},{12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5},{12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, > 14.5},{12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5}}
