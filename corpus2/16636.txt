I would like to efficiently fill in or assign values to matrix m: m={   {a[1,1],a[1,2],a[1,3],a[1,4]},   {a[2,1],a[2,2],a[2,3],a[2,4]},   {a[3,1],a[3,2],a[3,3],a[3,4]},   {a[4,1],a[4,2],a[4,3],a[4,4]}}; a[1,1] to a[4,1] to be equal to 1. a[1,2] to a[4,2] to be equal to another column of value: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E7nRV.png) a[1,3] to a[4,3] to be equal to another column of value: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RxmJg.png) and a[1,4] to a[4,4] to be evaluated based on the matrix locations of the other a[1,1] to a[4,3] cells as in excel cell format of : a[1,4] = a[1,1]*a[2,3]+ etc etc but as soon as those dependencies are replaced with actual numbers, for example a[1,1] is now no longer symbolic but actual values, then how to symbolically do those evaluations based on cell locations similar to Excel as I will reuse this matrix again? Maybe use Table or something to evaluate and then join them together into a large matrix ?
