Sorry for bad English. Suppose there is a library `xxx` under GNU GPL, that provide a function `yyy`. Suppose my code links to the library and use this function. Does my code inherit GPL license? IANAL, but my thoughts are conflicting:   * On one hand, my code is derivative from the library, so it should inherit GPL.   * On other hand, my code just use link to the `xxx`. Maybe there are other libraries, that has the same interface (particularly, they provide `yyy` function with same functionality, but different implementation). My code may link to any. My code really doesn't _directly_ derived from `xxx`, it just use its interface. So, my code shouldn't inherit GPL. I'm confused. **ADDED.** The question is absolutely abstract. I don't mean any concrete GPL library.
