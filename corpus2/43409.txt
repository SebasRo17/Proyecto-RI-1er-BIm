My friend is a project manager for a software company. The most frustrating thing for him is that his **engineers frequently leave their jobs**. The company works hard to recruit new engineers, transfer projects, and keep a stable quality product. When people leave, it drives my friend crazy. These engineers are quite young and ambitious, and they want higher salaries and better positions. The big boss only thinks about it in financial terms, and his theory is that “ _three newbies are always better than one veteran_ ” (which, as an experienced engineer, I know is wrong). My friend hates that theory. Any advice for him?
