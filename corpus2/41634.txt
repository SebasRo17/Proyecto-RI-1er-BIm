I have a problem with `ParametricNDSolve[]`. Mathematica gives the warning that a stiff system is suspected. I have varied the methods but unfortunately I was not able to solve it. First some formulas that are used in the definition of the differential equation within the `ParametricNDSolve[]` statement:               r = 0.005; η = 1;     P[t_, T0_] := Exp[-r (T0 - t)]     Bx[x_, α_, γ_] := α/γ (1 - Exp[-γ x])     T1 = T0 + 1/365;      This is a list of test parameters:               testPars = {α -> 0.2563, γ ->      0.3753, ρ13 -> -0.2414, ρ12 -> -0.7369, ρ23 ->      0.1300, σv -> 2.5618, σS -> 0.6143, κ ->      5.7734, v0 -> 0.1559};      and finally the `ParametricNDSolve[]` statement as how I have entered it:               nfun = n /. ParametricNDSolve[{\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(∂\), \(τ\)]\ \(n[τ, u]\)\) == n[τ, u] (-κ + u σv (ρ13 σS + ρ23 Bx[T1 - T0 + τ, α, γ])) + 1/2 n[τ, u]^2 σv^2 + 1/2 (u^2 - u) (σS^2 + Bx[T1 - T0 + τ, α, γ]^2 + 2 ρ12 σS Bx[ T1 - T0 + τ, α, γ]), n[0, u] == 0}, n, {τ, 0, 5}, {u, 0, 10^4}, {α, γ, ρ13, ρ12, ρ23, σv, σS, κ}, Method -> "StiffnessSwitching"]      I get an error when I plot the solution for the testparameter set:               Plot[nfun[α, γ, ρ13, ρ12, ρ23, σv, σS, κ][τ, 0] /. testPars, {τ, 0, 1}]      Does anyone have an idea on how to solve it? Your help is much appreciated.
