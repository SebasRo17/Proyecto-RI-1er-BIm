It seems to me like identifying the first occurrence of unique elements should take about the same amount of time as it takes to delete duplicates. My data sets are much larger than this (`a` is 10-20k and `b` is 1-10k).               With[{a = 1000, b = 10}, list = RandomInteger[a, b a]];     Timing[uniques = DeleteDuplicates@list;]     Timing[firstOccurrenceIndices = Position[list, #, 1, 1] & /@ uniques // Flatten;]      > {0.000116, Null} > > {0.653104, Null} Any ideas?
