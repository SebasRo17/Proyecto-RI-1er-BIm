I have a $2x2$ matrix $M$. $M$ has the following form:               M = {{a, bExp[-2ikz]}, {bExp[2ikz], a}}      $a, b, k - const.$ `z` is variable that takes values from the range `0, 10, 20, 30, 40 ......300`. I need `30` different matrices `M1, M2....M30` corresponding to the values of `z` \- `0, 10, 20.....300` and then multiply those matrices. How can I do that with _Mathematica_ ?
