So I design and develop websites myself, mostly in WordPress. Once I'm happy with the site on my local server, I upload it and its database to the web server and let the client make whatever changes to the site. When he/she needs me to make changes to the code or the backend of WP, I usually work on the remote version of the site from then on, which is a pretty slow process compared to working locally. I guess what I'm asking is, is there a way to work on a local version of the site which syncs any changes made to the remote version of the site? Is this version control by any chance? Here's my typical workflow:   * Set up local database   * Code local WordPress site   * Export local database   * Import local database to remote server   * Upload all files to remote server   * Continue to make any changes post-launch remotely Is there any way to improve my current workflow?
