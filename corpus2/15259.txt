I have 2 data sets, `data1` and `data2` with large (in the thousands) amounts of data and I want to compare them in a plane. They aren't modeled by the normal distribution, but I'm using that here for simplicity.               data1 = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {10000, 2}];     data2 = data1+1;      I can put these on a list plot and plot them. However, this is visually unpleasing and even hides some of the data.               combPlot = ListPlot[{data1, data2},         PlotRange->All,         PlotStyle->PointSize[0.01],         PlotStyle->Directive[Opacity[0.5]]     ];     Export[Directory[] <> "/figures/test-comb.pdf", combPlot];      ![](http://imgur.com/ylFd9.png) The `SmoothDensityHistogram` command with the following color function shows the data exactly how I want it for each data set.               histOpts = {ColorFunction -> Function[c, GrayLevel[1 - c]],         PlotRange -> {{-4, 4}, {-4, 4}}, ImageSize -> Medium};     hist1 = SmoothDensityHistogram[data1, histOpts];     Export[Directory[] <> "/figures/test-hist1.pdf", hist1];     hist2 = SmoothDensityHistogram[data2, histOpts];     Export[Directory[] <> "/figures/test-hist2.pdf", hist2];      ![](http://i.imgur.com/z20jC.png) ![](http://i.imgur.com/vtZSJ.png) How can I combine these into a single plot, preferably with different colors? I had no success using the `Show` command. Again, the idea is to visually compare the 2 data sets. If there are any other alternatives, I'd like to see them too. * * * Update: After seeing Diego Zviovich's post, I was able to get it working for my example. However, my actual data sets may significantly differ so the bounds aren't the same:               data1 = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {10000, 2}];     data2 = data1+10;          hist1 = SmoothDensityHistogram[data1,         ColorFunction->Function[c, Hue[215/360, .973, 1, c]],          PlotRange->All, ImageSize -> Medium];     hist2 = SmoothDensityHistogram[data2,          ColorFunction->Function[c, Hue[311/360, .973, 1, c]],          PlotRange->All, ImageSize -> Medium];     combHist = Show[         Rasterize[hist1],         Rasterize[hist2],         PlotRange->All     ];          Export[Directory[] <> "/figures/test-hist1.pdf", hist1];     Export[Directory[] <> "/figures/test-hist2.pdf", hist2];     Export[Directory[] <> "/figures/test-combHist.pdf", combHist];      data1: ![](http://i.imgur.com/Wrtky.png) data2: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qp6Wn.png) Combined: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jgGph.png) ~~How do I correct the bounds for this?~~ * * * Update: Using m_goldberg's suggestion, I'm able to get what I want: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gD1HV.png) I'll leave this opened for a little for any further discussion, but I'm satisfied with this now. Thanks to everyone who helped! * * * Further update (sorry): I'm a little unsatisfied with the results for my actual data. The first one appears fine, but the second is overly distorted: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pD2mv.png) ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TF6e9.png) Does anybody have any further suggestions for these?
