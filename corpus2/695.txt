I noticed that all of the packages that come with Mathematica start with a header that is in a standard format. (See e.g. the header of `NIntegrateUtilities`` at the end.) There are several commented sections, each starting with a word surrounded by colons. **Question:** What is the purpose of these colon-surrounded words? Do they have any meaning to Mathematica? They look like they were made for a machine to parse. Does Mathematica have any functions/tools that can read these? > >     (* :Name: NIntegrateUtilities` *) >   >     (* :Title: Utility functions for NIntegrate. *) >   >     (* :Author: Anton Antonov *) >   >     (* :Summary: >      This package provides a number of supporting functions for NIntegrate. >     *) >   >     (* :Context: DifferentialEquations`NIntegrateUtilities` *) >   >     (* :Package Version: 1.0 *) >   >     (* :Copyright: Copyright 2007, Wolfram Research, Inc. *) >   >     (* :History: >      Version 1.0 by Anton Atnonov, March 2007. >     *) >   >     (* :Keywords: >      NIntegrate, integration, evaluations, profiling. >     *) >   >     (* :Source: >     *) >   >     (* :Mathematica Version: 6.0 *) >   >     (* :Limitation: >     *) >   >     (* :Discussion: >     *) >
