When handling exceptions for example in a method in my presentation logic, is it ok to catch all possible exceptions in a one catch block as follows if the only purpose here is alerting the user.               private void Do()     {         try         {             //  Do some stuff here which might throw an exception         }         catch (Exception e)         {             MessageBox.Show(e.Message);         }     }      Or else should we always catch every possible exceptions (like `OutOfMemoryException`, `NullReferenceException` etc. followed by more generalized exceptions) in separate catch blocks ? Since the information in e.message is not relevant for average users, we could do like               MessageBox.Show("Exception occurred and contact system administrator");      Is that the standard way ? NOTE : My sole purpose is to alert user and try to keep the system up (with out crashing)
