As far as I can see consuming SOAP requires a SOAP stack, so it is harder for your clients to consume i.e. they need to ensure that they have a SOAP stack in place that formats the POST data and the headers correctly and then gives you back some data structure, whereas with REST you just make an HTTP GET request with the arguments in the query string and get back some text that I guess is probably XML. So what does the extra overhead / complexity of SOAP give you, when do you need it and when could you and should you do without it?
