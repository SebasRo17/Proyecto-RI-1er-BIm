I've been looking into using the Typhoon framework for dependency injection this week. I get that separating the construction of objects is beneficial for replacing arbitrary components with mocks during unit testing, and so far I have seen benefits from this alone. But I cannot help but think that where before I had a humongous view controller class that had tens of header imports, I now have a humongous factory class that has tens of header imports. Am I supposed to avoid having a massive factory class?
