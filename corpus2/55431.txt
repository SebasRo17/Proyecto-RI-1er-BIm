Why would this work               Times[a, b, c, d] /. Times :> List     (* {a, b, c, d} *)      but this doesn't work (the `Times` still remains even when the `List` has been added)?               Times[a, b, c, d] /. Times[p__] :> List[p]     (* {a b c d} *)      Applying `Trace` shows that `Times` might have applied itself to `p__` before the pattern is matched, so that the expression now became just `a b c d/. p__:>{p}`. If that's the case, why would `Times[p__]` become `p__`?               Times[a, b, c, d] /. Times[p__] :> List[p] // Trace     (* {{{Times[p__],p__},p__:>{p},p__:>{p}},a b c d/. p__:>{p},{a b c d}} *)
