Is there an easy approach - hopefully built-in - to partitioning `MatrixPlot` graphics into rows or columns (or both) of graphics sharing the same underlying options? For example, in the following graphic, the red rectangles indicate where partitions should occur, and the respective sub-Rasters (along with `FrameTicks` etc) can then be reorganized using `Row` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CmSYk.png) This particular graph (excluding the rectangles which were generated in `Epilog`) has `Length` 6, of which all but the first `Part` are related to options. But it's tedious to even list what parts of the partitions component correspond to which parts, which subsequently must be modified - for example `FrameTicks` are to be repositioned (reindexed). Obviously, because the "heatmap" color scale is shared among all the members of the desired partition, it's not feasible to partition the matrix prior and then mapping through `MatrixPlot`
