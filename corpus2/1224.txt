I've never found the ideal way to perform code reviews and yet often my customers require them. Each customer seems to do them in a different way and I've never felt satisfied in any of them. What has been the most effective way for you to perform code reviews? For example:   * Is one person regarded as the gatekeeper for quality and reviews the code, or do the team own the standard?    * Do you do review code as a team exercise using a projector?   * Is it done in person, via email or using a tool?    * Do you eschew reviews and use things like pair programming and collective code ownership to ensure code quality?
