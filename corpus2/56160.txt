Please try to evaluate this code in Mathematica 10.               << ComputationalGeometry`     g = RandomGraph[{12, 18}];     pt = GraphEmbedding[g];     convexhull = ConvexHull[pt];     Show[PlanarGraphPlot[pt, convexhull, ColorOutput -> Red], g,     Graphics[{Red, PointSize@Large, Point[#]} & /@ pt]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YxsJm.png) Works perfectly fine on the version 9. What is this dynamic object showing up? Anybody got some explanation for this.
