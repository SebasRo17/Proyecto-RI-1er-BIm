As a developer with enough experience to evaluate a tool, I may say that PDT is very huge in size and slow in performance for a PHP IDE. It gets bigger by release and exponentially slower by the size of the projects. Add some extra syntax coloring rules and it literally crawls, code completion works randomly and building workspace takes like forever. Java black magic (-Xmx etc) eases the pain a little but that's it. So my questions are:   1. Why is PDT like this? What design or engineering factors led to its poor performance?    2. How can I avoid making these same mistakes in my own products?
