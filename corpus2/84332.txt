How to deal with the developers refusing to use certain technologies or tools? **Note:** Good help is hard to find, so answer 'Let them go' doesn't work in this case. Besides, they are very good in what they do, just don't want to do what they don't want to do. Examples: "Get away from me with this Crystal Reports stuff or you will never see me again." "I am not using SSIS for anything." "You can integrate sytem with MAS 500 yourself, I won't touch it with a 10-foot pole." **General Comment:** "Ask developers to provide a better solution" is not always an option as the technology / tool maybe given to us by the customer.   * Customer has people familiar with CR to tweak reports after they are delivered   * Customer already has Microsoft SQL server and don't want to invest in any other ETL   * Customer uses MAS 500 and doesn't want to switch to the other accounting package
