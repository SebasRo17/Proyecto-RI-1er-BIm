I want to make a `Grid` with each cell Imagesize was `{10,10}`.If I place any Gui-Element with more than that cell Imagesize,I don't want to scale that cell. I want to set each cell ImageSize is `{10,10}`. For this purpose,I tried with both `Grid` and `GraphicsGrid`. If you can use `Grpahicsrid`,it's working fine.That corresponding code is in below.               GraphicsGrid[ConstantArray["234", {3, 4}], Frame -> All,ImageSize -> {40, 30}]      If you use `Grid`,it's not working.That corresponding code is in below.                Grid[ConstantArray["234", {3, 4}], Frame -> All, ItemSize -> {10, 10}]      I think,`Itemsize` units totally different compared with `ImageSize`.That's why it's not working . How can I resolve this ?
