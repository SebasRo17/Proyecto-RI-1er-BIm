I evaluated the following integral               NIntegrate[Sqrt[r] Abs[Cos[(k + 1/2) Pi r]], {r, 0, 1}]      getting as a result 0.413232 for `k=1` Then I evaluated the same integral as               Assuming[k ∈ Integers && k ⩾ 0,       Integrate[ 1/Sqrt[2] Sqrt[r (1 + Cos[2 (k + 1/2) Pi r])], {r, 0, 1}]]      and then I evaluated the result               -((4 (-1 + FresnelS[1]))/((1 + 2 k)^(3/2) π))      for `k=1` and I get the following result 0.137646. I am checking this result because I am mainly interested in               Integrate[ 1/Sqrt[2] Sqrt[r (1 + Cos[2 (k + 1/2) Pi r])], {r, R, 1}]      as a function of `R`. Where is my error?
