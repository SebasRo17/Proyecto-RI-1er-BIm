The function `Intersection` takes a number of lists (sets) and finds their intersection. However, the precise input is `Intersection[{1, 1, 2, 3}, {3, 1, 4}, {4, 1, 3, 3}]` and not `Intersection[{{1, 1, 2, 3}, {3, 1, 4}, {4, 1, 3, 3}}]`. This means I am having difficulty automatising my procedure using `Table`. For example, I wish to first construct `myInput=Table[i+j,{i,1,5},{j,1,8}]` and then `Intersection[myInput]`. This does not work, and `Flatten` doesn't seem to be able to flatten at level `0`. Any help? Thanks!
