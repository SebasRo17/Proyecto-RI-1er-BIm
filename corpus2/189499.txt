It has just dawned on me, that a system I am developing exposes a users username in the URI. This is a problem, since some of the users pages are public. Therefore people will know their username. I thought that this would be a security issue, but then realised that big names like twitter do the same thing. Pretty much every single twitter user has their username on full display. If a big name like twitter see it as safe, should I also assume the same?
