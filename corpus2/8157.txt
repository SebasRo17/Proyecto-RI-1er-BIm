I work at a company where we have a lot of different skillsets in the development team. We do all of the following (generally geared towards web):   * .NET (MVC, Umbraco, ASP.NET, Surface)   * Java (Spring, Hibernate, Android)    * PHP (Zend, Code igniter)    * Actionscript 3   * AIR   * Objective-C   * Html/Javascript (obviously) We're trying to streamline our development process. We currently have a TeamCity server that builds and deploys .NET projects with msbuild/msdeploy/nant. What I want is something like maven that will give us a standard project template structure that works for most projects to allow people from different teams to move between projects easily. Currently this works on one platform because we tend to do things in a standard way for that platform (as long as certain people have been involved) however I want to use something like maven to standardise how a project is laid out and built. Has anyone tried anything like this before? Experiences? Books?
