Please can you answer a couple of questions based on the code below (excludes the try/catch blocks), which transforms input XML and XSL files into an output XSL-FO file:               File xslFile = new File("inXslFile.xsl");     File xmlFile = new File("sourceXmlFile.xml");     TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();     Transformer transformer = tFactory.newTransformer(new StreamSource(xslFile));     FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("outFoFile.fo");     transformer.transform(new StreamSource(xmlFile), new StreamResult(fos));      inXslFile is encoded using UTF-8 - however there are no tags in file which states this. sourceXmlFile is UTF-8 encoded and there may be a metatag at start of file indicating this. am currently using Java 6 with intention of upgrading in the future.   1. What encoding is used when reading the xslFile?   2. What encoding is used when reading the xmlFile?   3. What encoding will be applied to the FO outfile?   4. How can I obtain the info (properties) for 1 - 3? Is there a method call?   5. How can the properties in 4 be altered - using configuration and dynamically?    6. if known - Where is there info (web site) on this that I can read - I have looked without much success.
