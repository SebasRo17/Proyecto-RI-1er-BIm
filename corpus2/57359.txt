I have a problem concerning `ArcTan` drawing a graph using `ListPlot`. I import a table of data:               a = Import["D:\2_b=10a.txt", "Table"];      Then I write:               ListPlot[Table[{i*0.005 Pi, -ArcTan[(a[[i]][[1]] -         a[[i - 1]][[1]]), (a[[i]][[2]] - a[[i - 1]][[2]])]}, {i, 2, 401, 1}]], PlotRange -> {{0, Pi}, {-4, 4}}]      The returned graph looks like ![this](http://i.imgur.com/lBZ0jLt.png) I know from the nature of my calculations that the function must be continuous on the interval $[0,Pi]$, but at $3Pi/4$ the `ArcTan` function goes to another branch, since `ArcTan[x,y]` chooses a quadrant. How could I possibly try to move the bottom part of the plot up by Pi, so the function is smooth and continuous? I tried defining a function               myArcTan[x_] := Piecewise[{{ArcTan[x] + Pi, x < 0}, {ArcTan[x], x > 0}}];      but it doesn't work. Thank you very much.
