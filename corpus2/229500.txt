I often use the following syntax:               std::vector<foo> vec;     vec.push_back( someClass.getFoo(...).modifyAndReturn() );      Considered about exception safety, I quote the standard on vector's push back behavior (23.3.7.5): > If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move > constructor, assignment operator, or move assignment operator of T or by any > InputIterator operation there are no effects. If an exception is thrown by > the move constructor of a non-CopyInsertable T, the effects are unspecified.   * Is it a good practice to use complicated push backs?   * Are there any perils exception wise?
