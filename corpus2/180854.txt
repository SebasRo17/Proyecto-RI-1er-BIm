I have a program I'm working on that my company uses internally, but is also sent to vendors. The vendor version will be identical, except that it will be missing some features, and use an installer. I only have to remove 2 lines from an XML file, and it's good for external use. Is there some "typical" method to create a project like this without having to maintain separate codebases for each project? If it makes any difference, program is written in C#, developed using Visual Studio 2010, compiled as a dll, runs on Windows 7.
