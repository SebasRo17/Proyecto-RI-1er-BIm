I am having some troubles with documentation generated by wolfram workbench. When i try to open symbol page created with workbench by pressing `F1` I get a search page instead of my symbol page. When I try to open page with make template (`Ctr`+`Shift`+`K`) I get the message that the page does not exist, even though I can find it through search. My guess is that page is not linked with symbol, but I don't know why it happens. Is there any way to fix it ? UPD: My Mathematica version is 9; By using `Ctr`+`Shift`+`K` i mean this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p6Ozz.png) The message with will show up only if notebook was launched with workbench, in other cases Mathematica will just ignore this attempt. If I set PackletInfo.m like this:                   Paclet[           Name -> "TheoryOfComputation",           Version -> "1.0.0",           MathematicaVersion -> "9+",           Description -> "Theory of Computation package",           Creator -> "Me",           Extensions -> {           {             "Kernel",              Context -> {"TheoryOfComputation`"}           },           { "Documentation",              Resources-> {"Guides/TheoryOfComputation"},             Language -> "English",             MainPage->"Guides/TheoryOfComputation",             LinkBase->"TheoryOfComputation"           }        }]      I can type something like MyPackage`MySymbol, press F1 and this works fine. But with this i can't use function templates. Also, typing MySymbol and pressing F1 leads to search page again, even thought result of ?MySymbol have link to documentation page
