When I first encounter a new code base, I often find myself constructing flowchart-like-thingies-on-paper, while stepping through the code - either by reading it, or with the debugger. Another approach, that I have heard about here on SE is to add `const` everywhere and see where the compilation starts to break. I am somewhat familiar with the different families of UML diagrams and 1) don't really like them 2) feel like they are intended for design time, not system analysis time. _So, what would be a good helping tool in understanding existing code that one sees for the first time? Is creating a diagram of the execution paths a widespread practice, and which diagram exactly? Or maybe a diagram of the inheritance hierarchy (or file-contains-function for procedural programming) is a more appropriate tool. Or something else?_
