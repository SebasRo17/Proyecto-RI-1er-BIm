I got to see many designs that normalization wasn't the first consideration in decision making phase. In many cases those designs included more than 30 columns, and the main approach was "to put everything in the same place" According to what I remember normalization is one of the first, most important things, so why is it dropped so easily sometimes? **Edit:** Is it true that good architects and experts choose a denormalized design while non-experienced developers choose the opposite? What are the arguments against starting your design with normalization in mind?
