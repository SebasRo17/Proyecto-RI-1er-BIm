I've been learning both Common Lisp and Racket, and one thing that I consistently hear is that Racket is a much "smaller" language than Common Lisp. I was wondering what this really meant. As far as I can tell, the syntax for Common Lisp isn't that much bigger than for Racket. Basically, I'm wondering what exactly about common lisp is bigger. Does it have more syntax that I just don't know about? Does it have bigger environments? Bigger executables? Bigger libraries? Or some combination thereof? Please, this is not a "which one is better" thread, I would just like to know exactly what "bigger" means.
