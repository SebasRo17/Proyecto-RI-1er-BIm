I am a fresher working in a software company. I am working on a project all alone. Though I studied CS, I dont seem to grasp things (concepts, code, etc.) easily. Most of what I read is forgotten!!!!:(:( I want to improve but it seems like there are too many things to learn and there's less time... One more factor is that I am handling a project on my own which adds to my tension, when things don't work and my mind is unable to troubleshoot or look for alternatives... Also, I can't go to others for doubts as they are busy with their work and they don't know about my app... It's really stressing me out... I have to do everything on my own. I feel bad at the end of the day since I don't meet the expectations of my peers as well as myself... How do I improve myself and handle things effectively? Suggest to me books on not just coding but also on designing. Also how can I effciently manage my work as well as practice more to get the concepts more clearer?
