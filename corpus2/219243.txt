I try to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and also to omit Code Repetitions. However there are often places where there are code repetitions that are nothing more than code blocks of invocations that are resistant to extracting them into at least meaningfull named method:               DoAction1();     DoAction2();          if (value)         DoAction3();          DoAction4();      What is the best way to extract such code into a method and how to name it?
