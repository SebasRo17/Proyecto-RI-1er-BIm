Suppose a user wants to transmit both audio and video to another user, whose formats are AMR for audio and H.264 for video. Does the user have to transmit audio and video packets always separately? Meaning that it is not possible to mix audio and video within the same RTP packed, is that correct? If this is true I guess the RTP protocol will need to know the SSRC of both audio and video to be able to check the sync of the two streams.
