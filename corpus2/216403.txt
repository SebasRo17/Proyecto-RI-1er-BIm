I have a website. I've been testing crossbrowser on my windows PC, and it looks good in all browsers, but on Mac in Safari it looks like the CSS is not getting interpreted right, or there is a critical javascript error. When I look in the console cross-browser, the error log shows exactly the same. Chrome on mac interprets the site as intended, so why do I have a problem with safari? It is the same across different computers, and iphone safari also shows the site wrong. How is this possible and how do I debug?
