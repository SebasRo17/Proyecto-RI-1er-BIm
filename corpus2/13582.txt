I'm trying to export some data with formats into Excel. It works ok, but the columns size get not properly adjusted. I don't want to use some complicated solution based on this example. In my tests, I tried a code like that:               data = {{"Column 1", "Column 2"}, {1, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 6}};     data[[1]] = Style[#, Bold, Red, FontSize -> 15] & /@ data[[1]]     Export["data.xlsx", data, "FormattedData"]      I get this result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yvLJg.png) And I need something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZQ7Do.png) Some clue?
