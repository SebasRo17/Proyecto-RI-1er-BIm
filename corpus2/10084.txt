I was looking for some guides to start programming with, I'm a college student and I'm learning Ruby as my first language (Side-question, is that something good to start with?). I found _Why's guide to Ruby and I also found Learn You Haskell (which is of course not Ruby) and I was curious if there were any more guides/books like these, free and fun to read? Just for future reads and to know about. Will reading a book or guide actually teach me programming, do I just have to hop from one book to another until I understand the concepts because I feel like most books focus on theoretical stuff and I don't actually pick up much programming from them. Are there any "just do it" ways of learning programming? Like do I just sit here and start writing bad code until I get better or do I go out there and find some code and edit it? Because ultimately I want to write my own code but I want to see some good examples.
