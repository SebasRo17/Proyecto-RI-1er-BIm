I am wondering what should an algorithm documentation contain? Can't locate a proper guideline to follow. I have in mind to include   * summary of the algorithm   * description of the algorithm   * flowcharts   * pseudo codes   * sample input data set(multiple)   * output data   * unit tests   * experiments The client requests such a documentation to: _Maintain confidence in our own numbers as well as to describe our process to potential customers so they know we are taking steps to check and verify our calculations._   * How would look like such a documentation? (example PDF)    * What would you include more in this documentation?    * What I enumerated is that good, or this should be somehow documented differently?    * How would you search in Google for such documentation samples?
