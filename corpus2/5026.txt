Recently I've been making movies by having _Mathematica_ create figures and then I combine all of them together using `ffmpeg`. The problem now is that my macbook is not fast enough to generate the figures I want in a short amount of time. I have access to a linux machine and I would like to be able to send a script to that machine so that I can generate my figures. The problem I'm facing is that _Mathematica_ can't open display ":0.0". ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5FbcP.png) I also found this, but it did not solve my problem. Does anyone know how to generate figures in the terminal? All I want it to do is to write them to a file.
