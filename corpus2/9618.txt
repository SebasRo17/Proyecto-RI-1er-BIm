I'd like to create a simple communication channel between MMA and the animation package 'Maya'. This is possible over sockets ( very simple, just sending and receiving strings). I've got this working perfectly, by writing a simple .NET dll which sends and receives strings and calling this DLL with NET link. However, player pro doesn't support NET link so I'm unable to deploy this outside MMA. Is there any way to send and receive strings over TCP/IP sockets in a way that Player Pro would support? Thanks!
