I would like to import the World Value Survey data file into Mathematica, but it's only given in spss, sas or stata formats, which are statistical analysis softwares format I think. I can't get to import these files in Mathematica, they are not recognized. I've found a Wolfram executable that should allow me to import SAS files but it can't make it work on Linux. Have you already been able to import such files in Mathematica?
