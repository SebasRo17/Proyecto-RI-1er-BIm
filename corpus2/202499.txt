I have an `Email` class that has a `Send` method that optionally takes an `SmtpClient` and sends an email asynchronously using `SendAsync`. If no `SmtpClient` is supplied to this method, it instantiates a default `SmtpClient` and uses that to send the email. Inside the `Send` function, I provide a `SendCompleted` callback which disposes of the `MailMessage` and the default `SmtpClient` if one was not supplied to the method. **So when I am supplying the`SmtpClient`, how do I go about disposing it?** I can't dispose of it inside `Send` because it may be used for sending other emails, plus I figure it's the responsibility of the thing that instantiated the passed in `SmtpClient` to dispose of it again. Is it possible to add multiple `SendCompleted` callbacks to the `SmtpClient` that run after each other?
