One of the advantages of using a DVCS is the **edit-commit-merge** workflow (over **edit-merge-commit** often enforced by a CVCS). Allowing each unique change to be recorded in the repository independent of merges ensures the DAG accurately reflects the true pedigree of the project. Why do so many websites talk about wanting to "avoid merge commits"? Doesn't merging pre-commit or rebasing post-merge make it more difficult to isolate regressions, revert past changes, etc.? **EDIT:** Point of clarification: The default behavior for a DVCS **is** to create merge commits. Why do so many places talk about a desire to see a linear development history that hides these merge commits?
