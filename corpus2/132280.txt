I have been a programmer for a few years and until now I worked exclusively with PHP, although I did create a few small side projects in other languages. I'm currently interviewing with a non-IT that relies mainly on .NET and they seem to be willing to hire me. I probably should have thought of this sooner, but without commercial experience in .NET what questions should I ask to ensure that that job will help me advance my knowledge of the .NET platform or if they are doing .NET the right way (libraries, frameworks, third-party tools, etc.)?
