I have almost 5 years of experience as a web developer, and feel that I should be mid-level by now, but when I walk the walk I think I'm still pretty "junior" at it. Here's what I think is the problem: For most of my career, I seldom had any real guidance by a more senior developer and zero experience with developer teams, so I sort of had to hack my way through a lot of solutions, and do everything cut-and-dried. In practice, there was no time to waste as the only guy responsible for writing or maintaining the code. Because of this, I have no formal knowledge of the actual software development _process_ and eventually realized that coding is only a small part of the process. I would greatly enjoy working with a developer team with solid experience, but I am afraid it would be a very bumpy ride trying to adjust with the knowledge base that is required for development processes. As a programmer who has flied solo most of his career, what can I do to prepare to "settle in" a job working with a larger team (at least 5) of seasoned pros? Edit: To that end I haven't passed a lot of the technical tests given out by the "big shot" companies that thrive on their software and developers. By big I don't mean like Google, but reasonably successful in the geographic area.
