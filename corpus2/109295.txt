I was pretty excited while creating one of my apps but as it turns out you can't actually sign up for Google Checkout if you don't live either in the USA or in the UK. And since Google Checkout is the only way Android Market will pay you, all my efforts seem to be going in vain. So because I live in India, I can't sell my apps. I tried contacting Google by various means on this, but haven't got any response so far. I tried searching the web as well just to find out that one can't be paid via any other way. I am pretty sure that many people here might have gone through the same problem. How did you solve it? I have a PayPal account and an AdSense account as well. Can they help in any way? And if nothing works out, how am I supposed to be selling my app?
