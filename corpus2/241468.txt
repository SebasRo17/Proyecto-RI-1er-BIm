I'm told to think about caching of images that will be displayed on the page. The images will be repeated throughout the website on different pages and I'm told to figure out the best way to cache these images. There could be few to dozen of images on single page. Here's few questions:   * Will browser caching work to display the same images across different web pages?   * Should I rather store images in stringified form in a memory instead, using JavaScript arrays?   * Store them on hard drive using 'localStorage'?   * What would be easiest yet best option for this?   * Are there any other alternatives?   * How to force cache? Any other information would be greatly appreciated...
