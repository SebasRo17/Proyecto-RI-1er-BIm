The **domain expert** in our team uses UML class diagrams to model the **domain model**. As a result, the class diagrams are more of **technical models rather than domain models** (it serves of some sort of technical specifications for developpers because they don't have to do any conception, they just have to implement the model). In the end, the domain expert ends up doing the job of the architect/technical expert right? Is it normal for a domain expert (not a developer or technical profile) to do class diagrams? If not, what kind of modeling should he be using?
