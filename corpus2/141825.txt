What are some recommendations for a build tool that would allow me to upload changes to a web server or a repository and minify the js and css automatically, and possibly even run Closure compiler on the JavaScript? I'm not worried about doing anything with the php code other than update with most recent changes although in the future would like to have phpdoc updated automatically. Just wondering if there is some way to do all this other than an amalgam of scripts that run or have to be invoked every time?
