At the top of the `.m` file which is automatically generated from initialization cells in a notebook there appears a header:               (************************************************************************)     (* This file was generated automatically by the Mathematica front end.  *)     (* It contains Initialization cells from a Notebook file, which         *)     ...      Is there any way to suppress generating this header?
