data = Flatten[Import["speedtest1B.csv"]];     distrib = HistogramDistribution[data];     histogram = Histogram[data, ChartStyle -> {Blue}];     Export["speedtest1B.pdf",          Overlay[{          Histogram[             data,              ChartStyle -> {Blue},             ImageSize -> {500,500},             AxesLabel -> {"start-up time [ms]", "number of samples"}             ],         DiscretePlot[             CDF[distrib, x],              {x, 0, Max[data]},             ImageSize -> {500,500},             Axes -> False             ]             }         ]     ];      From the above I get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G4mqh.png) I would like the plots to be properly aligned. Displaying the CDF x-axis on the right side of the plot would be a big plus. Also I don't realy get color- theaming so could someone please explain how to easily change the color od CDF to red.
