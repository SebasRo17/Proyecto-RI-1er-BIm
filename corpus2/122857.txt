I have a number of large text files that I need to manipulate in a highly performant manner. I've decided to look into using Memory Mapped files in C# (.NET 4). However, I can't find any examples of or guidance on how to read/write to a memory mapped file that, underneath, is bound to a text file. Can anyone shed some light on this and, possibly, provide me with some examples? If it helps, Iâ€™ll be reading text in whole lines, then altering the line and replacing it with content that may be shorter or longer than the original. After all of the manipulations are done, I want to save it back to disk as a text file.
