I've been working on creating tables of differences in MAA similar to the image below, but with a bit more detail: ![Example difference Table](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QXSSi.jpg) I've written a function that will take an anonymous function, a range of values and some optional arguments to create the table:               differenceTable[f_: Function[{g}, g], range_List, n_: 3, diff_: 3, p_: 2] :=     Module[     {a = N[f /@ range, n]},      Grid[     {{"x"} ~ Join ~ {"f[x]"} ~ Join ~ (Table[Superscript[\[CapitalDelta], k], {k, 1, diff}]),     {Column[range, Center, 1]} ~ Join ~ (Column[#, Center, 1] & /@ (SetPrecision[#, p] & /@ diffList[a, diff + 1]))},     Spacings -> 2,      Dividers -> {{False, True}, {False, True}}     ]     ]      with,               diffList[x_List, n_] :=        Module[{d = Differences[x]}, {x} ~ Join ~diffList[d, n - 1]];     diffList[x_List, 1] := {x}      For example:               differenceTable[Sin[#] &, Range[10, 90, 10] Degree]      gives ![My Difference Table](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jXieM.jpg) Which is great. The problem I run into is that when the function values and the x values take on non-standard formatting (fractional notation and exponentials specifially) the spacing between rows is thrown off. For example:               differenceTable[Sin[#] &, Range[Pi/18, Pi/2, Pi/18]]      gives: ![my difference table 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GMDjl.jpg) I'm not sure how to fix this without eliminating the taper in the table, which I would like to keep. Does anyone know of a fix for this?
