A month ago, I used Mathematica to solve my experiment of the Test Technology of Mechanics Engineering. The exeriment is mainly about the Fourier Transform and verify the validity of the theory of Fourier. My code is below:                originwave[t_] :=        If[-5 <= t <= 5, t, If[t > 0, originwave[t - 10], originwave[t + 10]]];     (*the definition of SawtoothWave function*)      **four periodic originwave**               Column[           {Plot[originwave[t], {t, -20, 20}, PlotRange -> {-5, 5},                 AspectRatio -> 1, ImageSize -> 300, AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[0.03],                 AxesLabel -> {"t", "four periodic originwave"}           ]},           Center]      ![four periodic originwave](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ty9AL.png) **The seven order Fourier series expansion**               Column[           {Plot[Evaluate[FourierTrigSeries[originwave[t], t, 7]], {t, -20, 20},                PlotRange -> {-5, 5}, AspectRatio -> 1, ImageSize -> 300,                 AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[0.03],                 AxesLabel -> {"t", "The seven order Fourier series expansion"}]},           Center]      ![The seven order Fourier series expansion](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TAmCy.png) Furthermore,I encounter a problem about Taylor Series that we can use the approximate value of Maclaurin Series to replace a function. I can see the degree of closeness between them by changing the variable n. That's my trial:               Manipulate[               Show[                   Plot[E^x, {x, 0, 5}, PlotStyle -> Pink],                   Plot[Evaluate@Normal@Series[E^x, {x, 0, n}], {x, 0, 5},                         PlotRange -> {0, 150}]],              {{n, 6}, 0, 10, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nfGeM.png) Lastly ,the problem of plotting 2-D graph of `|x|+|2x+y|=1`, below is the solution:               Plot[y /. Solve[Abs@x + Abs@(x + y) == 1, y, Reals] //           Evaluate, {x, -2, 2}, AspectRatio -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yc75g.png) **Summary and my confusion:** In three tasks, I am alway using the `Evaluate` command. Firstly,I know this command and I will remember it when the MMA cannot give the result that I want. However, it is confusing to me that I don't know when to use it or not use it. Can someone help me?
