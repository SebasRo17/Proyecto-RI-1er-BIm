Mathematica runs behind, while another window is selected. When I press print screen, I want mathematica too detect this and call a function with the picture as argument.               Paste[];     Image[%[[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]]      Returns the screenshot, but I need it to be one command and picture shouldnt be almost destroyed as it happens with the command above. How should I do this?
