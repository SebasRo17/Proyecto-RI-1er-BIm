Suppose you've had a recruiter contact you about a position at a medium-large to large company, and went for an interview and such, and seriously considered the position but ultimately you decided against joining, or they decided against hiring you for that particular position because they had someone more qualified show up. But time elapses, your circumstances change, and you realize that working there might be a better idea now (or they have other positions available)... How long should you wait before interviewing at the same company again?
