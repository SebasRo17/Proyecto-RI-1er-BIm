after 6 hours reading about string patterns, string manipulations and trying ..and trying..I officially give up (for now) and ask for some help. I have some unorderly equations you will find here Note: I only have 6 equations shown here, but actually it's 50 equations. I want to 1) extract the coefficients of every equation and 2) put them in a 50x50 matrix (to get a nice coefficient matrix for this linear system) on the right position, which is indicated by the number behind the name of the variable. For example:               ba5 = 255.587802741733 + 0.416407328023007*ba4 + 0.347918861182194*ba7 + 0.256752019528632*ba42 + 0.142629613367709*ba38 - 0.153600910218342*ba27 - 0.157696503802691*ba39      ba5 means that I want to fill the 5th row of the matrix. ba4 is the 4th column, ba7 is the 7th column, ba42 is the 42th. So in the 4th column the coefficient 0.4164... should be copied and in the 7th the coefficient 0.3479..and so on. As another example look at the second equation:               ba6 = 0.387399976154608*ba8 + 0.343433662895965*ba4 + 0.17517619838171*ba7 + 0.116548914112818*ba44 - 6.80424536420765      Here it is row 6 I want to fill. But this time it should copy the coefficients to the 8th(ba8), 4th(ba4),7th(ba7) and 44th(ba44) column. Additionally I need to copy the independent variable (in this case ba5 and ba6) on the right side of the equation and the constant to the left side to get a system in the form of A*x=y with A as my 50x50 matrix, x as my vector of ba's (ba4, ba5,ba7 asf) and y as my constants (255.587 in the first equation and 6.80 in the second). Right now, my brain is a little bit messed up and I hope you guys can understand what I mean. If not, please ask. EDIT: You can download all equations here Note: They are not continuously numbered and it's 41 equations, my bad :/ EDIT: I tried it like this, but I get some error messages:                 Table[Normal@       CoefficientArrays[        ToExpression[equations[[x]]], {Ba1, ba2, ba3, ba4, ba5, ba6, ba7,          ba8, ba9, ba10, ba13, ba17, ba18, ba19, ba20, ba21, ba22, ba23,          ba24, ba25, ba27, ba28, ba29, ba30, ba31, ba32, ba33, ba34, ba35,          ba36, ba37, ba38, ba39, ba40, ba41, ba42, ba43, ba44, ba45, ba46,          ba47}], {x, 1, 41}]      Errors: http://www.pic-upload.de/view-22173402/errors.png.html I guess it's because ToExpression assigns a value to my Ba's. The same which I use in the list of CoefficientArrays. But I can't use this function when I'm reading strings :/
