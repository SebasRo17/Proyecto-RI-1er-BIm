It appears in not just one language that comments can't be nested. Do you have a good solution for this problem? One workaround in C/C++ and Java is to only use the single-line comment but it becomes impossible then to comment out a larger block. I'm facing something like this:               </li><!--                     <li><!-- Save -->      So I must manually go through and edit the comments. Can you advice how we should handle this, in many languages? I'm not sure but maybe python has a solution for this with the `'''` way that might be able to include a `#` comment in python? `
