The following function $$g(x) = (1 + x^{1/a} )^a $$ should NOT have a Fourier transform, as far as I am aware, for any real values of $a$ since $g(x)$ is not nice in the sense of decays quickly enough to $0$ at infinity. However, doing:               g[x_, a_] := (1 + x^(1/a))^(a);     Plot[g[x, 2], {x, 0, 1000}]     FourierTransform[g[x, 2], x, Ï‰]       _Mathematica_ somehow comes up with the result: $$\frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{i}{2}\right) (\left| \omega \right| -\omega )}{\omega \left| \omega \right| ^{3/2}}$$ What is going on here?
