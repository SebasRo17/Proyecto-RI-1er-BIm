So I've done a lot of research and found that Codecademy has been mentioned several times on other forums. I got stuck in and chose JavaScript through Codecademy most probably thinking it was 'Java' and I'm now slightly concerned that I have made a bad choice.. due to the fact that I see posts mentioning JavaScript teaches bad habits and so on... Should I stop and learn other languages offered on 'Codecademy'? Should I stop using codecademy altogether? Or finally should I just wait until I start my degree and pose as a blank canvas? All opinions wanted, thank you. P.s I'm not entirely certain what jobs I will be applying for in the future but to give some indication I don't believe it will be website development and more so on the game or application designing side of things
