I currently work in tier 2 support for an ISP, but don't want to remain here indefinitely. My overall ambition is to be a programmer as it is what I really love to do. The problem is that I came to this conclusion later in my career path and have had only the chance to go back to school to earn an AS in Computer Science and have had no positions as a programmer. Being out of college for a long time now makes it very hard to go after a low level position as I don't have a BS (and realistically at this point, it won't happen for a while, if at all) and employers only seem interested in fresh graduates. I have had the opportunity recently to work on some special projects at my current position that involve coding in my preferred languages to solve various problems. I have now written various tools using a multitude of languages to solve these problems. Now I am not necessarily what I would consider competent in these languages, but I can get around them and I know all the fundamentals (autoit, vb.net, python, perl, pascal, c#, php, batch, bash). I am also very good at finding a way to code what I need when I don't know upfront how to do it. I have some code samples for all these languages that I have used to solve problems at work. How do I incorporate this experience into my resume to be a more viable candidate for an entry level position?
