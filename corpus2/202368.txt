I work at a BPO, actually a call center. My bosses saw the html tool I made to help me document customer concerns and steps I made to help them faster and more easy. With that, they made me the reporting guy. Then they asked me to create a executable file (.exe) which generates the stats or metrics of agents. I used c#, and ms access for the database for it. It took me 6 months to finish it, on my own. But I feel that's kind of a long period for a project like that. And when I look at my codes, I'm not satisfied myself. I really want to pursue programming/software development. Its just that I don't have proper training or education for it. I took computer engineering in college but my school isn't that good (I want to share the reason why but it'll just make this post longer). I've been doing research, reading ebooks about programming but I still can't grasp the essence of it. It's like, I can easily learn a language, IDE, technology etc., but I can't put them together. Can you, experts, tell me how I could see the bigger picture? Can you help me understand the following:   1. How are companies that makes/provides software solutions/programs start a project? Or how do they make them, in terms of process?   2. I've been seeing terms like software tester, unit testing, automation test etc. What are those and why are they being used or incorporated in the process? I have so much questions to ask, but when I try to post them, I tend to forget them, like at the tip of tounge. I hope you experts, can shed some light on those questions. I'm not trying to solicit points, but I really want to use the chat feature here so that when I have a quick question and learn more about programming/software development, I could easily chat with experts.
