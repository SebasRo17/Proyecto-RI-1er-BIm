I'm on Windows 8.1 with Mathematica 9.               Export["test.html",EvaluationNotebook[],"MathOutput"\[RightArrow]"GIF","CSS"->None]          Export["test.html",EvaluationNotebook[],"CSS"->None,"MathOutput"\[RightArrow]"GIF"]      > Export::argt: Export called with 4 arguments; 2 or 3 arguments are expected. > >> > > Export::noelem: MathOutput[RightArrow]GIF is not a valid set of export > elements for the HTML format. >> I think picture is clear to show the problem. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WP3hk.png) `"CSS" -> None, "MathOutput" \[RightArrow] "GIF"` are options? right? and order sensitive? `"CSS" -> None` seems to be an argument? of course it's an option in the help page of HTML,
