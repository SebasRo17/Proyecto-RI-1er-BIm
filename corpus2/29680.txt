This is somewhat related to another question i just asked, but I'm freelancing **solo and remotely** for a contractor who is to project management, what big ball of mud is to code, so to speak. I've been thinking a lot about working on a proposition to deal with his projects in a truly agile way. As I see it, this would involve several client- friendly and web-based apps :   * basecamp for communication   * github as a repository   * pivotal tracker for user-stories and as a display of work in progress   * some tool to gather acceptance tests (will upvote suggestions !) I've done a fair bit of reading on agile, and all good resources put much emphasis on the importance of communication in the team, to the point they are _discouraging agile for non-colocated teams_. Being the only programmer this seemed less of an issue, but as I'll rarely meet the client (if at all), **I'm worried the communication may not be effective enough to enable this kind of management**. Edit : Other people on the team would include :   \- customers (business people)   \- product manager (my client's client)   \- project manager (my client)   \- ui designer
