I'm a front end developer...I've never done ANY backend, although I did take a course in databases once. (I have a comp sci degree; I'm a competent programmer, I just haven't done any backend web stuff before.) So I'm trying to figure out how the framework relates to the database. Presumably they're set up separately, and the framework receives requests from the website and sends them to the database, then receives the response and handles it appropriately to deliver the content correctly? It's basically a complex intermediary for all the web-app logic? Am I far off? Need a good explanation of this.
