This is a little general, so I will try to make it as specific as possible. I used Mathematica a fair amount to derive and check analytical solutions to problems in theoretical economics. Lots of derivatives, integrals over probability distributions, root-finding, etc. I also find myself using the Manipulate[Plot] functions a lot to investigate the basic behavior and shape of equations to help conjecture solutions and outcomes. However, I feel like a large amount of what I do is an absurd kluge. My notebooks rapidly become an unreadable mess, and I often find myself accidentally clashing variable definitions or mis-specifying function definitions under Plots. I probably end up restarting the kernel 3-4 times a session just because. Some of this has improved over time simply by learning more about the language and developing my own workflow, but I feel like it's a little inefficient and that I'm probably re-inventing the wheel (octagonal wheels at that) a lot. Are there any online or printed resources for people who use Mathematica for the things I do? Alternatively, does anyone else use Mathematica for this type of exploratory work and have a short list of best practices?
