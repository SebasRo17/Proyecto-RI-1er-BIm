I am currently working on a small project in which I work with some "static data", which is extracted from one source. The data might change from time to time (up to once a week). I don't need all of the information the data includes in my project so to allow easier and a more logical access to it I wrote some small tool that converts the extracted data into my desired format. The conversion is mostly dropping data I don't need, and splitting some strings into arrays. No intensive calculations or anything. But, I drop more than 50% of the original data because their is no need for it. Now since it is static data would it make more sense to just store that converted data and do all further operations from this data or would it make more sense to convert from the raw data on the fly? Since the project is in JavaScript speed of course is important, but if converting on the fly has significant advantages it might make more sense to go with that approach. It is static data from a computer game that defines several units and other objects within the game. They are stored in JSON therefore I can easily use them in JavaScript. But I don't need a lot of the information, just some parts of it to build a kind of "encyclopedia", now since the data is already present in JSON I was wondering if I should just use it or convert it before usage.
