I am building an Android guitar application and I need a way for `GuitarString` objects to notify multiple listeners that it has just been played. This includes the current `Activity` and all instances of `GuitarStringView` that have it as their `GuitarString` (the guitar is displayed twice, zoomed in & out). I have so far handled this by having a `ArrayList<OnPlayedListener>` on `GuitarString` and each `GuitarStringView` or `Activity` adds themselves to that list. My `Guitar` class is a Singleton (which I know some may frown upon) so now I have to make sure objects remove themselves from the array of listeners when they're disposed of. So my question is, is this a good approach, or is there a pattern that I should be using to handle this?
