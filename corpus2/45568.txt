Does somebody know how to get the correlation matrix when using `FindGraphCommunities` (Social Network analysis) using the "Spectra" option? Can somebody tell me as well where the package for Social Network analysis (to see construction of function) resides in the Wolfram file system? I checked in Combinatorica, but I don't find the functions of Social Network analysis. (Mathematica V9)
