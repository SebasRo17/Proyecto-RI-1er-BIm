I was recently admitted into a Computing and Software Systems program (basically software engineering) and one of the first courses I'll be taking is called _Mathematical Principles of Computing_. The course description: _"Integrating mathematical principles with detailed instruction in computer programming. Explores mathematical reasoning and discrete structures through object-oriented programming. Includes algorithm analysis, basic abstract data types, and data structures."_ I'm not a fan of math, but I've been doing well in all my math classes mostly A's and B's ever since I started two years ago, and I've been doing math every quarter - never took a quarter without math - so I've been doing it all in sequence without gaps. However, I'm worried about this class. I've read briefly on what discrete math is and from what my advisor told me, its connection with computer science is that it has alot to do with proving algorithms. One thing that my instructors briefly touched on and never went into detail was proving algorithms, and when I tried, I just wasn't very good at mathematical induction. It's one of the things that I ignored every time it showed up in a homework problem (usually in Calculus III which I'm finishing up right now). Questions:   1\. What can I expect from this class?   2\. How can I prepare myself for this class?   3\. Other tips? Thank you.
