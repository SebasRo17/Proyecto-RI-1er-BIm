I have some data:               data={{"a", 1, 1}, {"a", 1, 2}, {"a", 1, 3},            {"c", 2, 1}, {"b", 2, 2}, {"b", 2, 3},            {"c", 3, 1}, {"a", 3, 2}, {"a", 3, 3}}      When I use:               Sort[data]      I get the list ordered in incremental order first with column 1 then by 2 and last by the third. Suppose I want the first column in increasing order but the second in decreasing order and the third again in increasing order. How do I do that. I tried with Sort and SortBy but that doesn't work. Output should be: > a 3 2 > > a 3 3 > > a 1 1 > > a 1 2 > > a 1 3 > > b 2 2 > > b 2 3 > > c 3 1 > > c 2 1 It's probably a simple question but apparently not obvious to me.
