I'm resistant to calling the "main" class the same as the namespace, but I sometimes find myself needing it. Considering I'm using the `Vendor.Namespace.[Subnamespace].Class` formula, imagine this scenario:               [MyFramework]         [Database]             Database             Sql             Schema             DriverAbstract             DriverInterface             [Drivers]                 Mysql                 Postgresql                 Sqlite      obs: `[]` are for namespaces, the others are classes. Now, I could call the `Database` class `Connection` instead, but when I import the namespace `MyFramework.Database` I would only see `Connection` in the code (but connection to what?). Other solution would be calling it `DatabaseConnection`, but is that really necessary? I would like to hear your thoughts and ideas on that problem. Thank you (: Sidequest: also, what are your thougths on `DriverAbstract` and `DriverInterface`? Should they fit better in the `[Drivers]` namespace? Should I call `DriverAbstract` just `Driver`?
