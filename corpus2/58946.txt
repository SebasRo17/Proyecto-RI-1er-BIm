I have mathematical model based on equation: $y(x) = 1 - \sum_{b=1}^{\inf} 2c_b \sin(c_b x/L) \exp(ax) $ (1), where $c_b$ are the positive roots of equation: $c_b \cot c_b + aL = 0$ (2). $L$ is a known constant, and $a$ is parameter. I would like to fit the model to experimental data and obtain value of $a$. How to implement model based on system of such equations to _Mathematica's_ FindFit? In particular, my problem lies in the second equation, which has more than one solution, and every positive one must be accounted in eq.1. Any help appreciated.
