Suppose a REST API, in response to a HTTP `GET` request, returns some additional data in a sub-object `owner`:               {       id: 'xyz',       ... some other data ...       owner: {         name: 'Jo Bloggs',         role: 'Programmer'       }     }      Clearly, we don't want anyone to be able to `PUT` back               {       id: 'xyz',       ... some other data ...       owner: {         name: 'Jo Bloggs',         role: 'CEO'       }     }      and have that succeed. Indeed, we probably aren't going to even _implement_ a way for that to even potentially succeed, in this case. But this question is not just about sub-objects: what, in general, should be done with data that should not be modifiable in a PUT request? Should it be required to be missing from the PUT request? Should it be silently discarded? Should it be checked, and if it differs from the old value of that attribute, return a HTTP error code in the response? Or should we use RFC 6902 JSON patches instead of sending the whole JSON?
