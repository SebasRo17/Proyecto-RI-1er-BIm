I have table like this:               t = {False, False, False, 4.5, 6.789, 1.23, 0.98, False, False}      and I want to know how many False values I have at the beginning and at the end of the table. I made:               size = Length[t]     t = Cases[t,Except[False]];     size2 = Length[t]     diff = size - size2      But this counts number of all `'False'` values inside the table. But I want to know how many is at the beginning and how many at the end (so i my example I have: 3 at the beginning and 2 at the end). How can I solve that?
