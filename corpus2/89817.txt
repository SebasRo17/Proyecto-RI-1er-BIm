Is anybody using **Hadoop** on **Windows** (Win32 or Win64) in **production** for serious work?   * If you've tried it and rejected this combination can you give your (top) reasons?   * If you managed to make it stable can you give an impression of how much work it took? * * * **Background:** My company is 100% Windows. There's not much I can do about this other than use the tools I'm given. According to the Hadoop documentation **only** UNIX-like platforms are recommended for production environments. Windows environments are currently considered to be experimental. I've tried some of the basic Hadoop Set-up on win32, and there seem to be a lot of gotchas, and I'm starting to suspect that this might be a foolish line of research. I understand that Hadoop scripts depend to some extent on UNIX features such as Bash, Rsync, SSH which could be provided by Cygwin - however I'm not planning on becoming a pioneer. I'd like to run something which is somewhat standard. I want a decent chance of being able to get some community support if there's something I cannot solve all by myself. I'm willing to invest some time to get this working on the company systems, but I'd like some reassurance from more pioneering types who have been there before. Alternatively I'd like some good advice from somebody who knows it's not worth bothering with!
