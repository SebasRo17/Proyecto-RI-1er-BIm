Here's a bit information about me, before starting with the question. I am a Computer Science Undergraduate, Java being my primary coding language. The basic problem in my University are the teaching standards. No one is concerned about teaching coding knowledge to students, rather than just theoretical knowledge. The effect being, most of my fellow college mates don't understand programming at all. Even I haven't been able to come out of the traditional programming environment, which limits my coding to an extent. What are the possible ways by which I can develop and expand my programming/coding skills. Also, can you suggest the sources for the same? **Edited** : Sources suggesting development of coding skills.
