> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  When should I start learning a PHP Framework I am an absolute beginner programmer. I've got lots of theoretical understanding from university a decade ago but no practical experience. I want to remedy that with a hobby project that would be similar to a real-world sellable web app. I've chosen PHP in order to avoid OS specifics, build process, etc. **Should I start out using a framework, or coding everything by hand? What would the benefits of using a framework be?** I have briefly looked at PHP Code Ignition and it does a good job of praising its own benefits. I am sure that is true for an experienced developer, but does it also apply to a beginner?
