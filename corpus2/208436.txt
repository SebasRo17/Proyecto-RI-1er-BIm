In light of recent revelations about widespread government monitoring of data stored by online service providers, zero-knowledge services are all the rage now. A zero-knowledge service is one where all data is stored encrypted with a key that is not stored on the server. Encryption and decryption happens entirely on the client side, and the server never sees either plaintext data or the key. As a result, the service provider is unable to decrypt and provide the data to a third party, even if it wanted to. To give an example: SpiderOak can be viewed as a zero-knowledge version of Dropbox. As programmers, we rely heavily on, and trust some of our most sensitive data - our code - to a particular class of online service providers: code hosting providers (like Bitbucket, Assembla, and so on). I am of course talking about private repositories here - the concept of zero-knowledge does not make sense for public repositories. My questions are:   1. Are there any technological barriers to creating a zero-knowledge code hosting service? For example, is there something about the network protocols used by popular version control systems like SVN, Mercurial, or Git that would make it difficult (or impossible) to implement a scheme where the data being communicated between the client and the server is encrypted with a key the server does not know?   2. Are there any zero-knowledge code hosting services in existence today?
