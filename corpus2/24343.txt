Speaking as someone with an Electronic Engineering rather than Computer Science degree, what is the **one bit** of computer science I should know to make me a better **real world** programmer? (By real world I mean something I'm going to use and benefit from in my day to day job as a programmer - for instance I'd suggest understanding database normalisation is of more practical use than understanding a quick sort for which there are lots of libraries).
