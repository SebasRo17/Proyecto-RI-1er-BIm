I'm wondering about doing a Qt Certification Exam this year, but I'm not 100% sure the investment is worth. I'm considering it because I think it could be a nice **+** on my resume, and as you know, I'm all for improving my software engineer persona. As I already earn a BSc and MSc degrees in computer stuff, I guess I see the certification process as some kind of adventure. Anyway, I know I'll spend a lot of time preparing myself for the exam and I just wanted to know if a Qt certification is worth the effort. Apparently there are 2 certificates that you can get in the Qt world:   * **Nokia Certified Qt Developer** (basic)   * **Nokia Certified Qt Specialist** (advanced) Nowadays I build cross-platform software in C++ and this exam would fit beautifully in my resume. My main concern is that, **given the obscure future of Qt** , I might be throwing time and money out the window. I'm looking for some advice regarding the usefulness of such certifications.
