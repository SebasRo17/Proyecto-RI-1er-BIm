I'd like to read the documentation of Azure Active Directory on my kindle (or similar device), but don't want to use "Print to Kindle" for each and every page. Is the Microsoft documentation for this technology available in other formats? (.chm, PDF, etc). If an alternative format is available, then I can adapt that to my needs. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj673460.aspx
