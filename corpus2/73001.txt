After a few years writing good ol' straight, archaic, homely C/C++, I'm finally going to give in and learn .NET. I'm looking for the best way to become .NET-competent quickly. I use VS2005 C/C++ Express and I see there's a CLR choice in the "new project" wizard. I _think_ that must be a way into the world of managed code. Is that a reasonable entry to .NET? Do I have to learn C# or some crazy stuff instead? Or maybe [shudder] CLR is just the first baby step into .NET?
