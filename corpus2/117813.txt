So I have a couple of software/site in my portfolio. They make money but not a whole lot. So I decided to get some job experience, mainly applying to Java/PHP junior development positions. The problem is that I answer all the technical questions correctly and we schedule to do a coding "test", the final phase of the interview. I can never relax and over think things and end up doing the test very slowly. OR sometimes I just hit a block and find it very difficult to think on my feet. I don't understand this because other stuff I had written were solving far more complex problems while the "Test" is actually brutally simple such as writing and testing palindrome. Other times, they will give me a logic test with flows to math operations and again I won't be able to do it in the time they assign. I know I can write sellable software/websites that can generate small revenues and find ways to solve problems but I have great difficulty with simple coding tests in interviews. Any suggestions?
