In _Mathematica_ 7 it is very easy to conditionally suppress plotting of individual lines using `If`:               Plot[{       If[x^2 < 2, x^2],       If[Exp[x] > x^2, Exp[x]],       If[False, x]                (* check recommended by Rahul *)      },      {x, -2, 2},      PlotStyle -> Thick, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fu16v.png) Or more verbosely using `Piecewise` and `Indeterminate`:               Plot[{       Piecewise[{{x^2, x^2 < 2}}, Indeterminate],       Piecewise[{{Exp[x], Exp[x] > x^2}}, Indeterminate],       Piecewise[{{x, False}}, Indeterminate]      (* check recommended by Rahul *)       },      {x, -2, 2},      PlotStyle -> Thick, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fu16v.png) It is reported that neither method works in **version 9.0.0** (at least on OSX.) Furthermore it is reported that my attempt using `ConditionalExpression` also fails:               Plot[{       ConditionalExpression[x^2, x^2 < 2],       ConditionalExpression[Exp[x], Exp[x] > x^2]       },      {x, -2, 2},      PlotStyle -> Thick, Frame -> True]      Plotting a zero is reported to "work" but that is hardly a solution:               Plot[{       Piecewise[{{x^2, x^2 < 2}}],       Piecewise[{{Exp[x], Exp[x] > x^2}}]       },      {x, -2, 2},      PlotStyle -> Thick, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qk3Tl.png) **1\. Is this indeed a bug in version 9.0.0?** **2\. Is there a workaround for the affected systems?**
