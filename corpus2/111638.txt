I was thinking about that, and I had some doubts. When I declare an interface, for example:               public interface MyInterface     {        public void method1();        public void method2();     }      Could these interface methods be considered abstract? What I mean is that the concept of an abstract method is: > An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation > (without braces, and followed by a semicolon). So, could these methods be considered abstract? They are not "pure" abstract methods as I'm not using the `abstract` word, but conceptually, it looks like they are. What can you tell me about it? Thanks.
