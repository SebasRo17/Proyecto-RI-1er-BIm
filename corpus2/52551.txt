I forked a project that was dual licensed under the GPL and a commercial license. Since my code was open source and the GPL being what it is, I started by releasing my app under the GPL. But now I'm thinking about dual licensing the project and can't figure out what to do. Since I have copyright on a majority of the code (most of the code was either rewritten or new), can I just pick a commercial license or do I have to buy the upstream commercial license since I'm technically a "derivative" of the project?
