I'm having a funny but also terrible problem. I'm about to launch a new (iPhone) app. It's a turn-based multiplayer game running on my own custom backend. But I'm afraid to launch. For some reason, I think it might become something big and that its popularity will kill my poor lonely single server + MySQL database. On one hand I'm thinking that if it's growing, I'd better be prepared and have a scalable infrastructure already in place. On the other hand I just feel like getting it out into the world and see what happens. I often read stuff like "premature optimization is the root of all evil" or people saying that you should just build your killer game now, with the tools at hand, and worry about other stuff like scalability later. I'd love to hear some opinions on this from experts or people with experience with this. Thanks!
