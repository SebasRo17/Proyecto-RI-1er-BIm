I want to store an encrypted string (specifically, email addresses) in a database. I'm currently using Python and MySQL. I was initially going to use MySQL's AES_ENCRYPT/DECRYPT to handle it, but then got to wondering if one was was better than another. It seems that if I tie it to a database function, that could potentially lock me into the database and at this point that selection may change down the road. Otherwise I would look to handling it in the Python code, but part of me thinks that having it all handled on the back end would free you to use whatever front end logic and code you wanted to. Any thoughts or ideas?
