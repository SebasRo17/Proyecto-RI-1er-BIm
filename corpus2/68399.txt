I am looking for some insight from you smart people on SO. I'm a relatively new developer (3+ years of experience) primarily on the .NET framework, and I'm absolutely terrible at knowing how to properly estimate even the smallest of projects. I know that it's going to be a pretty big hindrance to my upward mobility as well as my joy of programming if I don't figure out good tools, methodologies, approaches, etc. Therefore, I am seeking your knowledge and wisdom on this subject. I have heard of SWAG and have most of the time employed that to give my estimates in the past, but I don't feel comfortable just "feeling it out." Certainly, from my experience of doing similar projects I can recall how long it took me and give a relatively accurate estimate, but even that isn't always very accurate. Plus, it seems that inherent in every project are gotchas and unforeseeables to make estimating even more difficult. Thoughts?
