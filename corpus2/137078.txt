I want to contribute to open source projects on Github. Mostly, I'd like to just start out fixing small bugs or adding features. I don't have a particular project in mind. I'd like to work on C, C++, Python, .NET, Java, etc projects. However, my problem is I can't figure out how to find anything on Github. I did find a page on Explore Github, that lists C projects. Basically, it lists the top 5 "watched" C projects. OK, that's fine, but I want to see more than 5. Sourceforge was/is great because you can browse projects by programming language. Also, SourceForge has or used to have a forum for finding projects that are asking for help. I can't find any of that on Github. There is a "Search" feature that, seems fairly useless for finding projects to contribute to. I tried the advanced search, setting it to "Repositories" and "C" for the programing language. However, you have to put something int he search; although I just want to browse titles and descriptions of projects. So, I tried putting "network" just to see what comes up. It gives just a list of everybody's fork of every project there is. Is there any way I can search, say through a third party or something, for projects in a sane way? It seems like Github should have such a thing; I would just choose from Sourceforge since I can search there, but I want to establish a Github profile, since that is the flavor of the month and there are all these fanboys on Hacker News that seem to think a Github profile is better than a Resume/CV. :)
