I hear people saying that _"a true programmer is not bound to a programming language, because programming goes beyond that"_ , and albeit agreeing on the premise, i consider my professionality pretty bound to the languages i know. So i would say that this statement is practically false. Before this question goes closed, what is your opinion?
