ASP.Net is Active Server Pages using .Net Framework Wikipedia says > It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET > Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) > technology. While answering this question following thought came to me – why Microsoft named it’s Web API as “ASP.Net Web API”. There are no `Pages` involved in Web API. Then why do some people call it as “Active Server Pages .Net Web Api” ? I believe there are some `fundamental features` of ASP.Net shared with Web API. So what are they? Another observation - why is the tag in `programmers` naming it as "asp.net- mvc-web-api"? **Reference** :   1. ScottGu's Blog- ASP.NET Web API
