Here is the data http://wikisend.com/download/405620/datapoints.dat I have (x,y) data for a grid around an airfoil and I am trying to figure out how I can draw radial and polar lines for the grid to look like a mesh. I have tried ListPlot and ListLinePlot, but I have only managed to get circular lines, but not radial ones. Here is what the data looks like: ![Airfoil](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HTcHG.png) and here is ListLinePlot ![Airfoil LLplot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5L6b2.png) How can I improve these images?
