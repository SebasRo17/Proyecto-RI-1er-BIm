People always need concentration during work tasks, but i feel programming requires even a higher level. In general my biggest problem is getting distracted by my articles feeds, but i also give it a lot importance to keeping up to date.   1. What are recommended habits or tips to avoid distraction during long programming sessions?   2. How to keep up to date with technologies without investing a big amount of time reading and browsing?  Thanks in advanced.
