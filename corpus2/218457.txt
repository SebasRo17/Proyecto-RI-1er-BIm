I can be completely wrong but I vaguely remember hearing from a podcast that according to Visual Studio's license, a developer who works with Visual Studio professionally at their work place automatically has the license to use it in their personal life. That means a developer may not have to pay for Visual Studio to legally use/own it. Again, I can be completely wrong but if I'm right, can someone confirm with a source?
