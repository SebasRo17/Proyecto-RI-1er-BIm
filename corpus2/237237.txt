Given a REST API, which throws an exception when handling a request from a client. Whenever the REST API throws an exception, it's logged and the application (in this case a console application) closes to prevent further damage. Should I send a response to the client whose request resulted in an exception, indicating that an error occured or should I let the client hang and deal with it (timeout)?
