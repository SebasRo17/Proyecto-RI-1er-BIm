I am designing a new system that has one central web service and several site web services which are spread across the country and some overseas. It has some data that must be identical on all sites. So my plan is to maintain that data in the central web service and then "sync" the data to sites. This includes inserts, edits and deletes. I see a problem when deleting, if one site has used the record, then I need to undo the delete that has happened on the other servers. This lead me to idea that I need some sort of transaction system that can work across different web servers. Before I design one from scratch, I would like to know if anyone has come across this sort of problem and if there are any frame works or even design patterns that might aid me?
