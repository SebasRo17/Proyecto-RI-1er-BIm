This is a viewpoint I've started to realize recently about some companies that I have worked for. They had their own software product that they developed in- house but most of the focus was on building an in-person sales team to push their product to businesses throughout the country. I figure that companies that are exclusively "online", meaning that their revenue source comes from online transactions where there is no "face" of the company to the customer would have a different work culture. Just curious if anyone has worked for both types of companies and notices a difference. I myself am hoping to get more into contract programming and figure that companies that don't have to employ a sales-force and things like that would be more focused on technology and maybe even willing to be flexible on partial telecommute, etc
