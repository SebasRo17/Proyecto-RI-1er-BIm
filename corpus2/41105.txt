I try to numerically compute this integral and I don't figure out why on earth Mathematica is not able   to do it. Is my input correct? Does it possibly have a closed form?               N[Integrate[1/2 (-2 - π BesselI[1, x] StruveL[0, x] +        BesselI[0, x] (2 + π StruveL[1, x]))/(E^x - 1), {x, 0, Infinity}]]      **EDIT:** the correct answer is **0.6076895380471122** OK, here is the infinite series representation of the above integral $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left(\arcsin\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)-\frac{1}{k}\right)$$
