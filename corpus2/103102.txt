I start my new job next week as a PHP Developer which is my dream job but it's going to be object-orientated which I've only done in Java whilst at university. My question is regarding PHP tools - what are the best IDE's (I use notepad++), what versioning packages work best and bug trackers etc, so I was just wondering what tools the PHP developers out there use in their working lives.
