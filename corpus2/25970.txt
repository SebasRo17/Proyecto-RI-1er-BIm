Let's say I want to convolve two functions (f and g), a gaussian with a breit- wigner:               f[x_] := 1/(Sqrt[2 π] σ)Exp[-(1/2) ((x - μ)/σ)^2];     g[x_] := 1/π (γ/((x - μ)^2 + γ^2));      One way is to use Convolve like:               Convolve[f[x],g[x],x,y];      But that gives:               (γ Convolve[E^(-((x - μ)^2/(2 σ^2))),1/(γ^2 + (x - μ)^2), x, y])/(Sqrt[2] π^(3/2) σ)      ,which means it couldn't do the convolution. I then tried the integration (the definition of the convolution):               Integrate[f[x]*g[y - x], {x, 0, y}, Assumptions->{x > 0, y > 0}]      But again, it couldn't integrate. I know that there are functions that can't be integrated analytically, but it seems to me that whenever I go into convolution, I find another function that can't be integrated. Is the numerical integration the only way to do convolution in Mathematica (besides those simple functions in the examples), or am I doing something wrong? My target is to convolute a crystal-ball with a breit-weigner. The CB is something like:               Piecewise[{{norm*Exp[-(1/2) ((x - μ)/σ)^2], (     x - μ)/σ > -α},     {norm*(n/Abs[α])^n*      Exp[-(1/2) α^2]*((n/Abs[α] - Abs[α]) - (        x - μ)/σ)^-n, (x - μ)/σ <= -α}}]      I've done this in C++ but I thought I try it in Mathematica and use it to fit some data. So please tell me if I have to make a numerical integration routine in Mathematica or there's more to the analytic integration.
