With the help of almighty Mathematica 9, I got from this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/79l19.jpg) To this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rwDwl.png) with this code:               MorphologicalBinarize[       Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/79l19.jpg"]~        ColorConvert~"Grayscale"];     Binarize[LaplacianGaussianFilter[%, 10]];     CommonestFilter[MaxFilter[DeleteSmallComponents[%], 2.3], 10];     SelectComponents[MorphologicalComponents[%], "Length", -1] // Image;     Pruning[Thinning[%, Padding -> 1], Padding -> 1]      I'm sure the code could be shorter and is perhaps in places redundant, but that's not why I'm posting here, as because now, I'm interested in measuring the length of the curve that I got. I wanted to create a tool to test this theory whenever would I want so. I couldn't find a way - I thought I was close when I transposed `ImageData` position on ListPlot, alas, I swiftly got lost there. I am very new to this wonderful tool and am learning it by trial and error. I'd appreciate any form of help.
