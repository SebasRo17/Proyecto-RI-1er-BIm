I am new to Mathematica so I might be asking a trivial question, although I wasn't able to resolve it for several days. I am trying to optimize a 7x7 matrix with 12 variables with a certain evaluation function. The evaluation function is defined as:               SumCenter[v1_, v2_, v3_, v4_, v5_, v6_, v7_, v8_, v9_, v10_, v11_, v12_] :=        Re[Sum[N[Func[v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8, v9, v10, v11, v12, t]], {t, 0, 3, 0.01}]]      `Func` is a time dependent outcome of the matrix which is a little long if I tried to write it down here. Some functions that are used are: `MatrixExp[]`,`Tr[]`. I can guarantee that it gives a near accurate number, although it generates a very small amount of imaginary number which is not supposed to be there. That is why there is the `Re[]` function. `N[]` might not be necessary. Then I used `NMinimize` to find the optimal value and the variables:               NMinimize[{SumCenter[z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6, z7, z8, z9, z10, z11, z12],        -1 <= z1 <= 1 && -1 <= z2 <= 1 && -1 <= z3 <= 1 && -1 <= z4 <= 1 &&       -1 <= z5 <= 1 && -1 <= z6 <= 1 && -1 <= z7 <= 1 && -1 <= z8 <= 1 &&        -1 <= z9 <= 1 && -1 <= z10 <= 1 && -1 <= z11 <= 1 && -1 <= z12 <= 1},        {z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6, z7, z8, z9, z10, z11, z12},        StepMonitor :> Print["Step to z1 = ", z1]]      The calculation did not begin. Even though I put StepMonitor, it did not show the first step. I made a rather simple version with 3x3 matrix and 3 variables, which worked perfectly. I would like to figure out what might be causing the problem.
