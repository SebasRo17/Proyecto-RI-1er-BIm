Consider               {x->1}      which has `FullForm`               List[Rule[x, 1]]      and, therefore,               MatchQ[{x->1}, List[___Rule]]      produces `True`. Now consider               <|x->1|>      which has `FullForm`               Association[Rule[x, 1]]      but               MatchQ[<|x->1|>, Association[___Rule]]      produces `False` In fact,               MatchQ[<|x->1|>, Association[___]]      produces `False`. Any ideas? (I'm trying to make some MathLink xxxxxxxx WSTP functions for serializing C structs as Associations, and this lacuna is messing me up).
