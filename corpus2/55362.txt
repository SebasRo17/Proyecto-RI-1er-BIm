I use FontFamily->"Webdings" in interfaces in several places, but among other things for custom opener icons, for example I use the following "icons" for open and closed openers: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UBTWn.png) In version 10 this is what happens: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xLF7g.png) Both screen grabs are taken on the same computer. Webdings is installed. I open V9 and evaluate and take a grab. I close V9 and open V10 and do the same. I knew the Mathematica fonts were different in V10 compared to V9 but I don't understand why Webdings would be being rendered differently. I've tested a hand full of other fonts, including Wingdings, and have not observed any difference between V9 and V10. Can anyone enlighten me why Webdings is now different? I'm on OS X 10.9.4 but my interfaces have worked on both Windows and Mac with V9. **Edit** I always use OS X. On my current machine I am running OS X 10.9.4. I have V8, V9, and V10 installed. None of these have a `/SystemFiles/CharacterEncodings/Webdings.m` Regarding the error message that @m_goldberg gets when using `FromCharacterCode`. The same message occurs in V8 and V9 so I think that is irrelevant to the present issue. V8 ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PBFsz.png) V9 ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Okwvj.png) So the same error message occurs for `FromCharacterCode` in previous versions but it clearly has no bearing on the using of `Style[6,FontFamily->"Webdings"]`. The present issue is that you could use Webdings as a font in V8 and V9 on OS X and now you can't.
