When `FullSimplify` invoked on a large expression, it can run for hours. If I do not have time to wait, and abort the evaluation, I get no result, although, conceivably, some forms simpler than the initial argument have been found already. Is it possible to create a version of `FullSimplify` that can display the simplest form found so far in a temporary cell, and return it if the evaluation is aborted?
