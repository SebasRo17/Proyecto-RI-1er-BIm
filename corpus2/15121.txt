I am in the process of creating a palette for a specialised "Save as HTML". For context please see this. How can I grab the CellTags from a Cell[...] object? This is my first iteration, aka testing code:               PaletteNotebook[      Module[{action, create},       create := NotebookCreate[];       action[nb_] := Module[{found, out, cell},         out = create;         SelectionMove[nb, Before, Notebook];         found = NotebookFind[nb, "Input", Next, CellStyle];         If[found != $Failed,          cell = NotebookRead[nb];          NotebookWrite[out, OptionValue[cell, CellTags]] (* 1 *),          NotebookWrite[out, "Not found"]          ];         ];       Button[Style["Blog it", 12, FontFamily -> "Times"],        action[InputNotebook[]],        Appearance -> "Palette"]       ]      ]      At the moment it just dumps data into a temporary empty notebook if it finds the Input cell, but the code at (* 1 *) does not print the CellTags the cell has in the `InputNotebook[]`. I am thinking that `OptionsPattern[]` may be the answer, but I am not sure how to use it. I tried               ...     cell = NotebookRead[nb];     tags = cell /. Cell[__, OptionsPattern[]] :> OptionValue[CellTags];     NotebookWrite[out, tags],     ...      but it doesn't work either.
