I am very interested in network programming and I want to build a VNC client for fun and for learning purposes. I have been Googling for resources about VNC client and server, but most of time, resources found were about how to use VNC not how to build or how it actually works in business layer so I can get an idea about how it could be simulated. Please suggest me any documentation / articles / resources related to this. Thanks in advance. It is my first post on Programmers Stackexchange site so please forgive me if this question is not appropriate for topic of this site.
