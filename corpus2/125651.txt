I'm programming Ruby. I'm programming Rails. It's zen, it makes fun and it's cool. But what are the real technical and foremost business advantages of Rails, I can tell a client? I know the implementation details should be aligned on the requirements of a project. But if I'm honest, if someone says: "Hey, why not using a wordpress and a little bit customized template? It's much cheaper!", I don't have enough good arguments for Rails. Especially for smaller and mid-scale projects. So, what do you tell your clients, when you think they should use Ruby/Rails?
