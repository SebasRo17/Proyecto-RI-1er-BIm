I want to start a little project, where I want to connect several of my devices. Some are Android mobile devices, others are desktop devices like a PC or laptop. Furthermore I want keep the project as generic as possible. Means I want to share it, so other people can use it. By connecting I mean send messages between them. My problem is, that I'am not sure what technology or architecture to use, and hope to get some advice from you. (I think this question is more about software architecture then gorilla vs. shark) I have considered several approaches already. I looked at Google's Cloud Messaging, but that seems not to fit my requirements, where several users can register to send independent messages. It looks more like, sending from one master to several devices. The next thing I thought about was something lile VLC did with its Android remote app, where the desktop application hosts something like a server to which the mobile app must connect. This seems to be limited to LAN and only fits to about 80% of my use cases. Is there another approach which does not require something like a server who is aware of all clients, which has to seperate the user's devices and route the messages?
