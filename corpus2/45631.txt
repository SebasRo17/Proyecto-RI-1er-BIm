I can get line profiles from images using imagej but it would be nice to be able to do this in my mathematica notebooks. I found this http://library.wolfram.com/examples/intensityprofiles/ after some google searches and it is exactly what I want to be able to do. However it seems they removed this package. I cant seem to figure out how to do this in v 9.0. Anyone know how to do this? Edit: I added a picture to make it more clear what I'm talking about. Its important that I can take an arbitrary (diagonal) line and that mathematica interpolates between pixels in a way that makes sense. Sorry if my formatting is off, this is my first post. ![I'm basically trying to do this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2nytg.png) UPDATE: This is what I think I'm going to use to do what I want. Obviously the display isn't made, and details need to be sorted out, but ImageValue interpolates automatically and seems like the Built-In to use. Thanks for the help everyone.                 img = Import["http://i.imgur.com/szcChXh.png?1"]         (*First Argument of ImageProfile is the arc length along the line profile,         incremented in steps of 1/(npts-1)*)         (*Second Argument of ImageValue is the parametric form of a line, incremented in                steps of 1/(npts-1)*)              ImageProfile[img_, x1_, y1_, x2_, y2_, npts_] :=           Table[{N@((i - 1)/(npts - 1)) Sqrt[(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2],             ImageValue[             img, {x1 + (x2 - x1) (i - 1)/(npts - 1),               y1 + (y2 - y1) (i - 1)/(npts - 1)}]}, {i, 1, npts}]         pt1 = {500, 300};         pt2 = {600, 600};        Show[img, Graphics[{Red, Thick, Line[{pt1, pt2}]}]]         ListPlot[ImageProfile[img, pt1[[1]], pt1[[2]], pt2[[1]], pt2[[2]],1000], Joined -> True]
