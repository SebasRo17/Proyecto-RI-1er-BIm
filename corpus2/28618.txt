The expression $\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{L^2 \sin ^2(\theta )}}{\sqrt{L^2 \cos ^2(\theta )}}\right)$ can be simplified to $\theta$. After some attempts I got the following to do the job.               ArcTan[Sqrt[L^2 Cos[θ]^2], Sqrt[L^2 Sin[θ]^2]] //      PowerExpand // TrigToExp // Simplify // PowerExpand      It appears rather clunky to me. Is there a better way to simplify this expression.
