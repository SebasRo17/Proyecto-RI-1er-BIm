I encountered to two problems with _Mathematica_ : one: How can I change the default font color of commands and functions in _Mathematica_ (which is black) to another color, so that whenever I wanted to write that command, the color of that, changes automatically? Actually, how can I set all define commands or functions with a specified color? Second: I want to copy a command from _Mathematica_ into _Microsoft Word_ For example the bellow one:               Plot[x^2 + 1, {x, 1, 5}]      I have colored `Plot` with Red and `x` is shown Green by default in _Mathematica_. But when I copy this command to _Word_ , all of those will be black; and if I want them colored I have to color them in the _Word_ again.
