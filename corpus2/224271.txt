Is there a common and accepted term for the manual tests done by programmers or users on software in lieu of or in addition to automated testing? For example, in a progression as follows:   1. "Desk Test" for the non-automated testing a programmer does while writing code.   2. "Unit Test" for an automated test for a particular class/method/function.   3. "Integration Test" for an automated test of multiple components working together.   4. "System Test" or "Acceptance Test" for application-wide tests that would be meaningful in conversation with the end user.   5. "User Test", for when we hand it to the user and ask them to find bugs. Are there better terms for #1 ("Desk Test") and #5 ("User Test")? (And I know that TDD would say write #2 before #1... but making that point is exactly why I want to know the right word for #1.)
