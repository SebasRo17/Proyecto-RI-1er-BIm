I'm going to try to keep this topic as generic as I can so the question isn't closed as too specific or whatever. Anyway, let's get to it. I currently work on a somewhat small project with 15-20 developers. We recently hired a few new people because we had the hours and it synched up well with the schedule. It was refreshing to see hiring done this way and not just throwing hours & employees at a problem. Alas, I could argue the hiring process still isn't perfect but that's another story for another day. Anyway, one of these developers is really under performing. The developer is green and has a lot of bad habits. Comes in later than I do and leaving earlier than I am. This in and of itself isn't an issue, but the lack of quality work makes it become a bit frustrating. When giving out tasking the question is no longer, what can realistically be given but now becomes - How much of the work will we have to redo? So as the project goes on, I'm afraid this might cause issues with the schedule. The schedule could have been defined as a bit aggressive; however, given that this person is under performing it now in my mind goes from aggressive to potentially chaotic. Yes, one person shouldn't make or break a schedule and that in and of itself is an issue too but please let's ignore that for right now. What's the best way to deal with this? I'm not the boss, I'm not the project lead but I've been around for a while now and am not sure how to proceed. Complaining to management comes across as childish and doing nothing seems wrong. I'll ask the community for insight/advice/suggestions.
