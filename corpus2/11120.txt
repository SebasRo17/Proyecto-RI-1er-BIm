The company I am leaving has asked that I make myself available to answer questions and/or debug programs occasionally should the need arise. I'm not opposed to this. After searching google for some kind of standard contract for this sort of thing, I didn't see any. Is there a standard contract for this sort of thing that you use? Are there any other steps I should take to ensure this kind of arrangement works smoothly?
