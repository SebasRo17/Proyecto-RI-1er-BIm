I have recently started to learn PHP and while reading through a bunch of different articles and questions posted on Stack Exchange I noticed everyone recommends learning a framework. While I am up for the task and already selected Zend as the framework I will start learning at some point, I have only just scratched the surface when it comes to PHP and from what I know one should have some experience in a language before learning a framework. I want to learn the language the right way since I want to get a job as a PHP developer (I already know HTML, CSS, Javascript). At the moment my knowledge of PHP is limited to it's syntax, OOP, cookies, sessions and form validation. I have also developed a blog which contains a search panel, login system and a forum. What I want to know is how much experience with core PHP should I have before starting to learn Zend? In what parts of PHP should I concentrate my efforts to become a good developer? I remember when I started learning Javascript I didn't pay enought attention to the language itself and went directly to jQuery, something that didn't go very well for me on the long run I don't want to make the same mistake again. I have found a similar question here but it didn't seem to answer my question.
