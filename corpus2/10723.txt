I am using a java library licensed under AGPL3. However, I would like to license my own work as BSD, such that my code could then be integrated in proprietary projects if one strips the library. Will I be allowed to do that? So far, I couldn't find a clear answer for my problem on the net or in the license text(not a lawyer). Dual-licensing seems cumbersome and ugly. EDIT: What happens if I use other libraries which are licensed under BSD or anything else?
