By running the following code:               a = Sin[y[t]];     sol = NDSolve[{Derivative[2][y][t] + 0.1*Derivative[1][y][t] + Sin[y[t]] == 0,      Derivative[1][y][0] == 0, y[0] == 1}, y,      {t, 0, 10}, Method -> {"EventLocator", "Event" -> Derivative[1][y][t] - y[t]}]      we can obtain that the `"Event"` happens at `t = 2.4985352432136567` . The value of `y[2.4985352432136567]` can be obtained by using `y[2.4985352432136567] /. sol`, which appears to be `-0.589753`. However, when I apply this method to `a` for `a[2.4985352432136567] /. sol`, the results appear to be `{Sin[InterpolatingFunction[{{0., 2.49854}}, <>][t]][2.49854]}`, and no specific value is obtained. My question is, how can I get the specific value of `a` at `t = 2.4985352432136567`?
