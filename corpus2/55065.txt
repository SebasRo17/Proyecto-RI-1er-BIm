I'm trying to write a function which for a list of trees checks if a given tree is isomorphic with any of the listed, and if not - adds it to the list. I tried to use both `Append` and `AppendTo`, but they don't work ( I checked for non-isomorphic trees, and whole loop is executed, but nothing is added to the list).   `Append` doesn't seem to work at all (I mean outside of the loop), and `AppendTo` works outside, but doesn't work in loop.   What can be a problem here?               checkIsomorph[outList_, seedling_] :=       For[i = 1, i <= Length[outList], i++,       If[IsomorphicGraphQ[outList[[i]], seedling], Break[],        If[i == Length[outList], AppendTo[outList, seedling],         Continue[]]]]
