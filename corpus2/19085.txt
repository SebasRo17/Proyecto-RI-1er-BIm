I have heard lots of anecdotal evidence that using VSS is a horrible idea because sooner or later, it will just lose/corrupt/delete all of your work. (I am even guilty of using such evidence as one of the motivating factors to switch to SVN a while back). However, though I really prefer Update/Commit to Checkout/Checkin, it is horrible over SVN and there isn't good branching support, I have never actually had a catastrophic VSS experience. Has VSS ever ruined your project/job/sanity? Old version or new? Is there truth behind the stories?
