I have a library that makes architecture to load data from server and display all controls in table layout. It works great but it have a lot of TODOs there. Also, this library in 99% created by me. I starts developing it in when I working in one company, continue developing in in other company - I just move code prototype to new working place. Library contain large amount of iPhone features/hacks/fixes that write again make no sense. All created iOS business applications by me, based on this library. When library become needed in few projects simultaneously, I wanted to make library open source on GitHub but my Team Lead ask to create private repository for it. Library contains and uses 12 open source libraries.   * So:      1. Is it a good idea to make such library open source? It contains all my iOS development experience.     2. How to argue my wish to make library open source for Team Lead?     3. If I can't make this library open source - can I use it in other company? In contract, thats I work with, said that I assign all copyrights to employer.
