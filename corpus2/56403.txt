i'm looking for metrics/standards/normatives to evaluate a given "Software Development Process". I'm NOT looking to evaluate the SOFTWARE itself (trough SQUARE and such), i'm trying to evaluate software development PROCESS. So, my question is if you could give me some pointers to find this standard, considering that "evaluation objetives" would be documentation quality, how good is the customer relation, how efective is the process, etc. Very much like a ISO 9000, and like CMMI on a sense, but much lightweight and concrete and process oriented, not company oriented. Please help, i'm trying to stablish the advantages of our development process as formal as i can.
