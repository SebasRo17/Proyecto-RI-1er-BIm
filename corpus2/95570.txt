I'm doing some development of a website on a VirtualBox guest running Ubuntu 11.04 (host is running Windows, but I want to do the web development in a Linux environment). My development languages are primarily PHP and Javascript (using Apache and node.js). The question is this: is there a good IDE for work under these conditions that can handle running virtualized? I tried Eclipse, and was not particularly thrilled with the performance; I'm wondering if there's some other way to do this than to do all my text editing in emacs.
