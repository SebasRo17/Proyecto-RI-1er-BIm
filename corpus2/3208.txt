Mathematica has several ways of generating random numbers: Congruential, ExtendedCA, Legacy, MersenneTwister, MKL, ParallelGenerator, ParallelMersenneTwister, Rule30CA. For `Method -> "Congruential"` the page notes that this generates low-quality randomness. What is known about the others? I came across a paper today (available here and here) showing that `Method -> "Rule30CA"` has an extremely small effective size, suggesting that it is probably unsuitable for simulation work. I was a little concerned on reading this, since there was nothing in the help that suggested it should not be used. Which of the others are known to be good? In particular, is the default `Method -> "ExtendedCA"` known to pass such tests as BigCrush or Dieharder? I know of results for the Mersenne Twister, of course (does well on all but the linear complexity tests). ## Summary of Results So Far   * Congruential: Low quality (per documentation)   * ExtendedCA: Apparently high-quality; Lichtblau reports (in an answer below) that it passes BigCrush.   * Legacy: Presumably low quality, else would not have been obsoleted   * MersenneTwister: Fairly high quality, though fails some BigCrush tests   * MKL: Similar to MersenneTwister?   * ParallelGenerator: What is this?   * ParallelMersenneTwister: Same as MersenneTwister?   * Rule30CA: Low quality (Meier & Staffelbach 1991, Sipper & Tomassini 1996) _This question touches on math and computer science, but this se seemed the best fit._
