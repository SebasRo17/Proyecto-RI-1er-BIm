I wanted to check something, but ran into troubles using HistogramDistribution in combination with ParallelTable. The code does the following: Compute a HistogramDistribution of some sample and use some function which draws from that HistogramDistribution. Here's a stripped down version of the code that reproduces my problem:               exampledist =        TruncatedDistribution[{0, 1.16},         HistogramDistribution[         RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[1], 1000], 3]];     SetSharedVariable[exampledist];          drawExample[n_] :=            Module[{draws = Table[0, {n}]},        (*check some stuff, do something*)        For[i = 1, i <= n, i++,         draws[[i]] = First[RandomVariate[exampledist, 1]];         ];        Return[draws];        ];          drawExample[3]     ParallelTable[Table[drawExample[3], {1}], {i, 1, 2}]      The output is: `{1.05817, 1.05732, 0.47069}` and ` {{{DataDistribution[<<"Histogram">>, {1000}], DataDistribution[<<"Histogram">>, {1000}], DataDistribution[<<"Histogram">>, {1000}]}}, \ {{DataDistribution[<<"Histogram">>, {1000}], DataDistribution[<<"Histogram">>, {1000}], DataDistribution[<<"Histogram">>, {1000}]}}} ` Why can't I use the distribution in ParallelTable? First I thought the definition isn't shared properly, so I added `SetSharedVariable`, but that didn't resolve it. Does anyone know what I am missing here? Thank you very much.
