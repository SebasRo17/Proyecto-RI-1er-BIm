> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Controlling the 2D $xâ€“y$ aspect ratio of a 3D plot I am plotting 1000 points in a 3-dimensional cartesian coordinate system, the plotting range for the x, y, z axes is set to {-1,1} respectively. Mathematica code:               points1 = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {500, 3}];     points2 = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {500, 3}];          sphere = Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.1], Sphere[{0, 0, 0}]}];     plot1 = ListPointPlot3D[points1, PlotStyle -> Green];     plot2 = ListPointPlot3D[points2, PlotStyle -> Black];     Show[{plot1, plot2, sphere}, Axes -> False,          PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, AspectRatio -> Automatic]      ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0pxE3.png) Why does Mathematica plots axes of different lengths? Since I have given the same plotting range, I would expect and want to see a cube. How do I achieve this?
