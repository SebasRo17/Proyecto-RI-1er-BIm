After having read through some of the Spring docs my inclination is towards using a XML config file rather than annotations on the classes themselves. My reasoning is that by doing so you avoid tying your POJOs to a particular framework. Based on your experience with Spring, are there any advantages that XML configuration have over an annotation based configuration, and if not what are the disadvantages?
