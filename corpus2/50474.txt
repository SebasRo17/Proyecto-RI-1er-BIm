FE`ExecuteInDynamicModule::noval: Symbol FE`DynamicModuleVariableList$67 does not have a value. >>      I'm just posting the error for the moment as this is a problem that occurs in a largeish `Manipulate` that is being designed for a cdf document. It is wrapped in a `Dynamic` module which defines a number of symbols, including several functions. The context is this: I'm using `SaveDefinitions -> True` but it seems all definitions are not correctly saved once the kernel has gone. If I evaluate my `Manipulate` with the kernel running, the resulting interface runs correctly. If I copy it into a fresh document and save it as a separate cdf document, this document does not run properly in the CDF viewer. Now if I quit the kernel in the original document I see the same incorrect behaviour as in the cdf. The strategy I came up with was to move all the definitions outside the `Manipulate` into the initialization section or into the list of module variables so that I could stop using `SaveDefinitions -> True`. But as these sections get larger, I begin to get errors such as the above. If I can find a way of avoiding these, my strategy might work.
