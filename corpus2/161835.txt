I like how "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al. conveys knowledge. One reason is that everything has to do with programming problems and the book is not implemented in any particular programming language. This language independency provides focus on the ideas in general. So my question is, as it says in the title. Is every solveable programming problem solveable by thinking in this algorithmic fashion. No matter which language, field, etc ? If yes, give arguments, else, give arguments! I have not implemeted many complex programs with GUI, AI, Graphics, etc ... But are these types of problems also a matter of thinking out good algorithms?
