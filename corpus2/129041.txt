I admit that I haven't seen how fast other people people learn. But I in my case, it usually takes me a long time to understand few lines of a new programming concept. For instance, I've been programing in jQuery and a little of JavaScript for some time. I've been checking this Backbone.js tutorial. And it is taking me a lot of time to understand a simple block like this:                var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({             el: $('body'), // attaches `this.el` to an existing element.              initialize(): Automatically called upon instantiation. Where you make all types of bindings, excluding UI events, such as clicks, etc.              initialize: function(){           _.bindAll(this, 'render'); // fixes loss of context for 'this' within methods                 this.render(); // not all views are self-rendering. This one is.         },      Even if it is all commented and explained (I still can't figure out what is `el` or why there is an underscore before `_.bindAll`, and I've been stuck with this for about an hour). This really make me wonder if I'm suitable to be a programmer or not?
