I have some problems to calculate in reasonable speed the convolution of an interpolated function with a Gauss function. I have here (ExampleData.txt, alternate Pastebin link) data which I interpolate linearly:               data = Import["ExampleData.txt", "Table"];     interPolFunc = Interpolation[data, InterpolationOrder -> 1]      First, I tried to work with following function (I have to add a Dirac delta function to my interpolated function):               firstTry[y_] := Integrate[        PDF[NormalDistribution[0, 0.008],x-y]*(interPolFunc[x] + 4 DiracDelta[1-x]), {x, 0, 1.1}];      If I calculate some values with               firstTryTable = ParallelTable[{u, firstTry[u]}, {u, 0, 1.1, 0.005}];      I only get back the contribution of the Dirac delta function. If I use this function                secondTry[y_] :=           Integrate[PDF[NormalDistribution[0, 0.008], x - y]*4*DiracDelta[1 - x],{x, 0, 1.1}]  +           Integrate[PDF[NormalDistribution[0, 0.008], x - y]*interPolFunc[x],{x, 0, 1.1}];      and calculate values with                secondTryTable = ParallelTable[{u, N[secondTry[u]]}, {u, 0, 1.1, 0.005}];      then the result seems to be reasonable. So, my first question (not so important) is:   Why do I get back two different results? The second is:   Is there any way to decrease the calculation time? It is really slow. I would be happy about some help.
