I am currently reading the book Hello, Android, and am about 100 pages in. The problem is that even though I understand the instructions and what the code should do, I can't really put things together as to how things are connected(methods, views, things passed around different files(!!)). The sudoku example the book is following is too complicated to follow; maybe they should of instead gradually show and _explained_ each step to building such an app (let the reader build up with simple examples to more complicated ones). Maybe later in the author starts to explain things more clearly. Should I just keep reading/coding the book or should I focus more on my Java book and finish that first? If someone has experience with the book, I would love to hear some thoughts.
