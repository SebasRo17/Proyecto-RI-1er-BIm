I have almost a 'best-practice' question that's been nagging at me for a while. When I use JavaScript libraries and APIs such as JQGrid or Google Maps, I tend to find myself creating server side libraries to render the JavaScript for me. For example I might have:               $map->setZoom(10);     $map->setDimensions(200,250);      in PHP, which would internally render the relevant JS when I call `$map->render();`, for example. This means I can easily generate JavaScript based on the state of my applications. I also find it easier to work with the data I already have in my controllers etc. Is this a suitable way of using common functionality within a JavaScript library or would it be better to write JS as standard?
