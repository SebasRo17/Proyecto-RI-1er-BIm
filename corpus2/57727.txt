I try to solve a bit tricky problem. I want define line (or vector) between some geographical points with weights (for example how many transactions has been done between these cities). I tried this way:               c1 = CityData["Paris", "Coordinates"] ;     c2 = CityData["London", "Coordinates"];     c3 = CityData["Hong Kong", "Coordinates"];          ListDensityPlot[{{c1, c2, 5}, {c2, c3, 1}}]      Where 5 and 1 in ListDensityPlot are weights. When I evaluate this code I always get error message. Is it possible to make this simalution? Thank you very much.
