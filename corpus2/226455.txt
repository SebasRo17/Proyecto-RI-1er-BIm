I'm working on a social network website and I'm not quite sure when I should store the date/datetime. The service includes some of the following events:   * Register/Login   * Follow   * "Like" (images & comments)   * Post a comment   * Post an image In my eyes, I would use `DateTime` for all of them... Although I'm not sure if that's professional or maybe it's just a waste of space. When should I store the time of an event? Thanks in advance.
