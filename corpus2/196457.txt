Let's say I have a set of items {e1, e2, ..., en}, and I also have a set of constraints {c1, c2, ..., cm}, with ci := ej appears before ek, for some j and k. I want to produce an ordering of my items which maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, with the possibility that some of the constraints are contradictory. I'm not sure how to search for this, but I hope there is some known efficient algorithm for this. It might also be helpful if, given weights for the constraints, I could instead maximize the total weight of the satisfied constraints, rather than just the number.
