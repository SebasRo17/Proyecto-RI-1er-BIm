When you are defining a function/variable/etc and are not sure what to name it, what do you name it? How do you come up with a name? If you use a **_temporary_** name as a place-card until you give it it's real name, what temporary name do you use? * * * ### update I have been using things like `WILL_NAME_LATER`, `NEEDS_NAME`, or `TO_BE_NAMED`. I was hoping there was an adopted convention, I was actually hoping that if I used this adopted convention my IDE would highlight the name until I changed it.
