In each application there are concepts like users, customers, etc. and some part of the application tries to manage them. For example:               1. keeping the information of people, organizations, firms, etc.     2. managing users (people who work with the system)     3. managing customers (people who purchase goods/services)     4. distinguishing customers, from users, from ordinary people, etc.     5. ...      Do we have a universal term for that area of each application (that subsystem, that module, that whatever)? Or if I want to ask more precisely, can we package customers, users, people, organizations, etc. all in one module, and name it like X? Is this a correct taxonomy of subsystems? Update: Is **Entities** a good name?
