In agile methodologies (e.g. SCRUM), the complexity/effort needed for user stories are measured in Story points. Story points are used to calculate how many user stories a team can take in an iteration. What is the advantage of introducing an abstract concept (story points), where we can just use a concrete measurement, like estimated man-days? We can also calculate velocity, estimate coverage of an iteration, etc. using estimated man-days. In contrast, story points are harder to use (because the concept is abstract), and also harder to explain to stakeholders. What advantage does it offer?
