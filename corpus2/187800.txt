I ran into Rebol and I was wondering about it. I ran into the following script from here:                use [feed questions answers][         feed: load-xml/dom http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/rebol         questions: map-each entry feed/get-by-tag <entry> [             find/match entry/get <id> "http://stackoverflow.com/q/"         ]              answers: make block! length? questions              foreach question questions [             question: load-xml/dom join http://stackoverflow.com/feeds/question/ question             foreach entry next question/get-by-tag <entry> [append answers entry/tree]         ]              insert clear feed/find-element <entry> answers         feed/flatten      ]      All the collection manipulation operations like `map-each` remind me of JavaScript and C# both of which have functional abilities. Is Rebol a functional language? Does it support functional programming? Would it classify as a pure functional language (PFL)?
