I am currently building a Web application using a LAMP stack that relies on Javascript on the front end. As the app grows and expands, I naturally plan to expand and change the javascript files. I'm concerned that many of our users' computers will cache the files (which I usually want) but I want to be proactive to make sure that new files are grabbed when I update. The obvious answer seems to version the javascript files throughout the application so that `edit.js` become `edit.0.3.6.js` and can be updated whenever the file changes so a new version is downloaded. I think that this is the most fail-proof method, but I question if there is an easy way to manage these versioning changes automatically. We use Github to version control all our files.
