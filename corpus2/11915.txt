I am using MAMP (just and example) to develop web applications without having to constantly upload and download via FTP. I´m sure this is the correct way to test a project but I´m no sure if I´m doing it right. After I´m satisfied with the project I have to change in every page the MySQL databases and most of the links etc. Is there a workaround this? How should this be used? Thanks in advance!
