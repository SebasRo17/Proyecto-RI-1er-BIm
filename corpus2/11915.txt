For example, I'm typing this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JnIuX.png) When upon hitting the last character it gets converted to: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cOw3I.png) And trying to Convert To TraditionalForm has no effect. This glitch has happened a few times and on different characters each time. Is there a reason for this happening? **EDIT** \- By request from Mr. Wizard, here is the Cell Expression (and what was displayed) of the cell to which this just happened. **What was displayed:**               Subscript[     Overscript[u, .],        t] = \[DifferentialD]Subscript[u, t]/\[DifferentialD]t\[InvisibleComma],       where Subscript[u, \[Placeholder]]      **Cell Expression:**               Cell[TextData[Cell[BoxData[      FormBox[       RowBox[{        RowBox[{         RowBox[{"Subscript", "[", "\n",           RowBox[{           OverscriptBox["u",             StyleBox[".",             FontWeight->"Bold"]], ",", " ", "\n", "  ", "t"}], "]"}], " ",          "=", " ",          RowBox[{          RowBox[{"\[DifferentialD]",            RowBox[{"Subscript", "[",             RowBox[{"u", ",", " ", "t"}], "]"}]}], "/",           RowBox[{"\[DifferentialD]", "t"}]}]}], "\[InvisibleComma]",         RowBox[{",", " ", "\n", " ",          RowBox[{"where", " ",           SubscriptBox["u", "\[Placeholder]"]}]}]}], TraditionalForm]],      FormatType->"TraditionalForm"]], "Outline5",      CellChangeTimes->{{3.5589693713435035`*^9, 3.5589693812760715`*^9}, {        3.5589694358751945`*^9, 3.5589694980697517`*^9}, {        3.5589695385210657`*^9, 3.5589695520988417`*^9}, {        3.5589695873348575`*^9, 3.558969609079101*^9}, {        3.5589701806157913`*^9, 3.5589702522708893`*^9},         3.5589703063239813`*^9, {3.558990416805235*^9,         3.5589904721864023`*^9}}]
