I'm experiencing a trouble with my business model, let me explain better. I'm developing a software for 1 year and few months, it's for the food industry, more exactly a software to: _Delivery, Take Way, Table Reservation, POS, Accounts Payable and Receivable, Prints(receipt), Kitchen Monitors Orders, Customers Orders Control and Fiscal Area._ Well, I had separated the software mainly in two areas, one is web area and the other is desktop area (Used by Admins only) and local installed. 1 - Web Area (Basically do the follow:)   * Show Catalog with the products   * Customers Make Orders   * Customers Pay for the Orders   * etc ... as mentioned above 2 - Desktop Area   * Manage Orders   * Manage Customers   * Manage Suppliers   * Manage Accounts Payable and Receivable   * etc ... as mentioned above The web area is hosted in an online web server (scripts and database are online). The Desktop area is hosted locally in a Linux machine with a local database and local scripts files. My question is: Is it possible to keep **only one Database** for both applications? If YES, please what is the best approach? ## Follow my technical specification environment _Database: Actually I have two databases working and I would love to keep only one._ Operating System: Linux (Kernel 2.6.X and above) or Windows (XP and above) For the Web Area   * Apache, PHP, Python, Java Script, Shell Script and MySQL. For the Desktop Area:   * PHP-GTK2, Apache, PHP, MySQL and Shell Script. * * * ## Addtional Information about the system [EDITED] The main purposes to have a Desktop environment is:   1. I need to print and give out Tax Coupon on each new order.    2. I have the drawer.    3. I have a serial reader (Bar code).    4. I have a terminal to query for information.    5. and few other stuffs that is so hard if not impossible to do in the web environment. **Desktop relational schema: 104 tables. Web relational schema: 42 tables.**   1. Permissions is assigned based on: Deny all by default, and assigns as needed.    2. (Validation / Sanitization) has already been done in the web application.   3. Until now performance is not a problem, since every fiscal year part of my database will be archived. (Also customer, suppliers and all related data about them will be archived after 3 years of inactivity).  My real problem is I have 2 environments today and I would love to have only 1. Then "merge" the both worlds into one is an option, but not sure about. I would love to read here a lot of ideas about this matter. **Observation about the process:** Today it is in operation and it works fine, but I feel like waste time in some process. Take a look in the scenario:   1. The order is made in the internet, then stored in my Web database.   2. The "order" is sent to the kitchen and prepared.   3. Print a receipt (Tax Coupon), put it with the order and delivery to the customer.   4. A Tax Coupon is generated by my Desktop Environment and it need a call to the orders table, but it is not the Web Order Table but a Desktop Order Table. _In few words I need to generate again the order to fill up the Tax Coupon. The same happen to Customer Register, Supplier Register and few other stuffs._ I hope this information turn my question more readable. Thanks Again!
