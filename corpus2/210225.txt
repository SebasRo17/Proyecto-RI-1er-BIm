This question has been bugging me for a while. I came from a background where I taught that when a transaction reached some state (FINISHED, PRINTED, etc) it should no longer be opened for modification even to admin users. But here I am, fixing their human-input error barbarically by deleting a row in database and/or changing the current item's state to it's previous one. At some point they even make a mistake in inputting a transaction date, and just realized it somewhere later. And it's really annoying. Should a software, especially an enterprise one, gives a user all the freedom they requested? If so, what good does a transaction state for? Update : Here, by transaction I mean a Transaction object which usually consisted a reference to Master object and it's own attributes, not database transaction.
