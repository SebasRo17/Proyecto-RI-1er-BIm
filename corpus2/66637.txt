I have created my own forum on ASP.NET MVC 3 and Razor. It's a decent forum with, say, version 1 functionality. I plan to work on other features as well after my release of this version. 1) What site apart from Codeplex can I post my application on as open source? 2) What are the guidelines I need to follow before posting my application regarding my code etc? 3) I want my application to be used by others, so do I have to worry about anything like making a documentation about my code, etc?
