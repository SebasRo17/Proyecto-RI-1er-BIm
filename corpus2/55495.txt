I have modified my question to a simple version. I have vertex clusters, polygons and a list of center points. Attached pts and polygons of 3d tube are:                pts =Import["https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68983831/npts.txt","Table"];       polys= Import["https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68983831/npolys.txt","Table"];      These are approximate center points:                cpts = Import["https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68983831/cpts.txt","Table"];           Show[Graphics3D[{Opacity[.1], EdgeForm[None], GraphicsComplex[pts, Polygon@polys]},       Boxed -> False], ListPointPlot3D[cpts]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4cuX0.png) How to measure cross-sectional area, major & minor axis length as move along the center points? or may be without center points?
