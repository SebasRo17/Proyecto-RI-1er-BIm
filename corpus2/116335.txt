I'm trying to understand if JavaBeans is a good example of encapsulation. In my view, it's **not** as usually all the internal state is exposed through getters and setters. A simple example is               public class Test {         private List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();              public List<String> getNames() {             return names;         }              public void setNames(List<String> names) {             this.names = names;         }     }      This follows the JavaBeans standard but it leaks the implementation. For example a user could call `test.getNames().clear()`. Am I missing something?
