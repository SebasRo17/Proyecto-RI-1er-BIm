I've run into the limits of what NHibernate 3.0's LINQ provider is capable of and decided it's time to learn about one of the more powerful (or at least feature-complete) options: the `QueryOver` API. The problem is, I have zero experience with `ICriteria`, and all of the tutorials I've been able to find online either:   1. Assume I'm an `ICriteria` expert and simply show me how to convert ICriteria code to the new fluent interface, or   2. Are trivial "here's how you do an inner join" examples that don't really help me _understand_ more complex concepts like projections, subqueries, requirements, or whatever other magic the API is capable of. What should I read to really **learn** about QueryOver, and how to make full use of it?
