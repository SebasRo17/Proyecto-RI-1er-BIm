I have a function:               f[x_] := x + 31 x^3 + 5 x^25      Which I want to find an expansion for:               ex[x_, a_, b_, c_, d_] := a + b x + c x^3 + d x^25      I do this by solving to find the coefficients a,b,c,d by setting the expansion equal to the function at the appropriate number of points:               sol = Solve[{ex[1, a, b, c, d] == f[1], ex[3, a, b, c, d] == f[3],      ex[2, a, b, c, d] == f[2], ex[4, a, b, c, d] == f[4]}]      This works fine, but its ugly. I've only used this to illustrate what I want to do... but actually I want to find an expansion involving 'N' expansion coefficients, and perform solve at N different points to find what they are. However, I don't understand how to do that without having functions with N+1 arguments and so on. If I haven't expressed myself clearly let me know and I'll add more. EDIT: Perhaps I'll add that really the expansion I'm looking for is something like (though how I put the coefficients into the function argument I don't know):               ex[x_,a[i]_,b[i]_,N_,M_]:= Sum[a[n] ChebyshevT[n,x],{n,0,N}] + Sum[b[n] * y[n,x],{n,1,M}]      Where the functions y[n,x] are some other functions which is not orthogonal to the Chebyshev polynomials.
