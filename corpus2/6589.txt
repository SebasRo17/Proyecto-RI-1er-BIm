I recently learned that we can use `Print` as a monitoring tool. My favorite is Ted Ersek's example               h[f1[a1], f2[e][a2]] /. (a_ /; Print[a] :> 0)      which reveals the order in which `ReplaceAll` goes through parts of an expression. Clearly this is a very useful trick. On page 41 of his book, David Wagner gave the example               FindRoot[Print[x]; Sin[x] - Cos[x], {x, .5}]      which prints the sequence of iterates generated by `FindRoot` along the way. That code no longer works on Mathematica version 8:               In[22]:= FindRoot[Print[x]; Sin[x] - Cos[x], {x, .5}]     During evaluation of In[22]:= x     Out[22]= {x -> 0.785398}      At first I thought this is related to the fact that we now have the `EvaluationMonitor` option, and `FindRoot` somehow weeds out superfluous subexpressions like `Print`. Now I know this is probably false because               Plot[Print[x]; Sin[x], {x, Pi/4, Pi/2}]      still lists all the points considered during its evaluation. **Why does`FindRoot` ignore `Print`?**
