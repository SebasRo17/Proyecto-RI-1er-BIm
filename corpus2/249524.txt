The C11 standard says the arrays, both sized and variable length "shall have a value greater than zero." What is the justification for not allowing a length of 0? Especially for variable length arrays it makes perfect sense to have a size of zero every once and a while. It is also useful for static arrays when their size is from a macro or build configuration option. Interestingly GCC (and clang) provide extensions that allow zero length arrays. Java also allows arrays of length zero.
