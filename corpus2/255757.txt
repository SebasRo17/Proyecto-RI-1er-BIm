I'm struggling with how to keep track of what myself and people on my team actually do each day. I get a good broad picture by going over completed cards each week and stand-ups help a bit, but I feel like I don't have a good handle on the day-to-day workings of my team. Cards will stay in progress for days on end without an update at the daily stand-up, and some engineers are my team aren't the most communicative. I've thought about implementing some sort of daily record that everyone fills out (via a mailing list or a shared google doc) but this seems fairly cumbersome and manual. Monitoring GitHub activity does an ok job but can be a little bit overwhelming with how many emails it sends out everyday. I've thought about trying to build a digest system for it, but don't have the time to spare. What strategies have you implemented to stay on top of what your team is doing everyday so that you can measure work on "in progress" tasks?
