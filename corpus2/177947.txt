My requirements consist of using ehCache to send and store data via RESTful web service calls. The data can be stored in-memory or via the filesystem... Never used ehCache before so I am having some issues deciding on which bundle to use. Have downloaded the following bundles: ehcache-2.6.2 ehcache-standalone-server-1.0.0 (1) What is the difference between the two? It seems the ehcache-2.6.2 contains src and binaries, which essentially enables one to bundle it with their webapps (by putting the compiled jar or binaries inside the webapp's WEB-INF/lib folder). But it doesn't seem that it has support for Restful web services. Whereas, ehcache-standalone-server-1.0.0 (comes with an embedded Glassfish server and has support for REST & SOAP) can be used to run as a standalone server. If I my answers to my own question are correct, then that means, I should just use the standalone server? (2) My requirements are to setup ehCache (with REST support) on Tomcat 7. So, how could I setup ehCache on Tomcat 7 as a separate app with REST & SOAP support? Thank you for taking the time to read this...
