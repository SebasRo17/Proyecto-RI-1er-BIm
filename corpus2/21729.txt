Suppose we have a long list of 3D Cartesian coordinates, defining a distribution of random points in 3D space. How could we remove all the points inside a sphere of radius `sphereRadius` located at coordinates `sphereLocation = {X, Y, Z}`? This Boolean subtraction is probably trivial, but I didn't found any useful info on how to do it with _Mathematica_ 7.0. Maybe it isn't trivial, after all. * * * **Generalisation :** How can we do the same with an arbitrary closed surface, instead of a sphere, if the hole is defined as a deformed sphere ?               holeLocation = {X, Y, Z};     hole[theta_, phi_] = holeLocation  +          radius[theta, phi] {Sin[theta]Cos[phi], Sin[theta]Sin[phi], Cos[theta]};      where `theta` and `phi` are the usual spherical coordinates.
