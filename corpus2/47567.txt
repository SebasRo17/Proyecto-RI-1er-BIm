I'm a little confused with the `TemporalData` structure in Mathematica, in the sense that it doesn't seem to behave like a list. What I'd like to do is plot the sum and difference of a Brownian motion and an OU process, and so far, generating and plotting these individual processes is not a problem:               Z = RandomFunction[WienerProcess[0, 1], {0, 1, 0.01}];          L = RandomFunction[OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess[0, 1, 1, 0], {0, 1, 0.01}];          ListLinePlot[{Z,L}]      However, plotting their sum with               ListLinePlot[Z+L]      yields an error: > >     ListLinePlot::lpn: > TemporalData[Automatic,{<<1>>}]+TemporalData[Automatic,{<<1>>}] >     is not a list of numbers or pairs of numbers. >   I've checked out this related post, but am unsure how to interpret it in the context of my particular problem. Is there a simple way to do what I'd like?
