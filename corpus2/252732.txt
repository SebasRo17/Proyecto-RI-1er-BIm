We have new (quite big) project starting, that we planned to develop using TDD. The idea of TDD failed (many business and non-business reasons), but right now we have a conversation - should we write unit tests anyway, or not. My friend says that there is no (or close to zero) sense in writing unit tests without TDD, we should focus only on integration tests. I believe the opposite, that there is still some sense in writing plain unit tests, just to make code more futureproof. What do you think? Added: I think that this is not a duplicate of >>this question<< \- I understand difference between UT and TDD. My question is **not about differences** , but **about sense** of writing Unit Tests without TDD.
