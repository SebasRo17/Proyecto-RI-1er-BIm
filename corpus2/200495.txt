I wish to acquire a new computer that is specially designed for programming. I would like to build it myself for the learning experience, but am willing to purchase it made as well. Basically I have downloaded so many files dedicated to programming that are so large that a) my computer is near capacity and b) my 4 year old computer is extremely slow. Specifically, I am into databases (Oracle/PostGreSQL, Mongo, Hadoop) and java, but love learning all possible languages.
