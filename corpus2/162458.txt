We already have a WCF API with basichttpbinding. Some of the calls have complex objects in both the response and request. We need to add RESTful abilities to the API. at first I tried adding a webHttp endpoint, but I got               At most one body parameter can be serialized without wrapper elements      If I made it Wrapped it wasn't pure as I need it to be. I got to read this, and this (which states "ASP.NET Web API is the new way to build RESTful service on .NET"). So my question is, should I make 2 APIs(2 different projects)? one for SOAP with WCF and one RESTful with ASP.NET Web API? is there anything wrong architecturally speaking with this approach?
