I have a list of geographical coordinates(maybe the coordinates are not that accurate, but the problem is not that vital):                geodata = {{"30\[Degree]16'38.43''N",       "120\[Degree]10'55.54''E"}, {"30\[Degree]16'18.17''N",       "120\[Degree]11'2.03''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'58.53''N",       "120\[Degree]11'2.58''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'38.9''N",       "120\[Degree]11'0.67''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'29.61''N",       "120\[Degree]11'0.63''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'21.84''N",       "120\[Degree]10'59.94''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'10.91''N",       "120\[Degree]10'57.55''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'52.85''N",       "120\[Degree]12'48.06''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'46.65''N",       "120\[Degree]12'25.2''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'36.61''N",       "120\[Degree]12'10.54''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'26.53''N",       "120\[Degree]11'59.61''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'16.68''N",       "120\[Degree]11'45.45''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'1.32''N",       "120\[Degree]11'40.07''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'51.96''N",       "120\[Degree]11'36.82''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'35.73''N",       "120\[Degree]11'22.55''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'40.19''N",       "120\[Degree]13'10.21''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'28.39''N",       "120\[Degree]13'0.05''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'9.78''N",       "120\[Degree]12'43.92''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'58.1''N",       "120\[Degree]12'33.66''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'38.61''N",       "120\[Degree]12'16.68''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'33.41''N",       "120\[Degree]12'12.38''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'21.62''N",       "120\[Degree]12'1.76''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'51.43''N",       "120\[Degree]12'7.32''E"}, {"30\[Degree]14'59.66''N",       "120\[Degree]12'1.47''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'7.55''N",       "120\[Degree]11'55.81''E"}, {"30\[Degree]15'13.21''N",       "120\[Degree]11'51.7''E"}} // GeoPosition;      And I want to show those points in one picture with the background being the local map. At first I tried               GeoGraphics[GeoMarker[geodata], ImageSize -> 600]      as you can see, ![here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GMtZI.png) there should be a rivulet at every geomarker, just as the one on the left of the picture. But the map _Mathematica_ originally provided is not precise enough, the rest rivulets are not shown here( **Those rivulets are very important!** ). Then I used `GeoStyling["ReliefMap"]` and `GeoStyling["ContourMap"]` to specify a small region just to make it present better,               << "ComputationalGeometry`";     GeoGraphics[{GeoStyling["ContourMap"], Polygon[#]},ImageSize -> 600] &[     Extract[geodata[[1]], List /@ ConvexHull[geodata[[1]]]] //      GeoPosition]      (Here **ComputationalGeometry** package and `ConvexHull` are used to generate a convexhull, they don't matter much) but you will see that the polygon is just a piece of green, the same problem still remains. So what should I do to make the map more precise that can show the small rivulets? Thanks! **Edit:** I have thought to use google earth to screenshot the map, but the rivulets are too thin to distinguished from the background, it's hard to use image-processing method. And, if I use google map, but google map doesn't support multi-geomarkers like 26, I can't show every geomarkers on google map. Or else, I firstly take the screenshot, then add the geomarkers, but I think it's not easy to place the geomarkers at accurate places.
