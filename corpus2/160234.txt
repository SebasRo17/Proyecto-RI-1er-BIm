Loosely coupled classes gives flexibility. If I understand it right, Event flow, Observer Pattern and Design Patterns like MVC focus on loose coupling. So in this context I am aiming towards making a project where all the classes are loosely coupled. So, for example I have a class A that uses B: then instead of `a.b.doThis() ;` I will be going like this :               b.addEventListener( B.OnEventHappens, doThisInA ) ;       So, my question is. If this sort of loosely coupled relationship throughout a project is a good thing to do? Would it make a robust project? Or is it not advisable to use it on the "Extreme" side?
