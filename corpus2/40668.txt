How to exit a package in the middle, for example,               BeginPackage["myPackage"]     Begin["`Private"]          DoSomething          If[$FrontEnd===Null, Abort[]]          DoSomethingIfFrontEndDefined          End[]     EndPackage[]      Here Abort[] doesn't really quit the whole package. Is there any command which can do this? I could use Goto but that sounds not good. Also I don't want to Quit[] because I want to use the definitions in the DoSomething part.
