I've been using Xcode and building iPhone apps for two months, but I'm finding it really hard to grasp good application design. I always face problems—like you can't put your tabbarcontroller in another custom viewcontroller, for example—that 'sometimes', of course, would work if you did the creation of the views/viewcontrollers programmatically. So I don't know if I should start writing the creation of my objects or use Interface Builder. What are your experiences?
