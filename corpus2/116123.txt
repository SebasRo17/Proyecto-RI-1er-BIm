I have developed a few websites and applications using C#, and lately I've been developing a website in ASP.NET MVC. To be honest, this has pissed me off somewhat as it has me feeling like I have zero knowledge. So many things work under the hood in .NET that I'm just not able to focus and understand what is left to the developer and how these things are done. Now, the question that prompted me to make this post is: **How should I proceed for learning PHP from a very basic standpoint?** Mind you, I have no idea about this language at all, just seen some code and heard people talking.
