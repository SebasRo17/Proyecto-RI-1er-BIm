I want to solve following system of ODEs: $ \Bigg\\{ \begin{array}{} \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=\frac{2W_b}{Rsin(\theta)}(1-\frac{C}{\gamma})+\frac{\nu}{\pi R^2}\frac{\partial C}{\partial Z} \\\ \frac{\partial R}{\partial t}=\frac{W_b}{\gamma sin(\theta)} \end{array} $ Where $W_b=k_bC_h(1-\frac{C}{C_h})^{\frac{4}{3}}$ and $\nu, k_b, C_h, h, \gamma, \theta$ are constants. It is known that: $ \frac{\partial C}{\partial Z}=\frac{C_i-C_{i-1}}{Z_i-Z_{i-1}} $, where $Z_i- Z_{i-1}=h$ and $h$ is a constant. So, the first equation become this: $ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}=\frac{2W_b}{Rsin(\theta)}(1-\frac{C}{\gamma})+\frac{\nu}{\pi R^2}\frac{C_i- C_{i-1}}{h} $ My question is how can I get the result of previous computation, namely $C_{i-1}$? Here is the mathematica code I wrote:               Wb[C_] := kb*Ch*(1 - C/Ch)^(4/3);     system := {       c'[t] == (2*Wb[c[t]])/(r[t]*Sin[theta])*(1 - C/gamma) + v/(Pi*r[t]^2)*(c[t] - ?? )/h,       r'[t] == Wb[c[t]]/(gamma*Sin[theta]),       c[0] == 0, r[0] == 0.15};     solution = First@NDSolve[system, {c, r}, {t, 0, 25900000}, Method -> "BDF"];      **UPDATE** : Simplified version of the problem. This is a model based on a plug flow reactor.   $ \Bigg\\{ \begin{array}{} \dot{x} = \frac{c_1 x f(x)}{y} + \frac{\partial x}{\partial z} \\\ \dot{y} = c_2 f(x) \end{array} $ Where c1 and c2 are constants. This is a model of a physical process and it was shown that `z` dimension is quantified by a chunks of a constant size `h` and `x` is monotonously increasing, so $\frac{\partial x}{\partial z}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta z}=\frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{h}$               f[x_] := ...;     system := {       x'[t] == c1*x*f[x[t]]/y[t] + (x[t] - ?)/h,       y'[t] == c2*f[x[t]],       x[0] == 0, y[0] == 0.15};     solution = First@NDSolve[system, {x, y}, {t, 0, 25900000}, Method -> "BDF"];
