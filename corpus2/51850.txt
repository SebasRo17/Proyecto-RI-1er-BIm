I have a rather complicated function that I need to expand it in series, which is quite straightforward but takes a long time. I was wondering if there is a way to speed up such a calculation:               Series[1/(1 + x)^2 y z/.{x->x1+x2+x3+x4,y->y1+y2+y3+y4,z->z1+z2+z3+z4},{x1,0,2},{x2,0,2},{x3,0,2},{x4,0,2},{y1,0,2},{y2,0,2},{y3,0,2},{y4,0,2},{z1,0,2},{z2,0,2},{z3,0,2},{z4,0,2}]      Now the one,sth seconds the above needs to be computed on my laptop is not dramatic but the function I consider is way more complicated and runtime is in the order of hours...Thanks for any advice!
