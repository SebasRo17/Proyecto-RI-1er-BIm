My company asked me to set up a personal goal of improving time management. This means keeping up with time reporting, revising estimates and being responsive to email inquiries. Of course, I have read books on the topic and have tried numerous systems. I just get absorbed in coding to the exclusion of administrative tasks. I think most of it is an attitude or a psychological issue unrelated to actual time management. The company is willing to pay for it as professional training, so I'm looking for a recognized and effective training program. I would like something that doesn't just "fix" a problem, but potentially makes me more "promotable". I'm valued for my technical skills, but management is frustrated by my poor fit into overall planning and I understand that it's my main obstacle to handling more responsibility. What programs are out there that are tailored to effective and timely software development? I wonder if any project management training would be applicable, but something more specific to a software developer, or technical lead perspective would be great. Thank you.
