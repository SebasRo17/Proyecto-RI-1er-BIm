I am trying to collect all terms with non-negative powers of $x$ in polynomials like $\frac{1}{x^2}\left(a x^2+x^{\pi }+x+z\right)^2$ First expand the polynomial               Expand[1/x^2 (x + x^Ï€ + a x^2 + z)^2, x]      This gives $a^2 x^2+2 a x^{\pi }+2 a x+2 a z+2 x^{\pi -2} z+x^{2 \pi -2}+2 x^{\pi -1}+\frac{z^2}{x^2}+\frac{2 z}{x}+1$. Now try to select those terms with positive or zero powers of x. My best guess is               Plus@@Cases[%, (Times[___, Power[x, g_.], ___] /; g >= 0)]      However, this only yields the term $a^2 x^2$. And why does this not work for the other terms? How can I collect the other terms with positive or zero powers of x?
