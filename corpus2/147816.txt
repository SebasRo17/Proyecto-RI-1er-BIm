I have found a major security hole in one of my company's public facing site. This is our first public facing site that was converted from an intranet site. I brought this issue up to my boss and they essentially shrugged it off, saying that it would take a good deal of work to re-architecture the site to make it secure. This has really bothered me and I have thought about exploiting the hole to show the effects that this could happen if an actual hacker got to it. This is probably not the best idea as the effects could cost me my job if not something worse. What are some things I can do to show the magnitude of the situation to management?
