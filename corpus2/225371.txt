I understand that a process a unit of resource ownership and executable instructions. Threads allow a process to share its resources with multiple executions, and it's easier for an OS to schedule threads because of all the overhead associated with whole processes. But why the name _thread_? Does it have some reference to _string_ or the interleaving of execution? Even so, this isn't an intuitive term in my opinion.
