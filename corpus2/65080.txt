I keep seeing in job postings that the applicant must have experience writing "scalable" applications. What makes an application scalable, and how do I know that my code can scale to millions of users? * * * I guess a better way of phrasing this question is: How can I write my code with scalability in mind? So that the code is scalable from the get-go as opposed to an afterthought. Are there certain design methodologies? Or is it simply a matter of picking the correct algorithms for the job?
