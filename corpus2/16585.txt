I have two state equations.               f1 = 1000. (12 - (1 - u) x2);     f2 = 1000. ((1 - u) x1 - 8/100 x2 );      I did two different stream plots for state-variables `x2` and `x1` on the x and y axis respectively. The first stream plot was based on `u = 0` and the second one was based on `u = 1`. Then I superimposed the stream plots using the command `Show[{plt0, plt1}]`.                plt0 = StreamPlot[Flatten[{f1, f2} /. u -> 0], {x2, 0, 30}, {x1, 0, 10},        StreamPoints -> 500, StreamScale -> Large,        StreamStyle -> {Blue, Thickness[0.001], Dotted}, Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {Row[{Subscript["x", 2], " - Capacitor  Voltage "}],          Row[{Subscript["x", 1], " - Inductor  Voltage "}]},        GridLines -> Automatic, GridLinesStyle -> Directive[Gray, Dashed],        BaseStyle -> {"Times", 24}, ImageSize -> 500]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TpySO.png)                plt1 = StreamPlot[Flatten[{f1, f2} /. u -> 1], {x2, 0, 30}, {x1, 0, 10},         StreamPoints -> 500, StreamScale -> Large,         StreamStyle -> {Red, Thickness[0.001], Dotted}, Frame -> True,          FrameLabel -> {Row[{Subscript["x", 2], " - Capacitor  Voltage "}],           Row[{Subscript["x", 1], " - Inductor  Voltage "}]},         GridLines -> Automatic, GridLinesStyle -> Directive[Gray, Dashed],         BaseStyle -> {"Times", 24}, ImageSize -> 500]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DYElp.png)                   Show[{plt0, plt1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ehNLe.png) **Is it possible to draw a curve at the intersection points of the two superimposed streamplots and how?**
