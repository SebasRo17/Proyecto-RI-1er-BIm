I am using a lot of DateTimes in my application. Now I usually name it like StartDateTime, EndDateTime, etc, to imply there is also a time involved. I am getting a bit tired of this (it is tiresome to read), and _most of the time_ it is quite logical there is a time compartment to it anyway. Now I'm thinking about ditching `StartDateTime` in favor of the shorter `StartDate`, despite that there is also a time part included. **Question** What is better: easier to read _vs_ being more explicit about that there is a time included? (ps: I guess this has a lot to do with C# not having separate objects for `Date` and `DateTime`, so that's where the need for Hungarian comes from)
