Background: suppose I start with the following (working) snippet.                Manipulate[Graphics[Line[{{0, 0}, p}], PlotRange -> 2], {{p, {1, 1}}, Locator}]      Ideally, I would like to be able to add points with their own locator to the graphic and via selecting or otherwise add Polygons, Circles, BezierCurves, etc. Question: How can I interactively add a point to a Graphic that can be moved via its own locator? How can I select three or more points on such a Graphic and create a Polygon from them? ( I need the coordinates from the points, and which geometries have been created for later usage. ) *** UPDATE*** Thanks to FJRA's answer ( LocatorAutoCreate ) I can now rephrase the question as follows. From the following snippet                Manipulate[       Graphics[Map[Point[#] &, pts],         PlotRange -> 1], {{pts, {{0, 0}, {.5, 0}, {0, .5}}}, Locator,         LocatorAutoCreate -> True}]      **Question: How can I select multiple points and create a polygon from them. Ideally, I would like to select a geometry: i.e. Circle, Polygon, BezierCurve.**
