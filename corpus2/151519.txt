I'm creating a parameter table in our database. This table will have 1 row with values that are environment specific (production, development, etc). Is there any reason why I should define an index on this table? **Update**   This table is a parameter table which will be used to drive our job queue system. The table will be defined like this:               QueuePrm       LogLvl    integer       ShowMs    boolean       Restart   boolean      This table will only ever have 1 row. No other table in our system will reference it.
