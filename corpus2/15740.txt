I have several formulas I would like to place at specific coordinates in a `Graphics` object I have already created. I need to be able to choose bold or not as well as how large to make it. I am unsure how to control the size of the text as well as why _Mathematica_ will not place it. Specifically, it continues to try to evaluate my text. One of the objects I wish to place on the plot is (since it won't let me post a picture) $$M^\mu = \oplus_{\lambda \ge \mu} \,m \, \lambda_\mu \, S^\mu$$ However, _Mathematica_ continues to try to evaluate the direct sum rather than just place it at say the point (0,0). Here is the code I am trying at the moment:               Graphics[{Style[HoldForm[M^μ == \!\(*UnderscriptBox[(StandardForm[⊕]), (λ ≥ μ)]\) m Subscript[λ, μ] S^μ], Medium], FormatType -> StandardForm}]      Any ideas?
