I want to make a `3D` shape move through a specified graph; e.g. `y = Sin[x]`, such that it moves up and down.   My working so far has been to use `Manipulate`, and I think I want to use it with 'steps', as in the documentation, second one down, although I don't know how to use this.   Would this be the way, and if so how do I use it? Here is what I have so far:               Manipulate[Graphics3D[{Green, Cuboid[{0, 0, t}], Blue, Cuboid[{0, 0, 0}]}], {t, 0, 3}]      I think I want something like:               Manipulate[ Graphics3D[{Green, Cuboid[{0, 0, t}], Blue, Cuboid[{0, 0, 0}]}],                 {t, 0, 3, y = Sin[x]}]
