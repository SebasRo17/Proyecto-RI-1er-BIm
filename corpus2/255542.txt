I'm new to web development. From looking at popular open-source frameworks for both front-end and back-end, I have a general idea of what the modern full- stack web setup looks like: Database <-> Back-end language ~ REST API <-> Front-end Notes:   * The back-end language (Python, Ruby, PHP, Java) generates the API, which is the only layer between the back and the front. The API has authentication to protect private data.   * The front-end sends GET and POST requests to the API. A MVC framework can be used, such as Backbone, Angular, or Ember.js. Is my understanding accurate?
