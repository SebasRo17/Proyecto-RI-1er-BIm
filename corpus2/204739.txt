I jumped in to a project and I see that the other developers are adding a lot of logic in the setters of synthesized properties. I understand how this works, but I think that it makes it hard to understand the flow of the program; while reading the code, whenever I see `self.something = whatever`, I always check if `something`'s setter is overridden. What are your opinions around this topic? Do you think this is a sign of bad architecture or an elaborate solution? I would be glad to read more on this if you have relevant links/sources, it's just too hard to get good google results so I decided to ask here as well. Thanks for any answer and please note that I'm talking about objective C in case you haven't seen the tag (even though this shouldn't be a language specific issue I guess).
