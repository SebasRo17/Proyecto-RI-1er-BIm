I have a set of data read in from a larger CSV file. I want it to match the format I have from another analysis. It is structured as a series of strings with letters and numbers Here it is copy-pasted from Mathematica               {"{H, 1}", "{H, 2}", "{H, 3}", "{Mg, 1}", "{Mg, 1}", "{Mg, 1}", "{C, \     1}", "{C, 1, H, 1}", "{N, 1}", "{N, 1, H, 1}"}      I want to convert it to:               {{"H", "1"}, {"H", "2"}, {"H", "3"}, {"Mg", "1"}, {"Mg", "1"}, {"Mg",        "1"}, {"N", "1"}, {"N", "1", "H", "1"}}      I've tried `Read` and `StringToStream` but I haven't been able to do what I need. * * * I've also solved it. I wasn't on the right track, once I looked at the simple string manipulation tools after posting the question the solution jumped out at me.               data = Map[StringTrim[#, ("{" | "}") ...] &, data];     data = Map[StringSplit[#, ","] &, data]     data = StringTrim/@data
