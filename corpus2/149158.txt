I am only developer working on a project. The functionality that I have coded works to expectations(desired result) but since I am the only one I don't know if I can do anything better to it. How do I determine if my code is optimized (I want to increase the performance of some features)? One thing that comes into mind is _Code Review_ but there is no one free over here to review my code. I just keep on trying with alternate logic but at times things get stagnant and really dirty. Is there any other possible way?
