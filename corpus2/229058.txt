I have a C source file and another (non-code) file in a project which contain the same hard-coded value. Ideally, the value would be specified in only one location and be copied to the other location automatically during the build process. It's not hard to think of hackish ways to accomplish this task, but I want to know if there is a common way of doing it. What standard method or approach should I use to guarantee that the two values remain consistent? In other words, how should I maintain consistency in a non- hackish way?
