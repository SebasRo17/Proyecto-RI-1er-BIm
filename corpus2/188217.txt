I want to write a server side application which allows several users to exchange files (not above 3MB) in the following way: user A connects to (server) S. User B connects to S. User C connects S. User A sends a file. Users B and C "see" that a file was/is being uploaded and start downloading it. My main concern is responsiveness. I want the file to arrive at B and C not long after A started uploading. I thought of doing it using HTTP: user A sends raw bytes to the server and the server saves the file locally. At this point users B and C see that a file was uploaded and start downloading it. My question: is HTTP the best way to go here? Or should I write an app that uses TCP sockets, and write my own protocol? If I go with sockets. How can I estimate the RAM requirements of the VPS so that I can allow N file-transfer connections simultaneously?
