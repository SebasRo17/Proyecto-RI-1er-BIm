I have setup a RESTful API using Ruby on Rails for an iPhone application.There are some instances, however, that I would like to use Real-Time Pub/Sub data- transfers, I have drawn up 2 potentials:   * Connect the Rails API to a RealTime Node/Socket.io application using Redis. Where the iOS clients subscribe to the Node App through a socket connection.   * Interface Redis-rb (Ruby) and ObjCHiredis (iOS) directly - circumventing the Node application. (Is this even possible?) Would either of these be workable/recommended solutions? Disclaimer: I have never used Redis before.
