If I were to build a Twitter or Facebook application using pure client-side technologies like HTML and javascript, how would I mask/hide my API keys? For example, for Twitter I have consumer key and consumer secret. In order for me to call Twitter's API I'll have to pass these keys to authenticate my app. If I am using pure client side technologies, I leave myself exposed. Therefore, the API keys are up for grab and anyone can authenticate as my app. How can I prevent this? Can I prevent this at all? This question is very similar to this thread, however, it's not a desktop application.
