In designing the data layer code for an application, I'm trying to determine if there is a minimal set of database operations (both single and combined) that are essential for proper application function (i.e. the database is left in an expected state after every data access call). Is there a way to determine the minimal set of database operations (functions, transactions, etc.) that are critical for an application to function correctly? How do I find it? Thanks very much!
