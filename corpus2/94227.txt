I come from a "3rd world country", moved a year ago to a "first world country", got a job doing customer support (networking/ management company) and web dev for my current employer. I started to cover for the main support engineer that was going for holidays; then my boss wanted an iPhone + iPad + server app for managing the employees (app on testing ground now); and gave the project to me. As I started in a new country, I got offered a very low salary, and was told it would be reviewed in a couple months, then it became "when the app is ready", and now that the app is ready, is at the end of this year (I started August last year). I was ok with the low salary as I was mostly learning (Objective-C) I come from microcontroller C and Linux background. Now my boss is in Europe for holidays and left everything (and everyone) for some weeks... I got now the need to make an average salary for a developer (mid level), and have been looking for jobs now that my boss is away. If I get a job before he comes back, I feel a bit guilty that he gave me a chance to learn and I pay him by leaving (and leave him with some web portals, and iOS apps)... But I really need to make more money for my family too, so I have clear I need to improve my conditions, but still feel thankful with the guy. But more important is my family! So how to proceed?
