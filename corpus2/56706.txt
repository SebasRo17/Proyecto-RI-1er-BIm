Today Visual Studio 2010 SP1 comes out as general availability release. This made me wondering about the upcoming release of Visual Studio 2012: What are Microsoft's plans for Visual Studio 2012? I heard they'll come with a new version every two years. Are there any open fora or discussions? When will a preview be publicly available? But most importantly: what are the new highlights, improvements in .NET and C#/F#/VB (and C++ of course, request from Stijn)?
