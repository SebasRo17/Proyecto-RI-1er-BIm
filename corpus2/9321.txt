In a nutshell, why does this work (change `y` and see how the value updates)               ClearAll[y];     Dynamic[x,      Initialization :> (x = Symbol["y"])]      and then on a separate cell               y = 98;      but this doesn't? (assign the printed variable whatever value and see how it doesn't update)               Dynamic[x,      Initialization :> (x = Unique[])]      You can also write `Dynamic[the printed var]` in a separate cell and see how it doesn't update either. For now, I'll be using something that works and I would have never thought I would be using               Dynamic[x,      Initialization :> (x = (Remove[#]; Symbol[#]) &@ToString@Unique[])]      My current weird conclusion: _"If a variable was declared by`Unique[]` inside a `Dynamic` update, then it will never be tracked by any `Dynamic` "_
