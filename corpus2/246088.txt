I successfully setup a xcoderserver to do ci builds. On every bot's page there is an installation-link-button, which works well for developers. However, for our qa department, i'd like to provide a more app-store-like webpage showing all bot's build results with app name and icon from where they can install the **very same** archives as provided on the "normal" bot page. Is there an easy, or even apple-documented way to do so? Has anyone any ideas how to do that manually? I already found where builds are stored on disk, I also found out that a product-install-link looks like `http://<SERVER_NAME>/xcs/install/<PRODUCT_GUID>` . The productGUID is dynamically generated during the bot's run. The Xcode server webpage retrieves the productGUID via requests to the Xcode webapp which responses with json structures containing a lot of information about the bot run. I hoped for having access to the productGUID on that way too, but it turned out, that these requests need a (also dynamically generated) bot-run-ID...
