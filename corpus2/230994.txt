I am learning programming from a book called "Programming Principles and Practice" by Bjarne Stroustrup. It has been highly recommended over here and elsewhere. My only issue is that it uses C++98 and as I understand there have been two other standards c++2003 and c++2011. Going through this book will be a significant investment of time and effort for me (210 hours recommended) and I would not want to commit to if my skills or knowledge gained may be outdated or not as useful etc. On the other hand this book is written by an expert and is widely recognized as one of the best for entry level programming (assuming no prior knowledge). Despite a lot of research I have struggled to find another book which is written by such a leading authority and provides good and accurate introduction for the beginner. Could someone share some insight as to what and how much I would be losing out on if I use this book and learn C++98. And whether going through it would be a good choice for a person in my situation and worth the investment of time and effort. If you own this book or are experienced user of C++, your insight will be appreciated even more. Thanks.
