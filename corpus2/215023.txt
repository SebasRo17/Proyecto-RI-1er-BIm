There was a talk given by Brian Hurt about advantages and disadvantages of static typing. Brian said that by static typing he don't mean **C#** , but **F#** and **Haskell**. Is it because of `dynamic` keyword added to C#-4.0? But this feature is relatively rarely useful. By the way, there are `‚ä•` and `unsafeCoerse` in Haskell which obviously are not the same, but something that could blown your head off in runtime similarly like exception thrown as a result of `dynamic`. Finally, why F# and Haskell could be named a statically typed languages and C# couldn't?
