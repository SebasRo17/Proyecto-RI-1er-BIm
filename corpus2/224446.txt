Stata is a proprietary statistical program used largely by economists. I want to write a basic multiple regression package that uses the same commands as Stata, e.g., `regress var1 var2 var3, robust if var4[_n - 1] < .` Is it legal (in the US) to distribute source code that does this under an open-source license? In other words, does any IP protection apply to the command syntax used by proprietary software?
