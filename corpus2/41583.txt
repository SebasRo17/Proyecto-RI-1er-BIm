I am trying to solve for a variable which appears in the limits of an integral, rather like in the following;               Clear[f, a, x]     f[a_] := Integrate[x^2 + a x, {x, 0, a }]     f[Power[6, (3)^-1]]     NSolve[5 == f[a], a, Reals]      This works absolutely fine. But the integral I really care about is a mess, and so has, of course, no nice closed form. So I try the following;               Clear[f, a, x]     f[a_] := NIntegrate[x^2 + a x, {x, 0, a }]     f[Power[6, (3)^-1]]     NSolve[5 == f[a], a, Reals]      and this does not work. Instead I get `NIntegrate::nlim: x = a is not a valid limit of integration.` In both of these examples, the third line evaluates the function `f[a]` fine. I also tried               f[a_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[x^2 + a x, {x, 0, a }]      which fails with `NSolve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to NSolve.` I rather hoped the link below would answer my problem, but of course it refers to `Integrate`, not `NIntegrate`. http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38012/compute-unknown-limit-from- known-integral-in-mathematica I'd be very grateful for any suggestions.
