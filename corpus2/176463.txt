I'm wondering whether there is a performance difference between using different CSS properties to translate an element. Some properties fit different situations differently. You can translate an element with following properties: `transform`, `top/left/right/bottom` and `margin-top/left/right/bottom` In the case where you do not utilize the `transition` CSS property for the translation but use some form of a timer (`setTimeout`, `requestAnimationFrame` or `setImmediate`) or raw events, which is the most performantâ€“which is going to make for higher FPS rates?
