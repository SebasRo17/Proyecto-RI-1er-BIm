Here's a situation that usually happens in some companies: Announce interesting product X. Promise a release date. Release on the promised released date, ready or not. Users discover and report defects. Send patch after patch after patch after patch after patch. My question is: Ummm, what could be the factors that would lead them to tolerate these undesirable practices? So, in the name of quality, what can be practically and realistically improved in those practicies? I can think of time constraints, user feedback, sponsors pressuring the company, lack of money.
