I have an inheritance hierarchy three deep : an abstract base class, from which I derive another abstract class, call it the intermediate class, from which will derive possibly a large variety of derived classes. At one point, the base class calls a `this.GenerateXml()` method, implemented in the derived class, that returns nothing, but writes xml to a public property. At this point, I would like the intermediate class to do some stuff, without the base class or the derived class having to call a specific method on the intermediate class. Is this possible in OO languages? Constructors call each other up the chain of inheritance. Can methods? Can an object call a method on it's immediate descendant? The language in this case is C# The obvious solution is to call a method, perhaps a same named method, from the derived class, using "base". This is less than ideal, because every derived class has to remember to make the call.
