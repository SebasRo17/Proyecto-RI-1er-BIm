I'm experiencing strange behavior in `Checkbox` with `Appearance`:               Table[Checkbox[Appearance -> a], {a, {Tiny, Small, Medium, Large}}]      (Copied from the help file) doesn't give me any difference in size. Screenshot: ![checkbox sizes screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/77k73.png) `CheckboxBar` has the same behavior. _Mathematica_ seems to ignore the `Appearance` setting. I'm running mma 8.0.4.0 on Ubuntu 12.10 (64-bit). **Question: Is this a bug or just a non-existing but nonetheless documented feature?**
