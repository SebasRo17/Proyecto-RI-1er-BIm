I'm trying to do some typesetting in which I mix text with formulas. The _Mathematica_ documentation has a section titled `"Mixing Text and Formulas"` which pretty much describes what it is that I'd like to do. However I can't seem to work out how they do it. The tutorial says to use `Ctrl`+`(` to start entering a formula within text or vice versa, however I don't seem to get the result I am after. This is what their example looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rMCup.png) Notice that they have been able to mix text with a formula that is in `TraditionalForm`, this is what I would like to be able to do. If I enter: `"Hello World = " x^2` but `Ctrl`+`(` before I enter the `x^2`.... > >     Hello World = x^2 >   * * * ## Further Clarification Some further clarification (I would have preferred to enter this clarification after all of your helpful hints below but the guidelines recommend against answering your own question or adding further clarification in that way): In my text box I'd like to use a prior defined equation rather than having to re-enter and format it in the text box. Hopefully this next image will clarify: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tqF0p.png)
