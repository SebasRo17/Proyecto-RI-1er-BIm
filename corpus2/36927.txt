I'm relatively new to using Mathematica so I'm not sure if this is really even possible, but I figured it may be worth a try. In my Physical Chemistry class today, we were learning about acid/base equilibria, and for one particular problem it came to a point where we had a system of 6 unknowns in 7 equations, however these were nonlinear equations so simple calculator tools and matrices wouldn't be sufficient to calculate them. So I thought perhaps Mathematica would be powerful enough to be able to write a script of some sort to be able to solve them. The equations in question are as follows. Typically these variables are actually concentrations of some compound, but I've just replaced them with letters to make it simple: 1: x + y = 2z + a + b 2: x + c = 2(z + a) 3: 276 = (x^2)(z) 4: 5.7x10^-10 = [(y)(c)]/(x) 5: 9.8x10^-13 = [(b)(a)]/(z) 6: 9.25 = -log(y) 7: 1x10^-14 = y + c and we need to solve for x, y, z, a, b, and c. Can this really be done in a simple way? Thanks for any input!
