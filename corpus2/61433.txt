I'm a python monkey at heart. I eat drink sleep and dream in it, and have found that it's taught me much more about writing quality code than my degree in Computer Science ever did, however I've been asked to write an automated testing project in C# at work to link in with Team Foundation Server. Having looked at the language it looks very similar. I've noticed that it seems to be statically typed but I never had any problems with that in C++ or Ada. I've tried looking online for tutorials etc, but they all seem to start from the basics. I was hoping to be able to find information on differences and code translations et al similar to Norvig's lisp to python article. A search on google hasn't rendered any results for me so I was hoping to have a bit more luck here. * * * As a little background I have about 4 years of python, 2 of C++, but that was a few years ago, and bits and pieces of knowledge of other languages. I try not to mention BASIC any more...   It is because of my extended current experience with python that I wish to compare C# with it.
