I'm learning Silverlight, and I know that if I master it, I can apply the same concepts to WPF, which means I can do either web or desktop development pretty easily. But I've read articles and followed the discussion online, and I understand HTML5 is gaining traction for being cross-platform, and a lot of people seem to be moving to HTML5. From my understanding, any HTML5 application would be built with HTML and JavaScript (or Flash). But is it secure? It seems like anyone can easily use their browser's "view source" option and grab your code. Is this something I should be worried about, or is there a way to protect against it?
