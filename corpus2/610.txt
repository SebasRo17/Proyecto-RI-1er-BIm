MathLink supports two communication protocols on all platforms: TCPIP or shared memory. There are additional protocols supported on some systems only ("FileMap" and "Pipes" according to the docs). I do not have much familiarity with MathLink's C language interface. **Question:** Is the MathLink communication protocol user-customizable? Can MathLink be extended by users to use an alternative underlying communication protocol (example)?
