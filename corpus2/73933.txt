I'm reading about Algebraic Data Types (thanks to Richard Minerich I found this excellent explanation of the concept). While I think I understand the notion of sum types and product types etc., what I'm not quite understanding is how Algebraic Data Types are useful beyond specifying pattern matching. What other things can one do with ADT's beyond pattern matching? * * * EDIT: I'm not asking what can a developer do with ADT's that can't be done with objects. I'm asking if there are other operations that ADT's allow; for example, can one do additional reasoning about the types involved if ADT's are employed? Do ADT's facilitate some sort of type analysis that wouldn't be possible without them?
