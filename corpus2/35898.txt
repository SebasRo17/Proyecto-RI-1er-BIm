I have worked as a developer for over 10 years now. During that time I have had my own small projects where I have developed tools, applications and games. I have not found any robust solution to store my work. It’s always fun to get back to your code and see how you did before and how you would do it now. It’s just work that is unfortunate to lose. There are SVN solution such as Google’s Project Hosting. However I’m not interested in sharing my code or making it open source. Currently I’m hosting my own SVN server. So here comes my question: How and where do you store your private work/sourcecode? Requirements:   * Sourcecode versioning   * Backup   * Prefers free   * **Edit:** Remote access **Edit:** I have used Dropbox + TrueCrypt + SVN. Unfortunately you are limited to 5gb.
