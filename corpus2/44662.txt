I recently asked a question on SO about Python web frameworks: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4909306/python-web-frameworks-vs-java-web- frameworks-how-is-web-development-in-python-do I want to learn one just for fun but it also has to be able to help me deliver a proper working application. I am looking for a framework with lots of features, powerful, mature, with large community, good documentation, books etc. I need something that will help me be more productive in developing my app and not waste time figuring out how to do a certain thing in the framework or how to write workaround around the limitations of the framework. I was thinking one of the following: django, zope, turbogears, pylons. Off course the war is raging out there and there are other alternatives but seems Django is at the top... or is it just hype? I am interested in pros and cons of each. What was the best feature you think the framework has? What is the thing it lacks? What could have been done differently. Help me chose one to learn for starters.
