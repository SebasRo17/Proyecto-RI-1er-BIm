I'm trying to create a figure illustrating a cylinder filled with gas. And I saw a very good looking similar one at here. The shape is polygon and by using the VertexColors option, it creates a impression of gas inside the building, with high density near the floor and low density near the roof. However, I would like to plot a cylinder, and for a cylinder, there seems no option of VertexColors. So how can I create the same shading effect for a cylinder? Code copied from here               w = 100;     l = 200;     h = 30;     m = 70;     backwall = {{0, l, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}};     side1 = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, h}, {0, l, h}, {0, l, 0}};     side2 = {{w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {w, l, 0}};     floor = {{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {0, l, 0}};     top = {{0, 0, h}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}};     front = {{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {0, 0, h}};     leftRoof = {{0, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {w/2, l, m}, {0, l, h}};     rightRoof = {{w, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {w/2, l, m}, {w, l, h}};     roofBack = {{w, l, h}, {w/2, l, m}, {0, l, h}};     roofFront = {{w, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {0, 0, h}};     building = {backwall, side1, side2, floor, front, leftRoof, rightRoof,         roofBack, roofFront};     figure = Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.5],         Style[Polygon[building,           VertexColors -> Map[0.5 + #[[3]]/80 &, building, {2}]],          Lighting -> {{"Ambient", White}}]}, Boxed -> False,        RotationAction -> "Clip"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9zsS6.png)
