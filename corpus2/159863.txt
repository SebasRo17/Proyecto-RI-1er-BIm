int i = 2*5/2;      int j = 2*(5/2);      printf("%d\n,%d\n",i,j);      **Variable Associativity** : when I run this program, the first statement gives me `i = 4;` Shouldn't it give me 2, because according to BODMAS rule `/` is evaluated before `*`, so the variable should have been evaluated as `(5/2)=2` and then `2*2=4`? I know this is a noob question, but this never fails to surprise me.
