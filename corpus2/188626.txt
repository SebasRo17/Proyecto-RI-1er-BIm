For example I have class `ItemDownloader` which has method `downloadItem`. This method creates instance of another class - `Download` to perform actual downloading. Question is: I want to test `ItemDownloader` in isolation, so I will probably mock up `Download`. How should I do it? P.S.: Question is more about design than implementation, I can certainly mock up class object in languages like Smalltalk or Objective-C, or use Prototype pattern in C++. But as I understand there is better solution.
