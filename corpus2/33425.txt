I often do row-reduced-echelon-form (RREF) calculations that involve parameters using the _RowReduce_ command. Most times, I want to know which parameters make the system consistent. For example:                RowReduce[{{1, 2, 3, a}, {4, 5, 6, a^2}, {7, 8, 9, a^3}}]      Mathematica reduces this to its lowest form, which results in an inconsistent system because the last row is {0,0,0,1}. However, if you look at the details of the the steps it takes (using WA with rref {{1, 2, 3, a}, {4, 5, 6, a^2}, {7, 8, 9, a^3}}), it shows the point where you could see that choosing $a = 0$ or $a = 1$ would produce a consistent system with infinite solutions. Either of these values for $a$ makes the last row of the rref {0,0,0,0}. Is there a way to get Mathematica to show this reduction without losing that important fact or to state which values of the parameters make the system consistent? Maybe I should be using a different command or approach. It is also interesting that rref is able to successfully find the result for this two parameter example:                RowReduce[{{a, b, 1, 1},{1, a b, 1, b},{1, b, b, 1}}]
