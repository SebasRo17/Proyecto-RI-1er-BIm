I read an interesting article, _10 reasons for quitting IT_. I quote a part of this text: > "This misunderstanding of both duty and technology does one thing: It makes > your job impossible. When the powers-that-be begin to micromanage your > department for you, every single bad element is exacerbated. You know your > job and you know you know your job. Management does not know your job, but > they don’t know they don’t know your job. It’s all a vicious Mobius strip of > stress." This is exactly what is going on on my project at the moment. The client, that is, the one that pays, wants to be everything. He wants to play every possible role in the project. He even wants a detailed technical explanation even though he doesn't know a single thing about programming. And when something doesn't work he blames it on someone else. Has anybody had some similar experience? Any advice on how to deal with these situations?
