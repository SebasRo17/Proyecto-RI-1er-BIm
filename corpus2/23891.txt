Lately I have become interested in familiarizing myself with REST. I tried reading wiki entry on REST, but it was of no help. I would really appreciate it if someone can explain in simple English (that is without **unnecessary** tech jargon)   1. What is REST   2. What position it occupies in web architecture ecosystem   3. How tightly (or loosely) it is coupled with protocol.   4. What are the alternatives to REST and how does REST compare with them. I understand it may not be possible to answer this in one or two paragraphs, in that case relevant links will be highly appreciated.
