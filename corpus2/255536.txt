I am learning ZeroMQ and came across the Majordomo Protocol. I am wondering if I'm understanding this correctly, is the use case the same as.. for example.. the Microsoft Azure AppFabric service? Would I use Majordomo if I wanted to create an AppFabric-like servie bus? Or would I do Pub/Sub+Request/Reply? If you are not familiar, azure service bus is a way to connect applications to services (or applications to applications, etc) -- at least for the purposes of this discussion: ![Azure AppFabric Service Bus](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PY6xJ.jpg) Does it seem like this is a Majordomo protocol use case, or am I looking at a different pattern here (the bottom "direct-connection" line notwithstanding). How would eventing work (a worker initiated message)? \-- (EDIT) Thanks Adam. Distilling the question down to its essence, if I were to implement the Azure AppFabric messaging protocol with ZeroMQ, would I be using the Majordomo protocol, or would another pattern be more appropriate? Also as reference, link to ZMQ Majordomo: http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:7
