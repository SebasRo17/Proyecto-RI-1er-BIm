We are working in a Visual Studio Environment using TFS. When developers get the latest source code it includes a copy of the 'update' sql scripts for the database of the application. The challenge is keeping our local copies of the DB up to date. When changes are made to the DB by another developer, we are looking for a way to:   1. indicate to other developers that their version of the DB is out of date   2. indicate to other developers the order in which they should run the update scripts We are looking for suggestions. For point number 2, I have used numbers such as 01_DropCreate_TableX, 02_Create_StoreProcedure_X. etc DH
