I have a small github project, which I need to add an option to to output some version number on the commandline. The problem is I have no idea how to "compute" the version number. Is this some random process? Should I just start at 1.0 (probably creating a tag or something), and put a number after `.` for fixes? I know this question is a bit vague... I just had never to deal with this, and want to use some sane versioning scheme. **EDIT** Im also interested into how to update this version number automatically, maybe using something like a git hook.
