My Plan   * Have a system that holds some objects   * Have a winforms-form that displays some key values of these objects   * When certain changes occur(object gets add / removed / datat change): Update GUI My Idea   * subscribe my form to events in the objects   * update form when objects chamge (/raise events) My Troubles   * winforms (for good reasons) does not allow for changes coming from foreign threads   * an eventHandler is in fact run in the thread of the object calling   * hence .net throws an exception and I'm done. Question:   Is there a way to manipulate a form through events not raised by itself? Alternatively:   Is there a way I can "nudge" my form to say "hey, better check your data, there's something new", without having to constantly poll?
