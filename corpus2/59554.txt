First I will tell you what my ultimate goal is, because maybe there's another way of doing it other than what I am trying. I need a list of all $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N)$ tuples that satisfy certain conditions.   * $a_i$ can take integer values between $1$ and $s$, that is, from the set $\\{1, \ldots, s\\}$.   * Neighbouring entries differ by $1$, that is, $|a_i - a_{i+1}| = 1$   * A "periodic boundary condition" holds. That means that $a_N$ and $a_1$ also differ by $1$ (we effectively have a ring).   * $N$ can be assumed to be even, because otherwise it's not possible to satisfy the previous two conditions at the same time. For $N=6, s=5$, I've put $a_1$ at the back of the list in parentheses for clarity. $2,3,4,5,4,3(,2)$ works.   $2,3,4,5,4,5(,2)$ doesn't, because $5$ and $2$ don't differ by one.   $2,4,3,4,3,3(,2)$ obviously doesn't work, because some pairs of neighbouring entries don't differ by $1$.   OK, I've been thinking that I could take `PathGraph[Range[1,s]]`, which is a builtin Graph with 1 being adjacent to 2, 2 being adjacent to 3 (and 1), 3 being adjacent to 4 (and 2), ..., s-1 being adjacent to s (and s-2). Now I can easily get _the number_ of tuples with the above properties by calculating the Nth `MatrixPower` of the `AdjacencyMatrix` and taking the Trace of that matrix, because the entries on the diagonal are Paths of length N, starting at 1, ending at 1, (plus the ones starting at 2 ending at 2, plus ...) possibly going back and forth between vertices. However, I need to have the tuples to work with them, so I wanted to get a list of paths of length N between two vertices of that simple path graph. But I can't seem to get that with the builtin functions. `FindPath[PathGraph[Range[1, 7]], 1, 3, {2}]` will give the path `1 -> 2 ->3` which has length 2. However, `FindPath[PathGraph[Range[1, 7]], 1, 3, {4}]` will give an empty set. It won't give me the path `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3`, which visits nodes twice and goes back and forth along the same edge. Is there some way to get all of these? (the mentioned one and, say `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3`). Of course I've read numerous posts on paths on these forums and a couple of entries about functions concerning graphs in the Mathematica documentation, but I couldn't seem to find what I need. I'd expect `FindPath[PathGraph[Range[1, 7]], 2, 2, {2}]` (same starting and ending point) to give me `2 -> 3 -> 2` and `2 -> 1 -> 2`. Which would get me the tuples $2,3(,2)$ and $2,1(,2)$, speaking the language from the beginning of the post.
