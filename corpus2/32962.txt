I have two types of sets, one of them is a list of points of the form $\\{t_{k}\\}$ and the other one is an interval of the form $[a,b]$. And my custom set consists of these type of sets and I need to plot its Cartesian product. As an example, say my set is $A=[0,1]\cup\\{2,3,4,5\\}$, I need to plot $A\times A$. If I have only list of points, then I have no problem but when intervals come in to play, I don't have a very good idea. I need help at this point.
