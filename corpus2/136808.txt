I am writing an application that takes some file specifying an adjacency matrix and uses this to construct a graph (in this case, a directed social network). What I would like to do is specify the size of the matrix and then have it generate an adjacency matrix with one of these topologies: ring, hierarchical, fully-connected, random and smallworld (every node x degrees of separation from each other). Ideally a text file would be the output. I can't create these files manually because the size is in the thousands^2... Fully-connected and random aren't 100% required but they would be nice, I can just implement them in code. I read a dissertation which specified it used an application located at http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~tmill/graphtastic.tgz ...but it does not seem to exist anymore so I am not sure what to do. I thought there would be loads of applications such as this out there, but I can't see any. So, is there an program out there that could generate an adjacency matrix with a configurable topology into a text file ?
