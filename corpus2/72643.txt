In the company I currently work on, we've noticed that sometimes, some stories are bound to each other (as in too coupled). This might be that they belong to the same overall feature, or that they're different features but there are some of them that need to be finished first in order to continue with the next ones, etc. How do you handle this cases, without stopping the workflow of the iteration? Are we doing something wrong?
