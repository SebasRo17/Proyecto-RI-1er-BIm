We're learning that most languages are classified as either of the two, "relation based" or "high level". I've never used SQL before, but from reading its syntax it seems more like the imperative/high-level syntax than functional/relation-based (Lisp, Haskell)?? Or it could just be that my interpretation of my professor's lecture notes is wrong... but it definitely lists SQL as one of the relation-based languages (as opposed to high level), and it equates relation-based with functional... or perhaps it's that I don't understand **why the fact that SQL deals with relational databases makes a functional language the way it should be implemented? (and why 'relation-based' equates with 'functional' when categorizing programming languages?)** Thanks :)
