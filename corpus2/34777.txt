I would like to solve numerically the differential equation for the displacement `x[t]` of a mass `m`-spring `k` system with compliant stoppers. The equation should be something like:               m x"[t] == -k x[t] -F[t]       `F[t]` should be defined so that: -it is `0` when `Abs[x]` is below a certain value `x0` -it is equal to `- k2 (x[t] - x0)` when `Abs[x]` is above `x0`. Which _Mathematica_ function should I use to define `F[t]` so that `NDSolve` can solve the corresponding equation?
