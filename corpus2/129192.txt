The problem below appeared on the last Code Sprint 2 programming competition (it's over already). The base cases are clear, but developing an algorithm that solves all possible cases has been a challenge so far. > There are N cards on the table and each has a number between 0 and N on it. > Let us denote the number on the Nth Ni. You want to pick up all the cards, > but you can only pick a specific Nth card if you already picked Ni cards > before. (As an example, if a card has a value of 3 on it, you can’t pick > that card up unless you’ve already picked up 3 cards previously) In how many > ways can all the cards be picked up? > > Input are the cards with their respective numbers, and the output should be > the total number of ways possible to pick them up.               Sample Input:     0 0 0      Sample Output:     6          Sample Input:     0 0 0 0      Sample Output:     24          Sample Input:     0 0 1     Sample Output     4          Sample Input:     0 3 3     Sample Output:     0
