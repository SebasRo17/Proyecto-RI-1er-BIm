Is there a resource or site which illustrates building the same application (desktop or web) using several different contrasting architectures? Such as MVP versus MVVM versus MVC, etc. It would be very helpful to see how they look side-by-side using real-world code instead of comparing written theory to written theory. I've often found that something can be _described_ well in a book, but when you go to _implement_ it, the subtleties and weaknesses of the theory become readily apparent.
