I'm not totally clear on how using the command line differs from working through the OS' interface using an editor for example. Obviously the UI is different but I want to understand how the command line interacts with the kernel and microprocessor, and how this compares to how kernel interfaces with the OS' GUI. I know I'm missing several layers of abstraction but would be grateful for someone to explain this.
