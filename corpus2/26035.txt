I have a user-defined function which takes three vectors as input. Suppose that is like this:               f[a_, b_, u_] := Total[a*Total[u]^b]      Usually I have vectors for `a` and `b` but a matrix format for `u`. For example,               a = {1.5, 2, 1}     b = {-1, 1, 0.5}     u = {{1, 2, 0}, {1, 0, 1.5}, {2, 1, 1}}      which should give the result > {8.23205, 7.18114, 10.375} In other words, the function `f` should be applied to each row of `u`. I can do this using a `Do` loop, but I want to know how to do it using `Map` or other functional commands (but not `Table`).
