I want to ask whether any materials that has "Free for non-commercial use" license can be used in a GNU GPLv3 licensed software. In my opinion, it is "free for non-commericial use", and GNU GPLv3 is also non-commericial, so it can be used in the software, is it? I'm asking this question because there are no explicit or clear declaration about "FREE FOR NON-COMMERCIAL USE" license out there....
