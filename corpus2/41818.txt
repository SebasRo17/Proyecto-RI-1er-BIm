I am trying to solve two simultaneous equations that are claimed to have 145 solutions but I believe they have 143, I want to check I am right before sending an email to my professor. Mathematica is taking an incredible amount of time with this so I thought my code was wrong. Could you please check it for me?               Length[NSolve[{x == Sin[6 Pi y], y == Sin[6 Pi x]}, {x, y}]]      The equations are $y=sin(6 Pi x)$ and $x=sin(6 Pi y)$ apologies if my conjecture is wrong!
