I need to move an object based on 100 images rotating. The object needs to move in a path that is forming an ellipse when I'm rotating the image based on my gestures. I have **4 points** , _2 pairs of opposite points on X/Y axis_ , on the ellipse but how do I calculate the rest of the points in **code-behind** so that I can **calculate** the new **X/Y Value** of my **next/previous point**? Currently I'm just rotating my object in a circle what is a start but not what I want at all...      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rhyj2.png)
