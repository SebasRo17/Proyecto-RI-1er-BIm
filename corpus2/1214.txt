I'm new to CUDA, and CUDALink. I see how CUDAFunctionLoad allows one to set the block dimensions. On calling the function, you can also either pass as argument or have MMA automatically select the number of threads to be launched as the max length of the arguments passed. However, I don't see how I can set the grid dimensions if I want a bidimensional grid. It should be possible, right?
