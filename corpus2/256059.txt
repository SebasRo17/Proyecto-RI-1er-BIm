I am playing a MMORPG where I have to start a game client executable, and login through that game client. Somehow this game client manages to save my Username after I login with one. At first I thought that kind of information was saved in one of the game files, but after reinstalling the game my username was still there after I started the game client, meaning that username information is stored elsewhere. And so that leads to my question. Where does an executable, in this case a game client, store user information? This is analagous to how a browser uses cookies to store user info.
