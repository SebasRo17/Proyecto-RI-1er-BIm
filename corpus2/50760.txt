Minor aesthetic question here. I was playing around with `Graph`'s and decided to render a cute-looking family of directed graphs, with the vertices being the number associated with the vertex. Here is an example with number of nodes $n=200$ (right-click and open in a new tab to see at proper resolution):               n = 200;     Graph[Table[i -> Mod[30 i, n, 1], {i, n}], ImageSize -> 1280,       VertexShape -> Table[i -> i, {i, n}], VertexSize -> 1,       VertexStyle -> White, EdgeStyle -> Green, Background -> Black]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/maTTZ.png) It looks fine. Now let's try $n=5$:               n = 5;     Graph[Table[i -> Mod[30 i, n, 1], {i, n}], ImageSize -> 1280,       VertexShape -> Table[i -> i, {i, n}], VertexSize -> 1,       VertexStyle -> White, EdgeStyle -> Green, Background -> Black]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1nYef.png) The vertex labels are gigantic and distort the figure to make it unreadable. Fine, let's just set `VertexSize -> Automatic`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9WBQ7.png) Much better. Let's try using `VertexSize -> Automatic` for the $n=200$ case once more: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0N3l9.png) The three-digit labels are unreadable, because `Automatic` does not appear to correctly scale them, and so it only displays the first digit and cuts off the rest with a `...`. Is there an automatic way (other than `VertexSize -> Automatic`) to make text vertices show up as the right size without being truncated?
