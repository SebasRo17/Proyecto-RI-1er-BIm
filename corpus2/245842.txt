I have made a large number of modifications to some MIT-licensed source code to tailor it to the requirements of my project. Since this is JavaScript (for a website) the minified source code is naturally attainable by anyone viewing the site. Whilst I am happy for people to use the source code under the terms of the MIT license, I feel that the body text of the license may lead to confusion since this is a highly modified version. Is it acceptable to amend the license text? What is the correct etiquette ? **Original Text:**               The MIT License (MIT)          Copyright (c) 2009 - 2014 Adriana Palazova     http://www.adipalaz.com          ...      Full license in question (for a jQuery accordion control): http://www.adipalaz.com/docs/mit-license.txt **Proposed Change:** Add my name to the copyright notice in the MIT license:               The MIT License (MIT)          Copyright (c) 2009 - 2014 Adriana Palazova, 2014 {{My Name Here}}     http://www.adipalaz.com          ...      And then change the header in the minified JavaScript file to the following:               /*!       * Nested Accordion (Modified by {{My Name Here}})      * Copyright (c) 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 Adriana Palazova      * Copyright (c) 2014 {{My Name Here}}      * Licensed under the MIT (http://{{My URL Here}}/mit-license.txt) license.      */
