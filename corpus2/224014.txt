I am creating Rubik's cube solver. It will be good if solver could solve cubes of any size and if it could generate short solutions. I have found many various information about God's algorithm, which as I understand is able to solve various puzzles, not only Rubic's cube. So I want to implement God's algorithm, but I cannot find any simple explanation of this algorithm. In simple words, how does God's algorithm actually work?
