I'm taking intermediate data structures course as a prereq for entry into the CS MS program at a University everyone in America has heard of. One line of code that was written in class caught my eye: `if (a > 33 | b++ < 54) {...}` This would never pass a code review at my workplace. If you wrote code like this in an interview, you would not be hired. This is not an exaggeration. (In addition to being a conditional with side effects, it's being clever at the expense of clarity.) In fact, I've never seen a conditional with side effects, and Googling doesn't turn up much, either. Another student stayed behind after class to ask about it, too, so I'm not the only one who thought this was weird. But the professor was pretty adamant that this was acceptable code, and that he would write something like that at work. (His FT job is as a Principal SWE at a company you've all heard of.) I cannot imagine a world in which this line of code would ever be acceptable, let alone desirable. Am I wrong? Is this OK? What about the more general case: conditionals with side effects? Are those ever OK?
