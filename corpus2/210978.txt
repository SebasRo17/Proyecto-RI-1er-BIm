Backstory:   As the single developer with experience in the chosen technology, a month ago I drafted a component that for all extents and purposes worked within acceptable levels according to the demos that were had. Four weeks and assorted developers later (that´d be more or less last Thursday), the feature entered QA and since then I´ve been given 8 showstopper bugs, around 25 critical ones, 47 majors and a single minor one. I´m beginning to harbor a grudge against this people, but then, they're making their best to actually improve the quality of the product, so I really shouldn´t. At the same time, I also think I have a right to sleep/eat without having nightmares of showstoppers appearing on my inbox. What´s a polite way of handling this situation? I´ve gotten most of the former developers on board with this, but the QA folk continue to report all their bugs to me and upper management keeps asking me what I´m doing about them, so I´m growing considerably more anxious each day that passes by. * * * More details: About one in thirteen bug reports are actually addressable by me (about one in three of those is actually caused by code I wrote), the rest of them lay in code that is honestly foreign to me at all. Yet I´m the one getting the reports and being ad-hoc in charge of distributing them to the right developers. I´m not the team lead. Judging by the amount of work I´ve been given someone seems to think I´m actually a team of people under my name. All jokes aside, the actual team lead is on extended leave without an explicit replacement, and the most senior dev in the project is actually spearheading another module for the project, and I´ve made it abundantly clear that I´ve had 0 involvement in the project for about four weeks already. The reason I´m posting this is because I´m running out of options for reals, not just imagining things.
