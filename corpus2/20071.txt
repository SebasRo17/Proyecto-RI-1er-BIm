I am sending queries to Wolfram | Alpha from _Mathematica_ V9 and and importing the results back into _Mathematica_ , but I am running into a challenge in formatting the request. Specifically, I would like a listing of all of the departing flights from LAX for the current day and, then, I want to select only those flights using Airbus A380 aircraft (there should be about 5 per day). When I query for LAX departures it returns a subpod of the 680+/- departures for the current 24 hour window, but I am not able to retrieve the aircraft type. If I search for a specific flight, such as "American Airlines flight 1867", Wolfram | Alpha returns a subpod with the aircraft/equipment details. I checked Wolfram | Alpha's sources; both queries are going to the FAA ASDI database, so the data should be available. Any suggestions? One other question: The subpod of LAX departures displays five results, but indicates 680 or so results are returned. Is there a way in _Mathematica_ to tell Wolfram | Alpha to return all results without having to code "More" repeatedly? See the `PodStates` option below in the code.               WolframAlpha["Flights departing LAX",        {{"FlightsBetween:Scheduled:From:FlightData", 1}, "Content"},        PodStates ->            {"FlightsBetween:Scheduled:From:FlightData__More",             "FlightsBetween:Scheduled:From:FlightData__More",             "FlightsBetween:Scheduled:From:FlightData__More"}]
