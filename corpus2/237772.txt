I need to connect to a server and do manipulation with respect to HTTP GET and POST for my application and the server is generally used to handle multiple users with heavy load and many users might be sending multiple request at any moment. I have 3 questions here. The server is configured with ASP.NET I am using Java to do my HTTP POST and GET requests. Is there any way available to make my request data to have more priority than others ? Also, I read some article in internet and it is mentioned that using proxies will help in speed up the process and will give us high chance of getting the connection with the server. Is that true ? If yes, why ? Thanks in advance.
