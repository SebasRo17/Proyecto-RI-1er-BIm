I'm working with some people are are used to making "associative arrays" in JavaScript like this:               var arr = new Array();     arr.prop_1 = "asdf";      or               arr['prop 2'] = "1234";      It works just like an object because it is. `for...in` loops can be used and accessing the properties is fine using a dot or a square brace. the lack of native array methods seems not to be lamented. I find it sort of semantically irritating however. Maybe I'm being picky, but I want a good argument for arresting the use of this syntax, but I can't understand how to start. Any suggestions?
