There has been a trend in the Ruby/Rails community to create lots of objects that have very small functionality (SRP anyone?) and live in their own file. These are often extracted from large, bloated model files. This could be good, but I think it is often changing one problem (bloated models with hundreds of lines of code) for another, worse problem (hundreds of small object files in subdirectories several layers deep). Are there any known effects on the cognitive load difference between lots of small files and fewer large ones?
