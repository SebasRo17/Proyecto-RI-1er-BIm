Having this ordinary non linear differential equation $$y'-x^2 (y+1)\cdot (y+2)^2= 0$$ with the boundary condition $y(4)=2$. When trying to solve this one with Mathematica by using               DSolve[{y'[x] - x^2 (y[x] + 1) (y[x] - 2)^2 == 0, y[4] == 2}, y[x], x]      it gives an empty set of solution and returns               DSolve::bvnul: For some branches of the general solution, the given boundary conditions lead to an empty solution. >>      As we have $$y'=x^2(y+1)\cdot (y+2)^2$$ which is clearly lipschitz continuous hence local a unique solution exists. In special $$y=2 \quad \forall x$$ is a solution of the differential equation. When using `NDSolve`and plotting the results it looks pretty much like the constant function which solves the ode. How does it come that Mathematica says there is no solution? I am using Mathematica 9.0.1 (Student Edition).
