A friend is bidding on a IT project, and he needs to include my résumé with his response to the bid; I'm the "Subject Matter Expert." I will be helping him outside of my regular working hours. How do folks in the IT field handle such résumé submissions? First of all, I don't want to include (or exclude) anything that would be misleading or untrue, but my concern is that in my field people know each other and I don't want my current employer finding out that I have submitted a résumé with another company especially when I am not an employee of my friend's company. All in all, I want to avoid the awkwardness of my employer finding out (and the worse of whatever that might lead to), yet balance that with helping a friend. So my question is, what should I leave out or retain? What is appropriate? Thanks!
