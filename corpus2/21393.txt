I am using `Manipulate` and `Plot3D` to plot a function with two real variables and two extra parameters.               f[x_, y_, alpha_, gamma_] := x*y + alpha*x - Log[Power[x, gamma]*y]        Manipulate[         Plot3D[f[x, y, alpha, gamma], {x, 0, 5}, {y, 0, 5},          PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.4]],         {alpha, -100, 100, 0.1}, {gamma, -100,          100, 0.1}]      I want to dynamically highlight/plot the 3D curve (or set of points) of the vanishing partials (`D[f, x] == D[f, y] == 0`) over the function, and have it update according to the parameter values manipulated. I know I should probably use `NDSolve` for this, But I need the solution to be updated and displayed on parameter changes. How do I do that?
