With               data = {{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}, {4, 4}, {5, 5}, {6, 6}, {7, 5}, {8,         4}, {10, 3}, {10, 2}, {11, 1}}      and               ListLinePlot[data, Filling -> Axis, GridLines -> Automatic,       Joined -> True, Mesh -> Full, PlotMarkers -> Automatic,       InterpolationOrder -> 2]      we get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Oizjk.jpg) In reality, my datasets oftentimes have missing values. Setting f.e.               data[[3]] = {3, Missing[]}      I obtain with `Off[ListLinePlot::ioproc]` this picture, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LKvjv.jpg) nicely not-showing the missing point. Unfortunately though, the smoothing vanished. Could you propose a general way (plots may vary in size and may have multiple sets) to interpolate over missing values? Thanks **EDIT** Based on the ideas presented here I have written this little function:               Smoother[v_] := If[smooth != 2, v, Select[#, #[[2]] != "na" &] & /@ v]      Turning `Smoother` on or off (via a button) I now get what I hoped for: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YAEHz.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ILTZL.jpg)
