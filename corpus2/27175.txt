What is going on here?               Print[InputField[]]     CellPrint[TextCell["my\"text", "Text", ShowStringCharacters -> True]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CyahW.png) If I insert the above code into a blank notebook and run it, only the second cell seems to appear. If I run the code a 2nd time, both Cells are displayed. How do I correct the code, so the `InputField` will be displayed the 1st time the code is run? I am running Mathematica 8 on Windows 7.
