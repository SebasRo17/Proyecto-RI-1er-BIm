Now I am thinking about architecture of my program. I plan to provide one not only for Desktop usage, but for mobile platforms as well. I want to create a bpl package as separate file. That is I want to have in Windows version next files: program.exe + logic.bpl. It can be usefull because logic.bpl may be often modified, as it is a very important part of my program. Besides other programmers (my friends) will be able to develop their own logic and replace the logic.bpl file to their own. So, there are next questions:   1. Will I have any problems with compiling the program for Android, iOS?    2. How can I build the program with packages for Windows and without packages for mobile platforms with minimal changes in the code?   3. In the case of dll use instead of bpl, are there any advantages/disadvantages for cross platform programming? P.S. English is not my native language, sorry for possible mistakes.
