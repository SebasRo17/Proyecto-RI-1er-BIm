> **Alan Perlis once said: "A language that doesn't affect the way you think > about programming, is not worth knowing".** I am not proud of the fact that I started programming with scripting languages first( _php_ ,then _javascript_ and now learning _python_ ). I dont have any experience in _c,c++,java,.net,c#,objective-c_. Programming is such a vast field,it would take an eternity to get down to all aspect of it. I cant go back in time.But there are lot of people who would benefit from this question. **MyQuestion** :-If anybody had the option of going back in time,Which programming languages chronologically should that programmer shoot for? The obvious answers might be opinion and purpose/requirement based,But keeping in mind the limited time we have,which languages we shouldnt miss out for to get thorough understanding of programming. **Difference in opinion is OK,just looking for the approximate chronology.** Hope I am clear and not misunderstood.
