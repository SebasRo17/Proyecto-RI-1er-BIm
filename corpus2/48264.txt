I'm currently studying atmospheric-gravity waves and their dispersion relations. I want to have look at values of $(x,y)$ that solve the following system : \begin{equation}\label{}(1) \left\\{ \begin{array}{rcr} (x+\frac{1}{2}y^{2})\exp(u^2)-y[u+\exp(u^2)]+u\exp(u^2)& = &0\\\ 2u(x+\frac{1}{2}y^{2})\exp(u^2)-y[1+u\exp(u^2)]+u^2& < &0\\\ \end{array} \right. \end{equation} where $x\in [0,1]$, $y\in[0,1]$ and $u\in[0,1]$. My goal is to plot the region $(x,y)$ where this system has a solution. How can I plot S in the $(x,y)$-plane.? The code for the first funtion :               f1[u_, x_, y_] := ((y^2)/2 + x)*Exp[u^2] - y*(u + Exp[u^2]) + u*Exp[u^2]     f2[u_, x_, y_] := 2*u*((y^2)/2 + x)*Exp[u^2] - y*(1 + u*Exp[u^2]) +  u^2      The problem is how to used : ContourPlot or RegionFunction to construct the surface S.
