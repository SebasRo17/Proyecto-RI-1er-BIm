I'm trying to use some functions from cddlib in _Mathematica_. I downloaded the prebuilt file `cddmathlink2` and `cddmathlink2gmp` from $\quad \quad$http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/download/cdd/cddlibml_binary/ and followed the instructions to install it. But evaluation never stops. I tried some simple prebuilt examples given by _Mathematica_ itself and they worked for me. Any suggestions? P.S. I'm not good at programming. I also tried to build a mathlink program by myself from cddlib, but I failed. So suggestions on the prebuilt files are most welcome.
