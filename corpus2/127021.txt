Training freshers has become my responsibility. I work in a good small company and they want me to train freshers (MCA/BCA students). But I am not an expert in training field. So can anyone please help me in this? Few hints/tips and something that is new/different to train them. What care should be taken while communicating them? How to clear their mind covered with college environment? Please help me.
