I write many a PowerShell script for the organization I currently work for. Most recently I have been co-writing a tool that, in the end, will have a lot of functionality (beyond a single purpose), will be configurable, and will have both a CLI and GUI, all in PowerShell. So when does a script stop being a script and when can you call it an application or a program. Is this just kind of in the eye of the beholder?
