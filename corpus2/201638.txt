I am developing an application and i want to use two words somewhere in my application. First i want to use the word "Safari" in a menu option which labels "Open in Safari"(for a url). The second is the word "Apple" in my Terms pages where i want to use it in the phrase "....as provided by Apple",referring to technologies and API's provided by Apple. Can i use them and if yes with in which conditions?(adding "TM" or "Copyright" signs maybe?). Thanks.
