Not posting a question of my own per se, but I am a ".NET developer". I read the following article about one startup CEO's opinion of hiring .NET experienced developers. He has some comments on the blog but not much of a discussion format as what's possible here. I also know nothing about this man, or am promoting his blog in any way, but the article did throw me off some, and I would like to hear some feedback from developers. Personally, I see his point as it's very easy for some people to create a basic ASP.NET website or some other automated solutions without much knowledge of anything beyond that, and thus would not make them good programmers. But I also think he largely ignores the reality that while many pieces of the framework have been automated and work just fine, you can come up with some very advanced solutions if you really have the know-how and the drive to explore the full capabilities of the framework. Much of their automated tools are "black box", but I've never had a problem where if I needed to get more "low-level" or extend some base class to give me what I really needed in a way that wasn't already available. What's your opinions for or against? CEO Friday: Why we donâ€™t hire .NET programmers
