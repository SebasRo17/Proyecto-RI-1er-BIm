My organization was flat two years ago, and people felt that the general manager had disproportionate almost dictatorial powers. Also the general manager didn't have time to coach employees, so some employees were dysfunctional and nothing was done about them. However on the plus side everyone was involved in the decision making, thus motivation was very high. So what do you think about flat vs hierarchical organizational structures in software development?
