I have defined a function `g` in a **_package_**. It is:                g[x_]:=x/.t->3      Now I work in **_notebook_** with the command:                a=t+1;            g[a]      The result is not `4` but `1+t`. What can I do to get the result of `4`? The package file "pack1.m" is like this:               BeginPackage["pack1`"]          g::usage =""          Begin["`Private`"]             g[x_]:=x/.t->3           End[ ]         EndPackage[ ]      And I use `<<pack1.m` to load it.
