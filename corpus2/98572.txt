I would like to make for example imperative programs as output of Prolog (shaders of graphic card) and also event-driven programs (game logic) ... also I would like to learn how to metaprogram in Prolog in general. I believe there might be some insights or advices how to do it; I don't want to jump into it not prepared and hack until I make working programs. I wonder what is good introduction to metaprogramming in Prolog? Thanks :)
