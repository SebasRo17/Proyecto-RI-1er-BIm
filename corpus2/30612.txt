I am trying to solve the following recurrence relation:               c[1] = 0,          c[2] = a[1]*b[1],          c[n] = a[n]*b[n] + a[n]*c[n-1]+b[n]*c[n-1],          Modulus -> 2, a[n]*a[n]-a[n] = 0, b[n]*b[n]-b[n] = 0      `c[n]` is the recurrence that grows out of control that I am trying to solve/simplify Everything I try in `RSolve` is producing > "For some branches of the general solution, the given boundary conditions > lead to an empty solution" Can anyone help me understand the right way to approach this recurrence problem? Here is what I tried in the worksheet:               RSolve[ {c[1] == 0, c[2] == a[1]*b[1],               c[n] == a[n]*b[n] + a[n]*c[n - 1] + b[n]*c[n - 1]},               c[n], n     ]      > RSolve::bvnul: For some branches of the general solution, the given boundary > conditions lead to an empty solution. >> Now if I try to include the equations specifying that values for a and b must be 0 or 1 (a*a-a==0), I get a different error:               RSolve[ {c[1] == 0, c[2] == a[1]*b[1],              c[n] == a[n]*b[n] + a[n]*c[n - 1] + b[n]*c[n - 1],              a[n]*a[n] - a[n] == 0, b[n]*b[n] - b[n] == 0},              c[n], n     ]      > RSolve::deqx: Supplied equations are not difference equations of the given > functions. Lastly, I have no idea how to specify `Modulus -> 2` or if that matters for the purposes of recurrence relation solving.
