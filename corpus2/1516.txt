A few years ago I considered myself somewhat of a web developer, knowing the basic 3 languages (HTML, CSS, JS) and lots of PHP. Moving on from simple text to actual websites was a pain because of the so called "standards" out there, which at the time were ridiculously complicated for me. It pretty much boiled down to this (minus the IE related stuff): ![Web development in a pie chart](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aVD7a.gif) Standards are there to replace old ways of doing things in a simpler way. However when trying to actually implement some of the stuff (Entirely CSS based layout for example), it took me 10x longer to actually do it then if I did the simpler and still working solution. If it rendered the same, then why should I use the more complicated example that takes 10x longer and breaks once you change browsers? This sparked many long religious debates in ##php, ##css, and ##js in Freenode IRC and actually got me banned from ##css because I messed with their little world over there. My question: Should I follow every single standard and coding conventions even if they take me 10x longer but get me the same result as the simple one? * * * For the poll tag, those of you who have websites of any size (huge or small), do **you** follow all the standards?
