I would like to use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl``^` to enter a superscript. I have tried to type this two different ways, and each time i have gotten an undesirable result. According to the file `KeyEventTranslations.tr`, the binding is correct:               Item[KeyEvent["^", Modifiers -> {Control}], "Superscript"]      I am running Mathematica 8 on Windows Vista, and I currently have two keymaps installed--The standard QWERTY and a Progammer Dvorak--using Windows IME. My first attempt to type it is in standard QWERTY, I type the key sequence `Shift``Ctrl``6`. This sequence results in a dialog box as if I had entered the menu command `File -> Revert...`. On my Programmer Dvorak, I type the key sequence `Shift``Ctrl``]`. This sequence results in the dialog box as if I had entered the menu command `Edit -> Preferences...`. In both cases, the key sequences that I am referring to are the physical keys that I press, not the character produced, because in both cases, I type a '^' character. I am very confused, because neither of these dialog boxes seem to have an keyboard shortcuts assigned, so I do not understand why I am reaching them. I have also looked in `MenuSetup.tr`, but I did not see anything noteworthy. What is happening, and is there a way to correct this behavior?
