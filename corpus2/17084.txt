I would like to apply a matrix plot to the surface of a 3D cylinder. The matrix plot is the output from a custom cellular-automata, and it would be nice to see the lefthand side of the plot connected to the righthand side. ### Edit This is the solution I ended up using:               mrt =       ArrayPlot[CellularAutomaton[30, RandomInteger[{0, 1}, 100], 30],         Frame -> False,         ImagePadding -> 0,         PlotRangePadding -> 0];     ParametricPlot3D[{Sin[t]/2Pi, Cos[t]/2Pi,u},{t,0,2Pi},{u,0,2},       Boxed -> False,       Axes -> False,       PerformanceGoal -> "Quality",       ImageSize -> {300, 300},       Lighting -> "Neutral",       PlotStyle -> Texture[mrt],       Mesh -> None,       ViewPoint -> {0, 3, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IKy4B.png)
