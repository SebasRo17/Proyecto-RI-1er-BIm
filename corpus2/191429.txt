I have to read and write binary "chunks" of approximately 1Mb each. The data can come in the form of a stream or a in-memory `byte[]`. Normally I would use a `Struct` with a fixed layout, but there are a few properties of this binary data that are making this harder:   1. Byte 4 describes the "version" of the chunk   2. Byte 5 starts either as variable array of sub-chunks or as a human readable blob   3. Each sub-chunk has a version, and has a variable array of data within it.   4. The endian-ness of the data is inconsistent How should I structure a program that needs to handle binary data thats in this format?
