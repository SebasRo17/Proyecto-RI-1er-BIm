I'm trying to find (a)which countries have dependencies (b)and a list of countries that consider themselves dependencies (c)and a list of countries that don't consider themselves dependencies. * * * Okay, so to find the countries that have dependencies (part a) I input                CountryData["Countries", "Dependencies"]      But that output gives me {} throughout the list with the names of 10 or so countries, which I'm not sure are correct. * * * For part b, of finding the countries that consider themselves dependencies, I have:                Flatten[Map[CountyData[#,"Dependencies"]&]]      for this part I'm not sure what else I am missing. * * * I got stuck at part b, so I think this part is similar to part c.
