I have an upcoming technical interview with a former employer that will focus on PL/I, DB2, and ISPF. The job will be with systems that I architected and wrote myself 20 years ago. The few years of professional programming that I did since then was all assembly language. The problem is that I haven't programmed professionally in 15 years, and the personal programming that I've done since then has been in other "modern" languages. My question is whether there are new features in PL/I and DB2 that I should be aware of. (When browsing through the latest "Principles of Operation" I saw machine instructions to support C style strings that weren't there in ancient times - cool.)
