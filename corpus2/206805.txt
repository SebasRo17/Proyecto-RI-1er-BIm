I was going through the `PhonGap Documentation` about how to package your `HTML/JS/CSS` to a platform specific `"native app"`. They have maintained separate documentations for the separate `Cordova` versions which seems fine. I essentially understand most of the things there. But the confusion I have is the disparity or the loss of information in the documentation from the older ones to the newer ones. For an instance, if you take a look at this documentation for the version `2.1.0` about setting up the android project and scroll a bit down, they have mentioned such things:   * In the root directory of your project, create two new directories:       * /libs     * assets/www   * Copy cordova-2.0.0.js from your Cordova download earlier to assets/www   * Copy cordova-2.0.0.jar from your Cordova download earlier to /libs   * Copy xml folder from your Cordova download earlier to /res ....   * Change the class's extend from Activity to DroidGap   * Replace the setContentView() line with super.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/www/index.html"); ... and so on which clearly mentions the steps to follow while migrating or creating an app for a specific platform. But upwards from the `version 2.1.0`, these information are missing. Like in the newer documentations, all they have is just the `regular android setup stuffs and android hello world` which we can obviously find on the official android documentation. I tried searching the whole documentation for that version and I could not find any information regarding the steps I mentioned above in the older documentation. Otherwise how are the readers supposed to know those steps? Am I missing something here or have they provided?
