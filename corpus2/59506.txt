I have a number of functions that depend on a variable `x`. I am using a second, integer variable to index these functions, i.e. something like               f[x_, 1] = a     f[x_, 2] = b x + c      When taking derivatives of these functions with `D`, it works the way I intend, i.e.               D[f[x, 1], x]     D[f[x, 2], x]      returns `0` respectively `b`. Now, however, I have a set of differential equations involving derivatives of these functions. These are expressed by _Mathematica_ as               Derivative[1, 0][f][x, 1]     Derivative[1, 0][f][x, 2]      which remains unevaluated. Is there any way to have `Derivative` ignore the second variable? More specifically, I would like to have a way of doing something along the lines of               Derivative[1][g][x]      and then replacing `g` by `f[x, 1]`. I guess I could just assign specific names to each of the functions `f[x, k]`, but in the end I want to sum them all up               Sum[f[x, k],{k, 1, n}]      for which it would be convienient to have some index variable rather than writing out the sum over different functions. Maybe I am approaching the whole idea of indexing functions in the wrong way?
