When I was reading a book for SCJP, I came across the following paragraph. > A LinkedList is ordered by index position, like ArrayList, except that the > elements are doubly-linked to one another. This linkage gives you new > methods (beyond what you get from the List interface) for adding and > removing from the beginning or end, which makes it an easy choice for > implementing a stack or queue. Keep in mind that a LinkedList may iterate > more slowly than an ArrayList, but it's a good choice when you need fast > insertion and deletion.. What makes a LinkedList to iterate more slowly than an ArrayList ?
