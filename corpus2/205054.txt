This is how I roll with git:   1. I clone/fork something locally   2. I create a new branch `devel`. This is supposed to be a quickfix branch. It is also supposed to be parent to all branches.   3. I create a topic branch (say make a new theme `lex`) I actually create a few more child-topic-branches (say `lex.th2`) to test/see different things. But so now, I have to quickfix (in `devel`) a core functionality (say re- correct database credentials in `wp-config`).   I then have to switch to `lex` and `merge devel`. And then to `lex.th2` and `merge lex`. (So that changes from `devel` could goto `lex` and to `lex.th2`) Doing all this severely messes up my history-graphs ![C:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Git\\bin\\wish.exe](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Hy0H.png) I'll admit that the "official" workflow was too much for me and I just took the parts that I liked from it... probably badly. So any suggestions how to make it "tidy" while still not complicating or deviating too much?
