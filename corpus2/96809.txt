> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Would you see any use of a Trilean (True, False, ??) Well first and foremost, I'm not a programmer, I am a civil engineer that does some programming and quite enjoy it. Second and Second most, I'd like to claim rights to this amazing invention and call it TROLLEAN or DASSOUKIEAN. Joking aside, on numerous times I run into variables that can only hold three values (let's cal them True, False, and Other. For example, take a traffic intersection. It could be signalized, unsignalized, or non-controlled (aka no stop signs and no traffic lights). it would be dnice to define `TROLLEAN traffic_light = Other` Other in this case represents non-controlled intersections. Instead I find myself writing a code sequence to define that.
