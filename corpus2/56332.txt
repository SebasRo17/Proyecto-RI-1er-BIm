I'm trying to program a FFT using a recursive function in _Mathematica_ , though my program is not getting me anywhere at the moment. Could you say what's wrong with it and what I can do to make it work? My program is the following: (We assume that a is a list of size $2^s$ for some integer $s$)                FFT[a_] :=            (n := Length[a];       If[n == 1, Return[a],       f := Exp[2 I Pi/n];       o := 1;       b := Drop[a, {1, Length[a], 2}];       c := Drop[a, {2, Length[a], 2}];       d := FFT[b];       e := FFT[c];       For[k = 0, k < n/2, k++,       y[k] := d[[{k}]] + o e[[{k}]];       y[k + n/2] := d[[{k}]] - o e[[{k}]];       o = o f]       Return[Table[y[i], {i, 1, n}]]])
