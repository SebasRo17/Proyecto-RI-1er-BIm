I put up a webpage advertising a particular birthday party. A simple html page served by apache2 on ubuntu server 12.04. I have a link on the page to a cgi script-Python-that asks the requester to submit text values that will be formatted and relayed in an email to the bithrday boy. What's a simple way to authenticate that a human being is filling out the form, so that I can avoid having the birthday boy receiving spam. Using standard CGI because I do not expect an overload of concurrent requests. I am aware of things like reCaptcha, but am looking for canonical strategies for quick and dirty authentication. Not being paid for this and the site will be up for but 9 days, so I don't want to put time into a solution more robust that what I actually need. Would asking a human answerable question suffice? If so could I get a away with a dropdown box of selectable answers. I want quick and dirty, but I also don't want to wind up with boat loads of spam because I underestimated the intelligence of spam bots.
