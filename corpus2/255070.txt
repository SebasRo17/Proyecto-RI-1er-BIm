Background   * My team uses scrum   * I have currently no task assigned   * There are no more pending task in the backlog   * Today is Labor Day for my client. Not having many things to do today I wanted to start refactoring some code I keep on seeing in the project I am working on, but currently I am not assigned to any sprint task to do any large scale refactoring. Is it OK in **Scrum** if I start randomly refactoring code that I have and have not written that always bother me but don't have time other days to fix it because of other days assignments? What about other days that I have spare time between sprints. I actually do and believe in continuous refactoring. I always do it on the pieces of code that I am working when assigned a story but what about some other code I see that is not currently related to what I am working on at that moment?
