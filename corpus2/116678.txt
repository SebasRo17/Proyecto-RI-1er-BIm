I have been browsing some OpenJDK code recently and have found some **intriguing** pieces of code there that has to do with **bit-wise operations**. I even asked a question about it on StackOverflow. Another example that illustrates the point:                1141       public static int bitCount(int i) {      1142           // HD, Figure 5-2      1143           i = i - ((i >>> 1) & 0x55555555);      1144           i = (i & 0x33333333) + ((i >>> 2) & 0x33333333);      1145           i = (i + (i >>> 4)) & 0x0f0f0f0f;      1146           i = i + (i >>> 8);      1147           i = i + (i >>> 16);      1148           return i & 0x3f;      1149       }      This code can be found in the Integer class. **I cannot help but feel stupid when I look at this.** Did I miss a class or two in college or is this not something I am supposed to just _get_? I can do simple bit-wise operations (like ANDing, ORing, XORing, shifting), but come on, how does someone come up with a code like that above? **How good does a well-rounded programmer need to be with bit-wise operations?** **On a side note...** _What worries me is that the person who answered my question on StackOverflow answered it in a matter of minutes. If he could do that, why did I just stare like deer in the headlights?_
