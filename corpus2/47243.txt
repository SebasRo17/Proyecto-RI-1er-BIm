I am solving two simple differential equation using `NDsolve`.               solution = NDSolve[{X'[t] == μ*S[t]*X[t]/(k + S[t]),                          S'[t] == -μ*S[t]*X[t]/(0.664252*(k + S[t])),                         X[0] == 10,S[0] == 300}, {X, S}, {t, 0, 40.7}]      bacteria[t_] = X[t] /. solution;      food[t_] = S[t] /. solution;      qq = Table[310 - bacteria[t] - food[t], {t, time}];      error = MapThread[Plus,Abs[(exp[[All, 1]] - qq)/exp[[All, 1]]*100/298]]      I need to evaluate `error` for different values of `k` and μ in order to check the values of k and μ for which error is less than 5%. `exp` and `time` are results which I have. When I try to put my code in a For-loop, it fails.               For[μ = 0.1, μ <= 1, μ = μ + 0.1,       k = 100       solution = NDSolve[{X'[t] == μ*S[t]*X[t]/(k + S[t]),                            S'[t] == -μ*S[t]*X[t]/(0.664252*(k + S[t])),                            X[0] == 10, S[0] == 300}, {X, S}, {t, 0, 40.7}]       bacteria[t_] = X[t] /. solution;       food[t_] = S[t] /. solution;       qq = Table[310 - bacteria[t] - food[t], {t, time}];       error = MapThread[Plus,Abs[(exp[[All, 1]] - qq)/exp[[All, 1]]*100/298]]       Print[error]]      The above is giving me errors and I do not get any results. My plan is to use this For-loop to vary μ and then use a nested loop for varying k. Any comments?
