Suppose you want to develop an application, in midst of development you find out that one similar application already exists, highly recognized and used. It's a cross platform application but it's unknown whether this application is open source or not. However you decide to reverse engineer it without taking care of its license and eventually you succeed in it. And now you are using some portion of it for your application, which in some manner improvement of the application and -being based on same idea and targeting some platforms that the original application also covers- comes into straight competition of it. Can original developer detect that you plagiarized the original code? If yes how?
