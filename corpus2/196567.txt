I'm implementing a Windows 8 app using C#, part of it is One Way Chat. It will be for multiple users such as teacher and student. We want to use a chat room for every course. Teachers teach different courses that include many students and students study different courses, so when the teacher and student open the course page, they will find a chat page specific for this course. How can I build such a thing?
