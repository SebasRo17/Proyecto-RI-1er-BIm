I'm working on a .NET application and I'm wondering if I should use separate methods to handle the click events of two different buttons. They essentially do the same thing, just on different objects on the form, in this case two separate maps. Same method:               Private Sub SingleButtonHandler(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnToggleSatNew.Click, btnToggleSatOld.Click         If sender Is btnToggleSatNew Then             Me.NewMap.ToggleSateliteView()         Else             Me.OldMap.ToggleSateliteView()         End If     End Sub      Separate Methods:               Private Sub btnToggleSatOld_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnToggleSatOld.Click         Me.OldMap.ToggleSateliteView()     End Sub          Private Sub btnToggleSatNew_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnToggleSatNew.Click         Me.NewMap.ToggleSateliteView()     End Sub      What's the overhead of checking if the two objects are the same? Is one version easier to read than the other? Or should I be doing something completely different?
