From times to times, I need to solve a problem and I find it faster for me to create an application for the specific problem instead of searching all over the Internet for it. Most of the times it is an application created in .NET framework but there are also times that I create apps for linux. My question is: Is there a website where I can upload my free apps? I know that I can obviously upload everything to my personal website, but since I'm not very popular I'm afraid that most users that need my apps will not be able to find them if they are in my website. Keep in mind that I'm not talking about releasing my source code (just the binaries and the documentation) and I'm not talking about huge applications. To give you a better idea, in most cases the applications that I'm talking about will not even have an installation procedure: just a couple of executables and a config/data file. Thanks in advance.
