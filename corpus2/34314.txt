I'd like to ask how I might go about solving this equation: # $\frac{\partial Ci}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial (r^2 Ci)}{\partial r} = D\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}(r^2\frac{\partial Ci}{\partial r})$ as suggested a simplification # $\frac{\partial Ci}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{r}2Ci +\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial Ci}{\partial r} = D(\frac{2}{r}\frac{\partial Ci}{\partial r} +\frac{\partial^2 Ci}{\partial r^2})$ $r = 0, t = 0 \rightarrow Ci = 0$   $r = 1, t = 0 \rightarrow Ci = 0$ I am fairly new to Mathematica and I don't really know how to go about this; I've also tried the steps outlined in this post here but while I understood what to do I get recursion limit reached errors (using the code provided). Could you please help me out on how to solve this equation? a partial and first attempt on solving this taking in account the notes of the posted link is the following:               Clear[y];     f1[r_ /; r > 0] := 1;     f1[r_ /; r == 0] := 2;     f2[r_ /; r > 0] := 1/r^2;     f2[r_ /; r == 0] := 0;     f3[r_ /; r > 0] := 1/r;     f3[r_ /; r == 0] := 0;          eqns = {         Derivative[0, 0, 1][y][t, r, z] +         f3[r]*2*y[t, r, z] +       f2*Derivative[0, 1, 0][y][t, r, z] -       2*f3[r]*Derivative[0, 1, 0][y][t, r, z] -       Derivative[0, 2, 0][y][t, r, z] == Derivative[1, 0, 0][y][t, r, z],       y[t, 0, z] == 0,       y[t, r, 0] == 0,       Derivative[0, 1, 0][y][t, 0, z] == 0,       Derivative[0, 0, 1][y][t, r, 0] == 0,       y[0, r, z] == (1 - r^2)*(1 - z^2)}           $RecursionLimit = 1536           y[t_, r_, z_] =           y[t, r, z] /.                First[NDSolve[eqns, y[t, r, z], {t, 0, 1}, {r, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1},                Method -> {"MethodOfLines", Method -> "StiffnessSwitching",                "DifferentiateBoundaryConditions" -> {True,                "ScaleFactor" -> 1}}]];      This gives me a lot of errors but the first one is the following: ![partial error output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xZT5s.png)
