In Python and JavaScript, semi-colons are optional. In PHP, quotes around array-keys are optional (`$_GET[key]` vs `$_GET['key']`), although if you omit them it will first look for a constant by that name. It also allows 2 different styles for blocks (colon, or brace delimited). I'm creating a programming language now, and I'm trying to decide how strict I should make it. There are a lot of cases where extra characters aren't really necessary and can be unambiguously interpreted due to priorities, but I'm wondering if I should still enforce them or not to encourage consistency. What do you think? * * * Okay, my language isn't so much a programming language as a fancy templating language. Kind of a cross between Haml and Django templates. Meant to be used with my C# web framework, and supposed to be very extensible.
