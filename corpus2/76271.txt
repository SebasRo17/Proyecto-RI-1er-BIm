As a senior member of a software team that, unfortunately, has little documentation for legacy reasons, what are the things that one could do to make a new hire comfortable? I have been planning debug sessions with the person on specific defects/feature requests to get him/her acquainted with the code base. However the code base is real large, and its only a fixed amount of code I can expose the person to in this manner. I am looking for suggestions in either cases when the new hire is a recent graduate or an experienced professional.
