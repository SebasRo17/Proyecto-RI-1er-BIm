I defined a security boundary for a random walk:               p = 5000;(*steps*)     tc = 15;(*cube edge length*)     tp = 0.2;          random = Accumulate[     Join[{RandomReal[{-tc, tc}/2, 3]},      RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, tp], {p, 3}]]];          periodizedWalk = Mod[random, tc, -tc/2];     splitPeriodizedWalk =      Split[periodizedWalk, EuclideanDistance[#1, #2] < tc/2 &];          With[{cube = First[PolyhedronData["Cube"]]},      Graphics3D[{{Opacity[0.1], Scale[cube, tc]}, Line[random]},      Boxed -> False]]      and now i want to obtain a sample of the random times at which the random walk crosses the boundary for the first time. Something like this:               W = {}; For[i = 1, i <= 5000, i++,     PosFinal = {0, 0}; EME = 1;     While[True,     PosFinal = PosFinal + step[Random[]];     If[Norm[PosFinal] > 15, Break[]];          EME = EME + 1;     ];     W = Append[W, EME];     ]      but i want these two codes to be related. Would like some help please :)
