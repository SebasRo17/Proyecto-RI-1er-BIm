For one of the projects at uni we were given the task to create a custom, niche search engine. My colleges and I split the tasks amongst each other so that we can tackle the overall project more easily. My part is to create the indexer. I already read the wikipedia page on search engine indexers and some other related articles but I'm still struggling to understand exactly how it works and how it looks. To me it is obvious that it is not just a regular table with an index and a descrption column. So my question would be, what is a search engine indexer comprised of, how does it architecture look, and where to start from in building one?
