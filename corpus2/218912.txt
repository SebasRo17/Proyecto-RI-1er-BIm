I see many job adds which require at least x years experience. The question is how do you know when a candidate has the required years of experience? What do you expect from a person with x years experience (edit: effectively how do you check if the CV isn't lying without relying to skill checking)? What can a person with x years experience can do that one with y years (with y < x) cannot do (edit: assuming they have similar skills)? There can be cases with some passionate programmer with y years experience that has vast knowledge and worked on multiple projects and other programmer with x years experience (x > y) that has worked on few projects and doesn't have that much experience. Why can not it be reduced to something like this "if you know this technology and you know how to do that stuff (be it design, communication, estimates etc.) then you are suitable for our job"? I know you cannot hire a fresh graduate with 1 year experience for the post of an enterprise architect but I also see a problem with the facts that almost all ads ask experience. IMHO firstly passion should be taken into account. Firstly I did not know if the question is suitable for this site but since there is a tag for recruiting and experience I believe it has a place here.
