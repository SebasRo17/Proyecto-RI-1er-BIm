I would like to display an electromagnetic (EM) wave. I have written code that works, but it does not "shade" the area between the graph and the axes. Both the `Filling` and `EdgeForm` commands are ignored.               strength = 2; frequency = 3;          wave1 = ParametricPlot3D[{t (x/6.28), -strength Sin[frequency t (x/6.28)], 0},        {t, 0, 2 Pi},        PlotStyle->Directive[Thickness[.007], Lighter[Red, .5], Filling -> Axis]];     wave2 = ParametricPlot3D[{t (x/6.28), 0, strength Sin[frequency t(x/6.28)]},        {t, 0, 2 Pi},        PlotStyle -> Directive[Thickness[.007], Lighter[Blue, .5], Filling -> Axis]];          Show[wave1, wave2, Graphics3D[EdgeForm[Pink], wave1],       Graphics3D[EdgeForm[LightBlue], wave2],        Axes->False, Boxed->False, PlotRange->All, ImageSize->{500, 400}]      I would like to accomplish filling the portion between the two sinusoidal waves and the direction of propagation of the wave with color.
