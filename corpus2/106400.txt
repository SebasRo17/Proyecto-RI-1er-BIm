I'm currently evaluating which license to use for my next OS project, and things are getting more and more interesting after I decided that I really want to _understand_ what the licenses mean. Up until now, I just licensed everything under MIT because I like the MIT and their license is nice and short. And probably because it didn't really matter as only a hand full of people actually used my products. But now, I'm at the brink of releasing something that will surely be used by many people and also be subject to major modifications, so I want to choose the right license to go with. From what I understand, there are two groups of licenses; Copyright and Copyleft. Now, I read (and think to understand) MIT and BSD-2/3-Clause, but I'm really having trouble to get the gist of (L)GPL and alike. My main problem is; I want to always be named in derivative works of my project. I don't really care if it's used proprietary or free, I just want to make sure that anyone who reads the code sees "ah, that's the original author" (referring to me). Is there a clause in the copyleft licenses that assures this attribution? Or can this only be done using permissive copyright ones?
