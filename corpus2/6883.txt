This is related to my earlier question, but is specific to an issue I have encountered with the use of the `HoldFirst` First, let's create some fake data for testing purposes.               dateARList =        With[{ar = FoldList[0.9 #1 + #2 &, 0.,            RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 100]]},        Transpose[{ Table[DatePlus[{2000, 1, 1}, {n, "Month"}], {n, 0, 100}], ar}] ];      Now define two functions. First, the general one that doesn't assume the size of the matrix in the first argument.               Clear[testHolder, testHolder2]          Attributes[testHolder] = {HoldFirst}          testHolder[m_?MatrixQ, rest : OptionsPattern[{Graphics, Grid}]] :=           Module[{nc, nr, subrules, subargs},       {nr, nc} = Dimensions[m];       subrules = Table[Cases[HoldForm[m[[i, j]]], _Rule], {i, nr}, {j, nc}];       subargs  = Table[Cases[HoldForm[m[[i, j]]], Except[_Rule]], {i, nr}, {j, nc}];       Grid[Table[         Head[m[[i, j]]] @@ Join[subargs[[i, j]], subrules[[i, j]],           {PlotLabel -> {i, j}, Joined -> True} ], {i, nr}, {j, nc}],        FilterRules[{rest}, Grid]]       ]          testHolder[{{DateListPlot[dateARList, PlotStyle -> Red],         DateListPlot[dateARList, PlotStyle -> Blue]}},       Background -> Yellow, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gd97p.png) As you can see, the options I tried to insert into the sub-plots (`Joined` and `PlotLabel`) do not get passed to them, nor do the options for the overall `Grid` (`Frame` and `Background`). Now, let's try a more specific case where the dimensions of the matrix in the first argument are known.               Attributes[testHolder2] = {HoldFirst}          testHolder2[{{l_[largs__, lopts___Rule], r_[rargs__, ropts___Rule]}},        rest : OptionsPattern[{Graphics, Grid}]] :=      Grid[{{l @@ Join[{largs}, {lopts}, {PlotLabel -> "Left", Joined -> True}],              r @@ Join[{rargs}, {ropts}, {PlotLabel -> "Right", Joined -> True}]}},        FilterRules[{rest}, Grid] ]      Now we have a better outcome - the options for the specific plots are passed to them, but the options for the `Grid` aren't used.               testHolder2[{{DateListPlot[dateARList, PlotStyle -> Red],         DateListPlot[dateARList, PlotStyle -> Blue]}},       Background -> Yellow, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/93m9n.png) I'm probably missing something, but I don't know what it is. Is `HoldFirst` the right way to ensure that additional options can be inserted into a function before it is evaluated? If not, what do I need to do to the evaluation sequence to get the desired result? Can I get the general (`testHolder`) case to work, or do I have to set things up with explicit pattern matches for the heads and arguments of the elements in the matrix, as in `testHolder2`?
