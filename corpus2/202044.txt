**1.** According to Fowler's definition this pattern is implemented by having all classes in a layer inherit from a superclass. But after some googling it appears all of the following are considered as implementations of a _Layer Supertype_ pattern: a - all classes in a layer inheriting from the same superclass   b - having only some ( thus not all ) of classes in a layer inheriting from a superclass   c - layer having superclasses **S1** and **S2** , where classes **A** and **B** inherit from **S1** , while **C** inherits from **S2** So which of above are considered as implementations of a _Layer Supertype_? **2.** If a,b and c are all considered implementations of a _Layer SuperType_ , then I fail to see how this pattern is any different from a regular _class inheritance_. In other words, couldn't we then claim we're using _Layer Supertype_ any time some class inherits from another class? thanks
