I am trying to solve a differential equation numerically. So I have               zSolutionRule = NDSolve[        {         z''[x]*z[x] - z'[x]^2 - z[x]^2 - p0[x]*z[x]^3 == 0,         p0'[x] == 0,         z'[0]*E == z'[1],         z[0] == 1,         z[1] == E        },        {z, p0}, {x, 0, 1}       ];      When I run this, though, I get an "infinite expression $\frac{1}{0}$ encountered" error, but I want to get the solution to the differential equation. How do I get NDSolve to give me the solution like it does with other differential equations? (I am using Mathematica 9.0.0.0.) ## Background At first I solved a related differential equation               ySolutionRule = NDSolve[        {y''[x] - 1 - p0[x]*Exp[y[x]] == 0,         p0'[x] == 0,         y'[0] == y'[1],         y[0] == 0,         y[1] == 1         },        {y, p0}, {x, 0, 1}        ];     ySolution = y /. ySolutionRule[[1, 1]];     chargeNormalization = (p0 /. ySolutionRule[[1, 2]])[.5];      and this worked just fine, but I figured I could try to change variables to see if eliminating the exponential would change how good the solution is if I change boundary conditions when y[1] is big. So I rewrote the equation in terms of $z=e^y$. I can check that the exponential of ySolution satisfies the transformed differential equation and boundary conditions:               zSol[x_] := Exp[ySolution[x]];     zSol[1]/zSol[0] - E     zSol[0] - 1     zSol[1] - E      and               Plot[zSol''[x]*zSol[x] - zSol'[x]^2 - zSol[x]^2 -chargeNormalization*zSol[x]^3, {x, 0, 1}]      It does, up to some accuracy. So then I tell it to find my solution but instead, it gives me an infinite expression error.
