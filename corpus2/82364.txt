It is one thing to log something that happened in code, a process, or procedure. It is another thing to log something that didn't happen. For example, if your ETL system is supposed to receive a file every hour for import, and a file did not arrive at the usual appointed time, then it would be good to log "what didn't happen." I've called this negative logging, but I'm curious if there is an industry common term for this - a term which means "log both what happened **and what didn't happen**." Any idea?
