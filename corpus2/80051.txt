I am a recent graduate so I understand a lot of the theory, object-oriented languages, and various data structures. I am competent in languages such as C++, Java, PHP, just to name the ones I'm strong at. Since graduation I bite the bullet and accepted a job outside of my field for now. So obviously I don't want to lose my edge and want to stay current. Most of my programming has been for academic reasons and a 3-month web programming (back-end) internship. I really want to program something to use my skills I've learned. I always hear program a game is great practice. However one problem with the Internet is it's robust volume of information and find myself reading one site then jumping to another & on & on. Where would you suggest is a good foothold to begin? It's always harder to start from scratch and that is where I am. I figure start with some 2D game and go from there, but then comes the question of which SDK to use, if any. I'm currently using Linux but I wouldn't mind developing in Windows either. I'm always thinking maybe I should try to develop a simple app for an Android phone as well. As you can tell I'm all over and just need a little direction. Any advice/website is greatly appreciated!
