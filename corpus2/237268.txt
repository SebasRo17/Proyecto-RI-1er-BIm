Following Martin Fowler's explanation on event sourcing, I have a message class that looks something like this:               ShippingEvent     {         Process(Ship ship) {}     }      However, in my case, I need to talk to another component in the `Process` method. More specific, I need to access a repository to get some basic data. Is it ok to add this repository to the method, i.e.:               ShippingEvent     {         Process(Ship ship, IBasicDataRepository repo) {}     }      I could put it in the constructor of my message too, of course. However, I can't pass in the basic data, because the repo will be called multiple times with different parameters, depending on what's in the ´ship´ object. So is it ok to introduce external dependencies in the event/message class or is there a better way?
