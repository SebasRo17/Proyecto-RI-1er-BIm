Background: I have several `PopupView`s of which the loadtime adds to the startup time of a program. To improve the perceived performance I want to defer the loading of the `PopupView` to the moment that they are actually used. I thought about this:                 Clear[filelist];       Clear[obj];       filelist = {};       Dynamic@PopupView[filelist, Dynamic[obj, (obj = #;) &],          Button["Edit", filelist = {1, 2, 3}, ImageSize -> 80]]      The idea works but not as expected, the popupview is not displayed correctly until filelist is loaded. I want to correct this or find an alternative way to set this up. **Question: How can I defer the loading of a`PopupView` control until it is used ?**
