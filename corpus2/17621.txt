This is a system of equations of the Vietnamese Mathematical Olympiad 2013, the first day. Solve the system of equations $$\begin{cases} \sqrt{\sin^2 x + \dfrac{1}{\sin^2 x}} + \sqrt{\cos^2 y + \dfrac{1}{\cos^2 y}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{20y}{x+y}},\\\ \sqrt{\sin^2 y + \dfrac{1}{\sin^2 y}} + \sqrt{\cos^2 x + \dfrac{1}{\cos^2 x}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{20x}{x+y}}. \end{cases}$$ I tried               Reduce[{Sqrt[ Sin[x]^2 + 1/Sin[x]^2] + Sqrt[ Cos[y]^2 + 1/Cos[y]^2] ==         Sqrt[ 20 y/(x + y)],        Sqrt[ Sin[y]^2 + 1/Sin[y]^2] + Sqrt[ Cos[x]^2 + 1/Cos[x]^2] ==         Sqrt[ 20 x/(x + y)]}, {x, y}, Reals]      My computer runs more than ten minutes, but I have not received results.
