I'm about to start the process of migrating a program from one component to another. Most of the core functionality will be the same but I'll need to change database calls, etc. I'm sure there will be a few quirks somewhere. Naturally, there will be many errrrrrors, some of which Ill miss completely. Would it be better to completely scrutinize the code, checking for errors line by line, or to just write the code and see what errors occur?
