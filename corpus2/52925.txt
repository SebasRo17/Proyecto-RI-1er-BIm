I am wondering: how feasible it would be to start developing a social networking website entirely based on silverlight; This has been fairly discussed over the years in favor of HTML. Has something changed with silverlight improvements over the years? What about:               * Performance       -- active users       -- technology used, MVVM + MEF (possibility of lags, server memory overflow...)     * Security       --- WCF Ria Services & EF      What are your thoughts on this subject?
