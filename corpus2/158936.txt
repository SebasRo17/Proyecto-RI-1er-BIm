> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Resources for improving your comprehension of recursion? I am a programmer with 2 years experience, and sometimes think I could solve a specific problem with recursion, but in most cases I fail miserably. I am asking your advice about resources for learning, refreshing and deepening one's knowledge about recursion, preferably:   * helping to identify when you could use recursion.   * practical examples (applied to contemporary programming languages).   * a reference handbook.   * source code.
