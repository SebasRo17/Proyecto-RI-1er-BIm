I cannot believe what just happened. I'm an expensive full stack developer, although I have focussed on WPF and Silverlight lately. Much of the time, I write Controls, ViewModels, Repositories and a bunch of asynch code. This contract I'm working today is a shambles. The code is a mess. Everything is tightly-coupled, no MVVM, and a bunch of stuff ripped from CodeProject. I taught a junior guy how work the Parts and States model, build Controls and VMs and be a great UI dev. He tells my boss that he's formalising some new feature into a control and my boss says "We're not in the business of building controls." While their sole product is a WPF client, he could not be more wrong. He just wants crap smashed out my juniors in a hurry. What would you do in this situation? How would you explain it on your CV/resum√©?
