I follow a very raw approach while updating my website on server. The approach I follow doesn't seem right, so I am interested in knowing a recommended way of updating a **LIVE** project, be it on shared host or dedicated server. Right now, for any changes in View, I simply upload and overwrite the view files on server. Similarly for any code changes, I upload and overwrite the .dll and .pdb files. Currently my website doesn't have any traffic so there has been no issue so far. But, Is this a recommended approach for a website with good amount of traffic. And if not, then how should one approach updation on the server.
