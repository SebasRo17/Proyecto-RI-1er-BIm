I was reading _Code Complete_ and in the chapter on layout and style, he was predicting that code editors would use some sort of rich text formatting. That means, instead of code looking like this               Procedure ResolveCollisions     { Performs a posteriori collision resolution through spatial partitioning algoritm }     (       CurrentMap : SpriteContext,       PotentialColliders: SpriteList     )     var Collider  : Sprite,          Collidee  : Sprite,          Collision : SpriteCollision     begin       DoStuff();     end.      it could look something like this: # Procedure `ResolveCollisions` _Performs a posteriori collision resolution through spatial partitioning algorithm_ **Parameters**   * `CurrentMap : SpriteContext`   * `PotentialColliders : SpriteList` **Local Variables**   * `Collider : Sprite`   * `Collidee : Sprite`   * `Collision : SpriteCollision`                   DoStuff();      * * * I've seen syntax coloring and highlighting and even parentheses coloring, but nothing that looked like this in actual code. I was wondering if this sort of thing actually ever existed, or perhaps if it was decided that it didn't have enough benefit or that it was an entirely bad idea. Have any of you seen richly-formatted code like this before, or know if the idea was ever considered and eventually rejected?
