Let's say I have a `DatePicker` control and I allow my US clients to type something like `"1/1"` in it and hit tab go to next control. So I will parse that date for them as "01/01/2014" and some more similar patterns. But they are all US-based so they are               "MM/dd/yyyy"      Now my question is about other formats? What If I want to support a country format that is like `"yyyy/mm/dd"` . How do those countries interpret such patterns?
