While reading the Manipulate reference I've noticed this line: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Gyqw.jpg) What are the available external devices for that? Some months ago I was thinking on what would be needed to use a MIDI Controller such as The BitStream 3X above Into Mathematica. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/08Y83.jpg) With my limited knowledge, I thought I could make Max/MSP receive the midi messages and write them down on a txt file, and then Mathematica would read it and use it for controlling something useful, I've asked to a friend - who have a degree on C.S. - how this could be accomplished, he said me I would need to use the system DLL's for that. The questions are:   * What are these controllers?    * How would it be possible to transform the MIDI signals into Mathematica? **Bonus?** : I also have a KORG Kontrol 49 in my table. It's a MIDI controller - does not produce sound, only MIDI signals. - It's possible to translate some MIDI messages (such as button presses) into keystroke emulation through Bome's MIDI Translator. This is by no means contradictory, translating keyboard keys into keystroke emulation is easy, the only thing I kinda have no clue on how I could do it is how to make a MIDI hardware slider control a Mathematica Slider. I've posted this last section because it could be useful for someone.
