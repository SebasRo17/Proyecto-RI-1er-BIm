Is there a quick method to transpose uneven lists without conditionals? With:               Drop[Table[q, {10}], #] & /@ Range[10]      Thus the first list would have the first element of all the lists, the 2nd list would have all the 2nd elements of all the lists, etc. If there are no elements, skips. I have a feeling that this should incorporate Mathematica's Reap / Sow function, but unfamiliar.
