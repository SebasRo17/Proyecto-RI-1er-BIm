Say I have a class ImportantInfo with a public writable property Data. Many classes will read this property but only a few will ever set it. Basically, if you want to update Data you should really know what you're doing. Is there a pattern I could use to make this explicit other than by documenting it? For example, some way to enforce that only classes that implement IUpdateImportantData can do it (this is just an example)? I'm not talking about security here, but more of a "hey, are you sure you want to do that?" kind of thing. ## UPDATE I've been faced with similar situations before, that's why I tried to keep the question more generic but it seems that a more concrete example is definitely required. So here it goes: I have a Context class with a a property CurrentYear. Many classes use this Context object and, whenever CurrentYear changes, they need to react (reload themselves, for example). Now, there are some classes that can legitimately change CurrentYear. Of course, you don't want just everybody to change CurrentYear as that has an effect in many other classes. How would you go about that?
