Is there a way to robustly extract date and time from a text? Say for example: > ...The event will be held on 17/10/2013 at 3:30 PM in the room 121 and > everyone is welcome... should return: > >     {2013, 10, 17, 15, 30, 0} >   The emphasis here is on **robustness of the extraction**. The same output is expected when the date is slightly twisted as follows: > ...The event will be held on 17th October 2013 at 3:30 PM in the room 121 > and ... > > ...The event will be held on October 17th 2013 at 3:30 PM in the room 121 > and ... > > ...The event will be held on 17 October 2013 at 3:30 PM in the room 121 and > ... I guess this is a fairly trivial problem in natural language processing, though I am not aware of the state-of-the-art. I think simple regular expressions are the way to go. Is there an existing resource that can do this?
