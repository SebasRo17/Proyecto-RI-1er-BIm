I teach an _Intro to Mathematica_ course, and one of the things I try to reinforce early on is just how helpful Mathematica's help is. In the very first lab for the course, I even give the students a randomly selected command (from among simple ones like `PrimeQ`, `IntegerDigits`, etc.) and ask them to tell me what that command does. As of right now, they get this question right if they correctly explain what the given command does. What I'd like to do is make sure they are actually going to the help. Is there some way to capture an **F1** key press within an `EventHandler` or something similar?
