EDIT: I need to find out an index `i` which depends on certain conditions and I'm not able to implement it. I have a list (time points) $t_i$ and two constants $a,c$ the length of the list $t_i$ is $n$. So now I want to find the index $1 \leq i < n$, which can be found according to $t_{n-i}+a<c<t_{n-(i+1)}$ where $t_0:=\infty$. For example I know that `i=5`in this example, but I would like to have a function which tells me that:               c = 0.07875`     a = 0.01125`     ti = {0.056249999999999994`, 0.045`, 0.03375`, 0.0225`, 0.01125`, 0.`}     n=6      Do you have any tips how to implement it?
