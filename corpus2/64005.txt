I read a blog that said something along the lines of: > Some candidates could be inexperienced but with potential to be great. A > good way to test this is to have them solve (non-programming) puzzles to > test their problem solving skills. I wonder if solving the puzzles in the game Portal could be a good way to do this. First of all, its fun, candidates would enjoy the interview and be more enthusiastic about the job. However, many programmers are familiar with this game, and it would only work if they have never played it before. Also, my first time playing it I didn't find it very difficult, but I also love solving puzzles. So maybe its not difficult enough to really test problem solving skills. If this is a bad example, what are some good examples (of problems to solve)?
