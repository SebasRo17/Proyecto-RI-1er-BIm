In a program I am developing, I need to use an improved ListView. The ObjectListView seems to satisfy my needs, except it is GPL and thus unusable in my commercial application. I believe, however, that we can develop our own replacement in-house, using the documentation from the site, without looking at the code. Is there any legal risk in doing so? Does our control need to be GPL or any other license restrictions?
