I've been using `Simplify/FullSimplify` to simplify some nasty equations, and by and large it does well but sometimes it rearranges equations in an unhelpful way. Here's a simple example. Say `x` is a positive number (standing in for some generally much more complicated factors),               $Assumptions=x>0      I have an equation like               eq = x^2 (a + b - 2 c^2 b) == 0     eq // Simplify      > >     a + b == 2 b c^2 >   But I don't want it to move terms from the `LHS` to the `RHS`, splitting up terms proportional to `b`. I want them grouped together. I can use `Collect` to keep these terms together, but then I have no way of dividing out the `x^2`. I could use `Collect` then divide out the `x^2` manually, but the terms I'm using `x^2` to stand in for are quite unwieldy, and it would be quite laborious to do this case-by-case, especially when `Simplif`y does it right away. **My question** : Is there any simple way to take `eq` and output > >     a + b - 2c^2 b == 0 >     (* or *) >     a + (1-2c^2)b ==0 >   without explicitly specifying that I want to divide out `x^2` (since `Simplify` divides this out automatically)?
