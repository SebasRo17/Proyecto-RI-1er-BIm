I'm just wondering if this method would be possible using jQuery HTML and PHP. Basically I have a filtering system were products are listed, some have different attribute values such as Hatchback for example. The text element that holds these PHP echo's also have a css class that implements an icon. I'm just wondering can I alter class's that are added to a html element just by looking at the string? So for example if the string displays "Pick-up" then jQuery alters the class and adds the one associated with the "Pick-up" string? Thanks sorry if this is a little confusing, I can explain more if needed.
