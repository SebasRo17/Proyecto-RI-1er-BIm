Have you always been fundamentally correct in the software designs you proposed? When you give out some design that was fundamentally wrong, you tend to lose the respect of your fellow team members. No matter what you do after that you end up being crosschecked for everything thing you propose after that incident. This is especially worse when you are new to a team and they don't know your past where you have had some good success stories. Maybe the reason you gave a bad design was because of lack of experience or knowledge or both in that area. How have you who have faced such a situation dealt with it? Is this like a one time thing in your career or does it happen on and off? Does one put this behind or does one in such a situation need to look for a new line of work? Some honest feedback please... Thank you.
