I have an estimation routine I have coded up, I want now to do some tests on it where I pick a particular parameter and run the estimation for differing values of that parameter. What I want is to be able to specify the parameter name I am interested in changing at the top of the file and from then on just run a loop substituting different values into the chosen parameter. So for example I want something to the effect of               paramToVary = a;     paramValues = Range[0, 1, 1/20];          Do[MyEstimation[a, b], {paramToVary, paramValues}]      except this wont work as written, `paramToVary` takes the values of `paramValues` whereas I want these to be going into `a` instead. Any ideas on how to do this or alternative solutions?
