I am an advanced novice Mathematica user and have done a fair amount of single-variable calculus things with it. This semester I am using Mathematica for multi-variate calculus and when I tried to use Mathematica to solve a double integral I got incorrect results. I discovered that the syntax for the Integrate command has you list the variables in the opposite order they appear in the integrand. At first blush this seems dumb and annoying but perhaps there is a good reason for it. If so, I'd like to know what it is. If not, is anyone else annoyed by this?
