There is something about strings which doesn't seem to be totally clear for me (for the moment): When entering "a string", the output, formatted as "Output" gives this string without the quotes. But when changing the "Output" format to "Text" format (which looks better for text as the typewriter font for Outputâ€”for my uses at least), the quotes come back! Why is that and how can I get non-typewriter fonts as output of evaluations, without the quotes coming back? Thanks for all help, as always!
