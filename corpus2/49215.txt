My team built a website for a client several years ago. The site taffic has been growing very quickly and our client has been asking us to grow our team to fill their maintenance and feature request needs. We started with a small number of developers, and our team has grown - now we're in the double digits. What management/development changes are the most beneficial when team grows from small "garage-size" team to 10+ developers?
