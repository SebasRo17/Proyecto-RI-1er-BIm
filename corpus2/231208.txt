This is a function in the d3.v3.js file (the graph library D3.js):                 function d3_geo_areaRingStart() {         var λ00, φ00, λ0, cosφ0, sinφ0;         d3_geo_area.point = function(λ, φ) {           d3_geo_area.point = nextPoint;           λ0 = (λ00 = λ) * d3_radians, cosφ0 = Math.cos(φ = (φ00 = φ) * d3_radians / 2 + π / 4),            sinφ0 = Math.sin(φ);         };         function nextPoint(λ, φ) {           λ *= d3_radians;           φ = φ * d3_radians / 2 + π / 4;           var dλ = λ - λ0, cosφ = Math.cos(φ), sinφ = Math.sin(φ), k = sinφ0 * sinφ, u = cosφ0 * cosφ + k * Math.cos(dλ), v = k * Math.sin(dλ);           d3_geo_areaRingSum.add(Math.atan2(v, u));           λ0 = λ, cosφ0 = cosφ, sinφ0 = sinφ;         }         d3_geo_area.lineEnd = function() {           nextPoint(λ00, φ00);         };       }      I was completely taken aback that the programmers used π, φ and λ as variable names. Surprisingly, these variables were accepted even by Notepad (ie: it didn't turn into junk/unrecognized characters).   Is it good practice to use such variables? I can see that they're very intuitive and searchable too, but a bit unnerving.
