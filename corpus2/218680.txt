I'm currently working on a group project to recreate the original Pokemon Yellow version in Java. We've only just started planning it out but they way we've drawn out the design right now is to have an abstract Pokemon class and have 151 (Count of the original Pokemon) classes that extend it, each one being a different Pokemon. Each class will be able to store data such as an ID, its name, the type of Pokemon it is (ie: rock/water/fire/etc), and the moves it can use and learn. It seems a little much to be creating 151 classes for the Pokemon but it also seems like a good way to limit coupling. As far as design goes is this a good way to go about doing it, if not what are some better methods to go about doing it?
