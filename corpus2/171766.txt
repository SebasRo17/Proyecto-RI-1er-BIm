I want to create a python panel for Linux like pypanel or tint2 just for fun and to do practice with python development. Now the problem is: I want to create an auto-generated menu, but I don't know where to start. Where can I find all user's installed software in a Linux distro? I know I should look in the `/usr/bin` folder, but I don't know if it's really the best thing to do. Is there a way to filter installed apps to avoid dependecies programs?
