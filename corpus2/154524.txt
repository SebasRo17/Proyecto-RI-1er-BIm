I am planing to build a website which one of its main features is the usage of pictures. I was wondering what existing techniques are used to prevent offensive pictures (i.e pornography) to get loaded by users. i.e What does Facebook or Pinterest use? As well I would like to know what your recommendations would be to control offensive pictures to get uploaded to the site (OpenSource tools maybe..) Taking into consideration this is a personal project and will be developed with a very small budget. Thank you
