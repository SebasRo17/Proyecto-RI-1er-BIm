I am currently teaching myself Python, using the GNU licensed book "Introduction to Computer Science using Python." In chapter 3, functions are covered. While I understand the concept of functions and how they simplify code by executing a defined sequence of statements whenever they care called, and that Modules are collections of related functions and variables, stored in a file, I do not understand the concept of module objects and function objects. For example, when "import math" is executed, it says, a module object is created. Also, when a function is defined and is executed, a function object is created. Could someone please explain what these "objects" are to me?
