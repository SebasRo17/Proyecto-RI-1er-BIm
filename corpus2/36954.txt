I have a notebook in Mathematica 4. I'm trying to convert it to use in Mathematica 9. One of the problem is the long computation of definite integral. In Mathematica 4 the result of the following code ![code](http://i.imgur.com/0ILEIew.png) is ~18.4 and ~0.66 seconds, but the same code in Mathematica 4 gives me 0.266 and 0.031 ! Why? upd. The code itself:               B[i_,j_]:=Integrate[(x-i)^i x^j,{x,-5,5}];     Timing[Sum[B[i,1],1,10];]      The real program is much more complex. This is just the small part of it.
