What is the fastest way to cut off all `n z` digits of the fractional part of a real number? (For example 12390.20934230) I came up with this so far:               Round[l_List, z_] :=       IntegerPart[l] +         Module[{r = RealDigits[l]},          Fold[10 #1 + #2 &, 0, Take[r[[1]], {Max[r[[2]],0]+z, r[[2]]+z}]] 10^-z]      Best would be a fast pure function to run over an array, and optimal would be to just show the output rounded (aka ScientificForm), but let the actual numbers as they are.
