I'm trying to do a calculation in parallel that requires setting $MaxPiecewiseCases. How can I do this? This small test case doesn't work for me:               $MaxPiecewiseCases = 1000;     Print[$MaxPiecewiseCases];     ParallelEvaluate[$MaxPiecewiseCases = 500; Print[$MaxPiecewiseCases]];      Instead the output is:               During evaluation of In[118]:= 1000     (kernel 7) 100     (kernel 8) 100     (kernel 9) 100     ...
