This is next question from the series: _better avoid_ `Panel` _if you care about details._ previous about `FrameMargins` In the following example `ImageSize` is on purpose not big enough to display `1`, we will see that this causes the `Panel` to fool us about it's `ImageSize`. First case:               With[{opt = Sequence[ImageSize -> {20, 20}, ImageMargins -> 0, Background -> Orange]},      Row[{        Panel[1, opt],        Panel[1, opt]        }]]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S7Jzy.png)               With[{opt = Sequence[ImageSize -> {20, 20}, ImageMargins -> 0, Background -> Orange]},          Row[{            Panel[1, opt],            Panel[1, opt, FrameMargins -> 0]            }]]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QNsrl.png) Again, there is no problem with `Framed`. WinXP V9.0.1 Is this OS dependent problem too? Is bugs appriopriate tag?, because I see no reason that `FrameMargins` should affect overall `ImageSize`.
