Right out of college, I joined a company A a couple of weeks back. They have a good product, and I get to work on it from the ground up. I have to work with PHP and get to experiment and implement neural networks. A week back, I got a call from another startup B that was looking for experienced guys in Computer Vision/Machine Learning field. I'd applied to them some time back, they liked my CV, gave me a thorough interview and offered me a job but at a lower salary than what they originally mentioned and slightly lower than what I get at A. Here I'd be working Java/C++ and core software technologies. These guys have a product out, and I'd be involved in optimization of this product before I'm evaluated and start work on their newer one. Can someone experienced help me with some thoughts..   1. Will it be hard to switch from scripting languages like PHP to Java/C++ later in my career?   2. How stable is the computer vision field?   3. The head of B told me I'd be working in a challenging field, which would be a career escalator... People had taken huge pay cuts to join their company... Should I take these at face value? Any more opinions/suggestions (except for-just make sure you dn't regret it later) are appreciated.
