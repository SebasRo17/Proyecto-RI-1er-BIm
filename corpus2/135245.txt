We have about 3/4 different projects, each sharing a certain level of data. Some data is not shared, but all the data access has ended up in a single namespace that is included in every project. Utility methods and other "shared functionality" is continually added to this root namespace, and is ultimately fairly organized, but it all ends up in a single dll to be included in projects. To me it seems overly centralized but does it qualify to labeled a God Namespace? (does that term even make sense?)
