Let's say you have an application that has a boolean field in its `User` table called `Inactive`. Is there anything inherently wrong with just storing false as null? If so can you please explain what the down side should be? I have discussed this with someone a few months ago and we both agreed it shouldn't matter as long as you do it consistently throughout the app/database. Recently, someone I know was emphatic that "true" `true` or `false` should be used, but they didn't really give an explanation as to why.
