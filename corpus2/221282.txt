**The Problem**   I came up with this select-box variant in answer to a question on UX.SE: http://ux.stackexchange.com/a/48951/16187 ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w2hEC.png) However, working out how to implement it has been driving me mad ever since I wrote that post. **What I've tried**   Initially I figured it would be easy enough to do. The strategy I would have taken would be to model all the options in a javascript object, with their own name and selected properties, and then write a view function to display them as an unordered list or something. I could then create the button as another javascript object, modelling it's own state, and have a view function spiting it out a representation of it into the widget. Maybe throw in some event code for transitioning between button states and I'm done. **Where I'm Stuck**   The more I thought about that approach, the more I realised that having all of the state sitting in javascript objects was a terrible idea. I figured that I should probably store the state in the dom, and mutate it with javascript. However I have no clear idea what that sort of architecture would look like, or how I should go about coding it. Can you help me work out what a better high level implementation strategy for this sort of widget looks like?
