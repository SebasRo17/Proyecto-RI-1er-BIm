Let               f[x_]=9x^2-2x-3;      I want to make a table of `f` at `x ={-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2}`. Plot these values with `ListPlot` \+ option `Joined` set to `True` Make a "normal" plot of `f` on the interval [-1, 2] * * *               Table[{f[x]}, {x, -1, 2, 0.5}]          Curves := Riffle[Table[{f[x]}, {x, -1, 2, 0.5}], Table[{f[x]}, {x, -1, 2, 0.5}]]     ListLinePlot[Curves]     Plot[f[x], {x, -1, 2}]      Is this ok for this task? Because i think with `Joined` the points dont get joined but are still separate, but I don't know if that's normal because of `ListPlot`. And with `Plot` I don't think I got the right function, but if I do:               Plot[f[x], {x, -1, 2}]      then I miss the points $-.5, .5, 1.5$. Or shouldn't that be a problem since the question is not that specific? Thanks in advance!
