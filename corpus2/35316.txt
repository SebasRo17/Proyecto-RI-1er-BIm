I have a file (attached as an image) which I imported to _Mathematica_ and only extracted the first and second column. My problem is that I want to extract the data beginning from the row where $A=0$. Assuming that the extraction of the 2 columns is called $s$ I could easily use `Drop` `Drop[s, 13]`, but I want the same for more files in which the `0` is not always at the beginning of the 14th row. I think I should wrap it in a function of the empty entries, but I have no clue how to do it. Does anyone have suggestions for what my approach should be? ![Revamped image description](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iQzq0.jpg)
