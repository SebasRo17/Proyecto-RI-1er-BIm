I already have knowledge about basic algorithms. Now I plan to study more advance algorithms and I decide to go with Introduction to Algorithms. I'm not sure, do I need to refresh my math's skill before read this book or not? (I forget almost math that I learn in high school and college) If this book need strong math knowledge, please suggest subjects that benefit. **Update**   **P.S.** I want to learn about implementation, design and analysis of algorithms.
