I'm having some trouble exporting a ContourPlot as a .DXF (to be used in AutoCAD). My code is:               LG3 = ContourPlot[1/2 - Sum[Sinc[(n \[Pi])/2] Cos[n (1 x + 4 ArcTan[y, x])], {n, 1, 200}] == 0.5,       {x, -20, 20},       {y, -20, 20},       PlotPoints -> 100]     SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];     Export["LG3.dxf", LG3];      The relevant output is: > Export::nodta: Graphics3D contains no data that can be exported to the DXF > format. >> Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
