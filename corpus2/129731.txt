I'm using SVN and I'm wondering about which part of the code base the users should test. The trunk (after the new feature branch has been merged in) or the branch? If using the branch, how do you deal with the scenario where two developers are working on two different feature sets (so two branches), and need to release for testing to the users? We've had a scenario where users are testing the wrong version (branch) and obviously cannot see their fixes. I'd appreciate some experience / advice about dealing with this. Update: Branches are used for new features / bug fixing and eventually merged back into the trunk. Testing involves testing the entire application (for site- effects) but will realistically users will have only tested their feature.
