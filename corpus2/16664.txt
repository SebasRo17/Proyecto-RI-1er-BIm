Background:I want to create a "palette" that contains buttons that evaluate the selected part of the expression and replace the selection with the result, just like what the built-in palette _"Algebraic Manipulation"_ does. I found a way to achieve this feature in the documentation of `Button`:               Button[Defer[Expand[\[SelectionPlaceholder]]], None, BaseStyle -> "Evaluate"]      As you know, this creates a button named Expand that `Expand` the selected expression and replace it with the result.               (a + b)^5      Select the expression above and click the button, the expression will change to:               a^5 + 5 a^4 b + 10 a^3 b^2 + 10 a^2 b^3 + 5 a b^4 + b^5      I think this feature is very convenient, and I would like to create more stuff with it.e.g: create a button of this style with `TableForm`,I tried the following code:               Button[Defer[TableForm[\[SelectionPlaceholder]]], None, BaseStyle -> "Evaluate"]      Well, this is a simple imitation of the example shown above. But it gives me a button with a single **SelectionPlaceholder**. Finally,I found that `Defer` won't work with `TableForm`. When you execute:               Defer[TableForm[{1, 2, 3}]]      It gives me the `TableForm` of `{1,2,3}`. But when I use the following code:               Tableform = TableForm; Defer[Tableform[{1, 2, 3}]]      it works fine:                Tableform[{1, 2, 3}]      And then I can achieve what I want with this:               Tableform=TableForm;     Button[Defer[Tableform[\[SelectionPlaceholder]]], None, BaseStyle -> "Evaluate"]      **Q:** Could anyone gives me more details of how these things work? Bonus: How can I create this kind of " **inline execute** " palette with more complicated user-defined functions? (I would like to add it to the **Palettes Menu** , but I have no idea of where to get my user-defined function initialized every time I start the palette.) And is there any other way to create a **"inline execute"** button?
