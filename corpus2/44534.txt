I am new to signal processing. The equations below are given in $LaTeX$. I have the following transfer function (from the Dryden Model) for the two- sided Power Spectral Density: $$S(w) = \frac{\sigma_u ^2 \tau_u}{\pi} \frac{1}{1+(\tau_u w)^2}$$ I would like to plot the above as: Power Spectral Density, dB vs. w Any help on this would be appreciated. (please use any numerical values for $\sigma_u, \tau_u$) I also need to calculate the auto-correlation function by taking the inverse Fourier transform (call it `R(s)` ) of `S(w)`. Finally, I want to compute $$S1(w) = \int_{0}^{\infty} R(s) \cos (ws) ds$$ I would really appreciate someone's kindest help and advice in this regard. Thank you! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%               L := 50     Umc := 4.31     Su[\[Omega]_, \[Sigma]_, \[Tau]_] := (\[Sigma]^2 *\[Tau]/\[Pi] )*1/(1 \     + (\[Tau] *\[Omega])^2)     Sw[\[Omega]_, \[Sigma]_, \[Tau]_] := (\[Sigma]^2 *\[Tau]/(2*\[Pi] \     ))*(1 + 3*(\[Tau]* \[Omega])^2)/(1 + (\[Tau]*\[Omega])^2)^2          Ru[s_] := InverseFourierTransform[Su[\[Omega], 1, L/Umc], \[Omega], s]          S2 [\[Omega]_] := Integrate[Ru[s]*Cos[2*\[Omega]*s], {s, 0, Infinity}]          Plot[S2[\[Omega]] , {\[Omega], 0, 1}]
