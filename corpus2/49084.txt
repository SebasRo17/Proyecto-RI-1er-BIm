I'm trying to educate my colleagues in the area of design patterns. Some of the original Gang of Four patterns are a little esoteric, so I'm wondering if there is a sub-group of "essential" patterns that all programmers should know. As I look through the list, I think I've probably used -   * Abstract Factory    * Factory Method   * Singleton    * Bridge    * Facade    * Command Which ones do you actually use in practice, and what do you use them for? Link for those wanting a list of patterns
