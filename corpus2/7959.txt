So I find every project I get involved in, the start is great and I am all gun-ho lets do some coding. Next thing you know, the project is nearing completion, we are refining, testing, revising, waxing the car if you will and I just cannot retain focus. I get to this point and I cannot stop thinking about how to maintain and get the job done. Any comments on how to retain focus as project nears end and you cannot wait for next project?
