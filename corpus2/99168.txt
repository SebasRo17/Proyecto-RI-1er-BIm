This is a question **focused on the legal aspects of software licensing**. I am starting to develop a proeject want the option to claim the source code as properitary and retain full copy rights. I like 'git' (license under GNU v2), but want to make sure of a couple legal things.   1. What is the legal status of source code under version control of 'git' (which is distributed under the GNU v2 license)? Does it qualify as a 'derivative work'?   2. What are the legal ramifications of the source code's legal status? Specifically in regards to being legally obligated to realeasing source code.   3. What besides git (GNU v2 license), what are my other version control options (legally speaking)?
