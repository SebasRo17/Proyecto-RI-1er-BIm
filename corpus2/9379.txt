I have a multiset {1, 3, 3, 1, 2} and would like to randomly permute the classes like so: {2, 1, 1, 2, 3} or {3, 2, 2, 3, 1}, what is the simplest and most efficient way to do this? In reality the input set would be like `RandomInteger[1000, 1000000]` _Edit_ The tricky part of this question is that the positions of the same integers must remain the same! Only the representatives are permuted, but the positions of the classes of integers need to remain the same.
