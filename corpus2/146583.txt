I am building an online game much like Mafia Wars. I was thinking of displaying the number of registered users on the home page, but then I thought: > "What if a new user sees that the total number of registered users is > **5**?!" :D That would be too embarrassing to my _still growing_ game. Then another thought came by: > "Why don't I display **500** instead?!" ;) Nobody would know if there is actually 500 users registered to my website unless of course they start actually playing and interacting with other players. However, I just have a feeling that this isn't ethical. What if this generates a negative publicity to my website?!! What's your opinion should I fake the number? or should I honestly display it? or should I wait till I have 1000 real account then start displaying the number? And most importantly is this legal?! :D
