I'm a Delphi developer with aprox 5 years of experience. But now, Delphi seems to be dead, and the job opportunities are smaller. So, I want to begin learn Java, because I like it, and the job market is bigger(and competition also...). Until now I've searched for opinions about the best Java books and I've founded several books(Thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel,"Java 6 The Complete Reference " , complete JAVA for SCJP, etc - you can provide more examples if you want). Now, what I'm asking you: when you start to learn a new programming language (in this case Java) which are the steps you're following? How do manage the learning curve? (how you allocate time for different chapters and technologies) Thank you in advance
