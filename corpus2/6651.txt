On my system when a default button is pressed it turns light blue. This appearance can be changed using this code from the documentation: > Use a second element to get the appearance of a pressed button:               Table[Button["xxx", Null, Appearance -> {a, "Pressed"}], {a, {"DialogBox", "Palette"}}]      So in essence you change the _pressed_ button appearance by changing the button appearance. But if you want **no** appearance, i.e. Appearance->None, you are still stuck with the blue background:               Button["xxx", Null, Appearance -> {None, "Pressed"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fBpYu.png) I can achieve what I want using `EventHandler`:               EventHandler[MouseAppearance["xxx", "LinkHand"],"MouseClicked" :> Print["X"]]      But it seems to me that I should be able to do this with `Button` options. Q. How can I set appearance to None for both the pressed and unpressed button? If this cannot be done with button options--and it would seem an oversight if it is not possible--I will use `EventHandler`.
