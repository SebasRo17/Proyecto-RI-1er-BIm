I am a new PHP developer (coming from .NET). The experienced php dev that I work with said that calling a static get method on a PHP class with an ID as a parameter is common in PHP. Is there a name for this idiom? Is there a reason why developers do this? Can someone point to a link to an example class? I would like to understand more of what he is saying. He is talking about code like this I think, to pull car #1 from the database:               $car = Car::get(1)
