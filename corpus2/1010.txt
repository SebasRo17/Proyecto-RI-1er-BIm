I would like to imitate the structure of this great painting from Ellsworth Kelly in Mathematica. Yet with all the colored squares in Black and the beige one in white. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wgMtl.png) Below is what I have wrote to generate a square made out of 100 squares but I am confused about the next step : How could I "Gaussianly sample" from the center How could I then assign different colors to the ones selected ?               Graphics@Flatten[                      Table[Rectangle @@@                             Table[{{i, j}, {i + 1, j + 1}},                                   {i, Range[0, 10, 1]}],                        {j,Range[0, 10, 1]}], 1]
