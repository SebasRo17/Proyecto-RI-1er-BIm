I'm not sure if what I'm after even exists or if it doe's im looking for the wrong thing. I'm after a framework/application/SDK that allows me to build a desktop application with a HTML/CSS/JavaScript based interface yet still allow for more complex OS interaction with a programming language such as Python (im also familiar with Ruby but as this is a hobby project I don't mind looking into other languages if needed). By complex OS interaction I mean more than simply saving files to the HDD, being able to use pythons libraries would be a big bonus. The closet thing I can find so far is tideSDK http://www.tidesdk.org but it doesn't seem to offer much past its own API for OS interaction.
