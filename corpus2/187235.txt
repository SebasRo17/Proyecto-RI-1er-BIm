I work for an insurance company. They have a contact database that gets pushed to the field agents by Lotus Notes. We're trying to move away from Lotus Notes, but we first have to remove our dependency on it. It has been suggested that a HTML5 solution could provide offline access to agent contacts and be used to sync changed from the server down and the client up. It is my understanding that the SQL storage capabilities of HTML5 aren't fully implemented (IE and Firefox apparently don't support yet per one site I read.) LocalStorage may not be robust enough for the data we need to sync since the size limit is relatively small. Is HTML5 a feasible solution to this issue or should we track down some kind of syncing solution? (I've been reading about one from the Ubuntu folks and Microsoft's, as well.) Thanks!
