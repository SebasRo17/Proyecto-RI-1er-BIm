I am currently writing an extended report on a software library I have written. The reviewer will be a professor at my univeristy. He knows basically what I had to do, but the report will be evaluated. I have produced some samples results with the library which I already plan to include in the work. What I want to know know is :     * What should I write about the library itself?   * How should I structure it?   * Which points need to be emphasized? Also, the professor is as allergic to mundane implementation details as a business manager.
