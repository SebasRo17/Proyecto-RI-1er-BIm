Is there a way to `Export` expressions to a monochrome PNG? I have tried the `ColorQuantize` function which is mentioned in comments to this question. However, the resulting PNG image of `ColorQuantize[TraditionalForm[MyExpression], 2]` is still of depth 24b. GIF file's depth appears to be 2, which is OK but it still looks like a cheat, and yes, PNG is more desired in my case. Rasterizing formulas before exporting also seems to be an unnatural hack that could and should be avoided in some way. I could `Export` my expressions to PDF and then GhostScript them (say, via `Run`) using GhostScript's _pngmono_ device but _Mathematica_ 's current PDF Export is quite buggy. (It doesn't even print \\[Bullet] correctly; TraditionalForm is lost, etc.) Printing selection to PDF and GhostScripting the result would do the thing for me… but there seems to be no way to do it ‘in a background mode’ using _Mathematica_ commands.
