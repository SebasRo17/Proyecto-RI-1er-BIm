One of my company product need to implement a license mechanism. I'm planing to generate a key base on users PC MAC address. But I'm bit scared is this method confuse with some advance hardware. configurations such as.   * Multiple network cards.   * Virtualization.   * Mac address change possibilities(?)   * Working with VPNs. Is it a good idea to generate license key with MAC address? Some ideas?
