In my repo I have 3 closely related mini projects: 1 server and 2 clients. They are all quite small (<3 files each). Since they are so small and so closely related I just dropped them in folders in one single repo. However now that I know I can't clone a single directory in my VCS of choice (Mercurial), I'm considering splitting them up. However I'm confused about general best practice: Is it okay to put different small projects in different branches, or should they all go in different repos? I'm currently leaning towards branching since I can't easily splice out the file history of the different projects but then your using a feature in a way it wasn't meant to be used.
