I am struggling with naming convetions in C# I do not know when to use PascalCase or camelCase. I have read Microsoft's naming convention, but I got lost ther http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229045(v=vs.110).aspx As far as I know this is correct:               public int Number;     private int number;     public void Method();     private void method();     int number;//for any local variable      But in context of that above how should I name components in XAML: `x:Name="Button"` or `x:Name="button"`. They seems to be private field so I should use camelCase, but on the other hand everywhere on the examples I see PascalCase for `x:Name` I do not ask about one's habits, but orthodoxic/official/C# guru style.
