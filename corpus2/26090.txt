The function `PowerExpand[z^(a+b)]` does not transform $z^{a+b}$ into $z^a z^b$. Is there a way to force Mathematica 8 to expand $z^{a+b}$ into $z^a z^b$? In this case, the particular reason why is because the Mod function does not simplify expressions very well. I end up having to expand the powers by hand. For example, this expression should simplify to zero,               2^(3 + 4 k) + 2^(7 + 8 k) - 81^(1 + k);         Assuming[Element[k, Integers] && k > 1, FullSimplify[Mod[PowerExpand[%],5]]]      > >     Mod[4 (2^(1 + 4 k) + 2^(5 + 8 k) + 81^(1 + k)), 5] >
