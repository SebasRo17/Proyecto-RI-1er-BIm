The `Button` control is very easy to understand               Button["Press Me", Print["Pressed"]]      I press the button, I execute the function. No Dynamic tom-foolery (I'll be honest, I struggle with Dynamics when they get above a certain level of complexity). I would like to be able to do the same with other controls. For example.               SetterBar[1, Range[5]]      gives 5 buttons for use in Dynamic settings. I'd like something simpler. I'm thinking of something like               SetterBar[1, Range[5],Foo]      Where `Foo` is a function that gets called when I click on a button on the SetterBar, ideally with an argument corresponding to the button I pressed. So, if I press '5', Foo[5] gets called. Any ideas?
