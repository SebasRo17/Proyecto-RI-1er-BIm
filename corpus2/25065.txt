Is it possible to create a 3d rotating text like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JwlMN.jpg) animation here. Here is my try so far:               text = Style["Mathematica  Mathematica ", 128];     g = ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[theta], Sin[theta], rho}, {theta, -Pi,          Pi}, {rho, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> Texture[text],         Lighting -> "Neutral", Mesh -> None, PlotRange -> All,         TextureCoordinateScaling -> True, Boxed -> False, Axes -> False,         SphericalRegion -> True];          Animate[Show[g, ViewPoint -> {2 Cos[x], 2 Sin[x], 0}], {x, 0,        2 \[Pi]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RvxDE.gif) The problem is that the text is a texture and one can't look through it. We can use Simon Woods's nice `filledCurveToPolygons3D` function at here to change the the text into polygons, but wrap the polygon to a cylinder seems require non-geometric transformation, which I don't know how to do. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/k5qIb.jpg) possible related questions:   * How can I create a 3D FilledCurve object?   * Character edge finding   * Non-geometric transformation of Graphics3D primitives   * How can I wrap text around a circle?
