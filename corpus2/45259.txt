I work in a small sized software/web development company. I have gotten into the habit of optimizing prematurely, I know it is evil and promotes bad code, but I have been working at this firm for a long while and I have deemed this as a necessary evil. It has never caused me an issue so far in the past, but it might if I get partners or a successor. Should I change my current practice now to prepare for that case, or should I not worry about it?
