Suppose I am provided with two data lists. (Assume for the moment that they are lists of integers.) I would like a function that generates bar charts that I can manipulate. Here is what I have:               f[dL1_List, dL2_List] :=       Module[{dL1SymList, dL2SymList},        dL1SymList = (Symbol["dL1" <> ToString[#]] &) /@ dL1;        dL2SymList = (Symbol["dL2" <> ToString[#]] &) /@ dL2;        (          Manipulate[Grid[{              {               BarChart[dL1SymList, PlotLabel -> "dL1"],               BarChart[dL2SymList, PlotLabel -> "dL2"]               }              }], ##] &          ) @@         Join[          MapThread[({{#1, #2}, 0.0, 10*#2} &), {dL1SymList, dL1}],          MapThread[({{#1, #2}, 0.0, 10*#2} &), {dL2SymList, dL2}]          ]        ];          f[Range[1, 5], Range[1, 5]]      However, while this does not produce any error, it does not display bar graphs either. Can you please help me understand where I am going wrong? Thanks in advance for your help.
