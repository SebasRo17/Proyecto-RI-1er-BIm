When working on a software project or a website, do you develop with localization in mind? By this I mean e.g.   * Externalizing all strings, including error messages.   * Not using images that contain text.   * Designing your UI with text expansion in mind.   * Using pseudo-translation to test your UI's early in the process.   * etc. On projects you work on, are these in the 'nice to have' category and let the localization team worry about the rest, or do you have localization readiness built into your development process? I'm interested to hear how developers view localization in general.
