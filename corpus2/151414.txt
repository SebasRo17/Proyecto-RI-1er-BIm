Is there a language where **collections** can be used as **objects** without altering the behavior? As an example, first, imagine those functions work:               function capitalize(str)          //suppose this *modifies* a string object capitalizing it     function greet(person):         print("Hello, " + person)          capitalize("pedro")     >> "Pedro"          greet("Pedro")     >> "Hello, Pedro"      Now, suppose we define a standard collection with some strings:               people = ["ed","steve","john"]      Then, this will call toUpper() on each object on that list               people.toUpper()      >> ["Ed","Steve","John"]      And this will call greet once for EACH people on the list, instead of sending the list as argument               greet(people)     >> "Hello, Ed"     >> "Hello, Steve"     >> "Hello, John"
