So there is a website that I want to build. It will be a review aggregator and probably a bit more. I want to build this website for three reasons:   1. I really think this website will be used by a reasonable amount of people    2. I want to practice my programming skills since currently at my job I am doing mostly scripting    3. Maybe learn a new language. I am currently torn though since my immediate reaction is that I want to use Java since I know it relatively well, like it, and feel it will allow me to put something up as quickly as possible. I would also like to use an existing Web Application Framework. If I don't end up going with Java I would probably go with one of the following:   * C#/.NET - I prefer static languages, and this is similar to Java.   * Python - I use this at my job superficially and it seems that a lot of people are using it.   * Ruby - Seems to have a very well established framework   * Scala - Has some similarities to Java but from what I read it's a different paradigm So I guess my question is under these circumstances do you think that I should build a website using a known language or a new one?
