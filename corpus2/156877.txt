I'm working on a website for a photographer, the whole code is just a few files, and whole repository is a few MBs without the actual photographs. But, when I add the actual photographs to git and commit, then the repository jumps to 75 MBs. Considering the photos will be updated, the size of the repository is going to grow big as photos gets updated. I know I'm doing something very wrong. Please, share your methods, for managing big binary files separate from source code, and still maintain dependencies. PS: I don't use a db currently, all are plain text files.
