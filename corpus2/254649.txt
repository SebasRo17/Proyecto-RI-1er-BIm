Recently I came across the following in one of our projects. In one of our mvc views they are passing model data to an Angular controller through ngInit directive               In xxx.cshtml          <div ng-controller="AssessmentController" ng-init   ="Init('@Model.Status','@Model.ARN','@Model.AssessmentID','@Model.AssessorID',@Model.Contents, @Model.Date_of_Assessment.ToJsonTicks(),'@Model.HouseReferenceID',@Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(Model.House))">      I pointed out that according to Angular documentation ngInit directive is not to be used to to initialize controllers. https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngInit Instead what I suggested was to send the ID in ngInit directive and               <div ng-controller="AssessmentController" ng-init   ="Init('@Model.AssessmentID'">      Then after that use $http [https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http] service to get the remainder of data from the Angular controller. The developer is refusing my idea saying it's faster to just send all the data through ngInit directive instead of having to do another call to get the data inti the Angular controller. What do you guys think about this scenario? The only point I have right now is that this code is FUGLY and it not according to standards. How would you convince a developer to follow the path I suggested. Or am I completely wrong here?
