When I created my first web application few years ago, I remember trying to use the designer in VS 2008. Before I can even remember I abandoned it to the favor of actual debug to understand how my UI will actually look like. Since then, I gave it few more shoots but I was never convinced that it's even possible to build an complex UI with it. How much progress designers have made in the recent few years? Are there any designers that can enable real-time view of highly complex UI? is it programming language/framework dependent? Thanks.
