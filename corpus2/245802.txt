I bet I could answer that myself if I knew more about tools to analyze how C#/JIT behaves but since I don't, please bear with me asking. I have simple code like this :                   private SqlMetaData[] meta;              [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]         private SqlMetaData[] Meta         {             get             {                 return this.meta;             }         }      As you can see I put AggressiveInlining because I feel like it should be inlined.   I think. There's no guarantee the JIT would inline it otherwise. Am I wrong? Could doing this kind of thing hurt the performance/stability/anything?
