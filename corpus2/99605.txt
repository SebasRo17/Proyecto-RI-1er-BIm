I've heard the person at the keyboard named the "driver", and the other person named the "navigator". I've imagined rally car racers, where the person at the wheel just _cannot_ keep up with _everything_ that's happening, and they _must_ have the help of the "navigator", who's shouting volumes and volumes of directions at them to, literally, keep them "out of the weeds", much like a person at the keyboard is kept "on course" by the person in the second chair. What are the more/most commonly accepted terms for the two roles in pair programming, and (if it's not obvious) are they borrowed from any earlier professions?
