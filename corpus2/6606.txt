I have an external program which generates a set of data - X points at the time t1, X points at the time t2 and so on. These points are stored in CSV file and I can change the format if necessary.   What is the easiest way to plot and manipulate them, so I can click "play" and see the dynamics of process? **UPD:**   For example, points at t1:               0.2 42.8     0.4 12.3     0.6 32.1     0.8 37.3      Points at t2:               0.2 44.2     0.4 17.8     0.6 39.0     0.8 30.1      It is always a constant number of points at any time (4 in example). I can export them to separate CSV files or in the one file and change format in any way necessary, like adding a new column.
