For business or tester facing tests on projects (not unit tests), I've typically used FitNesse, but I've dabbled with RSpec and I'm interested in learning Selenium and Robot. Do you have experience in these (or other) acceptance testing tools? What are the pros and cons? For FitNesse, I can think of the following pros and cons initially. PROS:   * Wiki based editing, which most people understand   * Lots of support and plugins for different languages   * Completely self contained, you just download and go CONS:   * Refactoring the tests can be a little clunky   * You need to know (or document) the various properties that each method in your test fixture expects. There's no "intellisense" or IDE to do this for you that I'm aware of.
