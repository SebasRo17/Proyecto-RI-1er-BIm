There is of course the silly implementation:               FareySequence[n_] := Union[Flatten[Table[j/i, {i, 1, n}, {j, 0, i}]]]      However, there are numerous properties and confinements of Farey sequences (that can be used, **potentially** , in an indirect manner). This calls for a very simple, and, very efficient recurring/functional implementation, exhibiting _Superiority_. But I'm new to _Mathematica_ and can't find the right combination of built-in functions, and pure functions.. Ideas?
