How valuable (or not) do you think daily stand-up meetings are? If you're not familiar with it, this refers to a daily meeting that is part of Scrum adherents (and some other agile methodologies). The idea is that you hold a daily meeting, timeboxed to 15 minutes, and in which everyone must stand (to encourage people to be to-the-point). In the meeting, you go around the room and each say: \- What you did yesterday \- What you plan to do today \- Any blockers or impediments to your progress. Do you think this practice has value? Has anyone worked at a place that's done it, and what did you think?
