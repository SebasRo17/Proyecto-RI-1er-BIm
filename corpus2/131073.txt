According to the relevant Django documentation, a request context offers more than a normal context in that it merges request data into the context. It is hence necessary for views that perform form submission in Django. However, I am wondering why one cannot just always pass a request context for every view. After all, a request context offers more than a normal context. Why not create a helper function called, say, `render()` that automatically passes a request context? Is there a performance disadvantage?
