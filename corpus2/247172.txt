I'm studying dependency injection and I want to know if required function parameters can be considered dependencies. I'd just like to make sure before I go around referring to them dependencies and that turns out to not be exactly accurate.               function doSomething(required){              if(required !== null){                  // do stuff              }          }      **Are the required parameters of a function called dependencies?**
