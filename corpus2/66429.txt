I found a small bug in the microsoft mvc3 remote validation, concerning the clientside javascript implemented in jquerys unobtrusive javascript. The problem/bug can be fixed by adding a few lines to jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js which is bundled in the microsoft mvc3 installation. I can't seem to find a bug repository on jquery.com or in its plugins area. Am i not seeing the tree in the forest, or am i not going insane - where should i go with this problem - i already have the fix ready, but i'm afraid the next time jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js is updated (new version) and it's being applied to my project, my fix is overwritten. I also fooled around with adding some javascript that replaces the adapter (that has the bug) with my own version after jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js has been loaded - the problem is, that it's pretty ugly and What to do?
