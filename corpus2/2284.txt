I am trying to find the inverse function of $\frac{\ln{x}}{x^2}$ in Mathematica. I am using the `Solve[]` function to find the inverse (yes, I know about `InverseFunction[]`, but I was told to solve it with `Solve[]`). Why doesn't the following output evaluate correctly? I know that I shouldn't get imaginary values: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OtChM.png) Plugging the equation into `Solve[]` directly also gives me the same result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cB5GZ.png) However, if I drop the `x` from the `Log[]` function, I get something that looks more plausible: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FCeK1.png) Does `Log[x]` and `Log` evaluate to the same thing? Thank you for your time!
