Consider a manipulate function such as:               Manipulate[     per = 12.34;     pdata = Table[Sin[2 \[Pi] x/per], {x, n}] + RandomReal[.1, {n}];     ListPlot[pdata], {n, 100, 200, 10}]      which takes some time to re-evaluate each step of its manipulation. I would like to export each step of the manipulation as an image (rasterized or otherwise) & then create a manipulation that simply scrolls though the images, allowing it to run smoothly and quickly. Is there a way to automate something like this? _(NB The code I am working with takes far longer to re-evaluate each step that the example code above, but it works with much the same idea.)_
