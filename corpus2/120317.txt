It's maybe simple but I think about this every time I build a new application. How do you name the class for the _current_ user of the application and for the _orm_ class of the user table? Usually I have something like   * **CurrentUser** : Logged-in user, stored in session, info for last activity etc   * **User** : ORM Class (C# EF CodeFirst, but it doesn't matter) And yes, they could have the same name in different namespaces, but I don't really like that.
