I'm a python programmer who sees a lot of C++ code but doesn't know the language and there seems to be two ways to initalize a class. I was hoping that someone can tell me the difference.               class Point {             int x, y;          public:             int get_x();             int get_y();             Point(int, int);     }          // ok we are going to leave the methods and constructors unimplemented for brevity     // now here's the part that puzzles me     Point p(5, 5); // ..or     Point p = new Point(5, 5);      What's the diffrence between the two?
