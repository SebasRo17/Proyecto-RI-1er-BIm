For example, this code               Grid[Transpose[Table[{n, n^2}, {n, 1, 10}]], Frame -> All,      Background -> {{1 -> Red, 4 -> Red, 9 -> Red}}]      produces ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wldsN.png), in this case, the columns has column number being a square integer, i.e the 1,4,9,16,25...etc. columns This second code does the same job:               rule = {};     Do[If[IntegerQ[Sqrt[i]], AppendTo[rule, i -> Red]], {i, 1, 10}]     Grid[Transpose[Table[{n, n^2}, {n, 1, 10}]], Frame -> All, Background -> {rule}]      or better               rule = {};     Do[AppendTo[rule, i^2 -> Red], {i, 1, 10}]     Grid[Transpose[Table[{n, n^2}, {n, 1, 10}]], Frame -> All, Background -> {rule}]      I wonder if there is a way to specify a rule, in the 3rd way, inside Grid[] directly.
