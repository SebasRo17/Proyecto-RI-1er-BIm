There is a a program that I want to use that is released in two (fully copyrighted) ways:   1. Stable binary form   2. Beta release, mostly-stable binary form that is easy to derive the source (uses jars) (this version is free) Question:   1. Can I legally download the beta version, make the necessary changes to work properly on my machine, recompile and then use the software?   2. If yes to question 1, can I then explain to people I work with how to do the same thing so that they too can use the product?  In no way would I be giving them the modified software, but rather distributing instructions how to modify it. The original download would still come from the copyright owner. I believe I have done my due diligence searching these and google's forums, but as always, if you find a duplicate question, please let me know (and point to where it is found). It seems odd to me that this hasn't been covered yet.
