I have solved 2D incompressible Navier Stokes and written out a .dat file that includes x,y,u,v,p values. I am trying to get a 2D color heat graph like this one for my data ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VrAYZ.png) Here is what I have done so far trying to use Contourplot:               Data = Import[     "C:\\Users...     UVP-steady-state.dat", "Table"];     x = Data[[3 ;; 16002, 1]];     y = Data[[3 ;; 16002, 2]];     u = Data[[3 ;; 16002, 3]];     v =  Data[[3 ;; 16002, 4]];     p =  Data[[3 ;; 16002, 5]];     grid = Transpose[{x, y}];     ListPlot[grid, PlotLabel -> "MeshPoints", AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"},      PlotRange -> Automatic, AspectRatio -> Automatic]     velocity = Transpose[{x, y, Sqrt[u*u + v*v]}];     pressure = Transpose[{x, y, p}];     ListContourPlot[velocity]     ListContourPlot[pressure]      My steady state solution is in this .dat file http://www.wikiupload.com/VSPA5GS9BAXQ830 I am able to make my solution look like this with TecPlot. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6U1ly.png) For some reason Mathematica with ListContourPlot plots two fairly large gaps in the middle of the graph.
