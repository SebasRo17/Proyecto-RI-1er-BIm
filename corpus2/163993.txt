I've been asking a lot of people where to start learning java web development, I already know core java (Threading,Generics,Collections, a little experience with (JDBC)) but I do not know JSPs and servlets. I did my fair share of development with several web based applications using PHP for server-side and HTML,CSS,Javascript,HTML5 for client side. Most people that I asked told me to jump right ahead to Hibernate while some told me that I do not need to learn servlets and jsps and I should immediately study the Spring framework. Is this true? do I not need to learn servlets and JSPs to learn hibernate or Spring? All of their answers confused me and now I am completely lost what to learn or study. I feel that if I skipped learning JSP and servlets I would missed a lot of important concepts that will surely help me in the future. So the question, do I need to have foundation/know servlets and JSP to learn spring or hibernate or any other java web frameworks.?
