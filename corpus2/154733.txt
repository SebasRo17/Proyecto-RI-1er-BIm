In one of the latest "WTF" moves, my boss decided that adding a "Person To Blame" field to our bug tracking template will increase accountability (although we already have a way of tying bugs to features/stories). My arguments that this will decrease morale, increase finger-pointing and would not account for missing/misunderstood features reported as bug have gone unheard. What are some other strong arguments against this practice that I can use? Is there any writing on this topic that I can share with the team and the boss? I find this sort of culture unacceptable to work in but want to try and change it before jumping ship. Any input is appreciated.
