I am writing an iPad application. The main view of the application will be a PDF. I have made considerable progress in parsing out the contents of the PDF. The application will also have at least two "side views". These side views may or may not themselves be driven by PDF files. That is part of what I am trying to figure out. The main PDF will contain some hidden buttons which cause the side view to show certain things. For example, there might be a button over the name "Lincoln" that brings up a side view about Abe Lincoln, another one over the name "Washington" that brings up a side view about George Washington, and so on. The creation of these hidden buttons should be driven by data in the main PDF. I'm thinking this means annotations. Two questions: 1) Is there one type of annotation that I might prefer over another? Options I can see include actions, URIs, and maybe links -- but the last one could be complicated by the numerous internal links within the PDF. 2) Should I use PDFs for the side views? What are the arguments, pro and con? Considerations: A) Ease of moving the app to other platforms later   B) Pirating. I would prefer that someone who got my PDFs not be able to reproduce the app without some work. EDIT: answering the questions posed in an answer: By "action", I mean "PDF action". See section 12.6 of the [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html](PDF specification). The main view is a PDF because that's the format the content author is comfortable creating. But since this PDF will be embedded in the app, I have to assume that it could escape "into the wild".
