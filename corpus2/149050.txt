I'm using the WTFPL in my personal projects published on GitHub. Currently I'm using it verbatim, but I have the suspicion I shouldn't be leaving               Copyright (C) 2004 Sam Hocevar <sam@hocevar.net>       in there, and instead should use my name. But the license is very confusing about this. Half of the WTFPL is about the WTFPL itself, so I thought that copyright might refer to a copyright on the license text itself, and not on the project this is licensing. Also, it says > Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified copies of > this license document, and changing it is allowed as long as the name is > changed. So would I have to change the name, from WTFPL to, say, "WTFPL-Domenic"?
