Can someone explain the concrete reasons why BDFL choose to make Python lambdas single line? This is good:               lambda x: x**x      This results in an error:               lambda x:         x**x      I understand that making lambda multi-line would somehow "disturb" the normal indentation rules and would require adding more exceptions, but isn't that worth the benefits? Look at JavaScript, for example. How can one live without those anonymous functions? They're indispensable. Don't Pythonistas want to get rid of having to name every multi-line function just to pass it as an argument?
