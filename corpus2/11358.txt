I want to do a Delaunay triangulation on scattered 3D surface data. _Mathematica_ itself does it only for 2D through the command `DelaunayTriangulation[]`, which gives a triangulation for points in a plane. I also tried the MathLink package "TetGenLink", which can itself perform a Delaunay triangulation for three-dimensional data. The problem here is that `TetGenDelaunay[]` produces a triangulation through the inner region of the data, but I can't see how I can manage that the triangulation is only done for the surface (like what is done by MATLAB's `DelaunayTri` (see this SO question).
