In ruby ,               1.upto(10).to_a.group_by{|x| x%3}      gives               {1=>[1, 4, 7, 10], 2=>[2, 5, 8], 0=>[3, 6, 9]}      I would like use patten replace as a hash table in _Mathematica_. For example:               {1 -> {1, 4, 7, 10}, 2 -> {2, 5, 8}, 0 -> {3, 6, 9}}      I know I can use `GatherBy`, but it only contains the value. I tried to solve and I feel it isn't efficient for a large list.               fun = Mod[#, 3] &;     Thread[fun /@ #[[All, 1]] -> #] &@GatherBy[Range[10], fun]
