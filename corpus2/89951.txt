In a recent blog post by Roy Osherove, it is pointed out that his switch from primarily .Net development to ruby development has seen a huge difference in community involvement and really enjoys it. The quote that spawns this question is : > there is no master overlord that dictates what you will or wonâ€™t work with. I don't spend a great deal of time working with php, but I do spend about the same amount of time working with ruby. From the time that I spend working and communicating with people who work with both technologies it seems like Ruby has the feeling Roy describes much more than PHP does. I don't deal with Python a great deal, but those I know who do all say it has a similar community feeling. This strikes me as odd since every ruby and python programmer I know tend to have learned php somewhere along the way but they have no similar feeling about the php community. I understand there are justifiable complaints with earlier versions of php, but people were still able to use it to build some very large sites and many companies use it. What separates these communities that ruby and python seem to have such a different vibe compared to php? (This question could be subjective but I'm hoping there is a solid impartial answer to explain the difference)
