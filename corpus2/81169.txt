The Apache HTTP server is a fairly large projectâ€”much larger than, say, `lighthttp` or `nginx` or certainly the "simple HTTP servers" you see floating around in C/C++ tutorials. What is the extra code for? Does it add security/stability (and if so, how?) or is it just for doing things like parsing Apache `conf` files/`.htaccess` type things (and, I guess, `VirtualHosts` etc). I ask not to critique Apache, but because I'm interested in writing a web server of sorts and I'd like to know things that, while perhaps not obvious, are important to remember for a secure, stable and fast web server.
