I know three terms that have to do with storing objects or data. I'm not sure I understand the exact differences between the terms. Please confirm if what I'm about to write is accurate. **A data structure** is a group of data types or objects of the same type, grouped together in some formation. **A collection** is the same as a data structure (I don't mean a Java Collection, I mean a collection in the more general meaning). **An aggregate** is an object containing a collection or data structure, providing an interface to communicate with the inner data structure. For example, the object `someContainer`, which contains an inner `ArrayList`, is an aggregate because it contains a data structure, encapsulates it, and provides an interface to manipulate it. Is all of this accurate?
