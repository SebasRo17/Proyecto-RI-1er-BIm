I started with sftp, then switched to WebDAV and I'm currently using rsync through ssh to deploy any updates/upgrades from my development server into my production server. I'm still not very happy using this system and think using git to deploy may be better, mainly because of the possibility of rolling back any changes instantly with just one command. Appart from using ssh tunnel to pull and push to the production server (leaving the git service behind the firewall), I've also realized I have to edit .htaccess to deny web access to .git folder. Is this the correct approach, should I check anything else, do something in a different way, or should I go in a totally different direction?
