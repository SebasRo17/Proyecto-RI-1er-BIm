I have a stylesheet that works as expected in _Mathematica_ 8\. It does not work as expected in _Mathematica_ 9\. In the stylesheet I have set FontColor to `RGBColor[0.501961, 0, 0]` for ItemParagraph. DisplayFormula and InlineFormula have FontColor set to `Automatic` (I've also tried `Inherited`). When I press `Ctrl`+`(` to start a formula from within an ItemParagraph the color is the same as for my Text cell (black). The FontColor option for Text is Automatic. Interesting behavior. When I type `Esc``intt``Esc` the font color is `RGBColor[0.501961, 0, 0]` and it creates an inline formula region (or is it displayformula?). When I type `Ctrl`+`/` it creates an inline formula region but the color is black. I have both _Mathematica_ 8 and _Mathematica_ 9 installed and the behavior does not exist on _Mathematica_ 8.
