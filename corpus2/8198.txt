This is probably an easy question: I am exporting the results from a longer calculation into a dat-File, then I set the cell to non-evaluatable and put an Import in front, so I can later work with the results, even after closing and reopening the notebook:               results = Import["results.dat"]          (non-evaluatable) results = makeLongCalculation[parameters]     (non-evaluatable) Export["results.dat",results]          doSomethingwithResults[results]      (Is there a more elegant way?) Now, I have the problem that complex numbers are imported as strings. My results are typically of the form {{0.01,3*10^-6+5*10^-4*I},...}. Is there any more straightforward way than to apply something like ToExpression to the Import? I feel that native Mathemat
