I'm probably over-thinking this and it might not matter in the scope of things, but I'm wondering how people build up initial versions of their projects in source control? I'm talking about when you start with nothing but an idea, so no forking an existing project or anything.   * When do you do your commits before having an official or even unofficial version?   * At what point do you start branching for features, or do you this right away? I'm so used to working with existing code bases that I'm not really sure I know if there's a "best" way to build up a project history.
