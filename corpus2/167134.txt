I have been exploring Clojure for a while now, although I haven't used it on any nontrivial projects. Basically, I have just been getting comfortable with the syntax and some of the idioms. Coming from an OOP background, with Clojure being the first functional language that I have looked very much into, I'm naturally not as comfortable with the functional way of doing things. That said, are there any specific workflows or design patterns that are common with creating large functional applications? I'd really like to start using functional programming "for real", but I'm afraid that with my current lack of expertise, it would result in an epic fail. The "Gang of Four" is such a standard for OO programmers, but is there anything similar that is more directed at the functional paradigm? Most of the resources that I have found have great programming nuggets, but they don't step back to give a broader, more architectural look.
