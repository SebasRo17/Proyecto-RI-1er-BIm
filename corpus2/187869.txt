I'm writing a small utility in AutoIt that connects to Twitter. I would like to store the username and password in the programs setting file, but I know that it needs to be encrypted obviously. Previously when I've done this for personal use I've just adopted an `ini`format - written to a temporary file and then encrypted it using a rediculously long password and 256 bit AES encryption, just calling the file "settings.eini". However, I'm going to be offering this utility to the public. I don't expect a large amount of people to use it or for it to become a target, but I thought that it's best not to take chances. I've been reading about creating custom file extensions and it seems like something I want to avoid for now, so is there a standard/acceptable way of doing this?
