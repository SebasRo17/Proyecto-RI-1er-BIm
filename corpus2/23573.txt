I would like to plot the results of FindRoot over certain range of inputs. I tried to do this with the code:               Plot[Evaluate[FindRoot[f[m, b], {m, 1}][[1, 2]]], {b, 0,2}]      where I want to plot the roots of f[m,b] vs. b ranging over [0,2]. I'm not sure this code is working, because although I do get a plot, I also get this error: > FindRoot::nlnum: "The function value > {1.[VeryThinSpace]-(2.\Gamma[2.,0.,(1.[VeryThinSpace]+1. > b)/Sqrt[b]])/(1.[VeryThinSpace]+1.\b)}\n is not a list of numbers with > dimensions {1} at {m} = {1.`}." Note the function I'm trying to find the roots for is:               f[M_, b_] := 1 - (2 M Gamma[2, 0, (1/M + b M)/Sqrt[b]])/(1/M + b M)      Thanks!
