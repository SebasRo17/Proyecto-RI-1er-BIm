I've got an idea for a tiny utility program that seemingly nobody has thought of before. I've no idea what the demand for it would be, but I'm certain that it would be 0 if you had to pay for it. And I like opensource. :) That said, it'd still be nice to get a few euros for my effort. How can this be done? My first idea was to put some non-intrusive adverts in the program (somewhere in the side), but I can't find any advertising programs that would allow you to put adverts in Win32 applications. Google AdSense certainly forbids it. Of course, a "Donate" button is always useful, and I think I will make one, but I doubt that many people will want to donate anything anyway. Any other ideas?
