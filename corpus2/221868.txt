Many naming conventions recommend that methods returning a boolean (also called _predicate methods_ ) should be named after **a question**. My question is: don't they really mean the methods should be named after **an assertion**? The difference may be subtle, but you end up with different names in some cases:   * _question_ : is_pixel_transparent(...)   * _assertion_ : pixel_is_transparent(...) Sometimes, this makes no difference and the phrasing is the same:   * _question_ : end_of_file(...)    * _assertion_ : end_of_file(...) Besides, it seems like most of the time, what people call "questions" are actually _assertions_.   * key_exists(...) --> this is not a question, this is an assertion.    Example usage: if (key_exists(...)) ...   * array_contains_element(...) --> this is not a question, this is an assertion.    Example usage: if (array_contains_element(...)) ... So, to restate the question, is everyone meaning _assertion_ when they say _question_?
