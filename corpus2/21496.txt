Following the document, I generate a curve arrow tube using following code:               arrowtube =       With[{ra = .1, arhd = .25},        Graphics3D[{Arrowheads[arhd],          Arrow[Tube[           BSplineCurve[Table[{Cos[t], Sin[t], 0}, {t, 0, 3 Pi/2, Pi/10}]],            ra]]}, Boxed -> False, ViewPoint -> {1, 1, 1},         ImageSize -> {100, Automatic}, Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True}]]      and it gives me ![curve arrow tube](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOkkh.png) It seems that the arrow doesn't align with the curved path. How can I fix this?
