I am new to _Mathematica_ , and I find that there may be a lot of ways of doing this. I was wondering which one might be the most general. I am importing data from `.txt` files, resulting in a ragged array due to many lines containing parameters and other comments which I want to ignore. I just want to import the numbers, and ignore the comments. I am using this:               Import["filename.txt", "TSV", "HeaderLines" -> 15]      I have no TrailerLines that I need to skip, however, there are many rows halfway through the data which I would like to remove. These lines all start with `#`, which makes me think that there is a way to just specify that any line starting with `#` be skipped. Thanks a lot in advance to anyone who might be able to help me with this.
