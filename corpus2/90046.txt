Does anyone know of a template / checklist that can be used to conduct a software health check. My team supports a number of legacy applications and we have been asked to present a score card to senior management on the health of the applications. The template would be used to:   * Identify you have performance or stability issues that may cause production outages, delays or financial impacts.   * Identify data, authorization or authentication security holes / shortcomings in the application / service.   * Identify the backup, disaster recovery and business continuity compliance of the application / service.   * Identify the compliance of the application / service to a reference architecture or predefined set of technical standards.   * Identify the current and required monitoring and alerting of the application / service.   * Identify the level of transaction support and potential for data corruption or error of the application / service.   * Identify licensing concerns of the application / service.   * Identify the minimum hardware requirements of the application / service.   * Identify the technology, vendor support and community support for the application / service.   * Provide a recommendation on all findings. A quick search on Google didnt seem to realize anything useful, other than this template to purchase http://www.it- checklists.com/application_health_check_toc.html
