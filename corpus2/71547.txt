Do you believe there is a gap between computer science research and software engineering problems? For example, do software engineers ever have to worry about "factoring and graph isomorphism" or some complex computer science problems if they have to....say build a shopping cart website? Probably not. And if there is a disconnect between computer science and the engineers that build applications? Is that the way that engineering and science should exist? Will engineers dive through years and years of research papers to solve a particular problem that they have? Edit-1: After thinking about it, general science probably has the same problem. I am sure there are top chemists working at companies like McDonald's and Taco Bell that are tasked with making a better, easier to manufacture burger.
