Both in _Code Complete_ by Steve McConnell and _The Pragmatic Programmer_ by Andrew Hunt & David Thomas, they allege that most programmers don't read programming-related books as a habit, or at least not often enough. Does this still hold? Are programmers who do read such books still rare? I must admit that only quite recently did I start reading (and now I can't stop; it's burning a whole in my wallet!). Before I was actually against it and argued that it's better to write programs than to waste time reading about it. Now I realize that the best outcome, for me at least, is to do both. **EDIT:** I actually meant _any_ kind of books that on way or another was related to programming; be it either on a particular language, technology, pattern, paradigm - _anything_ as long as it may benefit you as a programmer. I was just referring to _Code Complete_ and _The Pragmatic Programmer_ because that's where I read that programmers don't usually read such books. It would have looked stranged if the title just read "Are programmers who read books still rare?"
