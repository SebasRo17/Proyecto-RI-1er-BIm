I can't seem to use `FindMinValue` to find the min. value of a curve represented by an interpolating function. For instance the below code generates an interpolating function polynomial as the solution of the heat equation.               tsol = u /.        NDSolve[{D[u[t, x], t] == D[u[t, x], x, x], u[0, x] == 0,           u[t, 0] == Sin[t], u[t, 5] == 0}, u, {t, 0, 10}, {x, 0, 5}][[1]]      This plots it:               Plot3D[Evaluate[u[t, x] /. %], {t, 0, 10}, {x, 0, 5},       PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yfXqT.png) I'd like to find the minimum point in the curve represented by this function at say, `t=10.0`, , so I try doing this:               FindMinValue[tsol, {{x, 0, 5}, {t, 0, 10}}]      Which is obviously wrong. I'd like to find the minimum value AT t=10. This didn't work either:               FindMinValue[tsol[10, x], {x, 0, 5}]      I actually have an interpolating func. which is in `x` `y` and `t` and I am quite flabbergasted. Why is the Dimensions of `tsol` 5? I thought it'd be 2 since it is only in x and t. Plot of tsol[10,x]: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YA3BV.png)
