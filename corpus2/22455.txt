I am using _Mathematica_ 9.0.0.0 under German Windows 32bit. I am on trying to export and import German text to PDF and re-import it. It seems that there is a confusion about the character encoding. It obviously differs between `Export` and `Import`. However, nothing related to the encoding is described in the PDF documentation, nor does specifying `CharacterEncoding` in PDF import and export seem to make any difference.               ImportString[ExportString[       "This is a string. Aber was ist mit äöü, ß und ÄÖÜ? Also x\.b2 und \y\.b3 measured in µm",       "PDF"]]      I wonder if there is a work-around which doesn't require a complete re- mapping. PDF export is slow, and doing it character by character will probably take hours.
