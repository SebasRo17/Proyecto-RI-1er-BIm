I am starting an Internet business. Basically the most important part, the part that is making me actual money is still missing. I tried to deal with those issues several times but I always get distracted by other things. This is a typical example of not rising to a challenge. I thought about hiring a programmer to continue my coding but I came up with two problems:   1. When revealing my current code the programmer could just run the business on his own. How do I choose someone who won't do that?   2. Which way of payment is appropriate for the programmer in this situation? Per hour? How do I figure out the right amount? The code to be written will be in PHP + MySQL.
