I have noticed that this is a frequent issue among _younglings_ from technical areas such as ours. In the beginning of our careers we simply don't know how to sell ourselves to our employers, and random guy #57 (who is a programmer, but not as good as you - technically) ends up getting a raise or a promotion because he knows how to communicate and market himself better than you. Many have probably seen this happen in the past, and most certainly many more will in the future. What kind of skill/ability (either technical, or of other nature) do you think is relevant to point out when doing a job interview or asking for a raise, besides listing all the programming languages and libraries you know?
