I've been studying about recursive functions, and apparently, they're functions that call themselves, and don't use iterations/loops (otherwise it wouldn't be a recursive function). However, while surfing the web for examples (the 8-queens-recursive problem), I found this function:               private boolean placeQueen(int rows, int queens, int n) {         boolean result = false;         if (row < n) {             while ((queens[row] < n - 1) && !result) {                 queens[row]++;                 if (verify(row,queens,n)) {                     ok = placeQueen(row + 1,queens,n);                 }             }             if (!result) {                 queens[row] = -1;             }         }else{             result = true;         }         return result;     }      There is a `while` loop involved. ... so I'm a bit lost now. Can I use loops or not?
