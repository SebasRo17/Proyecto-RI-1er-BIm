I have a 2D parametric plot like the following:               ParametricPlot[       {Sin[t], Cos[t]}, {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]},       Frame -> True, AxesLabel -> {x, y}, AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[0.04], PlotRangePadding -> 0.2     ]      ![wrong labels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AYko2.jpg) But I would like the axes labels `x, y` to be positioned besides the arrowheads (i.e. `y` left of the vertical arrowhead and `x` just below the horizontal one). Since I can't use the frame as a replacement for the axes (as the axes are in the middle, not at the edge), I believe I cannot use the approach suggested in this question. How could I achieve this?
