Can anyone help me with fitting an implicit function to data? The function is given by:               a*x^2 + 2*b*x*y + c*y^2 = e      under the condition               a*c-b^2=1      something like a least square fit with $\chi^2$ value would be really nice. Unfortunately I have no idea how to do a fit with an only implicitly given function. I tried the solutions according to this thread How to use FindFit to fit an implicit function?, but i got the following errors:               pts = {{0.943851, 0.0255852}, {-2.23615, 0.0255852}, {2.12656, -0.0845208}, {2.32489, -0.0354676}, {-0.284106, -0.0354676}, {-2.64798, 0.0415494},{1.41402,0.0415494}, {-0.114051, 0.0669646}, {-2.99405,0.0669646}, {-3.92389,0.0825293}, {-0.273894,0.0825293}, {-2.66303, 0.0877706}, {-1.76303,0.0877706}}          fitfunc[a_, b_, d_, x_] := y /. Solve[a*x^2 + 2*b*x*y + (1 + b^2)/a*y^2 == d, {y},InverseFunctions -> True]     FindFit[pts, fitfunc[a, b, d, x], {a, b, d}, x]     FindFit::eqineq: Constraints in {(-a b x+Sqrt[a d+a b^2 d-a^2 x^2])/(1+b^2)} are not all equality or inequality constraints.
