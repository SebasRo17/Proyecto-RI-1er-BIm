I am a student in high school who has wanted to become a computer programmer since elementary school. There are not very many places that teach programming to people my age around where I live, so I am entirely self-taught using resources on the internet such as the MSDN. I have learned and become decent in QBASIC (which I know is very old, even when I learned it), C, C++, C# and have dipped my toes into Java. I get the basic idea behind OOP. I'm planning on going to college and getting a degree in computer sciences, and maybe computer engineering and electrical engineering while I'm at it, because the curriculums are supposedly extremely similar, according to a man I briefly met and talked to from a college. What should I know about computing/programming before going to college? Should I already know a whole lot, know a language or two proficiently, and have fairly high programming/computing skills, or do classes basically start from scratch?
