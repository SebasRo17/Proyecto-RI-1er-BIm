I was wondering if there is any command to get the mode of the probability distributions. Calculating manually, the mode is (alpha-1)/(alpha+beta-2) While the mean, median or variance of the beta dist can be found. For example, the mean can be found using this following command:               Mean[BetaDistribution[α, β]]      As suggested by @kguler , this command `ArgMax[PDF[BetaDistribution[2, 3], x], x]` works perfectly fine. However, when I changed the value of the parameters to something like thousands, the running process took a very long time. Is there any other command that will produce the results much faster? Cheers.
