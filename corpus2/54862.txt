Is there a command to insert an item into a list such that they form pairs? In other words to take               InsertObject[{a,b,c},d]      which will output               {{a,d},{b,d},{c,d}}    ?      This would be equivalent to the function,               Table[{{a,b,c}[[i]],d},{i,1,3}]      This way works just fine, but it doesn't seem to be the "Mathematica way" of doing things. Is there a built in command this?
