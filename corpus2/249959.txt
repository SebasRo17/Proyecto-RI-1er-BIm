I have a rather complex method which can get called in two possible "scenarios". One is a special case of the other in which all the nested `foreach` loops are only executed once and several `if` statements are false such that essentially only two lines of code nested deeply inside the method are actually executed. Now the question is: Should I provide a separate (simpler) code path for the special case even though the complex code handles that case just as well? I suppose the code would be more readable/understandable that way but I don't want to give the impression that the two cases are handled differently. Performance is not an issue here so the fact that a simpler code path might also execute faster is negligible. Example code:               foreach(...)     {         foreach(...)         {         ...             if(...)             {                 ...             }                  Something();         }     }      as compared to               if(SpecialCase)     {         Something();     }     else     {         foreach(...)         {             foreach(...)             {             ...                 if(...)                 {                     ...                 }                      Something();             }         }     }
