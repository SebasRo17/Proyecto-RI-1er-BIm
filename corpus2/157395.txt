I'm studying YAML as a replacement for XML, but I'm experiencing difficulties when dealing with elements containing free-flowing text with embedded elements. For instance, the following XML document:                   <text>         This is an example text, spanning multiple lines, and it has embedded elements         like <a p="value">this</a> and <b>this</b>.  There is also a list:              <quote>                 <text>The text of the quote, spanning multiple lines, and it has                 embedded elements like <c p="value">this</c> and <b>this</b></text>                 <author>The Author of this quote</author>             </quote>         Text continues here.         </text>      I don't know how to convert the embedded elements in YAML. My understanding is that the above XML document translates to something like this (except for the embedded elements):                   text: >                 This is an example text, spanning multiple lines, and it has embedded                 elements like <a p="value">this</a> and <b>this</b>.  There is also a                 list:                      quote:                         text: >                                  The text of the quote, spanning multiple lines,                                 and it has embedded elements like <c p="value">this</c>                                 and <b>this</b>                         author: The Author of this quote                 Text continues here.      Also, is indentation not needed in some places? Thank you.
