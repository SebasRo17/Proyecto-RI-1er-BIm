I want to plot two functions. Function G8 and G9. Both should be manipulable. Function G9 should dependent on Function G8. Function G8 has a bigger starting value. If function G8 increases by δ function G9 should also increase by δ. And I want to manipulate δ.               Manipulate[G8 := Plot[a, {x, 0, 8}];       G9 := Plot[d, {x, 0, 8}, PlotStyle -> Red];      Show[G8, G9],      {a, 4, 20, Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {d, a - δ, 20,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}, {δ, 1, 20, 0.1,        Appearance -> "Labeled"}]          Can anybody help me? Thak you!
