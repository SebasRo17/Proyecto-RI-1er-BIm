I was late in my signing up for classes at the start of last term, so I signed up for the only programming class I could find C++. After doing well in that class I was allowed into intermediate C#, which I learned was what I needed to be in for my major. I also took intermediate C++ thinking that taking both would make them both easier. I was right. I will be moving on to ASP.NET next term, and while I really like C++, I'm not sure that it will help me overall with my future education in C#. I also have the option to move into java, so I would be taking ASP.NET and java at the same time. So do I take C++, Java, both, or neither? and why?
