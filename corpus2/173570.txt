**Problem:** Fill all the cells using distinct numbers from <1,25> set, so that sum of two adjacent cells is a square number. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ejYiD.png) (source: http://grymat.im.pwr.wroc.pl/etap1/zad1etp1213.pdf; numbers 20 and 13 have been given) I've already solved this problem analytically and now I would like to approach it using an algorithm. **I would like to know how should I approach these kind of problems in general (not a solution, just a point for me to start).**
