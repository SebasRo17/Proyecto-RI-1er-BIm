Recently I was asked to show "a page with code" for a job interview. Being mainly a back-end programmer, and that's the position I applied for, I first said to the person I was talking to exactly that: PHP is executed at the server and therefore not visible by just giving a "page". However, following their desire, I sent links to the pages I've worked on before. Obviously they couldn't see anything except for the HTML, CSS, JS... They said it was not enough, they could not see the PHP. Understanding that they probably just wanted to know my skills and/or interest I sent them my Stack Overflow profile. Among all my questions and answers, most of them with code, certainly the PHP is there. But it seems this is not what they wanted. Well, I don't have any code put together that I can simply publish for someone to see. And I would never do it for the code I have deployed, obviously. So my question is/are: What does "send us a page with code" mean? What should I send? Is this a typical interview requirement?
