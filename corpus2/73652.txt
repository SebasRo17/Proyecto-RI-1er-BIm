After reading the Self-Paced Training kit **Microsoft Windows Applications Development with Microsoft .NET Framework 4** , I ran the Microsoft Press Training Kit Exam Prep. I would like to know if it sufficient to pass and manage the 70-511? **EDIT** Ok, I did not pass the Exam this morning. So I Disencourage people which want to pass a certification without a meaningful experience. For your information, here my result : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BmVEq.png) As we can see, I've failed in two exam objectives :   * "Building a User Interface by Using Basic Techniques" which covering these chapters :      * Choose the most appropriate control class     * Implement screen layout by using nested control hierarchies.     * Create and apply styles and theming.     * Manage reusable resources.     * Implement an animation in WPF.    * "Enhancing the Functionality and Usability of a Solution"      * Integrate WinForms and WPF within an application.     * Implement asynchronous processes and threading.     * Incorporate globalization and localization features.     * Implement drag and drop operations within and across applications.     * Implement security features of an application.     * Manage user and application settings.     * Implement dependency properties. I really don't understand why I've failed the first objectif. I think to know the fundamentals of WPF. One the other hand, I know why I've failed the second objectif exam : this is an aspect I don't masterize. This exam shows me my weakness. Now I will focus on them.
