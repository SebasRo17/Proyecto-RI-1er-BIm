Struggling to get a 3d cylinder to scale properly on a street map. I want to use the stacked cylinder as a custom pin.               mypin = Graphics3D[     Table[Cylinder[{{0, 0, h}, {0, 0, h + 0.95}}, 0.25], {h, 1, 19}],      ImageSize -> Automatic];          GeoGraphics[{GeoPosition[{51.5144, -0.08028}],      GeoMarker[GeoPosition[{51.5144, -0.08028}], mypin,      "Scale" -> Automatic, "Alignment" -> Bottom]},      GeoRange -> Quantity[0.05, "Miles"]]      I know automatic doesn't work on its own but I've been replacing it with various values and all that happens is the marker vanishes. I should add that the reason for doing this is that the cylinder represents a building of x floors, and once I get the cylinder scaled properly the intention is to use each cylinder to display various feature of the building. E.g. Red cylinder if a floor is over capacity, cylinder radius proportional to the number of desks it contains.
