In some computer master program online application, it says: > Please list the programming languages in which you have written programs. > For each language, indicate the length in lines of the longest working > program you have written in that language. You may approximate, but only > count those parts of the program that you wrote yourself.   1. I don't quite remember that, and I have never counted the lines of each program. Do programmers always know approximately how many lines in each of his programs, and keep record of them?   2. What is the relation between " lines of the longest working program " in a language and familiarity with it? Typically, how many lines will indicate the programmer being excellent, good, fair, or unfamiliar with the language? Is knowing "lines of the longest working program" really helpful?
