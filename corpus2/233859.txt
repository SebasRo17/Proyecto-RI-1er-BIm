I have N different ads that I want to display at the same time to M people in an automatic advertising system. Some people will never see some ads because they only check some specific criteria on the GUI, which are used like filters. Some ads will never be displayed at all, if nobody looks for them. The goal is to maximize the visibility of an ad to a maximum of people looking for specific criteria (filters) at the same time. The system refresh the ad every minute. Once the system choose the moment and the users who will see the ad, he stores the values in a queue (a database). I am looking for a solution to avoid starvation and deadlock. I mean, all ads corresponding to the criterias must be displayed, even if the waiting time is long. It can also be a typical scheduling algorithm corresponding to my problem.
