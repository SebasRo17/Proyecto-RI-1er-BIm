I'm new to OpenGL and found that there are a lot of libraries to do that in C, and I also found that glx is most friendly with Linux X Server, I just want to do basic stuff, and I cannot find any tutorials for GLX. Is GLX a bad thing? I just want to do some small graphical things without installing many libraries and getting confused. Can anyone suggest me something which has tutorials and simple to compile? I found a link with an example with GLX and it worked perfect with no errors: anyone please suggest where I can find nice documentation or any better libraries.
