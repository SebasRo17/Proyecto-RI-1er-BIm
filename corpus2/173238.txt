Working on a C# WinForms program that is written in a MVC ( actually Model- View-Presenter) style and I want to add a few lines of code that is responsible for logging some events. Where should I write two or three lines of code that I need? Should I write it in the Presenter section? To get an idea, here is some lines of sample code that already exists in the **_Save()_** metohd in **_Company.MyApplication.Presenter.MyPresenter.cs class:_** he has written codes lie the following in this part of presenter:               private void Save(Helper.SaveStatusEnum status)     {         if (notification.CheckLocks(orderIdCollection))         {             using (new HourglassController())             {                 controller.FireActiveCellLeaving();                 ViewDocumentedValues();                      int result = saveController.Save(status);                      if (result == Helper.SAVE_SUCCESSFUL)                 {                     //  IS IT OK TO WRITE MY COUPLE LINES OF CODE IN HERE???????????                     model.Dirty = false;                          if ((model.CurrentStatus == Helper.OrderStatusEnum.Complete) || (model.CurrentStatus == Helper.OrderStatusEnum.Corrected))                     {                         controller.EnableDisableSheet(false);                     }                          CheckApplicationState();                     SheetHelper.ClearUnsavedDataRowImage(view.ActiveSheet);                 }                 else                 {                     MessageBox.Show("An unexpected error occuring trying to save.");                 }             }         }     }
