While browsing the MSDN documentation for the .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) I've always been amazed by how **consistent** and fully documented it is. It's a constant companion when developing .NET applications. Most doubts that arise when using the APIs are covered. The contrast with e.g. the older Win32 documentation is striking. Some examples:   * Documentation for properties always starts out with either _"Gets"_ or _"Gets or sets"_ to specify accessors.   * Type parameters start out with: _"The type of ..."_. Does Microsoft use a documentation convention which is followed for the FCL? If so, is this convention publicly available for me to use as well?
