We have the following SVN structure.   * Projects: Our work   * Clients: Projects for clients, needs to be different   * Shared: Shared libraries we created   * Docs: Documents explaining how software development flows within the company (has nothing to do with my question anyway) Where should we put the external libraries? Let's say from opensource projects etc. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dYENF.png)
