The other day I was reading a little about Unit Testing and I saw some examples where people create a repository interface (i.e. `IExampleRepository`) and then create the real repository (`public class ExampleRepository : IExampleRepository`) and a repository to be used for unit testing (`FakeExampleRepository : IExampleRepository`). In the `IExampleRepository` they were implementing the same methods as in the `ExampleRepository`, however with different Linq queries. What is exactly the objective here? I thought one part of unit testing your code is make sure that a method works correctly? But when I use two totally different queries, one for 'real' and one in the test, how much sense does the test make?
