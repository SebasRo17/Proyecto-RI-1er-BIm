This question is inspired by this question: How to convert the symbol $d$ in Integrate into $\mathrm{d}$?. Although it’s not a big problem, the `TeXForm` can be modified manually to “standard” form, I’m curious why _Mathematica_ ’s `TeXForm` won’t change the differential d to $\mathrm{d}$ automatically. There are some detailed situations to pay attention to.   * The integrand or the integration argument may contain some variables having letter “d”(Such as: det, adcda, etc.) or even “d” itself.(Although it’s ugly to do so.)   * Mathematica will automatically change alpha to $\alpha$.   * Single-character symbol names are given in _italic_ font, while multiple character names are given in roman font. I’ve written some lines of codes to do this. But I think the code is ugly and can’t handle the situation with integration argument’s name exactly “d”. Here is my code.               cTeXForm[expr_, arg__] := Module[{       (*temp saves the original TeXForm*)       temp = ToString@TeXForm@HoldForm[Integrate[expr, arg]],      (*var saves the integration argument and reverse the order to keep up with the integral symbol*)       var = ToString /@ TeXForm /@ Reverse@(Flatten /@ ({#} & /@ {arg}))[[;; , 1]], pos, range, betweenQ, loc},       (*locate the position of differential d*)       pos = StringPosition[temp, "d"][[;; , 1]];       range = StringPosition[temp, var];       betweenQ[n_] := Catch@(Scan[If[#[[1]] <= n <= #[[2]], Throw[0], n] &, range];Throw[1]);       loc = {#, #} & /@        Pick[pos, betweenQ[#] & /@ pos, 1][[-Length@var ;; -1]] ;       (*replace and output*)       CopyToClipboard@OutputForm@StringReplacePart[temp, "\\mathrm{d}", loc]]      Here is the test (although no beautiful):               cTeXForm[x^2 alpha d baded, {x, 1, 2}, {alpha, 2, 3},baded]      And here is the output of my code $$\int _1^2\int _2^3\int \alpha \text{baded} d x^2\mathrm{d}\text{baded}\mathrm{d}\alpha \mathrm{d}x$$ So the question is how to **precisely** change the differential d to $\mathrm{d}$? Are there any other ways to do this? (`RegularExpression`, rule- based replacement etc. I’m not familiar with these.) Any advice about the string manipulation or using `TeXForm` is welcomed.
