I am working with an array of data that may look something like this.               data={{0.,1.,0.,1.,1.,1.,1.,1.,1.,1.,0.,0.,0.,0.,1.,1.,1.,0.,1.,1.},{1.,1.,1.,0.,1.,0.,0.,0.,1.,1.,1.,1.,0.,1.,1.,1.,1.,0.,0.,0.}}      I want to replace any sequence of ones that exceeds two in a row with the same number of zeros in order to maintain the original dimensions of the array. I came up with the following to try to do this.               data /. {x__, PatternSequence[Repeated[1., {2}]], y__} -> {x}~Join~Table[0., {i, 2}]~Join~{y}          {{0.,1.,0.,0.,0.,1.,1.,1.,1.,1.,0.,0.,0.,0.,1.,1.,1.,0.,1.,1.},{1.,0.,0.,0.,1.,0.,0.,0.,1.,1.,1.,1.,0.,1.,1.,1.,1.,0.,0.,0.}}      Unfortunately, it only replaces the first two ones in a sequence with zeros and leaves the rest. That's not exactly what I was aiming for.
