I've read that I should avoid the postfix increment operator because of performance reasons (in certain cases). But doesn't this affect code readability? In my opinion:               for(int i = 0; i < 42; i++);         /* i will never equal 42! */      Looks better than:               for(int i = 0; i < 42; ++i);         /* i will never equal 42! */      But this is probably just out of habit. Admittedly, I haven't seen many use `++i`. Is the performance that bad to sacrifice readability, in this case? Or am I just blind, and `++i` is more readable than `i++`?
