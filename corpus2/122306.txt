I would like to put a program together to calculate the number of 60' pieces would be needed from a list of shorter pieces. For example, I sell rebar cut to length from our standard length of 60'-0". Now the length the customer requires are as follows:               343 pc @ 12.5'     35 pc @ 13'     10 pc @ 15'     63 pc @ 15.5'.......      There are 56 total lengths ranging from 12.5' to 30.58' The idea is to limit the amount of waste from the 60' piece. The input from the user would be:   * number of differnt lengths   * Length of piece to cut from    * count of different lengths The result would be the number of prime pieces needed to fulfill the order. What well-known algorithms exist that could help me solve this problem?
