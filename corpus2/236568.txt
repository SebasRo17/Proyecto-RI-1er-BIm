Or rather, practically _applying_ PRIMES in P. I've heard a lot about "PRIMES in P", or the "AKS algorithm". It is, to oversimplify slightly, a very fast way of finding prime numbers. However, while I've tried reading the original paper (the revised "V3" seems to have vanished from the internet), it's a bit above my comprehension. I've also tried using Google to find practical implementations of the algorithm, but they too are incomprehensible (which is to say, they're all written in comment-free C++). Can someone produce a hobbyist/freshman-level explanation of how to implement the AKS algorithm? Or am I misinterpreting exactly what it it does and is for?
