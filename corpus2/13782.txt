I've worked at two companies, who each had a different methodology when it came to code reviews: In the first company, a code review was conducted by the team leaders and was required after the completion of every module. However, in the second company, team leaders weren't required to conduct any code reviews, and just checked for functionality and design issues. So I am confused. Is the code review process really needed? If it is, why? And if it isn't, why not?
