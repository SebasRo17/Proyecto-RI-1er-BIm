What's the difference between the two UpdateSubject methods below? I felt using static methods is better if you just want to operate on the entities. In which situations should I go with non-static methods?               public class Subject     {         public int Id {get; set;}         public string Name { get; set; }              public static bool UpdateSubject(Subject subject)         {             //Do something and return result             return true;         }         public bool UpdateSubject()         {             //Do something on 'this' and return result             return true;         }     }      I know I will be getting many kicks from the community for this really annoying question but I could not stop myself asking it. Does this become impractical when dealing with inheritance? Update:   Its happening at our work place now. We are working on a 6 month asp.net web application with 5 developers. Our architect decided we use all static methods for all APIs. His reasoning being static methods are light weight and it benefits web applications by keeping server load down.
