Some time ago I read a kind of "rule of thumb" about the concreteness of method parameter types, return types and property types, but I just do not remember it. It said something about keep your return types as concrete as possible and your parameter types as abstract as possible... or vice versa. I don't know if it was actually a good or bad advice, so if you have your own thoughts about it, please let a comment. Cheers.
