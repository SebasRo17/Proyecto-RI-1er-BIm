I need your help how to implement it nice and well. It's quite a simple problem. I can solve it but I need help on how to do that better. My class has logic working using three parameters. It gets them from another class. The problem is:   1. the first parameter is enum (it's required)   2. the second parameter is another enum (it's optional - there is possibility that this parameter doesn't exist)   3. the third parameter is vector of other enums (it's optional - there is possibility that this parameter doesn't exist). How to handle these parameters to my class? Any ideas? I'd like to get these parameters in one method, e.g. `updateParameters(...)`. Maybe I should have overloaded methods for every possibility, but it's not nice I guess. I can't get some container with parameters because I have different types.
