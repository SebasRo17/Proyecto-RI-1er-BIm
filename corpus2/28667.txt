Assume $\dot x(t)=v(x,t)$ is a $T$-periodic, with respect to $t$ dynamical system. That is $x\in\mathbb R^n,\quad t\in\mathbb R,\qquad v(x,t+T)=v(x,t)$. Let $x_0$ be a periodic solution, and in elementary functions. Assume if you must that $x_0$ is as smooth as you need. How can one use Mathematica to compute symbolically a fundamental matrix for the linearised around $x_0$ system and its monodromy matrix? Any help would be appreciated.
