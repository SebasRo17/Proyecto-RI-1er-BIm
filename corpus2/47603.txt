I have a graph `WS = RandomGraph[WattsStrogatzGraphDistribution[n, p, k]]`. I need to plot several characteristics of each `v`: the clustering coefficient, number of triples at `v`, eccentricity, vertex centrality, closeness, and betweenness. I'm relatively inexperienced with Mathematica and quite lost on how to achieve this. I don't expect the exact lines of the solution, I'd just like some pointers on how to approach this. First of all, how do I get a set of all the vertices of `WS`? Then, how do I get the values of the different measures for each `v` in `WS`?
