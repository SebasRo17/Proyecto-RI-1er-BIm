I am using the free version of Google Sketchup and I've got a few designs in hand, which I need to be able to import into Mathematica. I saw the similar question asked by @Sjoerd C. de Vries in Stack Overflow, but I didn't find any answer that was simple and allows for complete communication of the information in the skp file to Mathematica. I am asking this question hoping that there has been some progress made in this regard as the previous question was asked in June, 2011.
