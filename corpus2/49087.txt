I have a problem with finding the function that gives the boundary curve in `RegionPlot` comamnd. I use the following code to make the regions in which two inequalities are held simultaneously               RegionPlot[{{x^3 - y^2 > 2 y && x^2 + y^3 > 2 x },                  {x^3 - y^2 < 2 y && x^2 + y^3 > 2 x }}, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, .1},                 PlotStyle -> {Green, Yellow}, BoundaryStyle -> {Black, Thick}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/s7XLJ.jpg) Here we see a black thick curve between the green and yellow regions, I mean the boundary that separates these regions (I showed it with a red arrow) . Now, how can I find its equation or at least the list of points living on this curve?
