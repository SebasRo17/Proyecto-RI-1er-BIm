In version 10.0, _Mathematica_ introduced a new function about region plotting: ImplicitRegion. But I'm wondered that haven't this function been already existed in the older version? That is, RegionPlot. I truly can't see the difference. Another question is, in version 10, _Mathematica_ also introduced a function called `ParametricRegion`, my question is the same again: isn't it equivalent to the third usage of `ParametricPlot`? PS: I found a little bit difference is that `ParametricRegion`(new function in ver. 10) have the ability to constrain the parameters in more specific way(not just required to be `{u,u_min,u_max}, {v,v_min,v_max}`, but also `{1 <= u <= 5, 3 <= v <= 10, u+v < 7.5}`), but it can seemingly be done by option `RegionFunction` in the older version!
