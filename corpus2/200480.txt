I've seen plenty of questions asking if _listening_ to music boosts productivity, etc. but I haven't been able to find one about _performing_ music. Learning to play the piano has been on my to-do list for a while, partly because I have a sneaky suspicion that learning to deal with the relationships, recursions, etc. inherent in music will make me a better programmer (plus it looks fun). Does anyone know of any research on, or have first-hand experience with, learning a musical instrument having any sort of noticeable effect on one's programming or mathematical ability? Most of what I've been able to find seems to be interested in the effects of learning music at a very young age on boosting overall mental ability. I would also be interested in the other direction, aka learning to program improving one's ability with an instrument.
