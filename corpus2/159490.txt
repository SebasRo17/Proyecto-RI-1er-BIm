One of the things I've noticed as a junior developer is that the people I respect and admire the most are those that can own up to their mistakes and clearly/logically come up with a great way to resolve them. Frankly, I aspire to have that skill - but I don't already have it. With this in mind - what are some of the things you do when you make a mistake? How do you communicate with your manager or user base and do you have any particular points to make the process of resolving the issue go easier for all involved?
