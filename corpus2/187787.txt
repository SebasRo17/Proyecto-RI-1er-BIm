I own and read 'Java Puzzlers', 'Clean Code' and GOF's 'Design Patterns' and more specific technology books however I have not yet read 'Effective Java'. Whenever I see a list of must read books I always see a copy a 'Effective Java' but I have put off buying it seeing as a learn to write Java book rather than a write better Java book. Is it still worth a read or even a purchase. What is special about this book that I am missing out on by not reading this. I know my design patterns and practice TDD and attempt to write clean code :), what will I gain from this book?
