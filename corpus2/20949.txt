In reference to this question, do you think that having a high reputation on this site will help to get a good job? Aside silly and humorous questions, on Programmers we can see a lot of high quality theory questions. I think that, _if_ Stack Overflow will eventually evolve in "strictly programming related" (which usually is "strictly _coding_ related"), the questions on Programmers will be much more interesting and meaningful ("Stack Overflow" = "I have this specific coding/implementation issue"; "Programmers" = "Best practices, team shaping, paradigms, CS theory"). So could high reputation on this site help (or at least be a good reference)? And then, more o less than Stack Overflow?
