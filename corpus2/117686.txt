In various languages (Java at least, think also C#?) you can do things like               if( condition )         singleStatement;          while( condition )         singleStatement;          for( var; condition; increment )         singleStatement;      So when I have just one statement, I don't need to add a new scope with `{ }`. Why can't I do this with try-catch?               try         singleStatement;     catch(Exception e)         singleStatement;      Is there something special about try-catch which requires always having a new scope or something? And if so, couldn't the compiler fix that?
