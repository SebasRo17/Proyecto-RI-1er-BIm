Where can I find fellow developers who are looking for help to create a startup? Are there any collaboration websites whereby people pitch ideas and a group of people 'join' the project in an effort to create some kind of prototype? **Edit:** @Vitor Braga - Seriously i'm not looking to make money, just finding developers who are interested in making a trivial little app with someone else. **Edit:** It may be worthy to explain that I live in a remote area of Australia.
