I have several sets of 5 polynomials of the form:               a0 = 0.00301472 - 0.0961879 beta - 0.860642 beta^2 - 4.73786 beta^3 -        0.00897697 z + 0.0389941 beta*z + 0.0131329 z^2 - 0.00552858 z^3      for a0,a1,...,a5, they form a vector A. My independent variables are `beta` and `z`. I want a Matrix Q of the coefficients, such that when I multiply it by a vector of the form:               B={1, beta, z, beta z, beta^2, z^2, beta^3, z^3}       like `A=Q.B` i recover my vector of polynomials. How do I get the matrix Q in the easiest way? I have many sets, so it would take me hours. I have been trying some solutions with `Coefficient[]`, but I am not fully satisfied. Thanks!
