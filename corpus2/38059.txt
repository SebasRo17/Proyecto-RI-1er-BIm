I'm a freelance solo web developer/designer/iPhone app maker by night (IT technician by day) and i'm interested in developing a social network site to go public (like Facebook, fingers crossed for half a billion users). But i'm concerned that i'm not going to manage this on my own, being only able to dedicate weekends/evenings to it. I would class my self as an intermediate web dev but by no means have i written something as large scale as an online community. When does a project become too big for one person and when do you bite the bullet and hire someone/team up with another web dev?
