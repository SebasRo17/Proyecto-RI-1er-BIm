We have a scenario where we have multiple WCF services hosted on the same server connecting to same database. But currently they all have their separate web.config files. So each time there is some change or new deployment to another server, each and every web.config needs to be changed. Is there a way we can have a single configuration (be it on a file or in memory/db) which can be shared among all the services on any given server? If so what would that be? If not, why not? If we shouldn't go for this approach, why not? Currently we have such a hierarchy (Folder structure)   * Services      * Service1     * Service2 ... ...     * ServiceN
