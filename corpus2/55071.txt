I've upgraded my home installation of _Mathematica_ from version 9 to 10 today on a Windows 8.1 machine, and I'm getting a weird font issue - the fonts are not anti-aliased, and look unbalanced and weird. Just look: > ![HALP](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cnuXE.png) For comparison, here what it looks on Linux with _Mathematica_ V10 > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qf6kO.png) At this point you may object, as these issues are too minor to get worked up about. But neither I nor my otherwise benign OCD can work like this. Any ideas? **EDIT** I've just had an idea, that maybe I need to manually remove old fonts leftover from the old _Mathematica_ 9 installation. I've read somewhere that they were not going to pollute the main font catalog with symbol fonts in the next release, and maybe the new _Mathematica_ is using old fonts for some reason. I can't test it right now myself, unfortunately.
