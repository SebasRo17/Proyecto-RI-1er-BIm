I've been studying http://www.vagrantup.com/ for several days and I'd like a feedback by people using it in a professional context or for personal projects. I think I get what positive things can bring Vagrant but I have questions about its drawbacks:   * I'm a php developer and I work in a small company. I'm wondering if Vagrant could be useful for me and newcomers in my company since it's forcing a total development environment. I mean, people often prefers to work on their OS (Linux/Mac/Windows). How do you deal with that, do you force everyone to use Linux for example?   * Doesn't it add complexity since you are entirely working on a Virtual Machine?   * Don't you fear your VM main file get corrupted one day and you wouldn't be able to use it again? I feel nervous about using VM because of that. Thank you.
