Im Trying to model a cloud of point masses that act according to gravity, what im strugeling with is the exclusion of cases where euclidian distance = 0, If I try to do it with an If statement in my forces function, NDsolve complains about too many dependant variables I think, but I think its rather a fault in my usage/understanding of NDsolve Any help is appreciated edit: im aware that the equations arent yet in working order               n = 20;     g = 1;     pos = RandomReal[{-10, 10}, {n, 3}];     masses = RandomReal[{1, 50}, n];     Tmax = 20;          Forces[xp_, yp_, zp_] :=       Sum[       masses[[i]]/        EuclideanDistance[{xp, yp, zp}, {x[i][t], y[i][t], z[i][t]}]^2       , {i, 1, n}]          Graphics3D[      Table[       Sphere[pos[[i]], ((masses[[i]]*4)/(3*Pi))^(1/3)/5]       , {i, 1, n}]      , PlotRange -> 11.5]          sol = NDSolve[       Flatten@Table[         {          (x[i])''[t] == Forces[x[i][t], y[i][t], z[i][t]][[1]]/masses[[i]],          (y[i])''[t] == Forces[x[i][t], y[i][t], z[i][t]][[2]]/masses[[i]],          (z[i])''[t] == Forces[x[i][t], y[i][t], z[i][t]][[3]]/masses[[i]],          (x[i])'[0] == 0,          (y[i])'[0] == 0,          (z[i])'[0] == 0,          x[i][0] == pos[[i, 1]],          y[i][0] == pos[[i, 2]],          z[i][0] == pos[[i, 3]]          }         , {i, 1, n}]       ,       Flatten@Table[         {          x[i][t], y[i][t], z[i][t]          }         , {i, 1, n}]       , {t, 0, Tmax}]
