> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Should I use switch statements or long ifâ€¦else chains? I'm working on a small program that will conduct an Insertion Sort. A number will be inputted through the keyboard and stored in a variable I called "num." I've decided to use a switch statement in order to obtain the number inputted.               switch( e.getKeyCode() ) {              case KeyEvent.VK_0: num = 0; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_1: num = 1; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_2: num = 2; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_3: num = 3; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_4: num = 4; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_5: num = 5; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_6: num = 6; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_7: num = 7; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_8: num = 8; break;         case KeyEvent.VK_9: num = 9; break;     }      I realized one other course of action could have been to use a set of if statements.               if( e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_0 )         num = 0;     else if( e.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_1 )         num = 1;     etc. for every number up until 9.      I then wondered what the essential difference is between a switch statement and a series of if statements. I know it saves space and time to write, but it's not that much. So, my question is, aside from the space, does a switch statement differ from a series of if statments in any way? Is it faster, less error-prone, etc.? This question really doesn't affect my code that much. I was just wondering. Also, this question pertains to the JAVA language, not any other programming language.
