As C# has progressed, many language features have been added. It has come to the point where it's becoming unreadable for me. As an example, consider the following code snip from Caliburn.Micro code here:                           container = CompositionHost.Initialize(                        new AggregateCatalog(                           AssemblySource.Instance.                                  Select(x => new AssemblyCatalog(x))                                    .OfType<ComposablePartCatalog>()                     )                 );      Now, this is just a small example. I have a number of questions:   * Is this a common or known problem?    * Is the C# community finding the same?    * Is this an issue with the language, or is it the style used by the developer? Are there any simple solutions to better understand others code and avoid writing code in this way?
