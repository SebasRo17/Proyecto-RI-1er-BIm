I have been seeing two implementations for syncing data between the server and the client on majority of the apps. This assumes no GCM is set up:-   1. Running an intent service periodically which downloads the data from the network and stores in the database.   2. Implementing a Sync Adapter which runs periodically. Which of the above would you recommend to have in your app and why?
