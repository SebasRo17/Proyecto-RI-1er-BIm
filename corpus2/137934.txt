I have been programming for 2 years in python, Java and C#. I have developed two programs that is being used by a IT-company I worked for and use programming/a programmers mind to solve almost every problem I counter. But still I feel I am missing something in my curriculum (selftaught mostly). When programming I usally do the most often mistake of never changing my solutions to problems in my code. Because I dont know the lowest principals in programming. I often give up on new projects I start because of this. I see codes from others and I shiver when I think back to my code afterwards. What are the basics in programming? How can I learn this? And which principals in programming is the building blocks to actually become a better programmer?
