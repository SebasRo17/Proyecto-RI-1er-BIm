I'm working in a REST JavaScript client, and I'm trying to follow the MVC pattern, but a very basic question came to my mind: who should make the http request and load the data into the model? My intuition tells me that the controller should do it, but in lots of examples (the ember.js documentation, by example) it's done by the model, with a find() method. But other frameworks, like Django, do it in the controller. What do you think it's the better way to do this?
