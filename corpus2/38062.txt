In the documentation of `FilledCurve`, one can create a circle "cut-out" of a bigger circle using `FilledCurve` and `Beziercurve`. Is it also possible using two `Circle` commands and some Boolean operator, as can be done with Adobe Illustrator using the Pathfinder commands? Does some counterpart exist in _Mathematica_? Edit: As asked in the comments: there exist a few Pathfinder operations, the most kwown are   * Add two graphics   * Substract one graphic from the oterh   * Union of two graphics   * "Exclusive" union of two graphics (without intersection)   * Intersection of two graphics Thanks for all inputs!
