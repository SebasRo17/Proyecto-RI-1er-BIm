Does anybody know why was Scala implemented in Java and .NET instead of C or C++? Most languages are implemented with Cor C++ [i.e Erlang, Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl]. What are the advantages for Scala implemented in Java and .NET other than giving access to Java and .NET libraries? **UPDATE** Wouldn't Scala gain more benefit if it were implemented in C because it can be tuned better rather than relying on JVM?
