In a NETLink application I checked all the types offered by `LoadedNETTypes[]` according to the following:               tt1 = NETTypeInfo["Wolfram.NETLink.DynamicDLLNamespace.DLLWrapper1",   "Methods", "DRV_AOVoltageOut"]          tt2 = NETTypeInfo["Wolfram.NETLink.DynamicDLLNamespace.DLLWrapper2",   "Methods", "DRV_AOVoltageOut"]      `tt1` offer `Null` response but `tt2` offer the non-null response below: â€¢ Methods (matching string pattern DRV_AOVoltageOut) static short DRV_AOVoltageOut(int DriverHandle, Wolfram.NETLink.DynamicDLLNamespace.DLLWrapper2+PT_AOVoltageOut IntPtr) My question is how to distinct between tt1 and tt2, because I obtain tt1==tt2 although they are obviously different?
