Suppose that I have the following list, called `list`. `list` contains elements `X`, `X1`, `X2`, and `X3`:               list = {X, {X1, X2, X3}}      I would like a function that operates on `list` and gives the following output list:               {{X, X1}, {X, X2}, {X, X3}}      Is there a simple way to accomplish this with `Thread`, `MapThread`, `Inner`, `Through`, or the like? I feel like this should be simple, but I am having a lot of trouble coming up with a simple solution. So far, I have only been able to come up with rather complicated solutions, such as               Transpose[{Table[#[[1]], {Length[#[[2]]]}], #[[2]]}] &@list      > {{X, X1}, {X, X2}, {X, X3}}
