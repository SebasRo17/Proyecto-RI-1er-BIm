I having trouble with this equation: $$ -\frac{(2 m \text{U0}) \Psi (\rho ,z) \left(1-e^{-\text{} \left(\frac{z}{d}\right)^2-\left(\frac{2 \rho -(r+R)}{R-r}\right)^2}\right)}{h^2}+\frac{\partial ^2\Psi (\rho ,z)}{\partial z\, \partial z}+k^2 \Psi (\rho ,z)+\frac{\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial \rho } \frac{\partial \Psi (\rho ,z)}{\partial \rho }}{\rho }=0 $$ I need to solve it with several conditions: $\Psi$ has to tend to the zero at infinity, and it has to be bounded in the whole area greater than zero (including zero). I'm trying to use `NDSolveValue` to solve this equation numerically, but I don't know how to set up the conditions. Help me please. Here's code:               NDSolveValue[{k^2*Ψ[ρ, z] - (2*(1 - e^(-(z^2/d^2) -     (-r - R + 2*ρ)^2/(-r + R)^2))*m*U0*Ψ[ρ, z])/h^2 +     Derivative[0, 2][Ψ][ρ, z] + Derivative[1, 0][Ψ][ρ, z]/ρ == 0},     Ψ, {z, 0, 5}, {ρ, 0, 5}]
