I am trying to better my understanding of polymorphism. Say I have a base class called `baseClass` with one method called `foo()` and I have three derived classes called `derived1` , `derived2` and `derived3` which all override the and implement their own versions of the `foo()` method. If I have an array of `baseClass` objects can it contain objects that are derived from that base class like so:               baseClassArray: [ derivedObj1, derivedObj2, derivedObj3];      Also if I pull an object out of this array and called the `foo()` method would it call the method defined in baseClass or the method defined in the respective derived class? Or does this depend on the programming language this is implemented in?
