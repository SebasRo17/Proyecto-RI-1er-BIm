I am not sure what exactly I am looking for here, but here are the facts: I will be offering a free to use software, free as in $0 cost only(not OSS). I need a piece of text included in the installer with agree/disagree, that would protect my rights. Specifically that I don't guarantee anything and shouldn't be held liable for their losses that the software might cause. I want to allow them to use the software for anything they like, but not allow to redistribute, sell, or reverse engineer it. I am not even sure whether this text is technically a license, disclaimer, or end user license agreement. I doubt there is a ready to go template for what I am looking for, but any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
