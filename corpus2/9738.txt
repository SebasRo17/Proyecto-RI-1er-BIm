I have a system of two equations in two variables $x$ and $y$. $$\begin{align} F_1(a,b,c,d,e)x+F_2(a,b,c,d,e)y+F_3(a,b,c,d,e)&=0\\\ G_1(a,b,c,d,e)x+G_2(a,b,c,d,e)y+G_3(a,b,c,d,e)&=0 \end{align}$$ I am pretty sure that they have a unique solution but I don't have a proof. The thing is that the coefficients are gigantic and _Mathematica_ is taking forever to do a `Solve`. My guess is that it is checking to see if the system is not indeterminate or something. Is there any way I can stop _Mathematica_ from doing that and just solve it. I suppose I can suck it up and solve it by hand. I wanted to post the exact system but copy and paste is not working, I guess because it's too large. Each coefficient has maybe a hundred expressions in different combinations of about 10 variables. I need these expressions later when I will evaluate, plot, etc.
