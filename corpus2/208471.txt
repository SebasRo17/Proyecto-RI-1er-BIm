I am trying to setup a small data-logging application under linux. The data arrives via serial port, and from there it should be pumped to logging and to graphical display. The logging functionality is there for initialization purposes of the graphing functionality, after a reboot. The data arrives every second and is composed of 1 number of 5 decimal digit precision, and should be logged for 2 years. My current free space is about 15GB. The languages of the project so far are bash and python. My objectives are to make simple but robust (maybe some live backups to a flash drive?) logging system, that is also fast and easy to read from python and write from bash. Is SQLite suitable for this (I have never used it)? Is a text file in my _home_ directory suitable for this?
