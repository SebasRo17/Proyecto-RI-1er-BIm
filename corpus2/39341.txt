I read several similar posts but I have not found a solution yet. However, I think that my problem should be quite easy. So here we are. Relations               Mt = M1 + M2;     x1 = -(M2/Mt)*R;     x2 = R*(1 - M2/Mt);     r1 = (x - x1)^2 + y^2;     r2 = (x - x2)^2 + y^2;     Ω = Sqrt[Mt/R^3];      * * *               V1 = -M1/(b1^2 + Sqrt[b1^2 + r1]);     V2 = -M2/(b2^2 + Sqrt[b2^2 + r2]);     Vt = V1 + V2;          Vx = D[Vt, x];     Vy = D[Vt, y];     Print["Vx = ", Simplify[Vx]]     Print["Vy = ", Simplify[Vy]]      My question is how to simplify the expressions `Vx` and `Vy`. Mathematica computes them correctly but I want to take into account the above relations, in other words, `Vx` and `Vy` should contain `Mt`, `r1`, `r2` and `Ω` in order to get the most simplified output. Any ideas? **EDIT** It seems that rules do not work in this case. For example if I set               rule1 = {Mt -> M1 + M2};      and apply it to `Vx`               Vx/.rule1      the output still contains `M1 + M2` instead of `Mt`. Same goes for `r1`, `r2` and omega.
