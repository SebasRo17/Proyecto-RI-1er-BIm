Alright people. Finally with the help of stackoverflow community i have gathered 20 commercial product selling websites product pages with the following features               Product URL     Product Price     Product Name     Product Category     Product Page Title     Product Page Description     Product Page Keywords      Now with using these features of the products i have to classify them. What does classification means ? Let me explain it. Now as you can imagine every website lists the products in their own ways. There is not format. So lets say iphone 4 is being sold at 20 different websites with 20 different way. So what i need to achieve is grouping the these 20 iphone page at 20 different websites. So when person query my website with iphone 4 word i will show that 20 results. Basically out of over 500.000 product urls i need to group every product. So lets say there are 15 gefore gtx 570 card out of these 500k urls so i need to group them as same product. You can imagine it as google products. But i am doing it at my own country which is Turkey and google does not have product search for Turkey. In short with using the features above what algorithm would you suggest. I don't want to use any training techniques if possible. Everything automated. I am using C# 4.0 WPF and data is stored at the MSSQL 2008 R2 database
