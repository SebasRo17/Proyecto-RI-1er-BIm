In _Mathematica_ , Ctrl+1 inserts a new picture. Using the drawing tool, we can draw many things. It seems to me that there is no way to control the drawing angle. So here are my questions:   1. How to draw a regular polygon quickly and accurately? (e.g. a hexagon)   2. How to draw a straight line with an accurate angle relative to the horizontal line? Or rotate an existing horizontal line for an angle (e.g. 60 degrees)?
