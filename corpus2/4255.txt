I have using Mathematica functions that takes a Cartesian coordinate relative to the Earth (xyz) and converts it to a latitude, longitude, and altitude (lla). And here it is:               xyz2lla = First@GeoPosition@GeoPositionXYZ[#, "WGS84"] &      I'm using it to convert a satellite viewing line (line of sight or los) from xyz to lla. For instance, if I have a satellite at the following observation point (obs, meters) looking in the direction of look:               obs = {2.560453600382259, 5.245110323032143, -3.819772142191310} 1*^6;     look = {-0.233218833096895, -0.814561997858160, -0.531128729720249};      It has the line of sight:               obs+d look      The transformation xyz2lla is smooth, so I was hoping to use function interpolation:               f = FunctionInterpolation[{xyz2lla[obs + # look]} &[d],                                {d, 2000000, 3700000}         ]      And while this works, and I get the following lat, lon, alt functions from it: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ualb4.png): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EQJ7u.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/95dPs.png) I also get the following errors that I'm wondering why I get:               GeoPositionXYZ::invcoord: "\!\(\"{2.560453600382259*^6 - 0.233218833096895*d, 5.245110323032143*^6 - 0.81456199785816*d, -3.81977214219131*^6 - 0.531128729720249*d}\"\) is not a valid coordinate specification."          Thread::tdlen: Objects of unequal length in {-212500.,-70833.3,70833.3,212500.}^{} cannot be combined. >>          Thread::tdlen: "Objects of unequal length in {12.2667 +3.14159\ I,11.1681 +3.14159\ I,11.1681,12.2667}\ {}\\n cannot be combined."          FunctionInterpolation::nreal: Near d = 2.2125`*^6, the function did not evaluate to a real number.      Does anyone have any insight into these errors? Also, how can I adjust the quality of the interpolation / how many points are investigated?
