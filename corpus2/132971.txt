I've implemented a generic factory as described here I need to register elements to the factory hard-code like this:               Factory.Register(1, typeof(MyClass));      this factory will have to be correlated with a simple domain data type table [id,Display], in this case id 1 is related to MyClass. I was thinking to add a column to that table with the qualified type, so I can simply retrieve the id to types. table will be [id,Display, typeName] and I will use the factory like this:               Factory.Register(id, Type.GetType(typeName));      I tried it and it's working ok. **is this a good design?** **are there any security flaws?** **is there a better way to do things?**
