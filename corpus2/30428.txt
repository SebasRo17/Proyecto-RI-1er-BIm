If I have an image `img`, and I ask `ComponentMeasurements` to return `"IntensityValues"` for the image:               m=MorphologicalComponents[Binarize[img]];     ivalues=ComponentMeasurements[{m,img},"IntensityData"];      How can I replicate the output of `ComponentMeasurements[{m,img},"IntensityCentroid"]`? The challenge I'm having is understanding how to interpret a calculated intensity centroid from `"IntensityValues"` in the context of larger image with the overlayed morphological component? Is it flipped or rotated? It would be fantastic to see an example going from the raw `"IntensityValues"` data to the output of `ComponentMeasurements[{m,img},"IntensityCentroid"]` for the same morphological component.
