In this plot the `Disk[]` markers are not colored according to the style of the line to which they belong:               SeedRandom[12]     data = Accumulate /@ RandomReal[3, {4, 10}] {1, 2, 3, 4};          ListLinePlot[data,       PlotMarkers -> Graphics[Disk[], ImageSize -> 13],       PlotLegends -> Automatic     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dmRVQ.png) Curiously, note that they are colored in the legend. How can I make the lines match the legend?
