I've been googling for a while and can't fathom why this doesn't exist yet. By a specification-code workflow I mean a system which links code to it's specification. For example I could be looking at a repository and highlight a specific revision and it would give me the related spec. I could also reverse this process and select a spec and it would show me all the related code changes and issues. I'm looking for this so I can mine a current system for ideas for my uni FYP of a software development suite harnessing existing systems.
