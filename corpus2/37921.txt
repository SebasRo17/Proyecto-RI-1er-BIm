I am new to using `DSolve`. In trying to solve a differential equation I was getting nonsense from _Mathematica_ , so I tried to solve an even easier equation $\frac{du}{dt}=u$, but still I get nonsense. My _Mathematica_ input is               Clear[u, t];     DSolve[u'[t] == u[t], u, t]      And the output it gives is               {{u -> Function[{t}, 0]}}      How am I supposed to interpret this? We all know the solution should be $u=e^t + C$. What is _Mathematica_ doing here?
