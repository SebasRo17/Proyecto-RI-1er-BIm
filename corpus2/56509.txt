How would I get the maximum values for `x1` and `x2` given that I have plotted the region governed by the following system of inequalities? Basically want to find the smallest bounding box around the plot's coordinates               (x1 == -120 && x2 == 240) || (-120 < x1 <= -12 && -2 x1 <= x2 <= 120 - x1) ||      (-12 < x1 <= 0 && (60 - x1)/3 <= x2 <= 120 - x1) ||      (0 < x1 <= 30 && 1/3 (60 - 2 x1) <= x2 <= (240 - x1)/2) ||      (30 < x1 <= 60 && 30 - x1 <= x2 <= (240 - x1)/2) ||      (60 < x1 < 90 && 30 - x1 <= x2 <= 120 - 2 x1) || (x1 == 90 && x2 == -60)      I tried using the maximize function and maxvalue but both did not seem to work? E.g. > MaxValue::objv: The objective function (System of inequalities here) > contains a nonconstant expression Less independent of variables {x1,x2}. >> Could someone please tell me what to do here? Thanks
