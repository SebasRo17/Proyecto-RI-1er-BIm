I have a client-side Javascript framework that is publicly available and BSD licensed. Each file says it is copyright me, the date, all rights reserved, and the BSD license text. I am making a project which uses - and adapts and makes code changes to - my BSD licensed framework. Although obviously browsers will download and execute this code, I don't want to BSD license my derived project. I don't object to people seeing my code, but I don't want them to cut-n-paste and make derivatives of my project. What boilerplate text do I put at the top of each file? I would like to include a link to my BSD-licensed framework too. How should I phrase that?
