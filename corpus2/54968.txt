I use the command > ClearAll["Global`*"] so much that I thought it would be nice to have a function that called it. Since by default `ClearAll` requires an argument, I decided to overload it and have it so when no arguments are passed to `ClearAll` it clears Global. > `Unprotect[ClearAll]` > > ClearAll[]:=ClearAll["Global`*"]; > > `Protect[ClearAll]` However, mathematica still expects an argument to the function, resulting in this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WQlgX.png) It still works fine, but is there any way to remove the red arrow? I've tried `SyntaxInformation[ClearAll] := {"ArgumentsPattern" -> {___}}` which should allow it to accept 0 arguments, but it still complains about it.
