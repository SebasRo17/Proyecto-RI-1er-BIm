I have a function that takes two inputs and processes them for a single output. What I need is one that can take a varying number of inputs. and process them to a single output. Is this possible in Mathematica?                DatasetAverage[inputData_, inputData2_] := Block[{dataAvg, v, w},        v = Length[inputData];        w = Length[inputData2];        If [v != w,         Print["DatasetAverage: Data sample sizes do not match"]];        dataAvg = Table[Mean[{inputData[[i]], inputData2[[i]]}], {i, 1, Length[inputData2]}]      ]
