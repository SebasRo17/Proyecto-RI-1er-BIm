Is there a more efficient way of evaluating a function of two variables on a rectangular grid the the following nested Do loops?               fonGrid[x_, y_, f_] := Module[{n, m, fvals},       (* x is an n-by-1 vector *)        (* y is an n-by-1 vector *)        (* f is a scalar function of two variables *)       (* fvals is an m-by-       n matirx where fVals[[i,j]]=f[ x[[j]], y[[i]] ] *)       n = Length[x];       m = Length[y];       fvals = Table[0, {m}, {n}]; (* preallocate fvals *)       Do[         Do[           fvals[[i, j]] = f[x[[j]], y[[i]]];,          {i, 1, m}];,        {j, 1, n}];       fvals]
