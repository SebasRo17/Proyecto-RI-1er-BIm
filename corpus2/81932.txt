I have been told that as part of my degree year I will be learning about Artificial Intelligence. My lecturers have recommended a couple of books: Artificial Intelligence: A Systems Approach (Computer Science)   Artificial Intelligence (A Modern Approach) I've watched a couple of lectures hosted by Jeff Hawkins, they were good although a little advanced for me. Could someone recommend any other books or lectures that introduce the topic?
