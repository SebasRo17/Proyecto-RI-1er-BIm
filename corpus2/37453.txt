Is it possible to simply add ending zeros to a decimal number? For example: 2.1 should be 2.10 (precision till 1/100), 2 should be 2.00, etc. I've tried looking into               digits = RealDigits[3.1,10,3][[1]]      which gives `{3, 1, 0}`, and using this, the impressively complicated form               Row@{digits[[1]], ".", Sequence @@ Rest@digits}      gives the desired result. But this is enormously complicated, and I was wondering whether there exist another (easier) method? Thanks for all help, as always!
