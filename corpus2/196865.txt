I apologize if something like this has been asked, I did try to look for something similar. I am graduating May 16th, and I applied for a position posted as '.NET Application Developer' requiring 1-2 years experience and a Bachelor's in CIS. I had the phone screen, which went well. They brought me in Friday for an interview with the head managers which consisted of a written 20 question test, and other behavioral like questions and oddball ones such as "How would you make an M&M?" That seemed to go well too, they took me on a tour of the campus and said they usually will get back to the candidate, if they decide to proceed, in a week or so. Well, that following Monday at 9:00 am sharp they called me back for a third and final 'peer interview'. **This is where I am stuck - I have no idea what to expect here? How do I prepare?** Is this like the 'Hey let's see if you are culture fit" or "Lets put him through the paces with whiteboard coding" or what? Any advice would be HIGHLY appreciated. I have been practicing whiteboard coding just in case, and will come in with a humble, "I want to learn from you guys" kind of attitude.
