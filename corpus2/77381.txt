I'm trying to introduce what is unit testing, and how to write good unit test to a friend. I think it's better if I give him some principles for a good unit test, and suddenly I remember about "ACID" properties of transaction: **A** \- atomic: a unit test should test only one thing **C** \- consistent: a unit test, if passed, should pass thousand times, whenever you run it, so it should not depend on external things, such as network, database... **I** \- independent: a unit test, should be independent from others, therefore, you can run unit tests in every order, without changing the result. But i get a bit stuck with "D" - durable. Durable unit test? It makes no sense. Any suggestion about this D? Thank you.
