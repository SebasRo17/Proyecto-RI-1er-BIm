Someone suggested me to mark classes as SEALED that are not being inherited anywhere. I was using default style and was not concerned with the type of class. At present I don't have a benchmark tool to study the performance gains but read somewhere that Sealed Classes give performance benefits. Is this performance issue applicable to other class types like: Abstract, Static, New etc. and also with access modifiers like public, protected, internal, protected-internal and virtual? If it does make difference in performance, what type of optimization is done internally?
