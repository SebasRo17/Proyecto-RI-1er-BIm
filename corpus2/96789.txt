I was reading in the side bar of the Java language wiki page and it says it was influenced by Pascal and Delphi. this isn't the fact anymore, there are no references to Delphi on the entire referenced wiki page as of this edit, probably should remove all references to Delph from this question as well At first glance Java appears to just be C++ with a garbage collector, and no pointers. Delphi and Java both came out the same year. I am curious if someone who knows Java and Pascal / Delphi really well could look at Java and say **"Feature X in Java is influenced by feature Y in Pascal (or Delphi)."** Additionally was the influence in later versions of Java (so the feature from Pascal or Delphi didn't show up until Java version Z), or was it actually in the seeds of the Java language? Delphi and Java both came out the same year, so Delphi's influence in the genesis of Java seems less likely. Alternatively it may be that Delphi or Pascal influenced the Java Platform in some other way, and not the language specifically. _[This was rewritten to be clearer. That may have changed the scope of the question to the point the existing comments and answers don't fit. My intention was to clarify and not change.]_
