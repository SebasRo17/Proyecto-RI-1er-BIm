According to Wikipedia > Of the 193 widely recognized countries, 178 have an official language at the > national level (NB:or more than one) The only exceptions are: > Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Eritrea, The Holy See, Luxembourg, San > Marino, Sweden, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, > Uzbekistan, and Yemen `CountryData[]` supports three language related properties: > "Languages", "LanguagesDialects", "LanguagesFractions" But none of them seems to return the "Official Languages". Is there a way to get a country's official languages within Mathematica?
