I want to create a signed graph where the edges of my graph are either green (for a positive correlation) or red (for a negative correlation). I only managed to create a graph from a tresholded adjacency matrix so far (greater than x), but struggling with this and didn't find a function in mathematica. I'm also not sure if it's even possible :/ Is it also possible to make the edge lines thicker for a stronger correlation? Thanks in advance
