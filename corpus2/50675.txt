In my work I found that I needed the `Extract` function. However I was wondering if there was a way to use `Part`. Assume that `mList` is a 4-dim array. I did the following, which worked.               x = {2, 10, 3, 4};     y = Extract[mList, x];      I found that I can't do this.               y = mList[[x]]      Is there a way to convert the list `x`, into a sequence of integers that I can use in `Part`? I tried enclosing it in `Sequence`, but that seemed to have no effect. As I said, I'm fine without this, I was just wondering.
