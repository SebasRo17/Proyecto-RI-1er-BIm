I have a `DynamicModule` that requires loading of Mathematica packages. The usual methods do not seem to apply (`Needs["MathematicaPackage`"]]`, etc) I've tried               Dynamic[Initialization :> (Needs["Package`"])];      with only partial success. I'm sure this is done regularly, but cannot find any MMA documentation to that effect.   What's the best way to load Mathematica packages in `Dynamic` or `DynamicModule` and `Manipulate`?
