I would like to run the PageRank algorithm on graph with 4 000 000 nodes and around 45 000 000 edges. Currently I use neo4j graph databse and classic relational database (postgres) and for software projects I mostly use C# and Java. Does anyone know what would be the best way to perform a PageRank computation on such graph? Is there any way to modify the PageRank algorithm in order to run it at home computer or server (48GB RAM) or is there any useful cloud service to push the data along the algorithm and retrieve the results? At this stage the project is at the research stage so in case of using cloud service if possible, would like to use such provider that doesn't require much administration and service setup, but instead focus just on running the algorith once and get the results without much overhead administration work.
