I want to make a simple cdf file that makes some hard computations inside Manipulate. Is there a simple way, lets say using a "stop!" Button, to terminate the time consuming calculations--without closing the web browser or Mathematica? To clarify my self: The following code works well because 2014 is not large enough, so Mathematica can easily compute the sum of Logs. `Manipulate[tick; tot = 1. Total[Log@Range[2014]]; color = Green;, tot, Button["Run", color = Red; tick = Not[tick], Background -> Dynamic@color], {{color, Green}, None}, {{tot, 0}, None}, {{tick, False}, None}, TrackedSymbols :> {tick}]` but when I introduce range at the place of 2014 as in :               Manipulate[tick;      tot = 1. Total[Log@Range[range]];      color = Green;      tot, Button["Run", color = Red; tick = Not[tick],        Background -> Dynamic@color], {{color, Green}, None}, {{tot, 0},        None}, {{tick, False}, None}, {{range, 1}, 1, 300000000, 1},       TrackedSymbols :> {tick}]      the things are coming very bad for huge values of range! So my question is : Is it possible to terminate a running calculation from inside Manipulate?
