**Background:** I'm running Debian on a remote server with Mathematica installed. I have several dozen small mathematica files that are run in cron jobs at unpredictable intervals and updated based on a web interface. I'm trying to get faster response times when I run the smaller files. **Question:** For Example I have `file.m` which contains(This is just an example)               Export["/home/rob/Desktop/eq.png",Sum[1/2,{x,i}]]      If I setup a cron job to run the following               time MathKernel -noprompt -script /home/rob/Desktop/file.m      I get a real response time of **`6.31`**. But now if I ssh into the server and run `MathKernel` and the following               AbsoluteTiming[Export["/home/rob/Desktop/eq.png",HoldForm[Sum[1/2,{x,i}]]]       the script returns **`1.13`**. The start up time definitely appears to be the issue `6.31` vs `1.13`. So what is the best way to keep MathKernel running it the background so it can periodically run `file.m`? **EDIT:** I would like to avoid using `CreateScheduledTask` because of the extensive rewrite that would be needed.
