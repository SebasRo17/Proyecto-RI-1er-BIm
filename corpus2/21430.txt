I am trying to write a set of homework questions. I would like the output to evaluate the constants but not the sum, so that I may present the homework question as something like this: $$\sum_{n=1}^{340}(-4n^2-n+3)$$ Here's what I have:               c1 = RandomInteger[{-5, 5}];     c2 = RandomInteger[{-5, 5}];     c3 = RandomInteger[{-5, 5}];     c4 = RandomInteger[{1, 50}]*20     f[x_] := c1*x^2 + c2*x + c3      f[n]      (* 340        3 - n - 4 n^2 *)          Defer[Sum[f[n], {n, 1, c4}]]      $\sum _{n=1}^{\text{c4}} f(n)$ It seems like I am not using `Defer` correctly. How can I fix this?
