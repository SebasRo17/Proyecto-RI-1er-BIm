I hope this is the appropriate forum to ask this question. A group of colleagues and I just starting learning C# a few weeks ago and we are planning on having a discussion about language interoperability. So, I am looking for known/classical examples of .Net language interoperability issues. Like this one, where the case-insensitiveness of VB.Net makes an overloaded C# method incompatible. **In C#**               public class Foo     {         public void foo() { }         public void fOO() { }     }      **In VB.Net**               Public Class Bar        Sub Bar()           Dim foo As Foo           foo = New Foo()           foo.foo(); //compiler error        End Sub     End Class      Or this one in which a VB.Net keyword is used in a C# method name: **In C#**               public class Foo     {        public virtual void Stop() { }     }      **In VB.Net**               Public Class Bar         Inherits Foo              Public Overrides Sub Stop() 'compiler error         End Sub          End Class      I would love to gather a few more examples of this type of issues. Does anyone know any other interesting cases of language interoperability gotchas? I used C# and VB.Net in these examples, but any .Net language interoperability issue will be just as good to enrich a discussion on the subject.
