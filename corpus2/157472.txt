I'm designing a tiered .NET application, and I want to use the Code First approach. I'm new to this, so I'm struggling to envision how it ought to be designed. Would the following be a reasonable approach? What problems or limitations might I run into?   * Write DTO classes for my domain. These will be used for data transfer between the server and client over WCF.   * Write a set of POCO classes that inherits from the DTO classes. Use these to generate the database on the server.   * Write another set of POCO classes that inherits from the DTO classes. Use these to generate an SDF database on the client.
