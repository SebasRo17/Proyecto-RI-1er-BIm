I develop a game library in javascript, containing many classes. I hesitate on the behavior that I should follow concerning method parameter validation: **Should I check the validity of parameters passed to each method ?** By example, when a method take only a number between 0 and 100 in parameter, should I check that the value is correct? I have dozens of classes, each with dozens of methods. For a simple getter, I can have more than half lines code only used for checking parameters. Add checks makes my code less maintainable, more heavy. Seeing that it's a library, destined to be used by many other programmers, checking parameters can avoid many mistakes and bugs, and would be a appreciated. So, how do other javascript libraries, handle this and what is the best solution?
