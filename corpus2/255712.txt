I want the user to upgrade to the latest browser, however, I feel like it's wrong to act as an evangelist (also I love Firefox). I know about browsehappy.com but what I'm looking at is a website that suggests upgrade to the same vendor's latest browser. Poor opera is second-last in that list. Is there a website that suggests only the latest opera version to opera users? PS: I also am not a fan of web-kit monopoly. I think subliminally a browser that appears earlier in the list is likely to be perceived better. But please no flame wars here!
