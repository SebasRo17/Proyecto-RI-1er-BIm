I'm a novice web developer, mostly worked with ASP.NET. On the server side, everything is very well documented and whenever there is an error, you get an explanatory error message. But on the client side, I'm at a total loss. I never had to develop a very interactive user interface. For example, tag suggestions on this site while you are asking a question. How such a thing is developed? Writing pure javascript and jquery, onkeypress events then ajax, then manipulating the dom and styling newly created html... This should take days even weeks for a novice developer and it's totally error prone. Something always goes wrong and your best chance is guessing what could have gone wrong. It's not like programming with Java or C# etc. Shortly, what I'm asking is what technologies are used for rapid, robust client side web development, that both looks good and reliable. EDIT: An attempt to remove vagueness about question, writing pure javascript to create a highly interactive and elegant client side app is like programming in Assembly. What major frameworks/libraries/technologies used to overcome this complexity?
