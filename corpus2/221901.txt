I am working with a non-OO language and I'm trying to name my routines consistently. I came acrross the following guideline from Steve McConnell's Code Complete: > _To name a procedure, use a strong verb followed by an object_ McConnell gives the following good and bad examples:   * good, non-OO --> `PrintDocument(doc)`   * good, OO -->       `doc.Print()`   * bad, OO -->         `doc.PrintDocument()` For an OO language, `doc.PrintDocument()` is non-recommended on the basis that it is redundant. I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this guideline. Why is `PrintDocument(doc)`recommended, and `doc.PrintDocument()` non-recommended? Also, what would be the problem with the simpler name `Print(doc)` in a non-OO language? Am I missing something very basic here?
