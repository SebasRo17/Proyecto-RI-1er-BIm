I've had a look at this question on giving presentations with Mathematica which is very useful on the technical side of setting up slideshows. However, my question is more about the integration of Mathematica with good teaching style. I shall shortly be giving an undergraduate lecture course on Mathematical Methods to engineers and others from non pure maths disciplines (it'll be from integration onwards) and am planning on using Mathematica as a teaching tool. One has to be careful with not letting technology take the place of good teaching but I would like to be able to use Mathematica effectively for showing the structure of a problem and the parametric dependencies of functions etc. - the perfect place for plenty of `Manipulate` usage. I hope to give at least 90% of my lectures in Mathematica and the rest on a blackboard - this is a wild estimate but it's what I'm aiming for. I would be grateful if anyone has undertaken such an exercise to give me possible pitfalls and pointers as to the best methods they've found to make Mathematica bring the maths to life, rather than confuse the students with a mass of fast-paced buttons, dynamic displays and notation. P.S I saw also this question on lecture courses with Mathematica, however again, these are examples and not descriptions of what went well and what didn't.
