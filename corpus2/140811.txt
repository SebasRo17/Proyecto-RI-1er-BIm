It is almost and instantaneous whenever I talk to developers about Model View Controller ( **MVC** ) they say you make a request to a url the server builds a entity (MODEL) and provides you with visual representation of that model.   * So does this mean MVC **is only for the web** or have I been meeting people who are just developers who employ MVC for writing web applications?   * Are there usages for MVC on desktop style applications?   * I for one am new to paradigm and would like to know of any super-set to MVC
