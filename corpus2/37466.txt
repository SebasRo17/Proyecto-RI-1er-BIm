I've found a simple example that illustrates my problem:               ContourPlot[x^2 - 1 == y, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, PlotLegends -> "Expressions"]      When I try to export this to PDF, I get the following: ![Contour plot with legend and bug](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AmdpK.png) and in the legend, the expression is misspaced and unreadable. Is this a known bug? Is there a known work around?
