I have this question: Suppose I have some two dimsensional graphic element, say "flower" (i.e. a picture of a flower) in a _Mathematica_ notebook. I want to insert this figure, say at a specific point such as `(1,1,2)` in a 3-dimensional plot such as given by               Plot3D[x^2+y^2,{x,-2,2},{y,-2,2}]      I tried `Epilog` command with inset within the above Plot3D command, but was not succesful. For example, I tried:               Plot3D[x^2+y^2,{x,-2,2},{y,-2,2},Epilog->{  Inset[flower,{1,1,2}]  } ].        The problem is possibly that `Inset` command only allows 2D coordinates. Can someone please help me to achieve this task?   Thank you for any help in advance Best Regards, Tim
