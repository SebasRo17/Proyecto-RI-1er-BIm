I am trying a problem that should be simple: to create a function that contains a derivative. I need to do a more complex example, but even with the simplest I'm having trouble: Let's consider               d[psi_[a_, b_, c_]] := D[psi, a] + D[psi, b]     p[x_, y_, z_] := x + y;     d[p[x, y, z]]      If I do that i receive the follow answer:               d[x + y]      I am only receiving a generic answer. Sometimes, I don't know why, I receive the evaluated answer (rarely). Do you know what is wrong? I'm using Mathematica 9. **Update** How do I have to modify the definitions above if I want to apply `d` to a list of functions?
