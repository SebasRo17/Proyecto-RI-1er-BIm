One way to optimize code is to minimize the access to arrays and use variables instead, because that way we use registers instead of loading data to cache memory. For example, if in a loop I'm going to use 3 times a data from an array, say radius[i], I'd better declare a variable tmp, and give it the value of radius[i]. Every time I need to call radius[i] I'll use tmp instead. The problem is, the number of registers is limited (to 8 in some cases, it depends on the architecture). What if I have more variables than the number of registers? Will the usage of variables in this case slow down my program more than having access to cache memory? I am coding in c language.
