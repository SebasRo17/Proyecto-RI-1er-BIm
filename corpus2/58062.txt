Basically I have a really large output which looks like a long linear equation $AAA-BAA-CAA+DAA+...-ZZZ$ And I only am concerned about those terms that have a positive coefficient (i.e. a plus in front). The others I can ignore. How can I get mathematica to ignore those positive-coefficient terms, or at the very least order the list such that the negative coefficient terms are in the front (or back).
