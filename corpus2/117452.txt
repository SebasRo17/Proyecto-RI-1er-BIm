I am considering hiring someone exclusively to manage outsourcing of relatively small projects on Guru.com or VWorker.com. The person should be located close to me so I can have face-to-face communication and also that he/she gets domain knowledge. The projects will be in a wide variety of technologies and ranging from mission-critical to completely experimental projects. Sometimes deadlines will also be extremely tight. My question is what kind of candidates would be the best at undertaking such a job? Are recently graduates the best? Expert technicians who can recognize and communicate with other experts? Experienced project leaders? An aspect of this is that I want the best cost/benefit ratio, given that experienced project leaders are likely to be much more expensive than recently graduates. I also believe that one aspect of this is that this is quite an unusual organizational structure, so I am not sure that people who are used to the bureaucracy project management in big companies would be able to adapt to such a working environment.
