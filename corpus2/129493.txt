I was checking out a video tutorial on HTML5 using Dreamweaver to do Android and iOS apps (using Phonegap) and it clearly mentioned that you need a Mac to debug and simulate for iPhone, iPod, etc. Is there any way around this? I really want to develop apps for iOS and android (more iOS) using HTML5 but what I need to know is if you develop an app with HTML5 and debug it in an android environment, is it still portable to iOS? My apologies if this question seems a bit ignorant but none of my google searches return results that answered my question. Maybe I'm not even asking the right question.
