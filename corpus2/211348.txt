I am writing some software that (for once - usually I open source stuff on sourceforge/github/etc.) I plan on selling. To each source file, I want to attach a proprietary software license that doesn't allow anyone to use, modify, derive, etc. the software (and source code) without my express permission. I have been looking at the Microsoft Reference Source Licensing and would be happy to use that, however I'm not sure if I can (legally). So I ask: in the same way that there are well-known an regarded open source software licenses (ASL, GNU, etc.), are there well-know proprietary licenses that are "open" in the sense that I could use them to protect my product? Thanks in advance!
