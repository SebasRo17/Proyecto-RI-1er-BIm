I am working on the application which in near future (hopefully) will have to process tens or hundreds of thousands of items (item is currently one row in relational database table) per second. If I understood it right NoSQL databases are superheroes of data retrieval thanks to map-reduce magic. But will NoSQL databases provide extra performance in comperatison to relational ones in my case?
