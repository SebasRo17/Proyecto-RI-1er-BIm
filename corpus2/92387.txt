I am posting this anonymously because I don't want to get into potential trouble.   I have a big problem.   I recently joined a team that is less than a year old. I have been here since a month in to the project started. The company structure looks like this:   * Owner (non-technical)      * Project Manager (non-technical)        * Lead Developer (Technical, but bad at it) This project is a website using ASP.Net that the Lead Developer designed a horrible architecture for. You will have to take my word at it, but basically, the way we are required to build web pages is giving us 3+ minute load times on a single web page over VPN in Debug mode. It has spiraled to the point where other coworkers agree that they spend more of their day waiting for pages to load than actual development. Now the big problem is this. Project Manager does not know technology and admits it. He has specifically stated that he trusts the Lead Developer to make the correct choices on application architecture. No one on the team knows what the Owners opinion would be, but everyone is afraid to make waves in this economy (myself especially). What would you do?
