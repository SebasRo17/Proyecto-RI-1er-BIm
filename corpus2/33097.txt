`RootApproximant` does a very good job when I need to recognize an algebraic number and when enough of its digits are known (or even when an unlimited number of digits can be obtained from a numerical computation given enough time). But often I need to recognize linear combinations of the form $\alpha+\beta\cdot\tau$ where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are unknown algebraic numbers, and $\tau$ is a known fixed transcendental number (e.g. `Pi`, `E` or `Log[2]`). Some simple cases can be solved using _WolframAlpha_ lookup:               WolframAlpha["2.421441469079183123",         IncludePods -> "PossibleClosedForm",         TimeConstraint -> âˆž]      Is there a way to solve this problem in general in _Mathematica_?
