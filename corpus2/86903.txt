I am looking for something like a subversion dashboard that at the very least can show me commits from across a group of repositories. Is there anything like this available? Since it could just as well be dead simple and I can't find anything immediately I am thinking if just scratching my own itch here, but I am hoping someone has wanted this before? Are there any subversion "dashboards" that an show me even a simple twitter-like list of commits from across my repositories?
