Math has always been my thing in that I've always found the subject easy. Computer Science is my second love, though. Given the choice, I would prefer to major in Math. Since the only careers one would usually go into with an undergraduate degree in math are not appealing at all, I would be very content spending my days as a software developer. My question is this: Which math discipline would a future programmer reap more benefits from? Applied math or pure math? I enjoy teaching myself and I am confident that I can teach myself how to be a great programmer, but I still plan on getting a minor in CS!
