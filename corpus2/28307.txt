I am running Mathematica 9 on a linux machine and I've encountered the following behaviour that I am trying to understand. When I'm editing multiple source (.m) files using mathematica saving adds a new line which reads (* ::Package:: *) at the start of the file. This interferes with the shebang line that designates a source file as an executable and prevents scripts from working. I then fix this problem by closing all source files in mathematica and manually removing the line in a text editor - so this is more of an annoyance than an actual problem. Does anyone know how the line addition can be prevented? Thanks!
