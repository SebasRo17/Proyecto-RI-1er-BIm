For some odd ball reason, my manager is giving me grunt work which no one wants to do. Currently he is working on a Flex/AS project, which I have previous experience with and he does not, but is unwilling to put me on that project. He cites other project needs and keeps me on them.. is it time to get out or talk to him or his boss???
