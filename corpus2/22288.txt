I am trying to create a transition matrix for a network. In order to do this, I need to sum down the column (the out degree), and then divide the column by the out degree in order to normalize it. I am able to sum down the column. What I am unable to figure out how to do efficiently and easily is to divide the column by the sum.               L = {{0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0},           {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},           {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0},           {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0},           {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},           {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1},           {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}};
