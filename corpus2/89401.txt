I am trying to create a small CMS with ASP.NET MVC3, but I got confused in designing the administrator section. I decided to create two areas, one for users and another for admin. In my CMS I have a `Post` and a `News` object, and I want to put create/edit/delete functions in the admin area and other function that related to users in the user area to achieve functionality in my CMS. For example I have two `NewsController`, one in the admin area (include create/edit/delete functions) and another in the user area (include `preview(id)` function). Is this design good? How can I improve it?
