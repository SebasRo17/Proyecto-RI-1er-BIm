I would like to be able to call a function an unspecified number of times. That is, I would like the generalization of something like:                  Sample[yi_, yf_, yinc_, zi_, zf_, zinc_]:=               Table[{y, z}, {y, yi, yf, yinc}, {z, zi, zf, zinc}]      to $n$ variables, all with their own respective initial, finial and incremental values, and so I'd be calling on `Table` $n$ times. Is something like this even possible?
