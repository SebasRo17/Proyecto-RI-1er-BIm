I recently asked this question on SO, which quickly became downvoted and closed. Clearly I lack a deeper understanding of JS, which I'm hoping you'll help me fill here. I'm a perfectly capable web developer and have built plenty of visually and functionally pleasing websites but am struggling to get to grips with how I should be handling JS. Up until now, I've only really used jQuery for form validation or providing AJAX functionality to forms/other page elements. There seems to be a lot of hype around JS frameworks - backbonejs, emberjs, etc, but when I look into them, it looks like they're just good for if you intend to build full applications in them. I'm happy using PHP/Symfony and just want to use JS to give my web applications a nice interactive/responsive 'feel'. Are the aforementioned frameworks any use to me, or am I right in just sticking with jQuery?
