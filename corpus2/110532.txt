If I want to use the data on Twitter in my application, what are the restrictions? What user data should I avoid touching? For example, if I want to collect information from certain type of tweets about users and use this information on my site as profiles for these users in my site, does this require permission from the users first or can I directly go and get the information? Technically, from anyone with a public account on twitter, we can get data of his/her tweets and create profile information for him/her, but does twitter privacy policy allow this? If you published some tweet on Twitter, am I allowed to take that tweet content and put it in my site (stating that it is written by you) but without asking you for permission? I found this in the Twitter Terms of Service: > Tip We encourage and permit broad re-use of Content. The Twitter API exists > to enable this. But also found this on the Twitter API Terms: > You may not use Twitter Content or other data collected from end users of > your Client to create or maintain a separate status update or social network > database or service.
