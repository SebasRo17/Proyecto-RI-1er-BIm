I know that integration testing means integrating unit tested moduls and testing for interface errors etc. But in real world examples, I am kinda lost. Here is an example of our system: Back end (Java).   Front end (Flex). Back end is processind data heavily and we have a lot of tests for weekly automated regression. But is it a system test? I think so, but on the other hand, it is just back end part testing. Or should I say it is system testing only when UI part is involved as well? But again, with testing UI we cannot test the logic in data processing.
