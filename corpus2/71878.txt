**Short version:** I've been a solo programmer for 5 years, right out of school, and am looking to for resume tips as I aim to get a job with a larger, well structured company. **Long version:** I am a 26 year old who graduated in CS in 2007. I had an internship for a small company starting in 2006, and still work for them to this day. I'm looking to work for a larger company for reasons beyond the scope of this post. During this time I was the only programmer, and designed/coded/maintained four .NET applications for various industries. Those four projects kept me very busy. My applications have happy customers, they work well and look nice. I realize that being a solo developer has given me some strengths and some weaknesses compared to my peers.   * My strengths are that I can self educate well, and I've suffered the consequences of mistakes firsthand, so I can give VERY good reasons why I do things the way I do.   * My weaknesses are that I've lacked a mentor, and the missed opportunities to learn from him/her. I also lack team work with programming. I worked closely with other technical people, and had my own SVN/TFS servers, but never worked closely with other programmers, delegated orders, or really had a specific role other than "do everything." I realize that the teamwork is a crucial component of a mature developer. So now, some questions about a resume and/or interview:   1. Should I be up front about being on a lonely island of programming so long?   2. When listing my projects in a resume, since I was a solo dev should I describe the projects in great detail, and say that I did everything rather than say "I did xxx, yyy, zzz"?   3. My current employer has web pages with videos/screenshots of my software in action, should I link to them?   4. Do you think my strengths make up for my weaknesses and leave me > 0?   5. Any other tips?
