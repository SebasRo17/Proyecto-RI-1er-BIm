I Have been looking for a job in the past 10 years. Since I believe the subject I know better is programming, I have been trying to find a programming job. I send my curriculum to a lot of companies, and they basically don't even reply. Lately I sent my curriculum to a php job and I got no answer. When I am called to an interview (yes, it happened) the interview doesn't even lasts 5 minutes and I am quickly dispensed. Sometimes they give a test for the position, and they tell me to go away without even bothering to test me. I have applied for jobs to work with Delphi and PHP. Basically the positions I have applied to, are for internships or first jobs. I never applied to a "senior" or "advanced" position. I am still undergraduate (from university) in compsci. Am I doing something wrong? Do I really need to finish my graduation or get a certification? Is there any tips for having a curriculum that gets you to more interviews? Does this problem happens to everybody or just me?
