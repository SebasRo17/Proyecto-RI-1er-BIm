We call `static final` fields as `constant`, rather I should say `Class constant`. So can we call just `final` fields as `Object's constant`? Is it right to say this?               Edited ::      Consider the following code :               class JustFinal     {         final int a=20;         final int b;              JustFinal(int x, int y){             //a=x;             b=y;         }              public static void main(String arg[])         {             JustFinal jf = new JustFinal(100,200);         }     }      In the above code field `a` will have a same value for all the object instances and field `b` can have a different value for a different object instance. Shouldn't we call the `final field a` as `CONSTANT` and `final field b` as `OBJECT's CONSTANT`?
