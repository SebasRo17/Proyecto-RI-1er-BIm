My classes are following this structure Service Tier (creates and maps InputDTO to DB Data) -> DAO Tier (actually executes DB calls) When I write the service tier JUnits, and when it calls DAO Tier, it expects an actual DB connection and getting data from the DB. Should I be mocking the DAO tier completely from the service tier, or should I be mocking the DB connection and data received from the DB? Secondly, the app expects certain data from a Cache. For JUnit run time, there is no Cache, so how should this be handled - since the service tier method includes looking up the cache to get the details.
