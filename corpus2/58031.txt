I am looking for advice, hopefully from people more experienced that me. I am going to start applying for junior positions for .net development in the summer. At the moment the only thing on my CV is a project I have done for Windows Phone 7 called sprout sms. It allows the user to send webtext as provided by Irish Operators. The app is doing well and is top ten in my local marketplace (Ireland). By trade I am a salesman and that is the extent of most of my employment. I haven't been to college and due to financial commitments I would not be able to go down the road of full time education. I have kept up to date with various .net related tech in a junior capacity and am looking to now change careers. What I am look to see is what stands out on a juniors CV. My lack of education stands against me so I am looking to offset this with practical experience. I am open to all suggestions and from the end of this month I am free to pursue "notches" which will make my CV stand out. So in short if you where hiring a Junior, what would you like to see that would make you take a second look or request an interview? NOTE: I do fear this is a subjective subject, rather than debate what is the best items to have on a Juniors CV I would like to concentrate on what info you would give to a junior who is looking to apply for a job this year. Thanks to all that respond. EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, I would give all the answers a green tick if I could. I awarded the tick based on what I felt I got out of the answer but all are tick worthy. I have upvoted all of the responses that have given good info too. If you feel you can add more to this question / answer it would be very much appreciated. EDIT 2: I just wanted to let everyone know that using the advice given here and some persistence I got my first dev role. The take away? Personal projects or help on other projects matter a lot, be able to talk, defend and concede when discussing them.
