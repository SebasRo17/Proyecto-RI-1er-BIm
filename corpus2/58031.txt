I got a piece of artwork in dimension of 20x20 pixels. I attempted to divide it into a 5x5 array of elements each of a smaller size of 4x4 pixels, and would like to find the mean color of the elements. I got the job done in a double for-loop. Is there a better way to do it? I need a faster way to treat much larger pieces. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U81QN.jpg)               Clear[avg]     avg = ConstantArray[0, {5, 5}];     image = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZZWEu.jpg"] ;     idata = ImageData[image];     ddata = Partition[idata , {4, 4}, 4] ;     For[i = 1, i <= 5, i++,      For[j = 1, j <= 5, j++,       avg[[i, j]] = Mean@Flatten[ddata[[i, j]], 1 ];       ]]     Image[avg]      This is what I got: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b4gnW.png)
