I have a relatively large set of data that I am trying to turn into a weighted, directed graph. The data concerns the inflow of migrants based on country of origin. I currently have three columns of data in excel: a number representing country migrated to ($a_i$), a number representing country of origin ($b_i$), and the number of migrants, $n$, who have traveled from $b_i$ to $a_i$. If I turn this data into a set of ordered triples ($b_i$,$a_i$,$\sigma$) where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are as defined above, and $\sigma$ represents some sort of weight (which I will calculate based upon $n$), would it be possible to have mathematica interpret these triples as directions for constructing a graph? That is, could I somehow yield a directed graph such that each triple corresponds to an edge $b_i\rightarrow a_i$ with weight $\sigma$? Any help is appreciated.
