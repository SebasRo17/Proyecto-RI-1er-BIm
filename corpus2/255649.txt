I want to find the oldest/newest element added into a heap of size k. At any given point of time if I have to find say the oldest element in the heap is there any approach with O(1) space and O(1) time. I was thinking of an approach of having a queue of the same size as that of the heap and add all the element into the queue as they are added to the heap. This yields a constant time solution but this requires an extra O(k) space. I would like to know if this problem can be solved with constant space.
