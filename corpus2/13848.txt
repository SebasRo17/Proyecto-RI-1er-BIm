I'm puzzled by the output I get from `SetAccuracy`. According to the documentation, when `SetAccuracy` is used to increase the accuracy of a number, the number is padded with zeros. But, let's take a look at a couple of examples:               SetAccuracy[1.2, 5]     (* 1.2000 *)     SetAccuracy[1., 5]     (* 1.0000 *)     SetAccuracy[0.2, 5]     (* 0.2000 *)      These examples seem to work properly, so why does it behave differently in this case?               SetAccuracy[0., 5]     (* 0.*10^-5 *)      What should I do to get a zero with four trailing zeros? **Update** I'm asking this question, because I need to export data to a txt file and I would like to avoid having `0.*10^-5` sort of numbers.
