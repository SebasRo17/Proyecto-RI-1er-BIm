FORTRAN code can be called using MathLink or .NET/Link (see the link for a worked examples). But as mentioned in a talk by T.Gayley and J.Klein in Wolfram Technology Conference 2011, LibraryLink, which is new in version 8, is much faster. In the presentation, they gave a comparison of these three different approaches. (see also here a comparison by @Szabolcs). I just copy the pros and cons of LibraryLink from that presentation: * * *   * Pros     * Extremely fast, comparable to internal implementation in Mathematica itself.     * Memory for large arrays can be shared with the kernel.     * Code generation tools in Mathematica can be used to simplify creating and compiling libraries.     * Probably a better alternative than installable MathLink programs for most users who want to call C functions.   * Cons     * Need to write specialized C code for every function you want to call.     * Without special (and sometimes inconvenient) effort by the author, the kernel is not interruptible while calling a library function. This means that functions cannot be aborted while in progress, and the front end will not be responsive to most buttons, the help system, etc. * * * The advantages arouse my interest. But I have little experience with C programming... :-( So I want to know how can one call fortran functions and subroutines using Librarylink? Is there any worked example? Practically, I want to use it to call a cernlib package MINUIT written in FORTRAN 77, see my question here. MINUIT is a complicated package for function minimization and error analysis, and it has been widely used for may years, especially in the fields of nuclear and particle physics. Here is a link to its reference manual.
