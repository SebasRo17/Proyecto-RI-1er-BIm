Is there an algorithm to search a directed graph (tree) for its neighbors neighbor? My current brute-force solution works as follows:               for each node n:        for each child c of n           for each parent p of c              if (p != n)                insert edge (p,n)      I am dealing with ca. 700.000 nodes each having between 1 to 1000 edges and currently I am facing too long running times: which is mainly due to the reason I am executing this algorithm on a graph database, since it would require too much memory.
