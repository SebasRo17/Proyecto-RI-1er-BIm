I want to build a grid to look like the top-left table shown below, but without an outside frame. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3csys.jpg) Here is what I've tried to do:               a = {         {, , 2, 2, 2, 2,},         {, , 3, , 2, 0, 3},         {, 2, 2, , 3, , 3},         {2, 2, 2, , , , 2},         {2, 3, , , 1, ,},         {2, , 1, 3, , ,},         {3, 3, 3, 2, 3, , 3}         };          f = Riffle[#, "\[CenterDot]", {1, -1, 2}] &;          f /@ Transpose[f /@ a] // Transpose // Grid      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TMtEC.png) What I don't like in my result is that I have three times more dots than I need. And I don't know how to fix it. Suggestions?
