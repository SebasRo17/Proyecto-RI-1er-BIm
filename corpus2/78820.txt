I've been working on this contracted project for over a year now and I'm the only developer (as a contractor delivering the product) on a mis-planned project with unrealistic deadlines. I've pointed those out at the very beginning but since I need the money I took the project. I don't care that much if I'm earning less due to this deadline overdue-ness... Anyway. Since I've been working many many late (as well as early) hours I became really fed up by this project and my productivity has fallen below 50% (approximation). **How do I fight this to boost productivity?** I can't take time off, because I'm the sole developer on this and because project is already too late. **Some more info** I got this project over another intermediary company (in other words: with connections). I'm mostly communicating with the end client and they are aware that things can only go as fast as they do. They have the know-how, we keep meetings every other week to check progress and talk about outstanding things, processes etc. They seem content and satisfied with my work. But this intermediary of course want their stake (25%) and are saying things are going too slow. That's why I say that I don't care that much about being late, because I know I'm delivering a very good as well as useful product that will be used heavily. And hopefully sold to other clients afterwards as well. I also have a strong wish to finish it and get some rewards myself as well. I've been working _on fumes_ for the last year. Until I deliver the first phase (out of three) I see no money. Last two phases will be shorter. Especially the second one.
