Although, my question may be entirely irrelevant, but I have sensed a pattern between most programming languages and their official implementations. **Interpreted** (byte-interpreted?) languages like Python , Lua etc. usually have an extremely lenient and easy syntax and are generally type-less or do not require the developer to explicitly write variable types in source code; **Compiled** languages like C , C++ , Pascal etc. usually have a strict syntax, generally have types and mostly require more code / development time Languages whose official implementations are **JIT-Compiled** like Java / C# usually are a unique compromise between the above two with some of the best features of both. Some of the more modern compiled programming languages like D and Vala (and the GNU GJC implementation of Java) are perhaps an exception to this rule and resemble the Syntax and features of JIT-Compiled languages like Java and C#. My first question is, is this really relevant? Or is this just a coincidence that most interpreted languages have easy syntax , JIT-Compiled ones have a moderate syntax and features etc. Secondly, if this is not a coincidence, then why is it so? Like, for example, can some features only be implemented in a programming language if you are, say, JIT-Compiling it?
