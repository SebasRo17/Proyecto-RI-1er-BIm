Please bare with me, I want this to be as language agnostic as possible becuase of the languages I am working with (One of which is a language called PowerOn). However, **most languanges support for loops and arrays.** Say I have the following list in an aray:               0x  0  Foo     1x  1  Bar     2x  0  Widget     3x  1  Whatsit     4x  0  Foo     5x  1  Bar      Anything with a 1 should be uniqely added to another array with the following result:               0x  1  Bar     1x  1  Whatsit      Keep in mind this is a very elementry example. In reality, I am dealing with 10's of thousands of elements on the old list. Here is what I have so far. Pseudo Code:               For each element in oldlist      For each element in newlist       Compare       If values oldlist.element equals newlist.element, break new list loop       If reached end of newlist with with nothing equal from oldlist, add value from old list to new list      End     End      **Is there a better way of doing this? Algorithmicly, is there any room for improvement?** And as a bonus qeustion, what is the O notation for this type of algorithm (if there is one)?
