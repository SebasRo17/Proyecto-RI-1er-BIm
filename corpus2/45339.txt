I have a polar differential equation (this is the reduced variant) as: $$r' = 0, \theta' = 1$$ I figured out (from previous answers) that I can nicely convert this to Cartesian and use StreamPlot as:                 field = {0, 1};            TransformedField["Polar" -> "Cartesian", field, {r, \[Theta]} -> {x, y}]            StreamPlot[{-(y/Sqrt[x^2+y^2]),x/Sqrt[x^2+y^2]},{x,-2,2},{y,-2,2},        StreamColorFunction->"Rainbow"]      This generates the correct phase portrait and worked great. I was even able to animate it. My question now is how can this field (polar DEQ) be solved as a polar DEQ? Can't this be solved as such and plotted using polar plots to arrive at the same phase portrait? Am I missing something? I tried NDSolve without luck, so think I must be missing something basic here. Is something special required for polar type DEQs in Mathematica?
