Sometimes my QA team reports bugs, but neither I or them have any idea on how to reproduce them. This leads to very long and frustrating debugging sessions which sometimes do not even yield results. My software is tied heavily with proprietary hardware so bugs can come from many directions at once. Should I expect more from them than "your software crashed when I pressed a button" or should I figure myself what happened? EDIT: One of my coworker pointed out that we are probably all developers here so the results might suffer a little bias
