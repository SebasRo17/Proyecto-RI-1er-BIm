What sort of languages would be able to handle writing your own web crawler? Could PHP handle this? I'm quite good with PHP (following best practices etc). But I'd like a good reason to learn a new language if I need to. The idea is to crawl one specific website that has multiple entries, much like an RSS feed, but they don't offer that an RSS feed of the site...
