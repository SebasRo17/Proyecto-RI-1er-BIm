I want to solve an Volterra type Integral equation, and as a practice I entered the following code to my mathematica:               Clear[Func, x, t]; DSolve[     D[Func[x], x] == Integrate[Func[t], {t, 0, x}], Func[x], x]      But I got an error message, > DSolve::litarg: To avoid possible ambiguity, the arguments of the dependent > variable in > > (function) > > should literally match the independent variables. >> I guess that the argument of Func[...] should be always 'x' (not 't') in the above example. I first thought changing my code to               Clear[Func, x, t]; DSolve[     D[Func[x], x] == Integrate[Func[x], {x, 0, x}], Func[x], x]      But it seems it's not the integral equation I want to solve. Also in that case I got the following warnings, > Solve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Solve, so some solutions > may not be found; use Reduce for complete solution information. Are there any ways to assign variable to the bounds of the integration interval? Thank you in advance,
