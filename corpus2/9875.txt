I need to solve a system similar to the following (Except it is quite large. Solving this ought to do the job): $$ \tan[2f(t)] = 1+ t^2\ $$ and $ f(t) $ is $ k $, such that$$ \tan[2kt]-(1+k^2) = 0\ $$ I have used `RootSearch` for both equations as I also know the range in which $k$ and $T$ lie. The sample of my code is below.               f[T_] := k /. Extract[Flatten[Quiet[RootSearch[Tan[2*k*T] - (1 + k^2) == 0, {k, 0, 1}],              $MinPrecision::precset]], -1];          Extract[Flatten[Quiet[RootSearch[Tan[2*f[T]] - (1 + T^2) == 0, {T, 0, 1}],             $MinPrecision::precset]], -1]      and I end up getting the following error               ReplaceAll::reps: {k,0,1} is neither a list of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table,     and so cannot be used for replacing. >>      Please suggest a solution. It would be preferable to use something as powerful as `RootSearch` because my other equations seem to be unsolvable via `FindRoot` or `NSolve`.
