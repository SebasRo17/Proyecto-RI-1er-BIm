How can I write a function which has two parameters and it should generate combination of arbitrary range bits, for example: `function[n, k]`, with `n` being range, `k` being number of `1` digits. If I define `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the function should return the following set (in any order):               function[4, 2]      > >     {"1100", "1010", "1001", "0110", "0011", "0101"} >
