I've got a neighbor who has been trying to sell me insurance for my side business. His claim is that I could be sued by my clients if the software I produce does not perform properly or has bugs in it. It seems like a pretty broad claim, but I'm wondering about the truth to it. Can I indeed get sued by someone I do work for if bugs are found? If so, to what amount would I be liable?
