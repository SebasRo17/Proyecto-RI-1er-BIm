At my place of employment, we've had some serious growing pains. We went from a development team of 3 to 10, and the company itself has grow 30% in the past year. By most measurements, we're doing well. Unfortunately, the quality of our software has suffered. In a meeting today with my division's manager, I proposed a project team meeting a day or two after the product has launched. We could discuss budget concerns, scope, what went wrong, and what went right. Ideally, learning from our mistakes. We build sites/apps for other people, so our time is either billable on non-billable. A meeting like this would fall under the latter. My manager shot it down almost immediately: "That time isn't billable. It'll make us get behind on another project because we waste time at the end of that one talking about it." I was so caught off guard by this logic that I didn't even bother fighting him on it. So my question: I see the value is post-project meetings, but he doesn't. Is there **documented** proof of post-project meetings helping save time and money in the long (or short) run? Intuitively I think it will/would, but he clearly is more worried about a small amount of un-billable time from the 5 people that would need to be there.
