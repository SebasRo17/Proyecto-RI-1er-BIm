`C#` has the `decimal` type which is used for numbers that needs exact representation in base 10. For instance, `0.1` cannot be represented in base 2 (e.g. `float` and `double`) and will always be an approximation when stored in variables that are of these types. I was wondering if the reversed fact was also possible. Are there numbers that are not representable in base 10 but can be represented in base 2 (in which case I would want to use a `float` instead of a `decimal` to handle them)?
