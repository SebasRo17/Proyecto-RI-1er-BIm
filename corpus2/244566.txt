Consider such code (let's say it is C++)               Foo::Bar.get().X      How one should keep the AST for this -- as "tree" with root at left `Foo(Bar(get(X))`, or with root at right `(((Foo)Bar)get)X`? Or maybe as a flat structure (list)? The first one seems more convenient when resolving names, the second when working with it as expression. _I set tag`parsing` but I am asking from semantic analysis POV really (there is no such tag)._
