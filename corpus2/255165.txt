I've recently been looking at how me and my team uses Git and how our workflows work. We currently use a feature-branch workflow which seems to work well. I've also seen some individuals on our team use workflow based on git stash. The workflow goes something like this:   * Work on a main branch (like `master`)   * Make commits as you go   * If you need to get changes or switch branches, push your uncommitted changes onto the stash   * Once your updating is done, pop the changes off the stash. I should mention that this workflow is used _instead of_ a feature branch workflow. Instead of taking a branch and working on it, developers here only ever work on a single branch and push/pop off the stack as they see fit. I actually don't think this is a great workflow, and branching would be more appropriate than using git stash in this way. I can see the value of git stash as an emergency operation, but not for using it in a daily, regular workflow. Would using git stash regularly be considered an anti-pattern? If so, what are some specific problems that could arise? If not, what are the benefits?
