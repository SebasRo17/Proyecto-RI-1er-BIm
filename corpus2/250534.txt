I am looking to understand and implement the Onion Architecture and have a vague idea on how to structure everything but need help to clear up some of my confusion. ![Onion Architecture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iyWBg.png) Based on different examples and articles I Have read I created the above structure. One of my main confusion comes when I look at "02-Service: Services Interfaces". Lets take the IUserService.cs. I assume this interface would contain different signatures like RegisterUser(), LoginUser(), BanUser(), ModifyUser(), ChangeAuthenticationLevel() and so on? Is this correct? If not what other examples would we find? And are these considered Domain Services or Application Services?
