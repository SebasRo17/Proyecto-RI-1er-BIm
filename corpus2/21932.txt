I often have the following notebook in _Mathematica_ , which I use to make a dataset and associated errors:               x = {0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 20};     y = {979, 146, 141, 157, 187, 274};     uncY = Sqrt[y];     dataVector = Thread[{x, y}];      I want to make an ErrorListPlot, so I need to add `ErrorBar` with each `uncY`-value as an element in each data pair. So the final dataVector should have the form               {{x_i, y_i}, Errorbar[uncY_i]}      What is an easy way to achieve this, without using a `For`-loop?
