The following code produces plot with axes labels, which are jumping constantly.               object = Cuboid[{-100, -100, 300}, {100, 100, 500}];          screenWidth = 640;     screenHeight = 480;     screen = Polygon[{{-screenWidth/2, -screenHeight/2,           0}, {-screenWidth/2, screenHeight/2, 0}, {screenWidth/2,           screenHeight/2, 0}, {screenWidth/2, -screenWidth/2, 0}}];          spaceWidth = 2000;     spaceHeight = 2000;     spaceDepth = 2000;     Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.5], object}, Axes -> True,       AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0},       PlotRange -> {{-spaceWidth/2, spaceWidth/2}, {-spaceHeight/2,          spaceHeight/2}, {-spaceDepth/2, spaceDepth/2}},       AxesLabel -> {"X", "Y", "Z"}, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1}]      **Sample 1** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/06Y59.jpg) Cube is near Y label, although it is on Z axes. **Sample 2** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aaR6E.jpg) Cube is now near X label, after rotated infinitesimally.
