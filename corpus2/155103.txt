We use Linq2Sql in an ASP.NET application. Unfortunately the eager-loading in Linq2Sql isn't as powerful as in Entity Framework, so a lot of the data has to be lazy loaded as needed. Taking connection pooling into account, is it OK for a web page to execute 60 queries to load a page? Executing a single big query probably won't be much better, as those 60 queries will all those connection pooled connections and not open a new connection each time (which I realize is slow). Any thoughts?
