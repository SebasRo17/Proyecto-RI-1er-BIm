i ve just tried to do coding bat exercise. There are posted solutions to the problem i tried to solve. However, I was stubborn, i ignored them and tried to code it up my own way(basically reinventing my own wheel - square,bad working wheel). After 4 hours it looks nasty and fails some tests. Now i realize that my logic was totally wrong and wasteful. So the question :   * When do you start to give up solving problem your own way(reinventing the wheel) and start to look around to see other solution?    * How long should a developer be 'stubborn' in trying to find his 'unique' or complicated solution?    * When do you give up and begin to search for another logic?
