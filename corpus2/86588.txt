I have to create a table where each row needs to store 50 number values. Each row will always need to store 50 number values. If this was a smaller number of values, I would just make fields for each of the values, but because there are 50, this approach seems a bit cumbersome (but since it will always be 50 values, maybe this is the correct approach?). Is there a way to store an array of values in a field? This seems like a nice solution, but the concept is almost identical to creating a relational database.
