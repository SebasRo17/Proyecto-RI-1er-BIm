I'm working on a MVC4 N-tier application and have a quick question about Service to Controller relation and using Domain/ViewModel.                  public ActionResult Details(int id = 0)         {             TenantDomainModel tenant = _tenantService.GetById(id);             TenantViewModel tenantViewModel = Mapper.Map<TenantViewModel>(tenant);             return View(tenantViewModel);         }      As you can see my service return a DomainModel that my controller use to create a ViewModel using Automapper. Is there a better way to do that ? Ideally I would like to have no domain model referenced in my Presentation/Web layer but i'm not what are the exact best practice on this specific point. Thanks
