So I have been looking through some code I wrote a few years ago for an economic simulation program. Each simulation has a large number of settings that can be saved to a file and later loaded back into the program to re-run the same/similar simulation. Some of the settings are optional or depend on what is being simulated. The code to read back the parameters is basically one very large switch statement (with a few nested switch statements). I was wondering if there is a better way to handle this situation. One line of the settings file might look like this:               #RA:1,MT:DiscriminatoryPriceKDoubleAuction,OF:Demo Output.csv,QM:100,NT:5000,KP:0.5 //continues...      And some of the code that would read that line:               switch( Character.toUpperCase( s.charAt(0) ) )     {         case 'R':              randSeed = Integer.valueOf( s.substring(3).trim() );              break;         case 'M':               marketType = s.substring(3).trim();               System.err.println("MarketType: " + marketType);               break;         case 'O':               outputFileName = s.substring(3).trim() ;               break;         case 'Q':               quantityOfMarkets = Integer.valueOf( s.substring(3).trim() );               break;         case 'N':               maxTradesPerRound = Integer.valueOf( s.substring(3).trim() );               break;         case 'K':               kParameter = Float.valueOf( s.substring(3).trim() );               break;      // continues...     }
