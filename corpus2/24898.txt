I want to find the major color (the color which appears most often) in a picture and do some analysis later. For example, if I have this picture: ![my picture](http://i.imgur.com/Wd9lPRa.jpg) What I want to do is find out that gray, red, black, and yellow are major colors in the picture. I thought this could be done by getting a histogram with the X-axis as colors (red, blue, yellow, etc.), and the Y-axis as proportions in the image. And once I get that histogram, I can retrieve the highest color by comparing the Y-values. I read some examples of `ImageHistogram`, `ImageLevels` and some other color- related functions, but I still don't know how to do this. Any idea is welcome.
