I have two different programs for simulating a system. when I get the results I have plotting result for each. now I want to combine both drawings so that I compare between them. I want to put both of them on the same picture. How I can do that? for example; I will attach two drawings. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YBpJR.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1b5Wc.jpg) my second question is that how to change the color of the line after drawing?
