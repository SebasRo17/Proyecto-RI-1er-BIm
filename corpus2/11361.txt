I'm trying to replicate a graph from my math book for my notes as well as to learn Mathematica. I was hoping someone would be able to help me figure out how to add the open points to the graph, and possibly add a slight curve to the lines as shown in the real graph. My lines are straight. The Graph from the book: ![](http://i.imgur.com/tRcRM.jpg) What I've been able to come up with:                  g[x_] := \[Piecewise] {        {x + 1, x < 1},        {-x + 3, x < 2},        {(x + 2) - 2, x < 3},        {-x + 6, x < 4}       }          Plot[g[x], {x, 0, 5},       PlotStyle -> {Thick}, PlotRange -> {0, 5},      Ticks -> {{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, Automatic},      GridLines -> {{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}},      GridLinesStyle -> Directive[LightGray, Dashed],      Epilog -> {Red, Dashed, PointSize[Large],        Point[{{0, 1}, {1, 3}, {2, 1}, {4, 2}}]        }      ]
