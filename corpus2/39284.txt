I'm reading through the CNN article about the highest paying jobs in America. A software architect is listed as #1. A software engineer listed as #9. And a software developer (programmer) is listed at #35. I think it's valid to replace computer scientist with programmer, right? Prior to this I always saw "Software Engineers" as being the title for experienced programmers and team leads. But where then does a "Software Architect" fit in and what exactly do they do? I read the CNN descriptions but they don't really satisfy me so I'm assuming I can get more thorough and experienced descriptions from the awesome user base here. Thanks in advance for any and all responses received.
