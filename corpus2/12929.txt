I have been going through Flask and it seems that now I have a decent understanding to go ahead and build a web application. However I want to know how would I approach the problem. For eg: I decide to build a blogging application. The first thing I do is write down all the things that come to my mind, from user registrations to posting data on the blog to publishing it on the site But after that I just get into coding. I know that is not the right approach. I have heard of UML diagrams, workflow diagrams and stuff. It would be great if someone could just outline the steps they would follow for building a large application and then I could go ahead and learn more about them.For eg,it could be something like the below:-   1. Collect requirements   2. Draw UML diagrams   3. Draw workflow diagrams   4. Start coding Please suggest an exhaustive list so that I can make my approach much more systematic. Thanks
