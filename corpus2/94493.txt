I am a fresher working in an Antivirus company in India. We work in Delphi 7. now i know that delphi is not very widely used. My concern is that I will be something of a pariah in the industry dominated by Java and C etc. Also, my company is not that great. I would like to switch to a bigger company in near future. Can you tell me some companies (mnc) which do their projects in delphi? Thanks
