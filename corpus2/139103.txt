So I need some help with Verification & Validation of software. So I know the definitions of both but ... I can't really find any real entry level books about the process from setting up the requirements of a customer, to making the finished product. And of course, making sure you tested it to what you think it should do, and what the customer actually wants. Can anyone recommend me any good entry level books, blogs, pretty much anything that just gives an overview of V&V? I'm pretty much just looking for concrete methods/examples on how to deal with all. I have looked, and found some good (advanced, if you ask me) texts scratching the surface of V&V, but nothing entry level :( Any help is greatly appreciated.
