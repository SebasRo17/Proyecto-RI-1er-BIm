I have a huge data file which I need to do some analysis on it. The file is built in this way that for each 4 variables, there is a value of the function:               List={{x,y,z,w},f[x,y,z,w]}      A part of the real data is the following `List`:               tab={{{0.0001, 1., -1., 1.*10^-6}, 0.6704}, {{0.0001, 1., -0.85,3.98107*10^-6}, 0.964659}, {{0.0001, 1., -0.7,0.0000199526}, 0.491676}, {{0.0001, 1., -0.55, 0.0001}, 0.0974736}};      For each value of the `x` and `y` parameters, I need to `NIntegrate` with respect to `z` and `w`. If I could have the whole function wrt all parameters, `f[x,y,z,t]`, I would do:               tab2=Flatten[Table[{{x,y},NIntegrate[f[x,y,z,w], {z,zmin,zmax},{w,wmin,wmax}]},{x,xmin,xmax},{y,ymin,ymax}],1];      and then I would `Interpolate` `tab2` with respect to `{x,y}`:               final=Interpolation[tab2];      I have almost 4 million points, I can do the analysis in this way, but how can I be sure that the `Interpolation` function is a correct function, while there are too many approximations to make it? I know that `Interpolation` works for any n-dimension, but it won't be acurate anymore for more than 2 parameters. Is there a way that I do this kind of analysis without needning to `Interpolate` with respect to all parameters? For example is there a way that I can just `Interpolate` with respect to `{z,w}`, I do the `Integration`, then I `Interpolate` the result with respect to `{x,y}`?
