I have two tables, `project` and `photo`. `photo` has `ID`,`projectID`,`path` : each `project` has multiple `photo`s. Now one of these `photo`s is the one that has to be displayed. The question is how to represent this in the database. Earlier, I used descending order of `ID` numbers and chose the latest one, but that failed and caused problems. Now I am not sure which way to go :   * Create a new table `projectPhotoDisplayed` that holds `project`.`ID` and `photo`.`ID`(those that are to be displayed only) numbers.   The bad : too much work, as well as replicating the information that `photo` table already has (`photo`s associated with `project`s ).   * Create a new binary field in the `photo` table. If true, then display, else not.   The bad : Structurally does not prevent multiple `photo`s being marked to display. I want radio button behavior   * Create a new field in the `project` table that stores the `photoID` of the `photo` to be displayed.   The bad : Does not ensure that the particular `photoID` is actually linked to this `project`. Also does this information belong here?   * Any approach with foreign keys so that referential integrity is maintained..? Using PHP and MySQL InnoDB database, though I'm sure it won't matter. Which is the best way to store this info?
