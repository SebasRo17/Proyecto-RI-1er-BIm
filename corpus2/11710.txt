How can I calculate the Asymptotic Rate of growth of a function, for instance like: $X^3 - X^2 - X -1$ EDIT: For instance, as you can see in this graph, after the 1200 the function approximates to the limit. I want to if there is a easy way to calculate the rate of grow, after 1200 for instance. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FejWE.png) **Edit** I'm trying to find a generalized way in order to graphically find it for Fibonacci, Tribonacci, Tetranacci sequences
