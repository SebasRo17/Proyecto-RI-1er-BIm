I am in the middle of refactoring code and would like to get some ideas on variable naming so that my new names clearly represent the data they hold. I have a class called `ContactMethod` which makes sense to me; each instance is a different way to contact someone. My problem comes when naming the properties of `ContactMethod`. For example, one instance might be a Fax number of 555-555-5555 while another could be an Email address of bob@email.com; I've got a property called `contactMethodType` to hold the values "fax" or "email", but I don't know what to call the "555-555-5555" or "bob@email.com" part. Has anyone here created a good generic name for this piece of contact information? _(PS - the old convention was to call it a "Phone" with fields "phoneType" holding the "fax"/"email" value and "phoneId" holding the number/address. Yuck.)_
