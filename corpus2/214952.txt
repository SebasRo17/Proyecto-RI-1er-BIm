I understand how GitHub works, but one thing I've been confused about is, why almost every OSS project lately has a "Fork me on GitHub" link on their homepage. For example, http://jqtjs.com/, http://www.daviddurman.com/flexi-color-picker/, and others. Why is this so common? Is it that they want/need code validation, checking for security/performance improvements that they may not know how to do? Is it meant to show that this is a collaborative project - you're welcome to add improvements? Do they work for GitHub, or want to promote their service? Oddly enough, I don't think I've seen a "Fork project on Bitbucket" logo recently. My first reaction to that logo was that the project probably needs to be modified (forked) in order to integrate it with anything useful - or that they are encouraging fragmented codebase, encouraging everyone to make their own fork of the project. But I don't think that is the intent.
