Suppose that we have the given simple integral expression $$ \int_{-5}^{5} x \int_{-\infty}^{x} e^{\int_{0}^{z} -y dy} dz dx $$ Writing this out in _Mathematica_ we obtain:               Integrate[x Integrate[Exp[Integrate[-y, {y, 0, z}]], {z, -\[Infinity], x}], {x, -5., 5}]     30.0795      ### Question: Is it possible to do a numerical integration on this expression by using `NIntegrate`? A very naive attempt gives us the following errors:               NIntegrate[x NIntegrate[Exp[NIntegrate[-y, {y, 0, z}]], {z, -\[Infinity], x}], {x, -5, 5}]      > NIntegrate::nlim: y = z is not a valid limit of integration Notice that we want everything to be a numerical integration, this includes the inner integrals. The problem is that one of the `NIntegrate`s is an argument to the exponential function and this does not allow us to write the double integral with only one `NIntegrate` as mentioned in here ### Motivation I'm trying to evaluate an expression that is too complicated for Mathematica to do symbolically and it is composed on integrals of the kind mentioned above.
