As a simple example of what I would like to do, suppose I have a list `a` of all real numbers. I would like to perform a simple check to see if _some_ element of `a` is positive. Of course, I could do this with a simple loop, but I feel as if _Mathematica_ would have a more efficient way of doing this, in the spirit of functional programming. Is there, or do I just have to do this with a clumsy loop:               test=False; For[counter=1;counter<=Length[a];counter++;If[a[[counter]]>0,test=True;];];
