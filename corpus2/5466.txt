Sometimes I can't stand it when project managers ask me to estimate time to complete for various tasks. An estimate is a guess, and guesses can be wrong. Generally, bad requirements and documentation will lead to bad guesses. So I often wonder if the project managers were ever in my shoes trying to guess at how long task X and Y will take, and how difficult it is to assign a number to it based on what little is known and collected from the client. My question then is: **Do good project managers need to have a programming background?** Or maybe the question should be, **do good project managers need to have been a _good_ programmer before?** Is there any correlation?
