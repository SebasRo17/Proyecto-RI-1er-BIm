I'm writing a specification for a project, and am struggling with separating functional specification from technical specification (see http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html). For example, I'm trying to specify the behaviour when a user requests a list of Foo objects they have visibility on. In the functional specification, should I describe what precisely is returned (i.e. the structure of a Foo object) or just that the system returns a list of them and then put the details of the Foo object in the technical specification? The design is for an API in case that makes any difference. I can't find many examples of how such an API specification is written.
