This post helped me out somewhat but it is missing a piece that I really need for something that I am working on that's more complex than what I've shown below. I want to disable a `Locator` when its corresponding tab is not selected, I've achieved this using the method in the link, however it is slow (not with this simple code), `ContinuousAction->False` doesn't affect it, and when I click anywhere within the plot range the `Locator` does not move there and I haven't been able to change this.               clip[pt : {x_, y_}, {xMin_, yMin_}, {xMax_, yMax_}] := {Clip[        x, {xMin, xMax}], Clip[y, {yMin, yMax}]}          Manipulate[      Switch[ctrl,       1, Show[        Graphics[{          {Thick, Line[{{-3, 0}, {point1[[1]], point1[[2]]}}]},          Locator[Dynamic[point1, (point1 = clip[#, {-3, -2}, {3, 2}]) &],            Enabled -> True]          }, PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}}]        ],       2, Show[        Graphics[{          {Thick, Red, Line[{{3, 0}, {point2[[1]], point2[[2]]}}]},          Locator[Dynamic[point2, (point2 = clip[#, {-3, -2}, {3, 2}]) &],            Enabled -> True]          },         PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}}]        ]       ],      {{ctrl, 1, ""}, {1 -> "black", 2 -> "red"}, SetterBar},      {{point1, {0, 1}}, None},      {{point2, {0, -1}}, None}]      I'm not sure if it's possible, or if there is a completely different way of going about enabling/disabling individual locators (that isn't super messy). I just want to do that and also be able to use options like `ContinuousAction->False` and be able to click anywhere within the plot range and have the locator "jump" there. What I've provided above is more or less what I learned from the other post, below is a short example of what I originally had.               Manipulate[      Switch[ctrl,       1, Show[        Graphics[{Thick, Line[{{-3, 0}, {point1[[1]], point1[[2]]}}]},          PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}}]        ],       2, Show[        Graphics[{Thick, Red, Line[{{3, 0}, {point2[[1]], point2[[2]]}}]},          PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-2, 2}}]        ]       ],      {{ctrl, 1, ""}, {1 -> "black", 2 -> "red"}, SetterBar},      {{point1, {0, 1}}, Locator},      {{point2, {0, -1}}, Locator}]
