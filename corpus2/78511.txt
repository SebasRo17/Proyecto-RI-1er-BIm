Mid-level PHP programmer here. I plan on teaching myself Java. I'm already familiar with the basic concepts like MVC, ORM's etc.. so I'm not a beginner programmer. As such, I'm looking for the best way to begin familarising myself with the nuances of a languange I am inexperienced with. For starters, I have begun coding up a simple login/logout mechanism using JSP and have enjoyed making some decent progress. So, my question to any and all Java gurus: What aspects of Java should I delve into first? My plan is currently to continue with a simple app in JSP, then introduce Spring and Hibernate before moving onto concurrency and Swing. If you had to re-learn java from scratch, what path through the different technologies and concepts is the best to take?
