I wonder, why small values (eg. 10^-1600) would not show on a plot? Here is a small example, where Evaluate gives a list of very small values and Plot does not show them, starting from x=20.               testfunc[x_] := 10^(-16 x)      testvalues = {x -> {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100}};     Evaluate[testfunc[x]] /. testvalues     LogPlot[Evaluate[testfunc[x]], {x, 1, 100}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 10^-1600}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D9jkY.jpg) I guess it has something to do with precision, but I could not find any solution for Plot function yet and would appreciate any help. Had no luck with SetPrecision/WorkingPrecision.
