I've been convinced for awhile now that some strategies in functional programming are better suited to a number of computations (i.e immutability of data structures). However, due to the popularity of imperative languages, its unlikely that I will always be working on projects that are functionally implemented. Many languages (Matlab, Python, Julia) support using a functional paradigm, but it feels tacked on in many cases (looking at you, anonymous functions in Matlab). That being said, what are functional methods and strategies that I can use even in OOP/Imperative code? How can I write solid functional code that does not allow side effects even in languages that have mutable state and global variables?
