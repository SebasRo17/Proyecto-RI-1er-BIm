I want to solve eqn for c0. I want to do it with both replacement rules. I realize I could just use solve twice, once for subsCoke, and once for subsPepsi. I'm trying to do it in just one Sovle to learn how to use mathematicas functional style better.               eqn = c0/(c0 + cs) == Iunk/Is     subsCoke = {cO -> c0, cs -> 2, Iunk -> 0.3995, Is -> 0.7339};     subsPepsi = {c0 -> c0, cs -> 2, Iunk -> 0.3915, Is -> 0.7645};     Solve[eqn  /. {subsCoke, subsPepsi}, c0]
