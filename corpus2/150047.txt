I have an online document which essentially gets stored to the database as XML string. I'm thinking about a way to implement versioning of the document for the user. So that user can go back to previous versions of the document. **update** In my case it's a web application with hundreds of thousands of users. A user can store unlimited amount of documents. The XML for document is stored in MySQL blob field so it's not small. Eventually I need to cap the limits somehow but that is a different topic all together. Is there a standard way to approach this? Should I store only the differences between versions? What are other things that I need to consider?
