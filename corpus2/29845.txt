Example: You create an abstract class for Ajax actions. Different Ajax actions will all extend this class. Problem:   1. Do you name the class AjaxAction or AbstractAjaxAction?   2. When you create subclasses, do you name them:      * Action     * AjaxAction     * Just name them what they are I have not been able to find what the "official" convention is. I don't see a need for the "Abstract" prefix or any _required_ naming convention in the subclasses. (It may fit anyway, depending.) Is there an official convention? Could you link me to it? And what are your opinions on this subject?
