**Just ran across this user story form:**               "As a <user role>, I can <activity> so that <business value>"      (source-1 and source-2) **which to me seems different than what I believe to be the "standard" one:**               "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire>, so that <benefit>"      (source-1 and source-2) (Meaning that I'd believe "I can" would be in the "benefit/value" statement, not the "goal" statement. For example, "So that I can [...].") **Are both right, or is one flawed, and why?**
