I'm trying to send some HTML table using _Mathematica_ `SendMail` function. To do it I wrote this function:               createHTMLTable[list_List] /; Length[Dimensions@list] == 2 :=       Module[{r, head, data}, head = First@list;       data = Rest@list;       head = Map["   <th>" <> ToString[#] <> "</th>\n" &, {head}, {2}];       data = Map["   <td>" <> ToString[#] <> "</td>\n" &, data, {2}];       headData = Join[{head}, data];       r = "<tr>\n" <> StringJoin[##] <> "</tr>\n" & /@ headData // StringJoin;       r = "<!DOCTYPE html>                 <html>                 <body>                     <table border=\"1\">                         " <> r <> "                     </table>                 </body>                 </html>"       ]      When I send the mail, as in this example:               list = RandomInteger[100000, {10, 3}]          SendMail["From" -> "test@test.com", "To" -> "test@test.com",       "Subject" -> "Sending Email from Mathematica", "Body" -> createHTMLTable[list],       "Server" -> "XXXXX"]      there is no table in the mail, but only the HTML text. Anyone knows how to correct this? Is there another way to do it?
