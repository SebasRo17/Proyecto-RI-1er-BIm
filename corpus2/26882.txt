I have a function that's represented as a long list of values that I want to integrate. I can do it procedurally with Simpson's rule. ListConvolve generally runs faster then procedural code, so i would like to use it if I can find the right kernel. My list can be of even or odd length, and for the latter I would like to use a method that is better than the trapezoid method. Is there a higher order method for this case?
