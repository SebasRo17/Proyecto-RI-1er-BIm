I often run database queries that return sets of {date, datum} objects. A hypothetical query looks like               testData = SQLExecute[commodDB, "select date,price from commoddb.tbcommodprices     where futurePrefix='XB'"];      and the results look like               {{SQLDateTime[{2005, 10, 3}], 188.88}, {SQLDateTime[{2005, 10, 4}],      184.53}, {SQLDateTime[{2005, 10, 5}],      176.5}, {SQLDateTime[{2005, 10, 6}],      172.}, {SQLDateTime[{2005, 10, 7}] . . . etc}      To do anything useful with these, I need to convert the SQLDateTime[] objects into Mathematica datelists. With the example above, this can be done with               Map[{#[[1]][[1]], #[[2]]} &, testData]      But this takes longer than I would like; I feel as though this conversion is trivial and should be basically instantaneous, but for typical queries (which admittedly return thousands of results), the conversion takes half a second or more. Can anybody suggest a quicker way to convert my SQLDateTime[]s into DateLists? Thanks.
