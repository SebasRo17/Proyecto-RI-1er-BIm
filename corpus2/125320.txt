I am working on a fairly big project and got the task to do some translations for it. There were tons of labels that haven't been translated and while I was digging through the code I found this little piece of code               //TODO translations      This made me think about the sense of these comments to yourself (and others?) because I got the feeling that most developers after they get a certain piece of code done and it does what it's supposed to do they never look at this until they have to maintain it or add new functionality. So that this `TODO` will be lost for a long time. Does it make sense to write this comments or should they be written on a whiteboard/paper/something else where they remain in the focus of developers?
