I have used Java Modeling Language (JML) with its runtime assertion checker jml4c for writing code contracts in java. However, it would have been great to have a static checker in place as well that provides suggestions as to where a contract is possibly broken during the build process, something like the code- contracts library developed for the .NET platform. Esc/Java2 does this for java version 1.4. Is there any such tool that supports java 1.6?
