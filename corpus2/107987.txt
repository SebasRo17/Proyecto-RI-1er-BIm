I was using Microsoft SQL Query Analyzer the other day and wrote a very simple select statement:               SELECT 22/7 as [PI Equiv]      I was suprized that the result was 3, when I was expecting to see 3.1428571. Even if you declare the output to be `Numeric(18,7)`, you still get 3.0000000.               DECLARE @Answer Numeric(18,7)     SET @Answer = 22/7     SELECT @Answer as [PI Equiv]          RESULT = 3.0000000      What other languages return integer values when the dividend and divisor are both integers?
