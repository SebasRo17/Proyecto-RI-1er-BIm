s = NDSolve[{f'''[eta] + 0.5*f[eta]*f''[eta] == 0.0, f[0] == 0.0,      f'[0] == 0.0, f'[Infinity] = 1.0}, f, {eta, 0, 1}];     Plot[Evaluate[f[eta] /. s], {eta, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> All]      I don't understand why this doesn't work. I followed exactly the instructions from the site. I get the following error (among others)               NDSolve::deqn: Equation or list of equations expected instead of 1.` in the first argument
