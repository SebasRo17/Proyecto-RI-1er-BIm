This question has it's roots in a SharePoint site that I am help with. ### Background on the issue I dealt with: The dev box and integration server are not setup behind a load balancer. The links were being built using the HttpRequest.Url value from the current context. Note that the links weren't relative links but full URIs. Once we deployed to testing (which has a LB, amongst other things) we received errors on the links being built since the server had an address of "http://some.site.org:999" while the address at the LB as "https://site.org" (SSL was off-loaded at the LB). The fix was easy enough by using relative URIs. ### The Question: Since this is the first site I've worked with that's behind a Load Balancer on I'm wondering if there are other gotcha's that I need to consider when developing a site behind one?
