There is a decent Wikipedia article on the "Feature Creep", but it doesn't state an origin. A Google search only leads to some vague article claiming "Earl Rich" coined the term, but there isn't much backup for that claim. There is a Dilbert comic from 2001 on the subject, but the tone seems to imply that the term pre-existed; more or less confirmed by the fact that Google has results pre-2000. However, finding the exact origin proofs difficult. So, who, if anyone at all, coined the term "Feature Creep"? Where does it come from?
