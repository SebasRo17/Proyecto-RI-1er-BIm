I have been advocating lately that all string fields should be ntext / nvarchar(max) - we're using MS SQL Server. The objections seem to be either "it's not a good idea" (without any reason) or "that would allow the customer to send a lot of crap". Since I believe in filtering out the crap before it hits the database, is there a _good_ reason why my idea is bad? My main argument for not limiting the string fields is that I have discovered that we have about six different types of addresses (customer, reseller and so on), with about 20 markets (each having its own database) and environments. I have spotted at least ten different lengths for say Address1 and the same thing happens for other fields. Instead of "standardizing" them and then discovering that we missed something, I suggested that we go ahead and limit the inputs and let the database handle anything. Does anyone have a pro/con I don't see? (I have seen Rule of thumb for field sizes but my focus is "is making everything max sized wrong?")
