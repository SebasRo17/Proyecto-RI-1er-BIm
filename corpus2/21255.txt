I've made a gauge like instrument that will get used to prompt someone to maintain rhythmic breathing patterns during heart/brain coherence training.               Manipulate[ListLinePlot[(Table[#, {10}] & /@ Range[10]) a,       PlotRange -> {{0, 11}, {0, 10}},       AspectRatio -> 3.5,       ImageSize -> 100,       PlotStyle -> LightGray,       Axes -> {False, True},       Filling -> Axis,       FillingStyle -> LightGreen,       Frame -> True,       FrameTicks -> {{True, True}, {None, None}}       ], {a, 0, 1},      Paneled -> False,      ControlType -> None,      AutorunSequencing -> 3      ]      Note that after executing the code you'll need to click on the `+` in the upper right corner of the output to get to `Autorun`, which will get you the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iwDIu.png) This nicely runs up and down, but now I'd like the ability to set four things programatically.   * A default speed at which the gauge will run up (e.g., 5 seconds);    * A default speed at which the gauge will run down (e.g., 4 seconds);    * A timed delay at the bottom (e.g., 2 seconds, which I currently kind of hack with `AutorunSequencing -> 3`); and    * A timed delay at the top. I had originally tried doing this with `Animate[]`, but it seemed to have too many limitations. Maybe the same holds for `Manipulate[]` and I have to go to basics with `Dynamic[]`. I thought it worth asking. Any suggestions welcomed.
