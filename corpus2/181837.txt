I have a tiny project (<1k but let's say its <5k of lines). I made it open source and put it on github. I did this once before and I didn't get a single download nor fork but that was very specific and this tiny project is very useable to other programmers. It's open source (let's say LGPL, GPL, public domain or somewhere in between these). What can I do other than let it rot on my computer/online while only I use it? I'll keep this as generic as possible and won't link my stuff.
