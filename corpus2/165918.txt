I've just been hired as a member of a group that is developing in C++. For the last 11 years, I'd been coding on and off at my last job (some C, some Fortran, some C++). The coding I'd done was mostly maintaining and adding new features to one of our systems. The code, being 10 years old, did not contain all the modern C++ stuff. Lo and behold, my new job is filled with programmers with 5-10 years experience of pure coding and they all use the most modern aspects of C++ (C++11, template, lambda, etc, etc). They are expecting someone with that same experience... which I have: I've been working for 15 years total, but when I look at their code, I can't understand half of it! :-| Anyone been in that situation? What would you recommend?
