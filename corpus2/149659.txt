I'm interested in seeing how other people do this. Especially in situations where multiple different clients are using the same software base with slightly different business rules. What kind of practices do you use to document how everything is supposed to work or business rules. Basically so when a new developer comes on the team is easy access to see how things are supposed to work because there's obviously a difference between making something bug free and making something work properly. It would be really nice to have a go to resource rather than having to bring an architect or BSA into the conversation every time a question comes up on how something should be processed.
