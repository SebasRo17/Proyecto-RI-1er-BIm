I am looking all over internet to find a logic to convert an Algebraic Expression into a Binary Tree. I could only find ones where you first convert the algebra expression to postfix or prefix and then convert it to Binary Tree. I am just curious to know , if its possible. Any pointers to external links or logical answers to put me in the right direction ? * * * yes A Syntax Tree So this expression               A+(B-C)*D+E*F      should be translated into                             |-(+)-|                   |     |         |---(*)---|     |---(*)---|         |         |     |         |     |---(+)---|   D     E         F     |         |     |         |     A   |--( - )--|         |         |         B          C
