From a given tree, subsequent trees have to be generated. Nodes can be marked as "variant" in the given tree (the example uses an asterisk to mark the node). All possible combinations between the variants form the resulting trees. From the following tree:               - Product         - Packaging *             - Small box             - Heavy box *                 - Eco                 - Non-eco         - Delivery *             - Standard             - Express      The following 6 trees should be generated:               - Product         - Packaging              - Small box         - Delivery             - Standard          - Product         - Packaging             - Small box         - Delivery             - Express          - Product         - Packaging             - Heavy box                 - Eco         - Delivery             - Standard          - Product         - Packaging             - Heavy box                 - Eco         - Delivery             - Express          - Product         - Packaging             - Heavy box                 - Non-eco         - Delivery             - Standard          - Product         - Packaging             - Heavy box                 - Non-eco         - Delivery             - Express      Is there an elegant algorithm for this (recursive solution)?
