`FilledCurve` can create a 2D graphics object; for example:               a = {{-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}}; b = {{0, -(2/3)}};     Graphics[FilledCurve[{{BezierCurve[2 a], Line[2 b]}, {BezierCurve[a], Line[b]}}]]       ![a FilledCurve in 2D](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aXVBq.jpg) How can I put a `Graphics3D` object like this on a plane, say $z=0$, and create something like the following 3D graphic (without mapping it on a polygon as a texture)? ![a 3D version?](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nTWnC.jpg)
