I have been asked to build what is essentially a query builder for a reporting application. The variety of objects to query, potential modifiers, number of conditions, and so forth to be reported on have made me conclude that a query builder would be the best way to go about this task. I am trying to decide the data model to back the storage of query parameters. I have seen the models in this SO question as well as in this tutorial. But since it feels especially important to pick a good model up front, I would really appreciate any input. Here is my current approach... please critique as I know it is not too good. **Query**   * QueryID   * QueryName, QueryDescription, etc **Entity** \- _ie Dog, Planet, Employee_   * EntityID   * EntityName, EntityDescription, etc **AttributeType** \- _ie INTEGER, DECIMAL, FLOAT_   * AttributeTypeID   * AttributeTypeName, AttributeTypeDescription, etc **BinaryOperator** \- _ie =, <, IS_   * BinaryOperatorID   * BinaryOperatorName, BinaryOperatorDescription, etc **AttributeTypeToBinaryOperator** \- _ie (INTEGER, >), (BOOLEAN, IS)_   * AttributeTypeID   * BinaryOperatorID **EntityAttribute**   * EntityAttributeID   * EntityID   * AttributeTypeID   * EntityAttributeName, EntityAttributeDescription, etc **EntityAttributeCondition** \- _ie Dog.Breed = 'dachshund'_   * ConditionID   * EntityAttributeID   * BinaryOperatorID   * ConditionRawValue - _ie 14, false, Tom_ **EntityAttributeConditionGroup** \- _ie (a AND b)_   * ConditionGroupID   * LeftConditionID   * RightConditionID   * LogicalOperatorEnum - _ie AND, OR, XOR_ **EntityAttributeConditionGroupToGroup** \- _ie (a AND b) OR (c OR d)_   * LeftConditionGroupID   * RightConditionGroupID   * LogicalOperatorEnum
