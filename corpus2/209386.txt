Developers in large companies usually have multiple specification documents that they write at each phase of the software in question. I've heard of some of them and would like someone to tell me of all specs documents that exist. For example, I've heard of estimation doc (written before project starts), high-level specs, low-level specs and implementation specs. Are there more of them? Can you sort them as they appear in the lifecycle of some application? Note: the reason for this question is that I have to delegate some project to another person and I would have to write all these specs docs. Somehow, I don't think that writing low-level specs is always the best solution (if I am wrong, let me know) so that is why I asked this question.
