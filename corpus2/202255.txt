Sometimes, the syntax of a language seems weird, I often think, why would someone make something like that, but definitely there is a reason and a history behind every aspect of a programming language. Apart from being fascinating, It helps me remember the syntax and also the purpose that language solves. Does knowing the background of languages like HTML & CSS ( _Okay, these are not programming-languages but still_ ) JavaScript, C++, Objective C and even Java help in understanding the aspects of these languages?
