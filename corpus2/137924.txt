I'm a developer that creates Open Source code for a small language (LabVIEW), and am currently sharing this in several places. The vendor of LabVIEW has a certification process for Open Source libraries (mixed with commercial/closed libraries), but it's rather lengthy. I was wondering how more popular languages manage large repositories of libraries (for instance Debian, or python-works) of Open Source libraries, are those strictly controlled and monitored for quality or can anyone contribute?   * How would one set up the process for a centralized repository and accept incoming code?   * Are there different levels of quality/trustworthy?    * Is it allowed to rely on libraries outside the repository?
