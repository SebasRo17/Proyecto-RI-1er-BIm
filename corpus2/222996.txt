I have read several posts which discuss coding standard for naming the unit test methods for improving readability. I follow this `NameOfMethod_ExpectedBehavior_WhenSomeScenario`, but now I am confused as to how should I continue with this in the face of overloaded methods. There can be several methods with same name but different signatures. Can someone please suggest me how to incorporate overloading in method names? For example: Java Code               class ClassUnderTest{         public int method1(){         }              public int method1(int arg){         }     }      Now I need to test both the methods individually from my test case. I am thinking of some standard that is applicable for this scenario.
