This came up in relation to this answer Is it possible to set a timeout for `LinkWrite`? `LinkWrite` seems to block until the sent data is read on the other end of the link. Can it block indefinitely or does it have a long timeout? If it doesn't have a default timeout, is it possible to set one? ### An example Let's create two new kernels in the front end (this might overwrite your existing kernels, but it will be reversed after restarting the front end):               SetOptions[$FrontEndSession,       EvaluatorNames -> {"Local" -> {"AutoStartOnLaunch" -> True},         "K1" -> {"AutoStartOnLaunch" -> False},         "K2" -> {"AutoStartOnLaunch" -> False}}]      Then open two new notebooks, and in the first one evaluate               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], Evaluator -> "K2"]          link = LinkCreate["alink"]          LinkWrite[link, "boo"]      In the second one evaluate               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], Evaluator -> "K1"]          link = LinkConnect["alink"]          LinkRead[link]      `LinkWrite` in the first one will only return after `LinkRead` has finished evaluating in the second one. * * * If the answer is that it's not possible to set a timeout, that can be reasonable too. I was wondering about this: suppose we're running a long parallel calculation, and we interrupt the main kernel to enter a subsession and inspect the state (`Evaluation -> Interrupt -> Enter subsession`). Is it possible that one of the parallel kernels will time out while trying to send the result, and the calculation won't be able to resume after returning from the subsession?
