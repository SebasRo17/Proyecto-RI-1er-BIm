With Ruby on Rails I've usually used **Forgery** for generating dummy data for testing. I've noticed recently that several clients and tutorials are using **Faker** They both seem fairly similar in use and popularity:   **Faker** 128 forks, 418 watchers.   **Forgery** 59 forks, 399 watchers. They both seem similar in how current they are:   **Faker** Most updates are from 6 and 9 months ago.   **Forgery** Most updates are from 4 and 9 months ago. The one distinguishing factor I've found so far is that **Forgery** seems like it has better instructions. Are there any particular _benefits_ or _disadvantages_ to using one over the other?   Have you ever needed to switch from one to another for a particular reason?
