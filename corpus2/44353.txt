I have a set of 1million 2D points and I would like to produce an image 200x200 pixels where each point will have the size of a pixel (no more). Additionally each point may repeats several times so I would like to add some weight on it (small number of repetitions ->Light Green , ... , large number of repetitions ->Dark Green) I am experimenting with the following data set before I use the real one :               data = Flatten[        Table[Table[{i, j} k, {i, 1, 50}, {j, 1, 50}], {k, 1, 10, .5}], 2];      So which is the correct PointSize in my case and how can I set the intensity of each point ? I am not that experienced on Graphics so I would appreciate any insight.
