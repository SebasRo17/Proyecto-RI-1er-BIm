I'm looking at a programming language design decision that's difficult to make precisely because there seems to be no objective basis for choosing one option over the other. The question is, given that a language doesn't have a `++` operator, would the better choice for an increment operator be as in C:               a += 1     a += b      or as in some versions of Pascal:               inc a     inc a b      (And similarly with `-=` vs `dec` of course.) Considerations I can see for `inc`:   * Slightly shorter for the typical case where the delta is 1.   * Less familiar to most programmers.   * Eliminates the corresponding `*=` etc operators, which are much less commonly used. Is there anything I'm missing?
