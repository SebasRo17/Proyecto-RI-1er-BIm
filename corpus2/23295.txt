At work we have a few older projects that are stuck on .NET 1.1 and VS 2003. While these are probably to much work now to move forward I'm wondering if the effort to keep our newer projects up to date will be worth it. Specifically we would be looking at moving about 30 projects from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.0 and VS2008 to VS2010. My Questions for the community are: **Do you move your projects along as new tools and libraries become available or just start the newest stuff in the newest versions? If you do move forward have you found the benefits out weigh the cost of the upgrade?**
