Suppose I have some project in `Wolfram Workbench`. In some packages need DatabaseLink`. I write it in this way:               BeginPackage["test`"]     Needs["DatabaseLink`"];          test::usage="";          Begin["`Private`"]          test[x_]:=SQLConnections[];          End[]          EndPackage[]      All work fine. But autocompletion of DatabaseLink functions don't work. How can I use autocompletion for imported contexts (applications)?
