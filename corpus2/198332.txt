I've been trying to think outside of the box as to how desktop GUIs can be designed in code(not a graphical designer!). I've come across basically three ways this is done:   1. XML   2. Raw code (create a window, create a text box, add text box to window, etc)   3. HTML and friends I'm sure that someone has done something other than these three though. Are there any existing examples of frameworks or languages which allow you to code a GUI using a format other than these three
