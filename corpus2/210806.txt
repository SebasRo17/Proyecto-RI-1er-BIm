Naming a variable or class, for example, must adhere to certain rules (such as not allowing keywords or reserved words as identifiers) I really don't want to code my own method to do such a thing. Does java have something already built in? My goal is that I am building an expression builder / code generator. It will recognize user specified variables and these must respect java's identifier rules or a warning is presented to user to rename his variable.
