On applying a multiplication and subtraction on a list, like so:               x = 2y - 4;      Where y is a list containing fractions of complex numbers generated from dynamic input, instead of getting a new list with that operation applied to each element of the list, instead the output is simplified, in the form:               -4 + 2{element1, element2, element3, etc}      This means I can't then apply normal list functions to x. How can I convert this style of input into just one list:               {-4 + element1, -4 + element2, -4 + element3}      When I make y non-dynamic, it formats it correctly, so that seems to be part of the issue. My exact code is this:               mirror[v_] := v^2     a = 3;     b = 4;     {Slider2D[Dynamic[{a, b}], {{-10, 0}, {10, 100}, 1}], Dynamic[{a, b}]}          y = Dynamic[Replace[t, Solve[-1/D[mirror[t], t] == (mirror[t] - b)/(t - a), t]]];     x = 2 y - a
