I've been working on an iPhone app for the past month and am interested in open sourcing some of its code. I built a few categories that others might find useful for generating filler data during testing and debugging, and I also made a view controller for displaying images that others might like to include in their own projects. How do you go about packaging these types of things (categories, view controllers, etc.) for sharing? What are some naming conventions I should keep in mind? Is it standard practice to preface open source code with initials (EGOTableViewPullRefresh, MGImageUtilities, etc.)? Should I make an example xcode project which shows how they can be used? Should I make a webpage to document and/or promote these things? Is automated documentation generated from comments a good way to go? What sorts of licensing should I be considering?
