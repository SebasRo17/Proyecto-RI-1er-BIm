I gave my rate to my client with a simple breakdown as requested. I listed out the components of my rate 1) Salary 2) Benefits 3) Overhead (tax, suppliers, etc etc) The client is ok with 1) and 3) But he wants a further breakdown of 2) Benefits (incl. vacation, sick days, insurance, etc) I am just using a very conservative and typical rate for benefits. Is this request typical? How should I say no? Thanks
