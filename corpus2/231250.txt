We have a set of Java tools that are built and run locally. Whenever one of the devs commits a change, everyone else (including non-developers) need to do an update and build the tools. Everyone uses windows machines so whoever designed the build processes decided to place everything in a folder called `C:\build` and dump all of the class files in the appropriate folders. For example, the folder might look something like               C:\build\firstTool\     C:\build\secondTool\     C:\build\settings.ini      We also have a huge library folder where all the jars go, and it's placed here               C:\lib\      As a result, many classes are simply assuming this is where the files are going to be stored and have hardcoded paths everywhere. What can I do to clean things up? I don't want users to have to build tools, nor do I want them to have to update any checked out repos on their end. Personally, I think developers should be the ones maintaining releases.
