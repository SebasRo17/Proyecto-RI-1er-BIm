I work in an open office with typical office noise (people talking and walking by). It is simply too noisy and restless for me to work in. I've been trying and trying to get some change, to no avail. I'm at a point of starting to look for a new job, but thought I'd give it one more shot, and try to argue my case with research. I remember reading about research on how noise and disruptions affect knowledge work and software development in particular. Maybe I'm bad at searching, but I just can't find research papers that deals specifically with noise and work that requires high concentration. PS: While I appreciate tips on how to cancel the noise (music, white noise, etc.), please limit your answer to links to research papers. Thanks.
