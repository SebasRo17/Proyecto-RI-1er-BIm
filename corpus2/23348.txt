I am trying to compute               Integrate[Sqrt[x^4 + (y - y^2)^2], {x, 0, y}]      _Mathematica_ 8 gives               (* ConditionalExpression[y^2 Abs[-1 + y]                              Hypergeometric2F1[-(1/2), 1/4, 5/4, -(y^2/(-1 + y)^2)],                              0 < y < 1 || y > 1] *)      but it is perfectly well defined for $y=1$ where the answer is exactly $1/3$. Is this a bug?
