In a team that I used to work for, there was a policy that if you introduced a memory or other resource leak, you got a 'dummy of shame' hung on your door until you found the next resource leak. While it was effective at finding resource leaks, I felt like it placed more emphasis on blaming others rather than working together to solve problems as a team. Am I being unreasonable in thinking that this policy contributed to a lower sense of team cohesion? Am I also being unreasonable in thinking that we should have rewarded those people who found and fixed the issue?
