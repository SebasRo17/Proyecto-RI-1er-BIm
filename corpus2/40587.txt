I have contour plots, such as               plot = ContourPlot[Sqrt[(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 5], {x, -15, 15}, {y, -15, 15}, Contours -> {4}] /. _Polygon -> Sequence[]      I have successfully found the numerical area enclosed using Stokes' theorem, essentially the "x dy" case shown here.               points = Transpose[Cases[Normal@plot, Line[pts_] :> pts, Infinity][[1,         All]]];       area = N[Abs[Rest[First[points]].Last[ListCorrelate[{1, -1}, #1] & /@ points]]]       What I would like to accomplish now is to apply the found area as a `Tooltip[]` on the contour plot. However, this isn't working properly:               Tooltip[ContourPlot[Sqrt[(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2)^2 - 5], {x, -15, 15}, {y, -15, 15}, Contours -> {4}] /. _Polygon -> Sequence[],"example"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/im34Rm.png) `"example"` comes up as a tooltip anywhere on the whole plot area, not just when the cursor is on the contour line. Also, sometimes it doesn't show "example"; it only shows like "ex" and then is cut off by white space. How can I implement this properly?
