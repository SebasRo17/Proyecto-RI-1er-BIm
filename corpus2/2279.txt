I am plotting two histograms on the same graph:               g1 = Histogram[bc, ChartStyle -> {Red}]     g2 = Histogram[bcx]     Show[g1, g2, PlotRange -> {{0.1, 0.6}, All}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3AVG7.png) But I would like the plots to overlap so that they are "see-through" and I can compare them. I've been trying with               ChartStyle -> {"Overlapped"}      which hasn't been working.
