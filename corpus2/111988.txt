Like I plan to build up my portfolio with games. If I don't get a job in gaming or if frankly I don't want to, how would an employer who wants nothing to do with games see me as a potential future employee? Would he see it as impressive and consider me? Or would he think it's nice but irrelevant and thus be somewhat detrimental?
