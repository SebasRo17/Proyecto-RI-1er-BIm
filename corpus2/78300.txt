I have created a small and helpful project that I'd like to upload to a public repository and share under the FreeBSD license. What are the common steps I should make to apply the license to my code? I mean, what are the technical actions that should be done to apply the chosen license. More specifically:   1. Should I put the licensing information in the header of every file?   2. If yes, should I put the whole license text or there is an acceptable short version?   3. Should I have a specific file (e.g. in the root directory) that deals with the licensing? Is putting the license text in it enough?   4. If a project is a cooperative effort by various people on-line, that are not part of any organization, what should be written in the copyright clause? Are there any other technical issues I should know?
