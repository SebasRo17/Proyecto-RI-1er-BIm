Let's say I select 2 different cells and then attempt to replace their content using `NotebookWrite` inside a button. How might I replace each cell's content individually instead of the current functionality I am getting.               Button["Write", NotebookWrite[EvaluationNotebook[], "Write"]]     Dynamic[Refresh[NotebookRead[SelectedNotebook[]],UpdateInterval -> 1]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8XX3U.png) When I click on the `Write` button, only the last selected `Cell` gets replaced. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/B15WN.png) Is there a safe technique to replace each cell with unique content?
