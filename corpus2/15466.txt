This StackOverflow question asks "where can I get Microsoft.Data.Objects" It turns out the answer was probably that its in the CTP4 (code first) release of Entity Framework 4 However there where a lot of guesses. Including   * System.Data   * Entity Framework   * Microsoft.ApplicationBlocks.Data    * Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.Data 10 years ago if someone asked a similar question for they might have gotten DAO, RDO, ADO. Is this just the nature of the beast or is it MS. Does this pattern happen with other vendors? Where the base data access strategy is either wrapped or changed?
