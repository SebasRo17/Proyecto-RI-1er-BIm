I am hoping to create a mind-mapping like application and it needs to have a central workspace that will hold the map. Users should be able to drag items (like rectangles, texts, etc.) from a container to the workspace. The important thing is when a user is dragging an element to the workspace, _the element should move with the mouse, **not** just the text._ What I'm looking for is something like the web apps LucidChart, Cacoo, MindMeister, etc. So is this possible to do in Java without too much hassle? And if yes, what is the application design (algorithm)? I have searched many resources but have only found ways to drag only the text, images or the like. Not the entire element itself. It would be even better if I could make it to drag an entire JButton, so the users can create a map of JButtons. Sorry if this is not the place to post this (should I post it in StackOverflow or here?).
