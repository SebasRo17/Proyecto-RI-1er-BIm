I have a DAO that brings data from a web service, that data comes in a string, in the likes of:               *NAME|John Doe *DATEOFBIRTH|1978-23-01*ID|anID123 (...)      I have a DTO that I wanna fill up with the parsed data (the DTO has fields in the like of name, birthdate, id...) So, my question is, what is the best practice:   * Parsing the string in the DAO to fill up the DTO   * Passing the data string to the DTO and the DTO itself parse the string and fill itself up   * Do the parsing in an utility class that would receive the string and return the fill up DTO > DAO: Data Access Object > > DTO: Data Transfer Object Note: I kept this language agnostic so it could be useful to anyone using object oriented languages, but, in my particular case, I'm using Java.
