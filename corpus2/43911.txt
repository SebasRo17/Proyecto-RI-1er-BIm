How can I apply list of functions to the same arguments? e.g. ApplyFun[{fun1,fun2,fun3},{arg1,arg2}] I looked here and could not find: https://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/ApplyingFunctionsToLists.html http://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/flash/ EDIT: "Through" is partial solution, because it cannot be used in expressions, where these functions are used without arguments.
