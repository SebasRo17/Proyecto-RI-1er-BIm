I'm trying to use LibraryLink in Mathematica, and come across some problems. Consider if we have a `MTensor m1` which contains a one dimensional double array, and I want to get the data of that array. I come across two methods. One is to use library callback functions `libData->MTensor_getRealData(m1)` as shown here , the other is use the micros `MTensor_getRealDataMacro(m1)` in the `WolframCompileLibrary.h file` as shown here. What are the differences between them? Does the library call back functions are slower then the macro since they need to "call back" to Mathematica?
