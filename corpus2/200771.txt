Where I work it is a common practice to create a separate for JPA entities and a project for the web application (the WAR). So basically you have (at least) two project for each application - appJPA and appWEB. The people who started this convention are no longer there, so I have been wondering about the benefit of having this separation. The only advantage I could think about is the Eclipse JPA facet which provides various tools for JPA. But if I am not mistaken, this facet can be applied to WAR projects as well. So my question is: is this separation unnecessary?
