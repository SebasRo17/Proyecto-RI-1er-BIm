I started programming fairly late. I am 24 years old and about to graduate from a local public university with a really poorly designed curriculum and teachers. Most of the work felt like busy work, and no matter how much I try, it all feels like a waste. I know what a good curriculum looks like. I know what books I should read, but alas it's not so in my university. There is no way at this point that I can catch up to those graduating from places like MIT. My question and this is a serious one: what do I do? Do I just postpone learning the theory I would have learned until later and focus on software engineering skills? How important is the theory in terms of landing a job in New York? Any particular things I should focus on to land a software engineer job? I am very motivated and I just wish someone would give me the time and a chance.
