I asked a question on SO, and found that there are no non-blocking ORMs for my favorite web framework. By non-blocking I mean an ORM with callback support for asynchronous retrieval. The ORM would be supplied with a callback or some such to execute when data has been received. I want to create one, but I have some questions that blocking me from starting development:   * What issues might be encountered when developing ORM?   * Does supporting non-blocking retrieval dramatically increase the complexity of an ORM?    * Why are there so few non-blocking ORMs around? **Update:** It looks like I have to improve my question. We have solutions that already allow us to receive data in non-blocking way, and I believe that most companies that use such solutions use raw SQL. We want to create a more generic solution that we can reuse in future projects. What difficulties might we encounter? **Update 2:** Preferred language is python, but I'm interested in principles. This question is actually for me, as I will look at platforms which already have non-blocking ORM.
