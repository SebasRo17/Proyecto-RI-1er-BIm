I'm trying to plot the _Compton Shift_ which I've defined as:               E2[ϕ_] := E1/(1 + (E1/(m*c^2))*(1 - Cos[ϕ Degree]))      I've initiated the constants and when I evaluate the function for various degrees, it gives me the correct answer. The issue I'm getting is that when I try and plot this function (with m = 1, c = 299792458 and E1 = 180), my plot shows a line until the value of ϕ is increased to above ~30-40. I'll get a flat line for small values of Phi but for larger values, the line disappears and I get a blank plot. What is the reason for this? Am I doing something wrong?
