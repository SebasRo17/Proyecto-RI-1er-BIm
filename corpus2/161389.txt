> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How should I test randomness? One of the features to be developed in our application was allowing user to click a button which will choose an element at random out of (normally 5-10) values registered in the database. The randomness doesn't need to be secure or scientifically uniform, but we do need it to be somehow unpredictable and not noticeably biased to one of the value. Any suggestion how to write a good unit test and functional test for this feature?
