I have searched for commands which will let me to create matrices and do matrix operations, but I don't know how to apply _Mathematica_ to the following exercise. > Make a conjecture for the result of `A*A*A`, where `A` is an n x n matrix of > the form ![A*A*A matrix of nxn rows](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O6Gjv.png) I would like to know if _Mathematica_ can calculate `A*A*A` and the approach I could use to carry out the calculation.
