I would like to complete a pharmacy software proof concept. But I have a few questions I do not know. **Physician information** In order to refill or dispense a new RX the software needs to have access to a database of current doctors, is there a downloadable database or a service I can interact with to get a list of current practicing doctors ? **Medication information** needs to access a database of medications, which I believe companies like Medispan offer for a price. How much does interacting with these kinds of companies cost. **Billing** How can I interface be it with an insurance company, medicare, medicaid, etc for billing ? I have seen these programs are able to submit orders and get a response automatically for how much was billed and how much was paid etc. **What I have done** I started to just work on basic windows form application which would be the client and then I imagine I would have to connect it to my server in order to perform authentication etc before I billed for them from the server. Are the client applications connecting with the APIs directly or just an intermediary web service which in turn does all the work ? I also found one open source project http://www.anshealth.com/ but it seems like its pretty complicated to setup and there isn't much documentation. There hasn't been a post in their forums since last year. **Edit** I edited my question in order to make it more specific, I have asked specifically three questions.
