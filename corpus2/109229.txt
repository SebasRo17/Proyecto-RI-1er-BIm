I would like to prevent a situation where two developers refactor the same code simultaneously without talking about it first, probably using a tool of some kind, maybe an Eclipse plug-in. Can you help? We've got 4.5 million lines of code, and more than 20 teams of developers on four continents. Ideally I would like the second of the developers mentioned earlier to notice that someone else is working on the same piece of code and talk to the first one before modifying anything. Do you know of a solution?
