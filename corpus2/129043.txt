I have an environment that supports both dictionaries (json style) and databases (not relational or anything, just formatted data by row and column). My application doesn't really need database functionality, butI'm somewhat more comfortable with the database system than I am with dictionaries. Is there a major performance advantage to dictionaries? What situations are there where a dictionary is better than a database?
