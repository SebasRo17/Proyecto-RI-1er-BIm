I'm an ASP.NET Webforms developer, and I face some problems when I deal with designers. Designers always complain about the `asp.net server controls`. They'd rather just have an html file and create `css` files along with the required images to go with those. Sometimes, if the design phase is done in advance, I get html files with related css files, but then we face many problems integrating the design with the `aspx` files (sever controls an telerik controls ... etc). What I want to ask about is:   * How do I overcome these problems? The designers prefer php- and mvc developers because of the problems with .net server controls. I need to know how to interact with the designers in the correct way.   * Are there any tools or applications to provide the designers with the rendered (html page) of the .aspx pages? By that I mean the page in runtime rather than the aspx in Visual Studio. They do use Web Expression but they want the rendered page in html as well.
