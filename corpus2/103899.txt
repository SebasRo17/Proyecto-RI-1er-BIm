I'm suffering a crisis of confidence in my ability as a computer programmer. Yesterday I tried to come up with my own shortest path algorithm for a graph and after some hours I simply threw in the towel and learned Dijkstra's algorithm. Is this the kind of thing a good programmer should be able to "reinvent" in a couple of hours or am I being unrealistic? Oh well, at least I was able to reinvent bubble sort :D
