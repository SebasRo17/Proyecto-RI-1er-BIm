I have been searching all over the internet for exact answer for my question. I am hoping you can help me out. I wonder how professional programmers/coders planing their projects? Libraries, subpackages? For example when creating a user system, how do you aproach it? How do you decide your classes, functions, requirements, database structure, depencies... Here is a example of user system planning i tried. Am I doing it right? [planing] ## General   * User identity should be selectable (email, username etc.)   * Passwords: use sha1. mixed with salt   * email   * user meta (a placeholder for user profile)   * user group   * user access (group based)   * invitation   * referer   * register and last login dates   * .... ## Auth System ### Register   * Required fields:     * Username     * email     * password   * First Check     * Username, email, password fields are filled? [/planing] I am trying this aproach with planning. Is there a software to do a planning like this? What should I ask myself? what is the important questions that guide me to the end? Thank you for your advices that you will send.
