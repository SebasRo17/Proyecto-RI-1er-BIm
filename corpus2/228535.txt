I want to describe an n-dimensional cube (a 2-dimensional cube is a square, a 3-dimensional cube is a cube, etc). I'm pretty sure I need an array, but how do I organise it in the best possible way? So far, I think the best way is to create an array with n dimensions (eg. a square is `$cube [][]`), but I can't understand how to create it. A similar approach may be storing an n-cube as an array of n cubes of n-1 dimensions, which is far more practical (eg. a cube is an array of squares, and each square is an array of points).
