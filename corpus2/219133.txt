Are there any reliable strategies to implement a login mechanism that will allow access to an application for maintenance purposes? Kind of like how some routers have a list of default logins that technicians can use. But the way routers do it is insecure, and I was wondering if there are better ways to implement this sort of access control. EDIT: Here's a possible solution I came up with. Generate a list of passwords for a given time window, say a month, with a different password for every day. This list would exist in the software in encrypted form. Maintenance technicians would have access to this list, and its use would be logged so we know when to block access should unauthorized personnel gets a copy of the list and use it to log in. Periodic updates would renew the application's password table.
