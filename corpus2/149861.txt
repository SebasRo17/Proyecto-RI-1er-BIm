I am looking for recommendations on a digital Scrum Board which can be shared over the internet. I imagine something like a big tablet on which you can draw and which remote users can access, too. I dislike Scrum software because I think one major benefit of a Scrum Board is its physical presence. It should be hard to ignore. The best solution would be two big tablets on which you can draw and which can be synchronized. Has anyone got product recommendations for something like this? Or would you rather use a software? Kind regards, Falcon
