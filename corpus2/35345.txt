Imagine we import a PDB file like so (using the example from ref/format/PDB in the help directory):               Import["http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/download/downloadFile.do?fileFormat=pdb&compression=NO&structureId=1tf6", "PDB", ImageSize -> Medium]      The help file says that it should be possible to treat the imported PDB image as a `Graphics3D` object, but I can't seem to get it to display with other `Graphics3D` objects after using `Import` with the specification:               Import["my_duplex.pdb", "Graphics3D"]      How would I scale and translate an imported PDB graphic and get it to display with other `Graphics3D` objects, like say a cylinder or sphere?
