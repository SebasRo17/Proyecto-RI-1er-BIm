Take the example of the recent ASP.NET (and Java Server Faces) vulnerability disclosure at a Hacker conference in Brazil. It's my understanding that the poet tool was demonstrated before Microsoft was even aware of the issue. Are there laws to protect legitimate customers from people who encite the hacker community to start hacking all the ASP.NET servers they can? Who knows how many legitimate businesses were compromised between when the tool was demoed and the patch was applied to the server.
