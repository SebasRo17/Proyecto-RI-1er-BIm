In a multiple `Sum` I need to put an automatically generated summation region. But when I generate the summation region automatically I get a list whose elements are lists. Then the summation does not work. For example:               Sum[1,{i,1,2},{j,1,2}]      works;               Sum[1,{{i,1,2},{j,1,2}}]      or               A = Table[{i[j],j+1},{j,2}];     Sum[1,A]      doesn't work.
