want to compare two text file. Suppose file AA contains following text                  1.The onunload event occurs once a        2.page has unloaded (or the browser window has been closed).        3.onunload occurs when the user        4.navigates away from the page (by clicking on a link, submitting        5.text One        6.text two        7.text three      And file BB contains following text                  1.The onunload event occurs once a        2.page has unloadd (or the browser window has been closed).        3.onunload the when  occurs user        4.navigates away from the page (by clicking on a link, submitting        5.text two        6.text One        7.text three      What I want is               -Line 1 in AA and 1 in BB is exact match         -Line 2 in AA and 2 in BB is match but contains error (see word "unloadd" in BB content)        -Line 3 in AA and 3 in BB is match but words are swaped in BB content         -Line 4 in AA and 4 in BB is exact match         -Line 5 in AA is swapped to Line 6 in BB .         -Line 6 in AA is swapped to Line 5 in BB.        -Line 7 is exact match with line 7 in BB.      How to achieve this ? Is there any pattern matching algorithm?
