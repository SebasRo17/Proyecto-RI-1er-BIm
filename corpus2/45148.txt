I am trying to make a presentation with Mathematica and would like to know if there is a way to add a logo that will show in every slide. I have not found any settings that would allow me to do that automatically and would like to know if there is a straightforward way of implementing this. I tried using a custom template with the logo but this also seemed impossible since custom templates are not possible, to my knowledge, with Mathematica presentations. Any help is appreciated
