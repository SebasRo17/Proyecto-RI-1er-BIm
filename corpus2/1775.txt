I want to build a bot to automate web browsing, this mean something like:   * filling forms   * press "submit" buttons   * find certain text inside pages   * and so on... How can I do this with Mathematica? The `Import` function just make you download a single web page but it doesn't support cookies and similar things to build a complete automated bot, does Mathematica have some useful packet to do so?
