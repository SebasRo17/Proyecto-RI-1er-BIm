I know about how the economies of scale work, and how a bigger competitor could beat you in price, if they wanted. But there doesn't seem to be anything better to compete at when entering a market in software (without being dishonest); a new product often won't be as good as an established one as far as features go. Plus, older popular products are usually priced higher just "because they can," and it's not likely they'll change just to crush a smaller company, so it seems tempting just to set a low price.
