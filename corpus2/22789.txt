I'm trying to export attributes and annotations to an HDF5 file. But the documentation here is horrible and there are no examples of this. I spent some time playing, but I can't get it to work. Here is the simplest example that should have helped me to get started:               Export["test.h5", {{{1, 2}, {2, 3}}, {{10, 11}, {12, 13}}}, {"Datasets", {"m1", "m2"}}]     r = Import["test.h5", "Rules"]     Export["test1.h5", r, "Rules"]      but it fails with: > >     Export::errelem: The Export element Dataset1 contains a malformed data > structure and could not be exported to HDF5 format. >> >     Export::noopen: Cannot open C:\Users\ajasja\Documents\test1.h5. >> >   So my question is: **How can one export attributes with datasets?** (preferably using built in _Mathematica_ functionality) **EDIT** For reference here are some external MMA HDF5 packages that might provide the required functionality, but I have not yet managed to write any attributes:   * HDF5WrappersForMathematica Uses .NET libraries to implement all the HDF5 calls   * H5DumpImport which works through ascii dump files   * h5mma which is a C implementation (but has read-only functionality)
