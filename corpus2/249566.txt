We are writing a search engine from scratch in a quite uncommon language, Aramaic, mostly for learning purposes but also because few resources are available in given language. The engine is/will be written in Python, and:   1. It is a human language search engine.    2. It's not about paying someone to do the tests, but trying to find a way to resolve the issue programmatically (if even possible) for learning purposes mostly. We would like to test automatically if the search engine works efficiently but without knowing the language we were wondering if there were maybe tools or ways to test it get statistics. If we had users who spoke the language we could ask them to evaluate the search results but not having that, what are the other ways to test a search engine?
