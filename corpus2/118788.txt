Is this an antipattern? It is an acceptable practice?                   try {             //do something         } catch (Exception e) {              try {                 //do something in the same line, but being less ambitious             } catch (Exception ex) {                 try {                     //Do the minimum acceptable                 } catch (Exception e1) {                     //More try catches?                 }             }         }
