This is an old thread that received no responce but like to post again. Anyone here using Mathematica and CUDA? I have not been able to have Mathemartica detect teh CUDA able C compiler. CUDACCompiler[] returns empty. I have tried the following and no results get teh following error               CreateLibrary::target: Target system specification "TargetSystemID" -> Windows-x86-64 is not available for NVIDIA CUDA Compiler installation C:\Users\jecalderon\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Paclets\Repository\CUDAResources-Win64-9.0.2.0\CUDAToolkit\bin\. >>
