I think voice recognition is cool, and I might start studying it soon, but one big question that I've always wondered about is "How do the programmers separate the noise from the voice?" I mean, if you've watched "Her", you'll notice the main character uses voice commands commonly in quiet places, but today, voice recognition is mostly used in the car, amid a LOT of background noise, and even possibly background voices. I've used Siri in these loud situations, and I'm always impressed that the program still understands me over the noise. So, without going into detailed specifics, **I'd like to know what methods or concepts are generally used by programmers to do this.**
