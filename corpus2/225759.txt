Today I just received my (almost-daily) mail from a big company career automated job search like the following:               Based on your search criteria the following openings are now available:     * Senior Software Engineer II - based in NY     * Principal Software Architect - based in NJ     * Software Engineer - based in LA      and I wondered: how come I'm receiving these ads so often? It doesn't seem they're always the same so (at least apparently) it doesn't seem they're always sending me the same jobs. Are big IT companies like this one firing people continuously, are they continuously expanding or are people continuously leaving from there (and in that case how come **that** many people are leaving)?
