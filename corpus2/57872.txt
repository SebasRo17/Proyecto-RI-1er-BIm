By combining the state data from here and the extrusion code from here I have managed to make prisms of the various US states such as ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gP9ej.jpg) However, the extrusion method looses information about the states relative position so I cant reassemble them into a map of the US states which is my final goal: a map with states projected upward by different amounts corresponding to a parameter I have (something like population or total sales) to make a 3D histogram of sorts. I have the seen the last example here(How to Plot Prism in Graphics3D) which has the right geometry but is not at a level of quality I can use in my work. Moreover, the final infographic may have additional data on the state surfaces like colored points indicating hotsopts so that solution wont extend.
