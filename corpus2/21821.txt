I started learning Java a couple of months ago. I also wanted to become more exposed to linux so I installed ubuntu and started working with Java since then. In the meanwhile however I became more interested in C# and in learning the Windows platform. At this point I'm asking myself if I should stop learning Java and move to the .NET world. I don't hate or dislike Java by the way, I am just more curious about windows/.NET at this point in time. My question is, should I remain with Java or go with C#/.NET? What is your advice?
