I need to price 23,000 securities from 1999 to 2007, and they are surprisingly hard to find on subscription-based services, like Bloomberg LP, ThomsonReuters or S&P CapitalIQ offerings. Probably because deleted/expired/retired securities are dropped from the databases. Is there a good source on what financial information is available to/via Wolfram products, e.g. how much of my needs would be covered?
