I frequently hear these two valuable programming practices: (1) lines of code should be 80 characters or less and (2) use descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, etc. I understand the reasoning for both of these words of advice, however, they seem to often be tradeoffs of each other. If I keep my code below 80 chars/line I end up using less descriptive names (esp. in Python in which each indentation counts as 4 characters) but if I use more descriptive names, I end up with lines over 80 characters. So, my question is which of these two pieces of advice is more important to abide by if the choice must be made? I am wondering this as an independent (hobbyist) programmer, but more importantly from the perspective of a software engineer working for a larger company.
