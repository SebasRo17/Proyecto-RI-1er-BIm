I developed many applications with registered user access for my enterprise clients. In many years I have changed my way of doing it, specially because I used many programming languages and database types along time. Some of them not very simple as `view`, `create` and/or `edit` permissions for each module in the application, or light as `access` or `can't access` certain module. But now that I am developing a very extensive application with many modules and many kinds of users to access them, I was wondering if there is an standard model for doing it, because I already see that's the simple or the light way won't be enough.
