When I take the $Z$-Transform of the `Floor` function:               ZTransform[ Floor[x], x, z]      I get > >     z/(-1 + z)^2 >   But when I do:               InverseZTransform[ z/(-1 + z)^2, z, x]      > >     x >   ... rather than `Floor[x]`... Is this an error in _Mathematica_ or is my understanding wrong? Is there a way to take the discrete-time $Z$-transform on a list, say: `{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`... and then the inverse $Z$-transform?
