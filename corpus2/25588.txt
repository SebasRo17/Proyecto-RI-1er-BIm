Say I have some Graphics3D object that I'm looking at from a top down perspective, e.g.:               Graphics3D[{Sphere[{-1, 3, 0}, 1], Sphere[{0, 1, 0}]}, ViewPoint -> Top]      How might I use Manipulate[] so that I can click somewhere on this image and generate an ${x,y}$ output corresponding to the position of the mouse on a projection plane parallel to my screen with respect to the coordinate system in the image? In the above example, for instance, clicking on the center of first sphere would output $(-1, 3)$, while clicking on the center of the latter would output $(0,1)$.
