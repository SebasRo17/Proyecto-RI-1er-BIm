My code finding Narcissistic numbers is not that slow, but it's not in functional style and lacks flexibility: if $n \neq 7$, I have to rewrite my code. Could you give some good advice?               nar = Compile[{$},        Do[         With[{            n = 1000000 a + 100000 b + 10000 c + 1000 d + 100 e + 10 f + g,            n2 = a^7 + b^7 + c^7 + d^7 + e^7 + f^7 + g^7},           If[n == n2, Sow@n];           ],          {a, 9}, {b, 0, 9}, {c, 0, 9}, {d, 0, 9}, {e, 0, 9}, {f, 0, 9}, {g, 0, 9}],        RuntimeOptions -> "Speed", CompilationTarget -> "C"        ];          Reap[nar@0][[2, 1]] // AbsoluteTiming          (*{0.398023, {1741725, 4210818, 9800817, 9926315}}*)
