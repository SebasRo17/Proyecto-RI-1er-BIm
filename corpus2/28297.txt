It seems that every time the start directory of `SystemDialogInput` is always the same, is it possible to set the start directory to the last used directory? For example:               SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vh4SE.png) will start from the "Documents" directory, if I change to other directory and select some file, and run the second input dialog               SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"]      it forgets the directory I chose in the first `SystemDialogInput` and starts from "Documents" directory again. Is it possible to set `SystemDialogInput` to always remember the last used directory?
