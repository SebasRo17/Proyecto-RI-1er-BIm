I have just started a new job as a front end web developer, this is my second day and I have just been handed quite a big project that involves lots of javascript which I dont know, this is leaving me extremely stressed (last night I couldnt get to sleep with worry) basically I got the job from the boss of the company phoning me up and asking me for a chat which then ended up in a job offer which I accepted, my previous role was just css and html with the odd little piece of jquery here and there and now this is way outside my comfort zone. What should I do? Against my name in here it says my name + DHTML, CSS and JQuery?
