I have a series of mouse MRI images, here are two ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xni6T.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/01a5d.jpg) How can I automatically remove the metal cage around the mouse to make it look like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ImP6U.jpg) The position of the cage is not always in exactly the same position. Making the image more horizontal would also be nice. Also each image should have the same dimensions.               image1 = Import["http://i.imgur.com/iGia7W6.jpg"]
