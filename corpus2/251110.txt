One of the things I run into often is problems caused by programs which don't conform to ISO standardss. One example would be not using the ISO country tables but making up their own shorthands, which goes okay for the United States (US), or the Netherlands (NL) but goes spectacularly wrong for the United Kingdom (GB, not UK) or Spain (ES, not SP) and a lot of other countries. As another example, internal date notations. Why would anyone store a date as 01/02/2014 ever? It is completely unclear whether that is 1st February or January 2nd, whereas if you use the ISO standard you just store 2014-02-01* and it's unambiguously February 1st. My question: When and why should a programmer make up their own constructs when there is an ISO standard available? * Store 2014-02-01, and format the date accordingly when showing it to an end user.
