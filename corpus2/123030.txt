If I am asked to program an algorithm, say binary search, in languages other than Java during an interview, I will have a hard time trying to remember the syntax. Is it okay to tell my interviewer that I can only code this in Java, because I have worked with other languages before but have not used them for a while? If not, what suggestions do you have (i.e. what languages and parts of those languages among these should I pick up the syntax of before my interview)?
