I am maintaining a WinForms application, which talks to a SQL Server database. Sometimes I have to change database schema (for example to alter a sql procedure or add new one). For this purpose I have a SchemaChange.sql file, where I put the corresponding sql code. When I create an installer for my project, the msi package is created. It contains my application, referenced assemblies, COM+ assemblies,... Alongside the msi package I provide an SchemaChange.sql file, which has to be run on the production sql server. But sometimes I forget to add something to SchemaChange.sql file during development or I forget to execute it on production server after upgrading my application on client machines. Any advice how to automate this to avoid further problems?
