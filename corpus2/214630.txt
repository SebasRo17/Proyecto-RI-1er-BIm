Generally whenever we're programming in any Programming language, say C, we would pass the parameters we need to pass to a function using the parentheses next to the name of the function. Whereas in jQuery, other than the user defined `function()` we write the action we need the function to perform inside the parentheses, for example,               $('div').mouseenter(function(){        /* blah blah blah*/     });      Why?
