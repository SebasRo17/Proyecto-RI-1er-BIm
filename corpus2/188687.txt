Given some random letters , For example "a,e,o,g,z,k,l,j,w,n" and a dictionary.Try to find a word in the dictionary that has most letters given I was going through some old interview questions and found this question, I am new to algorithms and I am thinking whether this can be related to dynamic programming(Longest common subsequence) this is the solution that I can think of "Let us assume that the dictionary is in a trie Start by finding the permutations of the given letters, here we could be using recursion, we can prune the recursion tree, by checking the letters in the dictionary. and we maintain a variable which holds the largest string formed till now." I tried searching online but could not find any example that match this could you provide some pointers.
