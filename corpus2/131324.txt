> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Difference between Dependency Injection (DI) & Inversion of Control (IOC) I'm new to Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection and everything related to these stuff, so excuse me if I'm not specific in my question: Is there any magical piece of code, a good explanation or a link, so I can finally distinguish the concepts? I really think that using Dependency Injection already means using Inversion of Control, but is there any way of using Inversion of Control without using Dependency Injection? I've already read Martin Fowler's articles but I still find the concepts very confusing.
