I've read many, many, _many_ posts on how "you're probably storing passwords wrong". They are always referring to storing passwords on a server into which a user is logging; they basically rehash (pun intended) ubiquitous advice like make sure to salt the passwords, etc. etc. However, I've never seen an article on best practises for storing passwords on a _client_ so that the client doesn't have to log in manually every time they want to log in; the "remember me" feature. Many pieces of software have this feature, from browsers to programs like Dropbox. I did read an old article recently about how Dropbox was storing an ID on your computer that you could just copy/paste to another computer and start Dropbox and be logged in as the device you got the ID from; no login, no nothing, and full access to the Dropbox account. This seems like a really stupid design, but I can't think of any better way to do it. I'm not even sure how to avoid storing something like a cookie in plain-text. If you encrypt it, where do you store the key to decrypt it? The only way I see to not introduce security vulnerabilities is to remove the autologin feature and make the user type their password every time they want to use a service, but that's a usability struggle and users are spoiled to expect not to have to do that. What can I read about locally storing credentials safely to implement the automatic login feature? If the principles are too simple for an entire article, what are they? The software in question should not depend on features not present on all platforms (like the "keychain" some linux distributions have).
