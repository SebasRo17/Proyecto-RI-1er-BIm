In the process of creating my resume in Mathematica, I needed to adjust the margins of the default stylesheet so that section headers would take up less whitespace. After modifying the stylesheet using the instructions mentioned here, the changes clearly show up in my document in Mathematica. ![Before printing](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vzphS.png) However, after I export the document to a PDF, either by saving or by printing, my work is undone. ![After printing document](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gTS9L.png) So I've resorted to copying and pasting screen captures of my resume into MSPaint and then printing from there. This is a huge pain. What am I doing wrong? Is there a setting I have to modify to get my stylesheet margins to stick in the PDF version?
