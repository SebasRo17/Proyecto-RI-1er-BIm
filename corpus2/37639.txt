Now that I have v10 running on my Raspberry Pi, I'm interested in what "personal and educational use" means. As a Home user, I fully understand "personal"... but does "educational" mean that I'm free to donate a Raspberry Pi to my daughter's school and have Mathematica installed? Or is it restricted to a single person's educational use? And to all those who made this possible, my deepest gratitude!
