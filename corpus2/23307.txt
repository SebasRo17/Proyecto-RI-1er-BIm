When I evaluate               CityData[All, "Coordinates"]      _Mathematica_ returns > >     {Missing["NotAvailable"], Missing["NotAvailable"]} >   but when I evaluate `CityData[All]` or `CityData[{All, "USA"}]`, it behaves as expected, and returns a gigantic list of cities. I'm curious to modify the neat example for `FindShortestTour`, to use coordinates from `CityData` \-- _yes it may take a very long time, but I'm curious to see for myself_ :) My guess is that it is because not every city in the database has coordinates mapped thereto - but why is _Mathematica_ failing this way? **How can I programmatically eliminate the cities with 'bad' coordinates? Or programmatically build a list of all cities that do have coordinates?**
