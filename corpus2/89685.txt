My employer is looking to purchase an enterprise account in the belief that it will enable us to develop and distribute apps for large clients of ours - however online it clearly states that the Enterprise account should only be used to distribute apps to the employees of the company that own the account. So my question is this: If we want to distribute in-house apps to "Company X" should we ask them to purchase an Enterprise account to distribute the app we made for them, or do we buy the account under our organisation instead? Thanks in advance.
