Recently I was looking at an open source project to contribute to however after going through the ugly code base (which seems to break quite a bit) and reading some things about the current maintainer I decided it would be a good fit for me. Right now my thinking is to just start a new project with the same goal but using a different set of technologies that I think fit the problem better, the only reason stopping me is avoiding second system effect given the fact the system is live and works. I could contribute to the other project and in doing so avoid essentially creating two different solutions to the same problem or I could solve the problem the way I think it should be solved and then see which system gets more traction. Is there some prior art to these circumstances that I should be aware of when considering this decision?
