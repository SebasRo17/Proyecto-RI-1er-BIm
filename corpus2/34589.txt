Working with some iterative integral equations I have Gaussian density functions involved therein. Integrating the gaussian function I obrain the error function. When I take the second integration, _Mathematica_ is not able to provide an analytical expression. Because apparently there is no closed- form expression for the integral of the error function. **Question:** Is it possible the tell Mathematica to consider the error function as some given exact expression which is analytically integrable? For example $$erf(x)=\frac{1}{(1+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+a_4x^4)^4}$$ for some appropriate constants $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$?
