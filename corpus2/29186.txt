This seems real easy but I can't find the answer. I have a few contour plots that I am combining and want to use only one bar legend that captures all the values. Given that I know the range of values, how to get the colors to correspond so that, say, if one plot only ranges over 1/3 of the total range, it only displays 1/3 of the range of colors. The following code only plots the BarLegend correctly but leaves the colors in the contour plot unchanged:               ContourPlot[X^2+Y^2,{X,-3,3},{Y,-3,3},PlotLegends->BarLegend[{"LakeColors",{0, 100}}, 10]]      Edit: I should have been more precise. Here is a more explicit example. The goal is to make the contour colors quantitatively consistent between the plots.               h1 = ContourPlot[X^2 + Y^2, {X, -3, 3}, {Y, -3, 3}, PlotLegends -> Automatic];     h2 = ContourPlot[X^2 + Y^2, {X, -5, 5}, {Y, -5, 5}, PlotLegends -> Automatic];     GraphicsRow[{h1, h2}, ImageSize -> 500]      As @David_Park mentions, I need to use ColorFunction. But I don't know how with ContourPlot.
