I just discovered something rather odd while using chemical curated data in _Mathematica_. I tried to extract `EdgeRules` for some molecules and some molecules gave me several copies of said `EdgeRules` as a list. Is this a bug? Have any of you found similar things happening with other curated data? Example:               ChemicalData[#, "EdgeRules"] & /@ {"Glutamine", "Alanine", "Serine"}      This input gives me 1, 3 and 2 copies of the `EdgeRules` of the given molecules.
