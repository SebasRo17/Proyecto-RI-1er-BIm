During a phone interview I had, the interviewer was asking me questions about my previous job as a web developer. After discussing how I had used Eclipse to write Java Servlets, he asked me the question whether I was familiar with the debugger, "you know, stepping through code, setting breakpoints, et cetera." I responded by saying something along the lines that I use the debugger almost every day at work in order to track down any bugs that may arise. Looking back now, it sounds like saying "I use the debugger almost every day" makes it seem like I write poor code that I constantly have to debug. So, my question is: **Is using the debugger frequently a sign of bad programming, or just a natural part of the development process?**
