* I have a hypothetical scenario where I need to pass data to APIs from multiple different providers, depending on the 'vendor identity' provided by one of the pieces of data.   * If I have the data as objects within an enumerable parent object, what would be a good way to pass the objects to the appropriate API in a reasonably loosely coupled way?   * Even if the API definition was more tightly hardcoded somehow, what would be a good way to actually pass the objects through to the API?   * I'm writing the solution in C# although it's the general architecture that matters not the specific implementation
