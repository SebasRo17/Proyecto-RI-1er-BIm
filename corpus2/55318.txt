I have a dataset which are keyed on `{"Item", "Hour of Day", "Value"}.` In the examples, I noticed that it is possible to apply functions using such as               Select[(#a > 1 &)]      But what would the slot name be for my string values above? Is there a way to interrogate a dataset for its slots? Should I simply avoid the issue and rename them if I wish to perform such operations?
