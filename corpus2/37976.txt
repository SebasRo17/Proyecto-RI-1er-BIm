I would like to allow a user to manipulate the segments of a pie-chart, which is to be generated from a list of a specific format. The code looks something like the following:               pieChartList = {         {category1, 1},         {category2, 2}     };          generatePieChart[dataList_List, plotLabel_String] :=         Manipulate[             PieChart[                 {category1, category2},                 PlotLabel -> plotLabel             ],             {{category1, 1}, 0, 10}, {{category2, 2}, 0, 10}         ];          generatePieChart[pieChartList, "Test pie chart"]      As you can see, the lists are being written "manually," even though `pieChartList` contains all the information to generate the necessary structures. Is there an elegant way to generate the manipulation list automatically? In other words, if I were to add `{category3, 3}` to `pieChartList`, the function `generatePieChart` should pick up the new value automatically. Thanks in advance for your help.
