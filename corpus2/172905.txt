Consider this bit of code:               if (x == 1)     {       throw "no good; aborting" ;     }          [... more code ...]      Now consider this code:               if (x == 1)     {       throw "no good; aborting" ;     }     else     {       [... more code ...]     }      The two cases work exactly the same way. The first case has the advantage that you don't have to "encase" the rest of the code in an `else`. The second has the advantage of following the practice of explicitly having an `else` for every `if`. Can anyone provide any solid arguments in favor of one over the other?
