On a graphic (in this example a simple plot), I need two points to move when I drag with the mouse, and these points must move to location {1,1} when I click on them. This is how I got it to work, but I don't think it's a good way.                DynamicModule[{pt = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}}},       EventHandler[  LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt], Plot[t, {t, -3, 3}],        Appearance -> Graphics[Circle[], ImageSize -> 10]],       "MouseClicked" :> (pt =       ReplacePart[pt,        First@Flatten@          Sort[MapIndexed[{#2, Norm[MousePosition["Graphics"] - #]} &,             pt], #1[[2]] < #2[[2]] &] -> {-1, -1}]),       "MouseDragged" :> (pt =       ReplacePart[pt,        First@Flatten@          Sort[MapIndexed[{#2, Norm[MousePosition["Graphics"] - #]} &,             pt], #1[[2]] < #2[[2]] &] -> MousePosition["Graphics"]])]]      Any suggestions for improvement?
