What I mean by that is, how do you go about developing on a code base you share with developers who have been working on it for years and are very familiar with it? I don't want to step on anyones toes, but I get not so subtle complaints about the way I do things, whether it be how I whitespace my code, or how frequently I checkin to SVN (too often). So while I can change those things easily -- I want to be a better team developer in general. I'm not sure what to do, other than ask, but maybe you guys have some thoughts I could put to practice. **UPDATE** There isn't any style guide to speak of -- it's just people aren't used to sharing the codebase. Everyone has their own little siloed code-world. This is a perl shop, but I'm sure these apply to any language **UPDATE 2** The CTO who later became CEO was a complete megalomaniac and was the primary source of these complaints. If you didn't do things exactly how he liked, whether it was using a Mac, or Emacs, or 4 tab spaces instead of 2, or dress a certain way, you were inferior. It was a horrific situation that I tried to correct, but the only correct answer for me was leaving. I am convinced that this was an instance of **bullying** in a workplace, and subsequently, I'm more aware of what might be subtle bullying and inappropriate behavior in a work environment. **To any developer looking for answers to a situation like this, leave immediately. You can't teamwork your way out of a bad team situation.**
