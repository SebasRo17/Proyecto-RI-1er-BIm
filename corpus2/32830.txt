I have found a research article about Martian sand grain size determination from the image using Mathematica (Figure 2 in the linked article). They have not provided any detail of the methodology. It could have many applications in biology specially in the microscopy. May be it is simple, but I have no idea how to do it. Any help would be much appreciated. I have enclosed an image of gold nanoparticles here. There's a reference size bar at the bottom right of the image. ![Gold nanoparticles](http://i.stack.imgur.com/udW8X.jpg)
