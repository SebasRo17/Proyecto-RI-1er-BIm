sorry call four points b c three must noncollinear otherwise three could lie surface sphere four must coplaner otherwise either lie sphere define infinity b c define circle perpendicular bisectors ab bc ca meet point p say centre circle circle must lie surface desired sphere consider normal plane abc passing p points normal equidistant b c circle fact diameter desired sphere take plane containing normal lies normal plane containing normal plane right angles abc one let e point normally two circumference abc circle lies plane need point q normal eq dq intersection perpendicular bisector ed normal point exists since plane abc ed right angles normal algorithm sphere well defined check b coincident failure find line ab check c lie failure find plane abc check lie failure yes find centre find perpendicular bisectors ab ac find point intersection p find normal plane abc passing p line n find plane containing n find point e abc circle plane lies n take e find perpendicular bisector ed line l find point intersection n l q q centre desired sphere pictures plane abc p b c rightangles abc plane containing n e line n pq numerically ed ep q close p relative radius abc circle subject error best choose least ad bd cd larger choice
