never worked really small signals questions low level noise noticed waveform synthesizer using analogic relatively large common mode noise using synthesizer null another transient waveform amplifying difference several hundred times mvpp common mode noise tends make measurements hard repeat noise quite sync line frequency spectrum analyzer main component get rid noise look spectrum using hp audio range analyzer noise goes away minute switch isolation input guessing anlayzer diff amp input since read accurately dc
