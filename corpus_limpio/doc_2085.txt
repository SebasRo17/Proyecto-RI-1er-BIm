interfacing simple circuits run cpu board runs optoisolator led side put signal want resistor base transistor side tie cpu input line collector pullup resistor functions ok seems slow detect pulses occur much faster isnt risefall time device something like able detect target cant get done using wirewrap wires going cpu test pin inches long im anything highspeed art electronics mentions tying base phototransistor ground resistor improve speed need calculate resistor value
