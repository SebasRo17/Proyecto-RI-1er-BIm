sure supposed post mail however last year involved developing graphical user interface gui applications enjoyed personally part news group wherin got interesting information helped work posting resuming hoping people working area would make time look westgate hall isu ames ia april dear prospective employer seeking employment software engineer interests software design development utilize experience hardware c c programming graphical user interface gui operating systems computer networking received bachelors engineering degree electronics engineering ms degree electrical engineering dec iowa state university currently enrolled ms computer engineering iowa state university masters program research assistant since jan published three papers including one ieee transactions magnetics papers reflection quality research ability learn new concepts quickly involved many projects involving software developments extensive experience programming c c fortran assembly level also familiar operating systems like unix ultrix msdos familiar motifx programming currently research assistant involved graphical user interface gui design using multiplatform gui toolkit xvt experiences also include areas operating systems computer networks course work projects involved study design development internals xinu operating system also involved many tcpip programming projects computer networking college learnt importance clear concise communication also learned lot time management ms program maintained grade average worked hours per week enjoyed involved many extra curricular activities software experiences along hardware background electronics engineering would helpful career goals software engineer request qualifications may kindly reviewed would like interview discuss
