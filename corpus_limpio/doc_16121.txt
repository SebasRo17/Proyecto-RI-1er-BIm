bad question dont refs list algorithm either thinking bit shouldnt hard take three points find plane define well circle lie say algorithm already find center circle line passing center perpendicular plane three points passes center sphere repeat unused point two original points gives two different lines pass spheres origin interection center sphere radius easy compute distance center original points ill leave math workable algorithm alternate method would take pairs points plane formed perpendicular bisector line segment pair also contains center sphere three pairs form three planes intersecting point might easier implement
