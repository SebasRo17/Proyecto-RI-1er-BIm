put conductor changing magnetic field produces voltage two ways permanent magnet move magnet move conductor slow shifting earths magnetic field isnt really significant especially consider weak earths magnetic field begin well would require generating incredibly large magnetic field repel earths magnetic field magnet repel another magnet course force works one direction magnetic field generated unimaginably powerful magnetic repulsion drops earths magnetic field surface already weak would require sort unknown superconductor special nonmagnetic construction seriously hardenned electronics optical computers perhaps physiological danger would significant due iron content blood among things words forget missed dragless satellite thread sounds totally bogus little bit
