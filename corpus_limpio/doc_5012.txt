sorry delay responding due conference paper deadline panic alarming amounts agreement deleted complicated isnt fact ph phg comes way around ph phg phg g complement g axiom panything phg ph phg sense hg necessarily complicated h h g may splitting hairs im trying say irrespective subjective impressions complicated something ph phg holds equality phg well px px b means x likely observed operative b operative implies observing x provide useful information might allow us discriminate respective possibilities b operative difference reduces difference unknown unhelpful prior probabilities pa pb px px b pa x k pa pb x k pb k px px px b px b equally consistent data observing x doesnt give pointers b operative particular case h b hg however know prior probabilities ordered ph phg although dont know actual values allows us deploy razor throw hg thats certainly true particular point whether divine component actually underlies prevalence religion addition memetic transmission component even religious implicitly acknowledge operative talk spreading word seems ive said observed variance religious belief well accounted memetic transmission model rather less well one proposes divine component addition since would expect latter conspire wide variance even mutual exclusion among beliefs thus personal feeling px hg isnt even equal px h case smaller h memetic transmission g divine component x variance among beliefs happily acknowledge subjective impression im statistician either idea theism atheism compatible read observations date however theism type concerned also suggests instance prayer may answered people may miraculously healed principle amenable statistical verification gods may generally intervene measurable ways means regions space possible observations loosely termed appearances gods nonzero probability theistic hypothesis zero atheistic since much probability available hypothesis scatter around observation space probability theism expends making appearances gods possible must come somewhere else ie possible observations else equal means observation isnt appearance gods must slightly higher probability atheism theism bayesian stuff implies observations must cause running estimate probability atheistic hypothesis increase corresponding decrease running estimate probability theistic hypothesis sorry thats still bit jargonesque rather difficult put way since depend intimately properties conditional probability densities particularly total area always unity analogy may may helpful say hypothesis coin fair b coin unfair twoheaded ive used b avoid confusion hheads ttails ph total pt ph b total pt b observations string heads tails compatible fair coin twoheaded coin b however probability expended making possible appearance tails even though dont actually appear must come somewhere else since total must unity comes case probability appearance heads say running estimates time observation xn time n another head xn h estimates modified according ph ena ph ph b enb ph dont know ph actual prior probability head multiplier ea half eb true every time coin tossed head observed thus whatever initial values estimates n heads n ena n enb since eka ekb time k show thus hence estimate faircoin hypothesis must decrease trial twoheaded coin hypothesis b must increase even though hypotheses compatible string heads loose analogy unfair coin atheism fair coin theism observations consistent tail would falsify unfair coin analogous appearance gods would falsify atheism claiming analogy extends numerical values various probabilities principle quite type theism might call g hg terms ockhams razor discussion id bin grounds hypotheses dont falsifiable indeed model theism isnt falsifiable dont dont need analogy know prior probabilities deduce updating multiplier faircoin hypothesis less unity corresponding multiplier twoheaded coin hypothesis greater unity dont need know initial values running estimates either clear large number observations pfaircoin approaches zero ptwoheadedcoin approaches unity need know whether px ha larger px ht observed x follows assumptions certain events rendered possible necessary ht possible ha else equal observations like really doesnt matter affect reasoning provided possible observations would count appearances gods examples might demonstration efficacy prayer veracity revelation ok well downgrade interact may interact would actually better since interact implies falsifiability agree misplaced ill explain bear mind isnt central require theism make prediction appearances gods never happen atheism somebody points quantum mechanics doesnt make prediction either difference qm atheism form partition predictions include statements prayer efficacious implying stats find prayer efficacious prayer efficacious verily say unto generation shall pass till things fulfilled dont think problems misunderstanding thats fine dont claim theism false merely finite number observations available far suggest continue observe suggestion looks better better think appearance gods sufficient falsify atheism whereas general corresponding theism unfalsifiable way counterexample let x coin fair accurately notx makes sense two sides coin different unfalsifiable tossing coin even string heads consistent fair coin go infinite number tosses falsify x limit converse falsifiable falsified least one head least one tail appeared oops sorry mea culpa agree rapture happen october said rapture would falsified atheism satisfaction happened although failure happen course falsify theisms specifically predicted phenomenon requires existence one gods explanation ever observed sums whole thing cheers simon
