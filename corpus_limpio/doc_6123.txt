comment thermal recalibration general new drives perform order increase overall integrity data writes basically firmware instructs actuator perform test see data tracks within certain physical tolerance since media heats cools track drift inevitable drive monitor becomes especially critical high recording densities used primarily largecapacity mechanisms seems finding way smaller drives way boosting drives longterm reliability mtbf ratings first became aware thermal recalibration pointed technique conflicts prolonged write times digitizing say audio video hard disk manufacturers explicitly state drives thermal recalibration used applications prolonged disk writes hope helps
