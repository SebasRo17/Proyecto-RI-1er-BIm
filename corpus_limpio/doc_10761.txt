obviously count rates low signal rise times long possible cgro meters long youd need time accuracy nanoseconds batse actually measure relative strength detectors also function photon energy detectors isotropic response right one must model scattering photons material around detector even scattering photons earths atmosphere back onto spacecraft believe reduced error degrees
