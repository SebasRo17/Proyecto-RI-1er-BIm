im sure help local interstellar radiation field measured modeled various groups remember things correctly models involved contributions three different bb sources theres obvious temperature background radiation local area however following references give interstellar radiation density function wavelength integrate average appropriate manner get effective temperature like witt johnson astrophys j henry et al astrophys j mathis et al astron astrophys see references date might get started hope helps
