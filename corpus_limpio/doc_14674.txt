dont conflict technically use parallel printer processor actual number escapes contains printer control register enables chip transmit interrupt interrupt controller onto main processor int default parallel printer processor enable interrupt line therefore int sourced printer controller chip thus enabling devices use actual note applies com ports also default route interrupts system bus although coms software usually enable feature make monitoring com port activity easier polling serial uart thus probably getting sound card slighty confused
