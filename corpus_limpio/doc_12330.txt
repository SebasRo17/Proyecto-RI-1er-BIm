great post martin informative wellbalanced humanitarian without neglecting need scientific rigor crossposted altpsychologypersonality since personality typing discussed beginning note ive set followups scimed since comments scimed oriented im sure replies medrelated responding natural way hypercholeric syndrome hcs oops recognized illness psychological community better say since therefore must never exist actually fascinating disproportionate number physicians type nt familiar myersbriggs system email ill send summary file general population nts comprise population among physicians much much higher dont know exact percentage help appers one driving characteristic nt especially ntj obvious choleric behavior driver type etc extreme emotional need control lead andor best competent also extroverted best described field marshalls trait valuable essential society need people want lead strive overcome elements seek thirst knowledge raise level competency etc great successes science technology large part due vision n trait scientifically minded approach trait nt personality course types temperaments positive contributions well however nt person selfimage challenges darkside personality type usually comes obvious physician strong nt learned temper temperament extremely businesslike lack empathy feeling compelled total control patient patient must obedient diagnosis prescription without question ive known many mds temperament suffice say dont oblige followup visit matter competent think usually competent knowledge viewpoint since extreme drive know know maybe need nf doctors enough subject lets move candida bloom youve helped already post course believe misdiagnosed net suffering anal retentivitis phlegmatic maybe little harsh people past posts lets try raise level discussion level anal effluent welldescribed situation prior posts definitely immune stressed blood tests showed vitamin levels low sinuses mess doubt mucosal lining cilia heavily damaged also antibiotics times years end even two weeks ceftin work confirmed diagnoses chronic bacterial infection sinuses via catscans mucus color wont get details symptoms three traditional ents made diagnosis cultures done however difficulty right symptoms clearly showed bacterial infection enough background provided help understand make comments sporanox antifungal therapy first question fungus penetrate little way poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without considered systemic classic sense sort inbetween infection concerned toxicity vitamin doctor blood tests put iu vitamin one week dropped iu next couple weeks also received zinc supplementation since interrelate fairly complex ways doctor explained hes one evil orthomolecular specialists blood test three weeks later vitamin normal stopped vitamin except multivitamin supplement made sure maintain iuday beta carotene call carrot face hopefully elaines doctor take similar careful approach supplements im even reevaluating supplements im taking example niacin fairly large dosages gramday steve dyer good information scimednutrition niacin secondorder improvement symptomatic relief sinus allergies probably worth taking large dose longterm risking liver damage though believe based successful therapy sporanox definitely excessive growth fungus unknown species sinuses still want ask question studies demonstrate candida blooms sinuses associated sinus irritation sinusitisrhinitis sinus irritation reduced significantly one week sporanox new treatments implemented time noticeable gi track problems starting sporanox days went away considered normal btw doctor dug one medical reference books sorry cant remember one found obscure comment dating back stated people develop contained nonlethal nonserious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis sinuses leading sinus inflammation symptoms ill dig reference since relevant discussion doctor tested believe rast rast similar test allergic response specificially candida albicans showed strong positive another question would everybody show strong positive test essentially useless assuming true candida grow partway mucus membrane tissue concentration exceeds threshold amount could person tests allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptoms mucus membrane irritation due bodys allergic response said earlier post one need rocket scientist md degree phd biochemistry see plausibility hypothesis btw ill repost dr ivker book sinus survival routinely given anything else nizoral presporanox systemic antifungal safe good sporanox new chronic sinusitis patients antibiotics four times last two years claims patients well notice relief sinus inflammation symptoms doesnt cure means implying socalled yeastfungus infection primary cause later complication hes also found nystatin whether taken internally put sinus spray help implies course assuming excessive yeastfungus bloom aggravating sinus inflammation yeastfungus grown partway tissue since nystatin kill yeastfungus direct contact absorbed blood stream admit lots ifs implies doesnt please hardcore nt doubleblind study nonissue one start plausible hypothesisexplanation strawman brings interesting observation used deny reject aspects yeast hypothesis appropriate studies done cant observe culture yeast bloom gut sinus theres way diagnose even recognize disease know realize virtually impossible test candida overbloom part body easily observed since candida everywhere body real another totally reject yeast hypothesis say studies done actually studies done certain standard perspective nonstudy even considered agree appropriate studies done take big right however order convince funding agencies austere times open wallets literally give evidence acceptable evidence compete proposals paradoxically almost exact study needed funding study even get funding scientist national lab im aware smaller funded projects im afraid even dr ivker doctors got together pooled practices case histories anecdotes compelling picture approach funding agencies would get nowhere even able publish statistical results obvious comments doctors decided excessive yeast colonization gut sinuses leading noticeable nonlethal symptoms exist even tenable hypothesis amount case histories compiled anecdotal evidence contrary never change mind would also oppose needed studies minds done issue excessive yeast growth leading diffuse allergic symptoms exist period kind tough dialog hold viewpoint kind reminds lister arent also nutrients necessary proper working sinus mucus membranes cilia evidence mycological studies indicate many yeastfungus species grow hyphae roots deep tissue similar mold growing bread continue kill surface nystatin cant kill deeper tissue without using systemic antifungal itraconazole sporanox older ones nizoral toxic effective pointed recent studies sent doctor ive email contact thanks nystatin effective long term treatment gi tract candidiasis like trying weed garden cutting whats ground leaving roots ready come walk away question whether contained candida bloom partially grow tissue mucus membranes causing types symptoms susceptible people eg allergy without becoming systemic classical sense word something strictly excessive bloom causing problems fullblown systemic infection potentially lethal also one anal retentive like ive diagnosed prior post also provide sites excessive candida growth ive said private email flaws current medical system make difficult even impossible physician attempt alternative therapies approvedprovenaccepted therapies dont work example went three ents said live acutechronic sinusitis abs failed mention surgery open ostia ostia werent plugged would get root cause condition three months aggressive fairly nonstandard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc health vastly improved two years ago health greatly deteriorated course skeptics would say maybe nothing would improved anyway view stretching things quite far experience three ents saw said id live im confident reach one could call total cure antifungal program undertook one necessary step direction overuse abs last four years note sinus problems may suggest book dr ivker mention sure get revised edition dr ivker started chronic severe sinus problems visits several ents totally floored said youll live spent several years trying everything standard nonstandard essentially cured chronic sinusitis shares approach book honestly say road recovery following parts one recommendation take systemic antifungal beginning treatment history antibiotic overuse proven time time practice im sure commented hardcore beliefs anti yeast hypothesis posters would definite things say worked wonders almost two thousand cases put mildly also would surprised would say ones violating moral obligations help patient maybe doctors reading practice confronted patient symptoms could due hypothetical yeast overgrowth eg fit profiles proyeast people identified consider antifungal therapy avenues exhausted remember theory practice two different things one without synergistic doctor something nonstandard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief thousand patients shouldnt least sit take notice maybe ought trust says begin hypothesizing works instead shouldnt work im afraid lot doctors become enamored scientific correctness ignoring patients sworn help balanced dont see posters group comes point use little common sense maybe empirical approach trying good systemic antifungal sporanox exhausted avenues one traditional medical establishment able help natural thing went couple doctors somewhat outside establishment result found significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear sued license pulled try experimental unproven beyond doubt therapies hisher patients finally reach point accepted therapies ineffective id like hear doctor tell well ive tried therapies approved accepted country since clearly dont work authority use experimental unproven techniques seem helped others cant promise anything risks sign something saying understand experimental possibly risky nature unproven therapies ill register case state board anyway ent suggested wouldve jumped pronto instead going one doctors either altruistic reasons greed practicing alternative therapies much risk himher risk meaning losing license possibly patient mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine also provide valuable data would essentially free also would morally ethically better current system showing compassion medical community patient everything within reason help patient lack mechanism leading large numbers people try alternative therapies seem work like case others never work true quackery better get soapbox post reaches size dosage appears necessary promote healing proper working mucos memebranes id like see role complex carbohydrates starch brave soul venom usenet quite toxic unless one develops immunity one year ago phlegmatic self would backed right away attack cholericitis immune system computer system hardened gradual desensitization kind like called anal retentive nice ring also impressed flowed post truly classic worthy blue maybe brown ribbon might even crosspost altbestofinternet hmmm thanks great informative post hope others researched area lurking background post thoughts well matter views subject jon noring charter member infj club
