best knowledge arent problems quadras blind transfers trouble blind transfers usually means programmer screwed tibs didnt test driver device question well designed tibs poll loop every point delays occur usually occurs first byte block transfer devices hiccup middle blocks happens middle blind transfer possibility losing gaining byte depending direction tranfer going anycase scsi manager eventually return phase error end transaction sync actual data loss would occur driver didnt pay attention errors coming back note effect caused anything actually scsi bus rather transfer loops inside scsi manager problem occurs processor bus errors trying access scsi chip next byte hasnt clocked yet also note bus error dealt bus error handler doesnt crash machine
