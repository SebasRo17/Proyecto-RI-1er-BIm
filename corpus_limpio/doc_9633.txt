well simple youre earths magnetic field dont generate electricity done way power things electricity answer first question definitely yes meant say propel rather power answer sort yes use interaction earths magnetic field get electrical power potential applications however bear mind free lunch energy isnt coming nowhere systems convert energy orbital velocity electrical energy cases useful tradeoff using power obtained way propulsion useful special situations however get power means eg solar arrays run interaction magnetic field reverse pumping energy orbit rather taking energy want information trying looking electrodynamic propulsion tether applications magsails dragless satellite magically drag burns fuel constantly fight drag maintaining exact orbit would drag quotes around dragless
