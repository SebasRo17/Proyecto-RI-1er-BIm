true especially electrolytic capacitors high temperature low power quartz oscillators usually khz significant temperature drifts one doesnt often notice wearing watch ones wrist low temperature sensitivity available crystal types unfortunately larger higher frequency mhz take battery power programmable timers might less accurate powerstingy suitable crystal oscillators
