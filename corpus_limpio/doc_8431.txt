ok fact two distinct components transmitted chip real message encrypted conventional key serial number encrypted conventional key encrypted imho kind bogus whole concept one key millions people use cant changed doesnt seem reasonable family key suppose analyze output chip im able determine bits encrypted packet contains serial number session key suppose also design simple algorithm based information takes data containing encrypted session key twiddles bit several sent line mind im sure nsa thought along dozen attacks cant imagine system probably somehow designed manipulation information cause compliant receiving chip somehow fail decrypt successfully two parties agree advance kind consistent bittwiddling scheme decryption chip sees restored proper bitstream eavesdropper gets ek uk packet thats wrong suppose could easily defeated chip sends information many times slightly different ways making effectively impossible certain know information sent
