easy answer question depends whether display device hold pixmaps offscreen memory efficiently server manages resources deal limited offscreen memory bane server implementors existence worked graphics devices offscreen memory main display copy rate eclipses main memory display copy rate main memory display faster offscreen display requires write framebuffer rather read fb followed write server uses cfb code something like render pixmaps cpu main memory rates get mitshm likely equal maybe tad slower depending oss implementation shared memory copyarea pixmap window also copy cpu main memory graphics device one advanage mitshm images large dont end growing size server process hold one disadvantage mitshm sample implementation provision elegantly cleaning shared memory segments client dies sudden violent death eg kill mindful cluttering system zombie shared memory segments ken
