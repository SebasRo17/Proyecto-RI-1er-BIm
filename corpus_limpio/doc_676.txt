marvin minsky hi writes building perceptrons using motordriven potentiometers vary weights reported circuits worked even tho wiring errors say robust cadium sulfide cells vary light cmos ttl gates provide sigmoid somewhatlinearyetsomewhatlimiter transfer function often used low power schottky gates earlier gates gain leds probably output enough light easily control cds cells even paper dark light regions controlled pencil eraser could also control cds resistance high input resistance cmos gates may let charge papermylar caps serve memory
