simple style ide controller use dma cpu performs data transfer string move instruction requires cpu stop transfer data smart drive controllers ide scsi transfer via dma controllers tend cost wether ide scsi get dma benefits ide must sacrifice price advantage controller floppies arent ide bus arguement makes sense isnt ide issue floppys processor controller board handles commands difference ide scsi scsi peripherials intelligent controller depend cpu fewer things ie ide drives needing processor transfer data dettachcallback mechanism alows cpu make requests devices scsi bus dettach go business later device done issues callback say data arrived function completed scsi cards also dma data memory without interupting cpu therefore allowing continue working uninterupted ide supports concept dettachcallback see would win multitasking system david willmore willmoreiastateedu death dishonor better dead greek david willmore ever noticed much look like orchids lovely
