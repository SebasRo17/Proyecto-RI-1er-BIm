freeenergy technology robert e mcelwaine physicist ninety hundred years ago everybody knew heavierthanair machine could possibly fly would violate laws physics experts authorities said example simon newcomb declared demonstration possible combination known substances known forms machinery known forms force united practical machine man shall fly long distances air seems writer complete possible demonstration physical fact fortunately smart people wright brothers accept pronouncements final word take airplanes granted except crash today orthodox physicists scientists saying similar things several kinds free energy technologies using negative terms pseudoscience perpetual motion citing socalled laws assert energy created destroyed law thermodynamics always decrease useful energy law thermodynamics physicists know certain things arrogantly declare things done principles impotence common orthodox modern science help cover inconsistencies contradictions orthodox modern theories free energy inventions devices tap seemingly unlimited supply energy universe burning kind fuel making perfect solution worldwide energy crisis associated pollution degradation depletion environment free energy devices probably create energy rather tap existing natural energy sources various forms induction unlike solar wind devices need little energy storage capacity tap much energy needed needed solar energy disadvantage sun often blocked clouds trees buildings earth reduced haze smog thick atmosphere low altitudes high latitudes likewise wind speed widely variable often nonexistent neither solar wind power suitable directly power cars airplanes properly designed free energy devices limitations example least three us patents far awarded motors run exclusively permanent magnets seemingly

rotation via coriolis effect like tornado also neutralize gravity fourth type free energy device mcclintock air motor us patent cross diesel engine three cylinders compression ratio rotary engine solar planetary gears burns fuel becomes selfrunning driving air compressor engine also generates lot heat could used heat buildings high torque makes ideal large trucks preventing slowing climbing hills david mcclintock also real original inventor automatic transmission differential drive crystals may someday used supply energy shown star trek shows perhaps inserting one metal capacitor plates bombarding beam particles small radioactive source like used common household smoke detector one energy source mentioned despite fact fit definition free energy bulgarianborn american physicist named joseph maglich invented partially developed atomic fusion reactor calls migma uses nonradioactive deuterium fuel available nearly unlimited quantities sea water produce radioactive waste converted directly electricity without energywasting steam turbines constructed small enough power house large enough power city unlike tokamaks laser fusion monstrosities read migma works already producing least three watts power every watt put new times us version pages cold fusion experiments news lately originally conducted university utah researchers b stanley pons martin fleischmann us navy researchers china lake naval weapons center california direction chemist melvin miles finally took trouble collect bubbles coming apparatus analyzed massspectrometry techniques found helium proves atomic fusion indeed take place enough explain excess heat generated good indications two socalled laws thermodynamics absolute example late physicist dewey b larson developed comprehensive general unified theory physical universe calls reciprocal system describes detail several books nothing motion universe motion physical universe two distinct halves material half antimatter half continuous cycle matter energy passing without heat death predicted thermodynamic laws theory explains universe much better modern orthodox theories including phenomena orthodox physicists astronomers still scratching heads selfconsistent every way free energy devices might tapping energy flow seemingly converting lowquality energy highquality energy also certain religious organizations sant mat eckankar teach members physical universe lowest least dozen major levels existence like parallel universes analogous tv channels described books like path masters dr julian johnson eckankar key secret worlds sri paul twitchell example next level physical universe commonly called astral plane longtime members groups learned soul travel higher worlds report conditions seems plausible energy could flow higher levels physical universe created boundary given right configuration matter channel supported many successful laboratorycontrolled experiments psychokinesis throughout world described book psychic discoveries behind iron curtain terms economics market failed inventors enough money resources fully develop massproduce free energy equipment conventional energy producer desire veted interet government needed intervene government intervene total supply energy resources earth continue decline soon run prices energy increase pollution harmful effects including greenhouse effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spills rape land strip mining etc continue increase government subsidize research development free energy inventors universities subsidize private production producers make subsidize consumption lowincome consumers free energy hardware longrange effects government intervention would widespread profound quantity energy demanded conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie countries electric utilitie etc would drop near zero forcing employees seek work elsewhere energy resources coal uranium oil gas would left ground prices conventional energy supplies would also drop near zero price free energy equipment would start high drop supply increases happened vcrs personal computers etc costs producing products require large quantities energy produce would decrease along prices consumers consumers would able realize opportunity costs paying electric utility bills buying home heating fuel tourism would benefit increase travelers would spend money gasoline cars government tax revenue gasoline fuels would obtained way energy could longer used motive excuse making war many conventional energy producer would go business society whole earths environment ecosystems would benefit greatly people government serve rather big corporation bank information answers questions etc please consult cited sources patents articles books
