firstly would never consider trying make oneshot timer cap designed ram battery substitute rather use applications wish drain cap constant current performance respects akin batteries normal cap point big electros usually rated tolerances calculating exactly capacitance particularly considering cold looking designing micropower oscillator divider chain rolls zero maximum count viceversa every seconds use something like clock would need divider chain give error less one percent firing times six week period course could trim oscillator give exact time likelyhood oscillator remaining exactly constant low anyway would suspect would far battrey drain firing solenoid would timer circuit caveat im experienced low temperature electronics cant guarantee approach best inhospitable conditions johnh electronics department school mpce macquarie university sydney australia email johnhmpcemqeduau ph fax
