definitely wrong newsgroup never mind machine powered heat motor steam gasturbine steamengine thermoelementetc work better bigger temperature difference input output never get thermic energy powering medium steam burning gaz etc eliminate rest energy keep efficency high thermal electric power plant coal oil atomic power works way heat water steam power turbine generators dont get whole energy steam efficency never cool steam something else power plants use cooling towers purpose type megarefrigerator others use water river ecologically unobjectionable got cheers robert
