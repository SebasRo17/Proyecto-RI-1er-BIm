would like know without irq nmi address lines giving memory space didnt know called thats cia found commodore dont believe chip existed around tia mapped bottom bytes page shadowed bottom bytes page get image screen wait raster line picture started load bitmaps line sprite registers tell x positions take many duplicates wanted etc next line took processors time visible portion display ram mapped top bytes page shadowed page zeropage addressing mode instructions shorter faster normal ones important machine like scratchpad ram page unfortunately also wants stack page stack pointer bits high byte address hardwired iot section mapped page somewhere bit io registers cant remember bit could independantly set like bit timer programmable prescaler think power interrupts system many games would set timer known time go away something else sit wait timer run logic box address decoding riot least chip select pins probably one active high one active low imagine tia much various address lines fed directly chip selects likes rom right top memory use roms active high chip selects exactly normal cartriges convert usual active low chip select
