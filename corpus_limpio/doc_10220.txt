concrete floor accelerates problem heat sink colder leadacid battery selfdischarges slightly faster rate thats old wives tale sitting piece wood floor works help keep killing battery fast insulates battery thermally youll set battery piece styrofoam selfdischarge even slower best thing would attach small load small transistor radio volume turned low leave constantly also tricklecharge every couple days shallow cycle charge battery mild exercising leadacid battery next best thing completely removing electrolyte storage remove electrolyte may sure keep separate storage containers cells electrolyte put back cells refill battery isnt critical brandnew battery fully charged state maximize restored output older battery may fully charged remove electrolyte storage
