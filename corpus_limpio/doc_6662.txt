first step make sure dc component intentional audio lines switched neither output input presents unintentional dc level lets say theyre capacitively coupled putting k resistor input ground output ground good precaution leakage coupling caps presenting dc level guaranteed cause click device presents unintentional dc level coupling capacitor leakage need remove dc switching coupling capacitors one relay relay switching one input common output use makebeforebreak switching brief instant sources connected switch change may mask switch click audio switch clickless made taking light bulb making ersatz optoisolator lightdependent resistor ldr sealed inside piece black heatshrink many broadcast consoles use older timehonored technique claro actually makes complete optisolator like dont part number handy radio shack ldr grabbag might want try simple solid state clickless switch cheap might try looking analog switch commonly available older predecessor dc component must removed prior switching alternatives include jfet switches discrete ic diode switching works relatively well surprisingly pitfalls application tips could easily make subject multipage article solid state switches may induce click turned due charge injected audio line device capacitance control signal changes state techniques minimize include lowering impedance signal paths switch differential switching slowing risetime control pulse cutting click simple putting resistors series control pins hope helps least get started dave medin phone w ssdnetworking h intergraph corp ms internet huntsville al uucp everywhere look least around office
