wrong wrong completely wrong little misleading white noise random noise whose energy density constant constant bandwidth hz wide band hz precisely amount energy hz band khz pink noise random noise whose energy density constant constant precentage bandwidth thus wide band noise hz whose bandwidth hz contain energy wide band khz whose bandwidth hz wide white noise often used spectrum analyzers constant bandwidths pink noise used audiotype realtime analyzers whose bandwidths centertfrequency dependent often described octave octave terminology white noise relative pink noise energy high frequencies rate equal db per octave pink noise relative white noise energy low frequencies rate equl dboctave
