ibm problem workstations also shocked first realized offset lines fills bits assuming bit z buffer seems huge dynamic range terms doesnt seem bad happening interpolation z totally linear due mainly roundoff believe polygon planar z like ruffles potato chip ditto lines startend different xy values ridges phase resulting stitch effect problem try draw polygon right top another different vertices likely see smeared effect overlap example try polygon polygon implementation correct fact similar trick rendering primitives lines polygons nurbs surfaces isoparametric lines without trick lines appear stitched say application draws linespolygons independently system smarts automatically z shifting application must discovered bravo note ibmers information given previously disclosed proper channels im giving away new unpublished info
