article theism strongly correlated irrational belief absolutes irrational belief absolutes strongly correlated fanatism deletion theism correlated fanaticism neither said fanatism caused theism theism leads fanatism point theism increases chance becoming fanatic one could course argue would fanatics tend towards theism example loook times history theism dominant ideology invalidate conclusion basic mechanism behind imo influence stalin matter ayn rand invalidates assumption theism factor considered bogus said theism factor fanatism point theism factor thats claim back consider argument useful following belief strongly correlated fanaticism therefore belief factor fanaticism true utterly useless note belief belief gods tiring say least backed read first statement read conspicuous absence evidence point latter fallacy wrong analogy saying someone believes something hardly information person saying someone theist holds much information correlation theists fanatism higher belief fanatism special features theistic belief truth blatant assertion evidence gullibility blind obedience authority lack scepticism reliable indicators really dangerous people sources fanaticism often none things cynical manipulators gullible know precisely thats claim support please note especially field theism leaders believe say believe youre incredibly naive frank odwyer living dream world wonder base discussion left statement matter fact think ignorant human nature even one starts something one believe one gets easily fooled actually believing one says give benefit doubt prove statement onus proof sunshine makes think theist leaders believe say especially say one thing another say one thing closely followed opposite practice restricted theism anyone see almost epidemic country instance harder camel pass thru eye needle catholic church wealthy landowner churches square inch country brands theism precisely theists tend fanaticism grant tar theists brush bigotry reasoned argument reads like warmup censorship restriction religious freedom ever read animal farm thats straw man usually discussions one repeat read written every theism leads fanatism fanatism caused theism point correlation comes innate features theism comes features theism common fanaticism last statement simply isnt implied say youre trying sneak innate features theism word youre groping bogus theism fanatic however rest already gives backup statement correlation fanatism theism specialty theistic beliefs allows switch fanatism easily takes nifty improvement theology truth blatant assertion gullibility way one shit sherlock talk gullibility instead theism since seems whole lot relevant case opposed case trying make theism attraction gullible people causing correlation whole discussion started way statement theism meaningfully correlated fanatism challenged indeed recall asked evidence correlation speak say going forbid religion another straw men interesting nothing better offer said reads like warm thats irrational bogus tirade use creating nice themus split minds excitable people found either side church walls blah blah blah quite well aware giving everyone rights protects better fanatics way round course people always fanatics never oneself wish slur theists seems pretty fanatical quite nice see actually implying connection argument rise fanatism far another assertions define irrational belief eg rational believe reason always useful irrational belief belief based upon reason latter discussed long time charley wingate one point beliefs violate reason often another process lend rational analysis contain reliable information well glaring paradox argument reason useful based reason would circular argument based reason would irrational thats bogus self reference circular since evaluation usefulness possible within rational systems allowed ok oval still begging question however though certainly allowed rational claiming rational another assertions proof evidence claims hey learned good risk repeating hearing didnt hear refutation back deal cant use reason demonstrate reason useful someone thinks reason crap wont buy see unusually weak even latter implies proof depends opinion somehow accept triangles wont accept pythagoras wow thats incredible insight dont prove wrong opinion possible show systems leave useful information respectively claims unreliable even absurd statements information totally circular totally useless wish believe makes believe things judges appeal information makes feel good believe may good contains zillions possible pitfalls belief despite contrary evidence bogus proofs attempt truth blatant assertion ive seen many bogus proofs nonexistence gods existence rational systems way mean every data come logical analysis point evaluation data contradict logic easily follows system allows evaluate rational yes possible evaluate rational system rational fallacies system since validity axioms agreed upon little impact possibility demon ala descartes doesnt parse sorry far matter consistency use ratiional arguments show system consistent isnt evaluation predictions need rationality contradict however argument silly proving mathematical statements needs mathematics mathematics therfore circular anybody else think godel silly stream consciousness typing supposed mean first part second statement contains information dont say beliefs beliefs strong theism andor strong atheism statement general true second part sentence patently false counterexample axiomatic datum lend rational analysis assumed contain reliable information regardless process used obtain ive speaking religious systems contradictory definitions god axiomatic datum lends rational analysis say often refuted fallacy look discussion axiom choice one evaluate axioms larger systems usually derived exist derived want way one test consistency set axioms trying say point people always wind saying datum reliable particular reason example dreaming nope evidence trick choice axiomatic basis system difficult possibilities interwoven one therefore chooses least assumptions assumptions necessary get information system anyway id like see alleged evidence one need define axioms order define evaluation method usefulness foundation laid one feels thats one feels see irrational beliefs fanatics never compared evidence theists claims strength demands makes whole thing irrational antirational cant agree specific theism say theism necessarily antirational requires proof suspect using traditonal definition gods personal supernatural entities objective effects world usually connected morals andor way world works imo belief gods necessarily irrational mean people hold principle opposed exercise intelligence atheists also scientists example dont use theism science wouldnt science please note subjective data lend scientific treatment well prohibit formulating objective statements ergo nothing objective fair enough affinity fanatism easily seen true believe nothing work hypothesis however beliefs say work hypothesis dont understand formalise argument person believes system b becuase sounds nice make b true best work hypothesis however content b true work hypothesis testing evaluating evidence therefore dismissed b already believed says wrong waste time possible depending contents b amalekitesidolatersprotestants killed interesting effects peculiar definition interesting sure show belief gods entails contents speak arent catholic neighbours killing protestants example maybe dont believe maybe conjunction b asserts b jailkill dissenters important belief gods entirely irrelevant certainly seems axe grind example neighbours fallacy neighbours dont says little others times exactly happened nope fallacy doesnt go correlation wish see tell irrelevant statements amalekites idolaters holy books please note one could edit relevant anymore gods dont err say message excuse holy books come theists saying genocides ordered god ok god easiest way excuse anything therefore highly attracting fanatics mention effect interpretation fanatics rest believers happens god neither easiest way excuse anything way
