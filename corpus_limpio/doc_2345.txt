whole hell lot better degrees differential timing measurements interplanetary network ignore directional information batse look time arrival three detectors properly arranged one often get positions arc minutes btw oort cloud sources shouldnt testable fairly near future grbs short rise times ms could detect curvature burst wavefront distance order c b detector spacing time resolution ms b au order light years understand statistics reduce number considerably would geometry burst coming wrong direction
