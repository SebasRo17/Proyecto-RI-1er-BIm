fc exactly fraction current research done big fc visable light telescopes ive seen less fc amlost years ago sounds like dying fc doesnt seem like fair comparison infrared astronomy didnt really get started something like yrs ago didnt explode iras gammaray think xray observations didnt really get started believe true ultraviolet observations general know extreme uv short angstroms observations euve launched last year almost history except observations skylab twentyfive years ago vast majority astronomers access optical radio instruments far instruments available growth new fields resulted optical work representing smaller fraction total astronomical work fc would true adaptive optics worked well visable fc take look papers subject refer anything fc microns visable dont know fc people trouble seeing beyond microns fc reasons think adaptive optics work shorter fc wavelengths without truely radical improvements technology hmm folks department planning using adaptive optics palomar nearinfrared observations microns might surprised hear isnt ntt already pushing toward arcsecond resolution groundbased site remember arcseconds one selling points hst
