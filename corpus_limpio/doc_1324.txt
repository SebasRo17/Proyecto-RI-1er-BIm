pretty complex cd isnt whole story either cd cars usually calculated based frontal area car large car good cd could get drag force smaller car poorer cd calculate drag use formula rho cd drag force lbs rho local air density v velocity fts frontal area note pieces called rho sometimes called qbar dynamic pressure fancy aero term air pressure force note power p f v p power lbffts f force drag case lbf v velocity fts note put whole equation one substituting force get velocity cubed term thats huge increases power result little increases speed ditto decreases cd mph car reduce cd new top speed sound trumpet fanfare mph sorry dissappoint
