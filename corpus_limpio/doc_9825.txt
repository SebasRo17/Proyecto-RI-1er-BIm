khufu khafre patented biham shamir showed differential cryptanalysis break khafre chosen plaintext attack using different encryptions khafre rounds broken attack using different encryptions probably efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks someone wants take time look khufu keydependent sboxes immune differential cryptanalysis source code algorithm khafre patent snefru publicdomain oneway hash function version snefru produces hash vulnerable differential cryptanalysis vulnerable means attack efficient brute force four passes less given sha much efficient oh yes anyone interested licensing patent contact dave petre director patent licencing xerox
