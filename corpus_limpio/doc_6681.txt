ok game listed characteristics looking think may left important parameters polygons convex less n sides drawing meshes walls doors etc believe algorithms get draw convex polygons much efficient draw concave self intersecting polygons efficiency largely attributed fact simple convex polygons left right edge scan line complex figure type polygons bit trickier less n sides specification especially small number like allow othe optimisations made thus high speed game application think looking code exploits hence limited drawing simple convex polygons may general purpose algorithms limit four sided simple convex polygons think might suprised fast c algorithm asm block move fill scan line might actually
