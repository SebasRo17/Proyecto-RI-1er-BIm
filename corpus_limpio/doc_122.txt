heats formation deleted major problem reaction takes place acid solution soluble acid solution precipitate also water solution thus heats formation part irrelevant turns reaction indeed exothermic heat producing later actually happens make battery completely useless talking leadacid batteries course battery slowly self discharges discharge takes place two things happen level pb ions acid solution increases ie lead lead oxide plates dissolved level ions acid solution decreases ie solution becomes less acidic like water like post responding correctly stated precipitate water nonacid solution battery dies ie fully discharged end high concentration pb water forms solution falls bottom battery course happens varying degrees discharged precipitate forms precipitate forms conductive layer bottom battery enough lead lead oxide plates left touch precipitate common newer battery dead short results seen products automotive shops correct condition part useless dissolve restore lead lead oxide plates properly may success products newer battery stuff deleted stuff deleted stuff made author completely invalid fact discharge reaction takes place higher rate higher temperatures logical consequence argument really want car start lower battery temperature pull reaction along know experience least us canada gets cold true want start car really cold day warm battery besides enough energy released self discharge appreciably raise temperature air would amply dissipate heat whether bottom battery insulated course irrelevant since would want battery cool storage
