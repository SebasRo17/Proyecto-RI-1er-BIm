thousands tens thousands arithmetic please skipjack possible keys lets assume bruteforce engine like hypothesized des microsecond per trial million chips thats trials per second years trials well maybe get chips running one trial per nanosecond build machine million chips sure years solution idea uses keys shall bother calculations hint multiply years cant idea speed key setup takes much long wouldnt surprised case skipjack though theres way knowing yet des used xor thats feasible technology modern chips lot
