forsee compadible wd card unless right bios rom check numbers nonsmt chip board slightly center left bios read either last digits got problems looks right factory jumped trace pins select primary controller address looks right art deleted notice left jumper table settings control drive controller thinks rom set like open open open open closed closed open open note wd runs numbers jumper block top bottom represent jumper pins pins select first drive setting drive pins select second drive drive rom autoconfig ill look dont big book right see might problems jumpers right also risk insulting make sure cables right good jumper try moving opposite side drive one narrow data cable goes ive thrown times banged head day dunno ibm roms later quick way check boot dos run debug enter fffc debug prompt return rom date use oversimplified appologize hard know caliber person im talking bob valentine ravalentmailboxsyredu chppunitrixutracza mon apr received unitrixutracza ponder id mon apr
