stuff deleted two problems bios tod routine updates bios clock uses bit day increment second wrapping clock past midnight get lost one calls bios read clock meantime bios resets day wrap indicator first get date call anybody wrap indicator set unless first bios get date call midnight done dos kernel part dos knows increment date day wrap indication normally lost guess kevins menu system uses bios calls read clock order display time hence entity causes day wrap indication get lost even menu system notices day wrap think indicated nonzero value al really isnt particularly good way tell dos dos update day menu system use dos calls get time would cause dos kernel bios call wrap indicator would hence processed properly possibly though menu system cant easily use dos calls time dos reentrant perhaps time incrementing ofters occur menu system inside dos call
