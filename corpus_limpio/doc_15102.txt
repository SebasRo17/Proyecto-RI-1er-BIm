quite correct understanding filtering interpolation would distort frequency content signal listening generally players run samples thru allpass filter network done ecg waveforms persons heart effect rather spooky actually reconstructs peaks werent correctly fills gaps properly computed values real sample taken point use cpu math takes decent unreasonable amount cpu time keep things realtime write efficient code case care filtering method uses fir finite impulse response filter id guess cd makers use kind method anybody know real answer id say use tapped delay line resistoropamp weighting accomplish filtering strikes cost effective method volume production runs actually think reason say marketting gimic would guess acutally cheaper filter oversampled signal use sloppier components give filter rolloff isnt sharp bad charge something think actually less costly build seriously doubt filters cost better built price spec spec says cheap possible dave
