first realize tesla invented ac power generators motors transformers conductors etc technically transformers tesla coils general though someone refers tesla coil mean air core resonant transformer tv flyback version tesla coil see encyclopediaofelectroniccircuits diagram air core class circuit called oscillating shuttle circuit osc generally oscs highly efficient version uses transistors resistors lossy devices typically tesla used active reactances instead passive resistors could achieve efficiencies better usual application aircore resonant transformer osc produce strong emi wireless broadcasts well think computer screen would work removed hf hv tesla flyback coil remove homes industries tesla coils lights would go dark cars would sputter die radios would go silent industries would grind halt would go back using coal heat gas lamps horses transportation steam power telegraph communication real world enough get message would convieniences today tesla give credit credit due edison wed still century flame peril im good putting edison et tesla years ahead time perhaps time comes
