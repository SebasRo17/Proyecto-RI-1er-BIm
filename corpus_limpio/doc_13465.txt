aaahh problem near dear heart case monitors cause problem deflection coil monitors specific also seen monitor backed fuse panel exhibit problem sounds like problem since flourescent lites motors etc several feet away seem far cause juice running must pass nearby monitor fusebox side wall maybe started specing panasonic video monitors switchable input linesvid aud svhs one stopped wavy interference effect computer monitor next problem need known mu shielding common fact almost mandatory electrostatic deflection type oscopes talked ee prof said get coffee cut ends mount around deflection coil interfering monitor careful avoid high voltage circuitry especially thicker high voltage anode lead usually colored red kill dont blamesue use plastic nonconducting standoffs mount would assume good keeping mag fields also good keeping hopefully thisll work mounting shield monitor interfered well start shielding sources
