cryptanalysis statistical attack applied iterated mapping ie mapping based repeated round function method recently popularized biham shamir coppersmith remarked sboxes des optimized attack years ago method proved effective several product ciphers notably feal differential cryptanalysis based observing large number ciphertexts whose corresponding plaintexts x x satisfy known difference xx componentwise xor basic bihamshamir attack plaintext pairs required determine key des substantially fewer pairs required des truncated rounds cases actual key recovered matter minutes using thousand pairs full des attack impractical requires many known plaintexts work biham shamir des revealed several startling observations algorithm importantly key schedule removed des key used key could recovered less steps thus independent subkeys add substantial security des sboxes des extremely sensitive changing even single entries tables yields significant improvement differential attack adi
