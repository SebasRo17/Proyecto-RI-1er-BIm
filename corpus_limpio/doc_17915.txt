well lets seei took class last fall notes ill try wing heres understand remember stellar evolution black holes neutron starspulsars formed high mass stars high mass stars live fast burn hard taking appoximately years going nova supernova time dont live long enough get perturbed galactic plane assumed sources grbs plane galaxy take catalog bursts recieved various satellites around solar system pioneer venus one either pion ginga course batse distribution tests catalog tests show bursts isotropic distributionevenly spread radial direction show signs homogeneity ie clump one direction unless sampling area inside disk galaxy sampling universe cool want figure hell caused things suppose saying well stil may sampling inside disk well necessarily remember less interplanetary network burst detectors baseline goes waaaay beyond plutopioneer able detectors de tect sort difference angle satellite satellite heres analogy see plane overhead measure angle plane origin arbitrary coordinate system one friends mile away sees plane measures angle zero point arbitrary system two angles different able triangulate position burst maybe find source knowledge one able throw halo corona models dont work also said looking possible astrophysics bursts short timescales high energy black holes pulsars exhibit much type behavior case said stars seem bound disk galaxy especially energetic sources look simulated model bursts confined disk sample large distances say mpc definitely see anisotropy towards direction clumping sources direction galactic center said none characteristics
