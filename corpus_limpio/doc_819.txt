assuming refering standard pots ground start lines looking loop start lines idle conditions ring conductor one approximately vdc respect ground tip conductor near ground potential sure reference telco ground taking measurements dealing ground start lines idle conditions ring conductor one approximately vdc tip conductor would look like floating may see potential line capacitance bleed time remember use telco ground reference making measurements
