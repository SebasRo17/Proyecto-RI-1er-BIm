turn one problem sets class little problem dont calculator problem set long ago ill use hope wanted highly simplified problem simple burst bursts usually complex example use burst peak flux ergs duration seconds frst second burst last seconds flux half peak flux flux peak flux rest time assume background flux erg find integrated luminosity burst several different spheres cloud radius edge galaxy edge galactic corona lastly integrated flux time find fluence used old standby formula radius pc found l around ergsec pretty energetic close coronal model found around ergsec lastly cosmological model thats youd call moderately energetic id say suggestions could put much energy one second jeremy
