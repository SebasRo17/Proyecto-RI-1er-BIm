well bit colour could improved resolution bits per channel seems like bit excessive seen paper quoted bits per channel bits computational precision would seem wasted perhaps frame buffer uses another colourspace needs bits represent full range rgb cube compact encoding likely however two separate bit bits per component frame buffers set called double buffering allows complex picture built one buffer buffer containing previous frame displayed makes smoother animation well hey want brag numbers range take pxg turbo card bits per pixel full double buffering two bit buffers bit z buffer extra bit buffer screen image storage mind card costs workstation chris lilley technical author itti computer graphics visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road manchester uk internet cclilleymccacuk voice fax janet cclilleyukacmcc
