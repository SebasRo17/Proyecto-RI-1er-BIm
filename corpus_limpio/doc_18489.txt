pink noise constant power per geometric frequency increment octave octave etc thus octave amount noise power octave white noise constant power per arithmetic frequency increment hz khz etc thus band amount noise power band bands wide pink noise made passing white noise thru filter usually approximated network several rc pairs note cant get using half network pink noise commonly used audio power response measurements shows audio spectrum analyzers octaverelated bands flat line across bands
