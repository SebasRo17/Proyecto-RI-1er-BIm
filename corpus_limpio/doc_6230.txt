plan post summary responses soon working code also include intersection planes method looks best implementation based short article graphics gems doesnt work may misinterpreting course avoided simultaneous solution plane equations favor dot cross products former may actually better either case matrix determinant needs computed implicitly solution linear equations get planes taking midpoint line say setting normal normalized vector plugged formula graphics gems however resulting center point occasionally equidistant test points different tests matrixvector math rusty looks like need verify formula use simultaneous equation solution require bringing another routine dont easy find another method first find center circle defined sets points intersecting normals would also define circle center however small numerical imprecisions would make lines intersect supposedly planes intersect unique point parallel ed thanks answered far
