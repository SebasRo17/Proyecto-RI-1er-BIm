hope clear taken one lecture notes alternative approach cisc adopted many recent years come known risc reduced instruction set computer characterised simply simpler faster simplifying design eg reducing variety instructions addressing modes hardware designed run faster even cost needing instructions task done quickly simpler faster design typical risc processor provide large number registers eg perform data operations registers provide addressing modes eg immediate register offset allow load store operations access memory use instruction formats support data types eg integer unsigned floating
