zenos paradox resolved showing integration infinite series decreasing terms sum finite result well suppose probe emitting radiation constant frequency sent towards black hole got closer event horizon red shift would keep increasing period would get longer longer would never stop observer would observe probe actually reaching event horizon detected energy probe would keep decreasing wouldnt vanish expt never quite reaches zero guess probably doesnt make things clear hopefully get general idea maybe
