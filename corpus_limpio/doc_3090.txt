well actually quite radar radioaltimeters measure distances measuring time required transmit signal receive reflection target radar generally uses pulses radio altimeters use either pulses modulated continuouswave transmission case latter highly accurate distance measurement made example original bendix radio altimeter accurate foot feet altitude note however different method measuring poster originally asked problem gaining accurate measurements transmitter seperate receiver need highly accurate time base starts receiver exact instant transmitter triggers wire connected since radio waves actually travel faster freespace air case wire difference called velocity factor cable need resort common timebase automatically corrected distance etc something like pll connected gps receiver trick triggering transmitter receiver simultaneously sound expensive bad plan spending bucks equipment effort go different method surveyors use laserlight system reflection time measured try sounds like something pe know anyway actually highly inaccurate since power output transmitter varies unit unit variances antenna transmission line receiver may also vary unit unit unit time would need continuously calibrate entire system radio altimeter also done since everything located one place much easier note especially time base ra receiver transmitter one unit also nope fm capture effect says strongest signal wins unless two interfering signals seperated db signal strength one problem makes altimeters inaccurate low altitudes signals bouncing runways tend strong high possible eliminate outside influence also enhance attenuation multipath signals radio altimeters typically use frequencies around ghz hope helps
