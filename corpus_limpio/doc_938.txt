ok one last attempt ill take different tack seem agreement two explanations one use handlebars lean moving motorcycle question one effect dominant one idea would design experiment would seaprate two characteristics see effect produces similar result one us bikes familiar lets look one far sparked controversy gyroscopic precession examine alone would get rid contact patch effect allowing contact patches transmit force wheels steering mechanism would remain attached vehicle weight bike suspension wheels transmit forces bike way similar bikes experiment would ride bike along dry road get moving get wheels spinning change surfaces something wont transmit forces contact patches try steering manoeuvre see bike leans probably would since us know easy fall ice wouldnt get good idea well feels like without contact patches cant turn maybe theres better way besides even ice doesnt get rid contact patch forces altogether wed find really frictionless surface youd try wheels locked really know rotation looking contactpatch effect however fairly simple find vehicle gets magnitude direction cantact patch forces motorcycle transmits way vehicle without rotating wheels gets contact patch forces irrelevant looking something contact patches go straight sideways skis skates would fine dont know snowski skate bikes suzuki wetbike arranged like motorcycle fat water skis wheels think propellor front rear ski something like could try coast get rid effect admit second hand info although id love try one review local cycle rag guy bike shop sells say machine handles much like motorcycle countersteer turn contact patches transmit similar forces bikes similar suspension arrangement gyroscopes countersteering conclusion dont need gyroscopes countersteer vehicles motorcyclelike contact patch arrangements still dont know real effect gyroscopes theyre observations handlebar angle force etc relate steering general im willing bet theyre dominant factor countersteering dont like conclusion dont accept motorcycles behaviour consistent someone prove otherwise go ahead
