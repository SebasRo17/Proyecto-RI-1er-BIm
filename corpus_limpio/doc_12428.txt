since mosfet vintage probably good one todays standards idea voltage current ratings eg probably get away replacing anything better specs early mosfets gatesource voltage rating approximately vdcmax would usually turn completely otherwise mosfets really mysterious theyre less voltage controlled current sources mosfet circuit used openloop voltage controlled current source may experiment various gainaltering techniques
