basically two algorithms determining whether point inside outside polygon first one ray half line method method draw ray number intersection point ray polygon even outside number odd inside cause deal special cases may make headache second method pi algorithm draw lines point vertices polygon calculate sum angles successive lines result inside pi polygon otherwise outside experience tells second method relible hope helps
