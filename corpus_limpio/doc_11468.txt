im looking algorithms articles virtual sound want following fast source eg cdrom several sound sources read defined position attributes eg direction etc given listeners position direction sum sound played back listeners earphones function position direction means simulation ears coloring sound relative incoming direction done sound source think possible lookup table impulse responses several angles relative ear interpolate impulse function given angle impulse function could convoluted sound source impulse function must changed every time sound source changes position listener changes orientation additionally reflection diffusion absorbtion due environment wich defined could simulated requires sort sound propagandation simulation kinda like radiosity algorithm someone done andor written articles implementing system please post mail answers comments torgeir veimo studying university bergen im gona wave freak flag high jimi hendrix
