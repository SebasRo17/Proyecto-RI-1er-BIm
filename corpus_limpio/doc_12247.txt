ive used onchip capacitors reduce groundbounce noise small systolic array chip loads clock lines design nwell cmos using mosis scalable design rules thoughts bypass capacitors dont help much simultaneous output switchingthere still large inductance bypass capacitor load capacitor signal line ground return still get ground power line bounce help lot onchip loads high load clock lines transients trying suppress really high frequency forget large areas polythinoxidediff capacitors since rc time constant large make metal poly diff sandwich put lot holes poly layer allowing frequent contacts forget exactly wide poly lines design id probably omit diff altogether use solid poly sheet instead using poly substrate high resistance ignored speeds probably better trying tune circuit run slightly slower edges lower voltage swings especially output signalling spending chip area capacitors spare space die since circuit big mosis tiny chip next size twice big needed kevin karplus kevin karplus karplusceucscedu
