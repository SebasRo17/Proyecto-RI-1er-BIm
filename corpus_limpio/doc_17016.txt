note tried figure stuff month ago various people net could wrong data ever read barring mistracks course eventually gets turned khz bit two channel data oversampling takes two discrete data points interpolates points n times oversampling asked people said interpolation simply linear interpolation significantly complicated anyway purpose oversampling move effective sampling rate n times khz order use higher frequency antialiasing filters quality filter higher oversampling lets build cheaper filters whereas price filter higher oversamplings lets build better filters assuming quality components cd player remained oversampling allow manufacturer produce slightly better sound due antialias filtering
