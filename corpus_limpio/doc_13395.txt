stuff deleted actually make reasonable amount sense fixed disk sectors buffered controller transferring memory rep insw whatever instruction called quite efficient single instruction goes fast controllercpu know use bus since wasnt cached bus likely critical resource relative cpu performance possible dma bus interference would cause much loss cpu cycles computing rep insw sequence floppy hand buffered using cpu floppy data transfer done pc jr way really stink
