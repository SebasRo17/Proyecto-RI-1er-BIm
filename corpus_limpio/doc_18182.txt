year ago started work problem appeared simple turned quite difficult wondering anyone net seen problem hopefully published solutions problem draw outline surface defined two roughly parallel cubic splines inputs problem essentially starts two sets points set points edge object treat two dimensional ie extant edges exists three dimensional space draw object fit cubic spline points spline effectively computed sequence line segments approximating curve spline equal number segments assume nth segment along spline roughly exactly distance along spline reasonable measure take segment n along spline match nth segment opposing spline use pair segments form two triangles filled color surface depth sort triangles take triangle sorted order project onto pixmap draw color triangle take edge triangle along edge surface draw line along edge colored special edge color edge coloring step heart problem idea effectively outline edge surface net result however generally lots breaks gaps edge surface reasons fairly complicated involve rasterization problems problems resulting projecting splines anything problem sounds familiar would appreciate knowing work area
