want achieve overall throughput rate around megabytes sec large data transfers around mb quadra nubus network card pump data mac memory mbs using blockmode transfers highspeed disk array asynchronous pb calls achieve mbs lets say transfers go disk buffer network card enough first transfer data disk buffer transfer data buffer card mbs mbs result overall mbs slow tried following scheme nmegabyte transfer step load mb disk buffer step asynch send mb card load mb disk buffer step asynch send mb card load mb disk buffer step n asynch send mb card load nth mb disk buffer step send nth mb card even though code apparently execute card transfer asynchronously card use mac cpu using buffer tho steps n take long two transfers executed one another improvement rate mac ram dualport nubus card disk driver access data time problem two devices card disk driver use bus mac ram anything
