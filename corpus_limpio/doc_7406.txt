hi ive built valve preamp use diodecapacitor voltage multiplier step supply voltage approx load resistance increases rc constant decreases hence output voltage drops need high output voltage possible circuit consists seven voltage multiplier stages ie diodes capacitors capacitor develops across take output across seven capacitor increase capacitors rating increase rc constant hence alleviate problem capacitors going little expensive need would happen connected capacitor parallel output hence parallel seven capacitors assume increase c circuit hence increase rc time constant output voltage becomes stable killed two birds one stone experiencing ripple hence amp hum new capacitor smooth anyone recomend suitable value inductor choke placed output line power supply filter mains hum lowest resistance possible ive got preamp moment much distraction im university ive got get dissertation finished two weeks hence im mailing playing solderoing iron itll cheaper long run especially new large capacitors dont work planned email please cant always read net thanks advance chris name mr chris smith twang ole guitar addrs uni liverpool university quest build hardware dgree computer science ever sun may certainly ball flaming gas dh lawrence
