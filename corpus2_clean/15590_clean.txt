trying figure would best running simulation using multiple computer mma licence main part computation involves parallelized table run algorithm different value computer intel quad core pc intel core duo laptop controlling pc looking around found two basic option using ssh mathematica run parallel computation using remote desktop control pc leaning towards second two main reason first assume use total core whole grid given home licensing wrong apply single license whole grid given limitation use remote desktop run two simulation would allow fully benefit quad core pc still running stuff laptop even work code thinking flawed miss something ssh option licencing limitation would make lean towards option edit turn multiple licence kernel running quoting jagra license typically grant access minimum parallel kernel control kernel case would kernel quad core core duo plus one control kernel could really see benefit running grid parallel kernel even though would able use one instance mathematica work code algorithm running positive side lw grid jagra pointed need sending input output file remote pc control pc time resource consuming large edit contacting wolfram support informed trial licence also provide kernel grid thinking adding pc trial licence mma
