current implementation interpolation allow arbitrary precision spline interpolation yu sung chang say hard implement manually arbitrary precision using bsplinebasis new spline familiar bsplinebasis best way implement arbitrary precision spline interpolation mathematica interested primarily analog method spline interpolation investigated answer btw name spline kind parametrization also give answer interesting implementation spline centripetal parametrization clear use interpolation p need implementation degree spline arbitrary moment interested even degree spline
