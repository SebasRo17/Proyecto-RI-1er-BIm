read following algorithm 4th edition robert sedgewick kevin wayne first qualitative observation program problem size characterizes difficulty computational task normaly problem size either size command argument intuitively running time increase problem size question much increase another qualitative observation many program running time relatively insensitive depends primarily problem size relationship hold need take step better understand perhaps better control time sensitivity hold focus goal better quantifying relationship problem size running time question size problem size program increase thus running time also increase would running time program relatively insensitive confused
