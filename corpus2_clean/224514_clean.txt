far recall ongoing trend past student might wrong long ago integer number calculation precise however cannot present big range later point added single precision floating point number float also added fpu incredibly fast calculating quite recently double precision floating point number double starting become common example opengl shader language steadily introducing method work double natively think also working fpu double also change num bit processing year ago got question option calculate fixed point number maybe two int64 register far know specific unit fast integer calculation respect fixed point number maybe saying make much sense think question remains valid switch switch fixed point arithmetic near future
