following parametric plot enter image description generated following manipulate parametricplot co b co sin c co sin pi plotrange b c would like find exact value c inner circle one point fixed origin tangent outer curve would mean mistaken left pi right solving following system equation c x co b co co b sin x c co c sin x x e find intersection curve also tangent x x reason find solution wrong
