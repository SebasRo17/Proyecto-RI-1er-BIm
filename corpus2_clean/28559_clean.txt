trying solve system several simultaneous equation generated series module function using module solvephieqs number module eq simeqs diffsimeqs xvalues eq generatephieqs number xvalues xvalues range number k r simeqs table eq j phi j phi j eq x x j xvalues j number diffsimeqs table eq j number xdiffphi j xdiffphi j eq x x j xvalues j number equatedeqs flatten simeqs diffsimeqs coefficient flatten table r j j number table j j number table j j number table b j j number finalcoefficient solve simplify reduce array eq number equatedeqs coefficient however solve simultaneous equation generated using number argument computer start churning away come back answer least min longest tried far supposed general solution problem looking generating solution least number particularly encouraging however fairly sure code functional particularly efficient whilst appreciate easy make specific comment based incomplete code anyone general suggestion make simultaneous equation solving efficient would much appreciated
