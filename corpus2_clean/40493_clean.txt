trying use mathematica solve relatively simple ode involving parameter would like use set condition solve particular solution ode understand make mathematica find value constant arise process solving ode solving constant coefficient already present original ode simple example involving newton law cooling enter image description code tried dsolve k ta k feel like need two step process first solve ode parameter solve parameter afterwards sure start thank advance
