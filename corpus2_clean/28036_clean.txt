novice mathematica guy helpful past binary array j repetition consisting zero one like extract histogram number contiguous one individual column assuming variable f j containing data bhist sparsearray index f j index bhist index index bhista j bhist j rep bhist record number contiguous many time ensemble occurs loop j repetition monte carlo problem seem generating zero despite fact simulation generate contiguous expression setting index record value bhist variable something else going furthermore wanted extract histogram bhista efficient way flattening bin counting
