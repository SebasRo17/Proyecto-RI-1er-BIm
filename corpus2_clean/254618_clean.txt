rather inexperience problem forming subclass created made called vector2d contains method add vector2d addend take vector2d argument return vector2d particular designed add two vector sum started coding subclass called intend functionality vector2d except additional function usage vector2d inside preexisting class argument etc replaced add addend add two vector together return sum issue arises inherits vector2d function continue work term vector2d object spitting soon passed relevant vector2d follows public vector2d field variable private double x vector x coordinate private double vector coordinate constructor public vector2d construct empty vector setx num sety num method public setx double newx problematic inherited subclass x newx public sety double newy problematic newy public vector2d add vector2d addend add two vector return sum however pose problem vector2d sum new vector2d sum x x addend x sum addend sum work around currently think add addend could public add addend add two position vector return sum sum new sum x x addend x sum addend sum e repeat vector2d manually modify course efficient waste time especially whenever done similar method whenever intend make subclass e g therefore looking much cleaner efficient mean
