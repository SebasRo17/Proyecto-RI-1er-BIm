currently large system autonomous differential equation indexed managable dummy system identical form using part reference individual equation eqns c kf c kr c c kf z kr z kf c c kp c lh denoted cn n range equation inputting eqns yield c kf b kr whereas inputting fullsimplify eqns yield kf c c kr c anyone know way specify format ought maintained ie input would isolate c fullsimplify term yield c kr c kf c sound petty dummy example larger system thank advance edit spent awhile digging around online help avail possibly changing notation format would render future use ndsolve hope use shorthand eqns problematic given mathematica understanding prime notation derivative also another complication changing lh notation c cn implicit rather explicit function see attached link line ndsolve cn cn must appended end point ndsolve function
