trying create transformation rule take list non negative integer value length find non zero entry list add preceding number subtracts chosen non zero entry keep subsequent value untouched example could transformed looking transformation rule let call say desiredrule replacelist desiredrule yield three list failed attempt along line replacelist x z x z result key issue obviously x sure correct know way achieve result without using replacelist know could example following transform list module nonzeropositions numberoftransformations nonzeropositions flatten position list x x numberoftransformations length nonzeropositions table list nonzeropositions j nonzeropositions j j numberoftransformations length list specifically interested learn could achieve result via transformation rule approach outlined initially
