function f mathbb c rightarrow mathbb c would like visualize plotting f plot using operatorname arg f colorfunction use densityplot arg f b b plotpoints workingprecision colorfunction darkrainbow get following nice look pretty nice however use plot ab f b b plotpoints workingprecision colorfunction colordata darkrainbow pi pi arg f colorfunctionscaling false performancegoal quality mesh none get awful quality operatorname arg f fine densityplot using quality parameter awful make colorfunction suppose surface mesh made f plot operatorname arg f densityplot f changing much around important part operatorname arg f look choppy noticable fix way give colorfunction plotpoints actual surface perhaps different mesh possible want avoid increasing plotpoints overall plot happy quality f slow render
