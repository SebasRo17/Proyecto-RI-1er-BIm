set data point energy eigenvalue corresponding parameter h represents magnetic field h value equispaced going step please note energy eigenvalue exact experimental error trying first plot data point mathematica found command listlineplot x x however feeding huge set data point consumes lot time way example importing data file fortran used command import file table file fortran data file giving error message file found import would like find second derivative plot accurate evaluation second derivative crucial purpose done plot using gnuplot found first derivative plot using central difference formula frac f x h f x h h h evaluated first derivative latter plot using formula get second derivative plot getting plot desired result peak obtained near value h pre calculated word getting disagreement theoretical numerical value h eigenvalue evaluation ok think checked mathematica fortran maybe something going wrong second derivative evaluation kindly advise carry numerical differentiation set data point mathematica
