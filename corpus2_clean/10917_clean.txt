assume following element begin equation f j ij k end equation represent component tensorial object rank respectively complex coefficient let component f given f j begin matrix x iy x ixy z z x ixy z z end matrix f j begin matrix x iy x ixy z z x ixy z z end matrix f j begin matrix x ixy z z x ixy z z x iy end matrix f j begin matrix x ixy z z x ixy z z x iy end matrix j would like solve component satisfy following equation begin equation li jf k l lk jf l end equation l summed index run symmetric lower index would possible write code find component code provided previous question solving antisymmetric tensorial equation would work well simple example f example
