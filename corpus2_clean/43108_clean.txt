updated today mathematica version found something absolutely confuses let u define piecewise function gr x v v v v v piecewise g v x v v g v v x v v v g v v v v x v v v v v try integrating obvious assumption integrate gr x b c e x end assumption b c b c b c b c e end take around second obviously result b g e g although seems lot faster mathematica though point integration different symbol integrate gr x x tr assumption tr sudden evaluate second running till page memory available crashing afterwads anyone explain
