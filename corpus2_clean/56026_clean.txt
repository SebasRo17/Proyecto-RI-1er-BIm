think interesting issue adjust one prediction function also obtain prediction band ass graphical tabular error trying apply step step delta method data however would like share advance get final summarizing reviewing standard method using commercial software find delta method confidence prediction interval right square root involves inverse hessian matrix think although call design matrix well gradient matrix function share code try fit custom non linear function assessing prediction interval confidence prediction int mathematica language mean simple prediction interval code example data example data data dist probabilitydistribution cdf exp exp x b c exp x x infinity assumption b c re finddistributionparameters data dist b c acov acov data dist paramlist mlerule block len infmat cov len length data infmat loglikelihood dist data paramlist len mlerule cov inverse infmat acov data dist b c re gradient matrix g case one variable x obtain vector one element exp exp x b c exp x x re multiply transpose gradient acov gradient necesary transpose first matrix mathematica detect matrix u student critical value alpha data quantile studenttdistribution question snip line code must add complete apply code numerical example find getting predicted confidence prediction interval try code give table confidence interval exp meanpredictionconfidenceintervaltable case non linear fiiting different fitting distribution mle method doubt old user mathematica little doubt finally acov matrix well assessed code understand post got first information hessian information matrix divide matrix partial derivates n length data please check following delta method execute dot product transpose gradient acov gradient obtain simple number correct found number column vector number row matrix obtain matrix number fill column obtain number maybe correct way please comment post clear edit code know appropiate code line reference post numerical example similar way get confidence interval using also delta mathod calcultes variance standard error maximum likelihood estimate finddistributionparameters compute prediction band non linear regression stats se basic question fisher information matrix relationship hessian standard error stats se look forward help thank
