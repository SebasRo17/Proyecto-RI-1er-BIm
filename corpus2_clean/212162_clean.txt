asked question someone pointed would better likely right go wanted opinion num different way approach problem okay system wanna design toward future type object wich take parameter implementing interface wich contain another implementing another interface way interfaceb b b c c interfaced get point contain another one every interface implement common interface parent interfaceb parent parent interfaced interfaced necessarily implement interfaceb interface one implemention multiple possible tree interfaceb b b c c interfaced interfaceb b b z question want manage possible tree better using reflection generate possible tree startup would better hold different tree xml file would parse startup keep mind interface type implementation keep coming every time add new managed know solution work question like would best approach orient system toward future add context situation example case interface expose adaptor adaptor may need another one task instance adaptor wich parse communicated remote target use ethernet serial port etc could generic parser wich take generic communicator one different possibility need clarification dont hesitate
