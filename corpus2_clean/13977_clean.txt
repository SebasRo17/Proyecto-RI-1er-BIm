say matrix x want compare first element uppermost top left element first column matrix b size x whenever first time equality flagged say element less equal element b corresponding row position b printed procedure repeated next element compared column b similarly element second column compare second column b third column compared third column b repeated whole matrix element essentially output matrix c size x value ranging easier vba matlab
