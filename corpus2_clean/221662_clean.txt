interested build prototype need sort thing point xa ya radius num meter point b radius num meter point c radius num meter point radius num meter person num certain point question point num example person inside b area c point geographic coordinate e lat long want understand best algorithm strategy implement good index current idea implemented yet hole map divided quadrant small example num num meter point marked quadrant inside area marked well search using person num find quadrant retrieve point marked basically build huge prefix tree based point 10k point problem single point numerous entry inside tree though would better searching think note lack formal understanding spatial index
