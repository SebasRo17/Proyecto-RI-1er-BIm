assume complicated integral feature kind difficulty like infinite interval rapidly oscillatory integrand integrable singularity numerically almost singular point integrand assume need compute many time need optimize speed figured need help mathematica bit avoid problem nintegrate slwcon want increase maxiterations miniterations workingprecision lot would decrease speed decompose domain integration several ldots n n finite nintegrate behaves better manually perform integral transformation choose well suited method different domain however fixed accuracygoal pressiciongoal nintegrate choose sufficiently many sampling point iteration achieve error level even total contribution negligibly small would proceed would choose accuracygoal pressiciongoal individual integrands reduce total number integrand evalutations minimum required achieve given global value accuracygoal pressiciongoal since integrand fixed reorder difficult possibly small one appear late use previous result estimate total value however assume analytic estimate
