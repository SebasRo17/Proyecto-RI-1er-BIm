currently studying engineering telecommunication electronics migrated assembler c microprocessor programming doubt good idea advantage disadvantage c compared assembly advantage disadvantage see advantage tell c syntax lot easier learn assembler syntax c easier use making complex program learning c somehow productive learning assembler cause developing stuff around c assembler disadvantage assembler lower level programming language c make good programming directly hardware lot flexible alluding work memory interrupt micro register etc
