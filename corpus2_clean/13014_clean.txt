best way find shortest path using custom distance function trying play little bit concept using distribution instead deterministic weight value given edge result different want example check shortest path confidence flaw average knowledge distance might certainty may want work interval confidence range weight loc flatten solve mean weibulldistribution x x n n n weibulldistribution loc network undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge networkweight n n n n n n n n n n n edgeweights map mean networkweight n edgelabels thread rule network edgeweights g graph network edgeweight edgeweights edgelabels edgelabels vertexlabels name vertexlabelstyle directive red italic imagepadding graphlayout springembedding findshortestpath g tell shortest path calculate shortest path hand using monte carlo path randomvariate n randomvariate n path randomvariate n randomvariate n randomvariate n dist estimateddistribution path weibulldistribution dist estimateddistribution path weibulldistribution nsolve cdf dist x x x real quiet nsolve cdf dist x x x real quiet see path would choice case way assigning distribution edgeweight define function calculate total weight using concept shown many thanks
