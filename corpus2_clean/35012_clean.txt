would like carry following iteration process apply function f b c starting list l b c result l b c apply function f b c list l get l b c finally apply function f b c list l get l b c soon would like b c starting value process word start procedure value l obtained previous step repeat l l step identical would also good could get list l l last step returned end process idea mathematica find similar problem solved net read fixedpoint nestwhile fold documentation still know apply problem grateful tip advice function f f bit complicated involve reading value dll library let say look like one f b c afrombc b c b c dfromab afrombc b c b afrombc dfromab predefined function connected dll library
