far understand scala clojure designed new language num depend jvm num easily integrate sense allow use class inside scala clojure starting num maybe even strongly subsequent version change semantics language wanted ask change impact interoperability scala clojure consequence example since lambda num object see e g scala clojure might deal value object would problem think following scenario num scala clojure language extended adapt new semantics handle new non value support interoperability num scala clojure language extended would possible new feature like value mapped existing concept e g scala even guess function would wrapped kind object become visible scala num scala clojure language continue support interoperability num num without following latest development would require older version still supported least openjdk another project language based conservative stable branch summarizing expect future development impact language like scala clojure maintain interoperability link ongoing discussion topic already note imagine scala clojure jvm based language major problem updating implementation newer version jvm new jvm feature make implementation even easier question focus feature language whether jvm language able see use new feature whether jvm based language latest jvm
