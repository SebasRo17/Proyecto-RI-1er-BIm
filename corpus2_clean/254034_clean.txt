suppose hierarchy whose base b requires clone defined derivation whilst work perfectly one derivation x hold optional reference resource referenced one instance x whilst rest x cloned without problem reference would set nil nullptr correct way handle situation x clone could throw though would correct satisfying set reference nil nullptr leave notice user x know x require derivation b define b user b aware might num num clone something else
