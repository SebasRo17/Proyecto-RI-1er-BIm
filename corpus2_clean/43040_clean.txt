want get continuous point two equation equation x c cosh x sqrt f b g q g f b g tu x exp x try find c constant term g boundary condition tu x l k x du ku tu x x l two uknown c two boundary condition single point continuous l actually boundary condition l cosh symmetric assume positive positive part boundary like plot example found tu e x continuous mm cosh function enter image description manner obtained thanks boundary condition applied boundary condition order find c continuous l solve g f b g c cosh l sqrt f b g q e l c c e l f b g e l g sech l sqrt f b g q f b g c okay finding applied derivative boundary condition solve c sqrt f b g q sinh l sqrt f b g q dia k e l du ku program gave error olve nsmet system cannot solved method available solve get c term g obtain c term g constant temperature condition used g int integrate x x l l nsolve int g
