trying generate mesh later use finite element method dsolve command basically parallelepiped spherical indentation trying generate mesh follows need ndsolve fem region implicitregion norm x z x z mesh toelementmesh region show mesh wireframe plotrange however see picture produce really irregular inaccurate think mesh spherical part way improve generate homogeneously distributed element spherical part enter image description
