got interesting tiling problem large square image size num square want fill image certain grain type tile 1x2 strip 2x1 strip 2x2 square overlap hole extension past image boundary given probability grain type list number required placed generated obviously iterative brute force work well randomly place piece instead certain algorithm required num 2x2 square grain randomly placed exhaustion num 1x2 2x1 grain randomly placed alternatively exhaustion num remaining tile placed fill hole turn algorithm work pretty well case problem filling entire image however might guess increasing probability thus number 1x2 2x1 grain eventually cause placement stall since many hole created strip placed approach solution follows num create mini image size 8x8 16x16 num fill image randomly following algorithm specified desired probability entire image realized mini image num create n mini image randomly successively place large image unfortunately downfall simplification num given small size mini image nailing exact probability entire image possible example want p 2x1 p 1x2 num mini image may give num close probability num mini image create pseudo boundary overlap occur really descriptive model used num fixed number mini image sure random really really looking brainstorm possible solution concern really nail closer probability one might suggest increase mini image size well turn certain case p 1x2 p 2x1 num mini image 16x16 even iteratively solvable pretty obvious difficult randomly solve anything greater 8x8 size love hear idea thanks
