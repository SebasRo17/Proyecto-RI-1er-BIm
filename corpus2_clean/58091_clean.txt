start saying total beginner mathematica answer need code need spelled quite clearly learning curve proving steep basically trying manipulate power series expression involving function alpha r inside indefinite sum pick coefficient series solving ode context following code used produce alpha sum square first derivative r sum subscript j r r sum r r j n sum x sum expand x without sum x sum expand x output stay collected one sum j even expand applied shown fig code sum split series sum one term long fig however variable r still inside sum case meaning apply coefficient r etc output spit output e anything rather identifying term correct power r really need code pull r factor summation term coefficient pick required term
