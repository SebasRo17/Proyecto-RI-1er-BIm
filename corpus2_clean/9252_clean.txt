first quite new mathematica hint better code would greatly appreciated histogram frequency data unknown distribution trying fit histogram draw need histogram data form rank count raw readlist desktop data txt number number missing rank want set count fd table max raw fd raw raw length raw histogram log fd frequencydata true enter image description need histogram seems deprecated find nice way plotting frequency data without rank actually count histogram frequency observed x number thing make sense slightly concerned confusing data log plot seems show nice continuous curve thought could find line fit followed instruction findfit bincounts using findfit frequency data far good let try power law distribution center movingaverage raw count raw centered table center count length center xmin model xmin x xmin par findfit centered model x nlm nonlinearmodelfit centered model x nlm bestfit parametertable particularly expecting power law distribution work demonstrates method get x estimate standard error statistic p value question correct managed find model describes data findfit estimate parameter anyone help distribution might tried grasping straw zipf law power law gumbel laplace frechet reported good fit p value ridiculously low line really match plug number get really bad result feel like hopelessly naive trying head stuck number long really know going
