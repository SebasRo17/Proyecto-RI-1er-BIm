need expert answer help determine efficient algorithm scenario consider following structure b parent set b child integer integer situation need fetch orphan child could hundred thousand assign randomly parent based following rule num end job orphan left num end job less child minimum num end job child maximum num object create new default value minimum maximum assign remaining orphan object num distribution child evenly distributed possible num may already child assigned job start toying afraid would end looping across parent sorted smallest largest grab orphan parent wondering efficient way handle edit expanding upon criterion even distribution child attempt avoid situation one num child unless started way example a1 num child a2 a3 num child num orphan a2 a3 assigned orphan making even distribution num num num child yes understand could end one orphan left met minimum exception case handled separate algorithm try evenly split two object assign remaining orphan amongst edit num ok misunderstood requirement situation model show minimum maximum property fact global setting every essence missed requirement requires model refactored later minimum maximum actually change thing significantly sorry confusion
