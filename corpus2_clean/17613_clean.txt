problem slow mathematica code basically computation expected take hour core processor basically computing index stock market option implied volatility data coming x matrix call completematrix however know code basic trying find way improve parallelmap paralleltable even compile know though interesting calculation map faster parallelmap table faster paralleltable sample code long take calculate pregaomc v completematrix v n way improve function compile deleteduplicates table pregaomc x x n absolutetiming null deleteduplicates paralleltable pregaomc x x n absolutetiming null deleteduplicates map pregaomc range n absolutetiming null deleteduplicates parallelmap pregaomc range n absolutetiming null another calculation taking lot time ativomc v completematrix v select flatten position table ativomc x x n stockname absolutetiming null select flatten position map ativomc range n stockname absolutetiming null select flatten position paralleltable ativomc x x n stockname absolutetiming null select flatten position parallelmap ativomc range n stockname absolutetiming null apparently calculation take long however several time several different stock several different day way improve whis code compile thank rodrigo
