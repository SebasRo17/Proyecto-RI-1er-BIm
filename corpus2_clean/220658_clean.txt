started learning functional programming trying compare different algorithm written imperative functional parallel programming using collection lambda expression order make question clear avoid sharing long algorithm working take example well known modified fibonacci algorithm euler problem num problem num iterative way result num first num second num num num first second num num result first second second writeline result recursive functional way num num takewhile x x num private static num num takewhile x x num x x num num sum way let rec fib x x num num else fib x num fib x num let fib async parallel num num async fib async calculate big algorithm written using lamda expression complexity function like filter functional algo written way consider complexity knowing difference time execution
