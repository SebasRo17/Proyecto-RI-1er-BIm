possible take time derivative vector given curvelinear coordinate system e spherical mathematica would need take account time dependence basis vector frac dt vec r dot r hat r r dot theta hat theta r sin theta dot phi hat phi bet something built mathematica already get result figure edit thanks answer already helped lot end hoping quick way get frac dt left begin array c f r theta phi end array right left frac dt f r theta phi right left begin array c dot r r dot theta r sin theta dot phi end array right typing dt f r theta phi mathematica could get behavior multiplying time derivative f result transformedfield could quickly become tedious higher time derivative vector component direct way thanks lot
