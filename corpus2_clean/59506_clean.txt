number function depend variable x using second integer variable index function e something like f x f x b x c taking derivative function work way intend e f x x f x x return respectively b however set differential equation involving derivative function expressed mathematica derivative f x derivative f x remains unevaluated way derivative ignore second variable specifically would like way something along line derivative g x replacing g f x guess could assign specific name function f x k end want sum sum f x k k n would convienient index variable rather writing sum different function maybe approaching whole idea indexing function wrong way
