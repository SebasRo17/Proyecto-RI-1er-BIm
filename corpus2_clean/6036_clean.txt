writing numerical optimization problem expression form e mathrm erf overall shape function look correct small e huge mathrm erf small product also small lead horrible floating point inaccuracy know course multiple thing remedy including scaling problem value reasonably sized another reformulate expression avoid ever computing huge intermediate value particular example given simple e mathrm erf exp left log e log mathrm erf right exp left log mathrm erf right well behaved reasonable value however actual expression various parameter respect take derivative resulting expression hideous reformulating hand daunting although tractable way make mathematica reformulate expression attempting avoid expression numerically unstable expect mathematica automatically aware expression problematic could example simply instruct avoid using exp unless absolutely must would useful tool suspect people working numerical optimization note optimization work mathematica using mathematica help derive analytical gradient merit function therefore feature mathematica would eliminate numerical inaccuracy mathematica really help
