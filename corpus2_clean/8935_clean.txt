trying convert image graph image already skeletonized look pretty much like enter image description need identify vertex edge particular get list pixel position edge seen using morphologicalgraph would get vertex way also extract information position edge edit first thanks lot comment let clarify acl would like list pixel coordinate edge grouped together yves klett think solution would work give morphological graph need pixel coordinate original image silvia daniel lichtblau could extract pixel position way need know pixel belongs branch vitaliy kaurov need know vertex connected done using morphologicalgraph also need know exact path vertex branch image need list pixel coordinate show answer edge found using morphologicalgraph match single pixel image branch need latter guess silvia answer would solution interesting though get morphological graph mathematica process information pixel coordinate branch probably store anywhere
