investigating fold could improve performance v tested code absolutetiming sum inc inc inc sin sum sum tan inc sum output hoped using fold could improve performance absolutetiming fold sin tan sin n range however code faster question concerning example partially solved see edit fold faster thought auto compiled thus faster solved see edit mathematica using precision much higher double precision number small would possible set precision boost performance tried setpricision setaccuracy precision change improve performance solved see mr wizard example answer another problem fold one first generate long list length example much larger list fold method may use much memory possible use functional way necessarily fold memory efficient way thank much p met question trying reproduce mr wizard answer thread modification reproduce wizard result fold boot performance greatly compared understand example good alternative procedural loop iterating list mathematica edit rojo comment answer setsystemoptions catchmachineunderflow false b performance fold mathematica v disabling catchmachineunderflow fold code x faster code however mathematica v fold code bit slower seems like regression mathematica comparison code x improvement version fold sin range v v
