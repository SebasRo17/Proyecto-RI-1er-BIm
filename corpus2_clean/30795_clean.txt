trying solve problem form left x x right left x x right min j real valued coefficient x integer fact real problem variable problem look like sum n left sum j j x j right min easy way transform linear integer programming probably suitable mathematica sure deal absolute value objective function convert problem matrix form thanks edit concrete example consider function f x x x x x x x sin x sin x known grid ldots defining data table x f x problem recover coefficient f data knowing f perturbed rational function integer coefficient bounded magnitude f perturbed functionapproximations rationalinterpolation f x x could used recover coefficient variant specifies x priori information coefficient integer allow exact reconstruction f despite perturbation
