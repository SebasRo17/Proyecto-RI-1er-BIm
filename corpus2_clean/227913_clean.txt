working pricing algorithm want generalize calculation certain component charge num component charge num basic core charge num handling charge may many number num tax component may many variety well wondering store algorithm like database use calculating charge every time better way handling pricing flexible way step num sum component1 component2 let u say freight charge sum core charge step num num let u say handling charge num percent step num result step num num let u say tax step num result num percent step num num let u say special tax num percent total edit adding sample logistics freight service working parcel booked may get transported location location e via c e base freight charge calculated cost transportation b b c c e parcel may unloaded one vehicle location loaded another vehicle loading unloading charge may added may percentage transportation charge absolute may additional charge may added future well may premium facility charge tax computed entire cost one tax may go basic freight charge may go charge another set total cost need flexible logic calculation configurable pricing logic user someone worked generic algorithm pls give idea please note searched stuff well google unable come concrete one yet missed something please feel free point basically would like store formula workout price logic going implemented c sql server
