economic research student previous experience mathematica please pardon question sound really stupid hoping solve system nonlinear ode symbolically heard dsolve utility handy sort problem invest time hope make sure mathematica answer want specifically system contains function coefficient know explicit expression expressed phi psi etc also contains unspecified constant coefficient well dsolve handle situation much appreciate someone could suggest alternative method thank edit system look something like beta phi lambda x alpha beta psi frac dx dt phi x alpha beta gamma x frac lambda dt k psi lambda alpha phi x alpha beta gamma lambda text x text function want solve phi psi function coefficient without explicit expression alpha beta gamma k unspecified coefficient hope solution expressed term integral phi psi possible
