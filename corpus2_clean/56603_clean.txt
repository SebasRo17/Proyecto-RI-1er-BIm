eigensystem version seems give slightly different result version hmtx vals vecs eigensystem hmtx vals vecs version get eigenvalue first eigenvector version get eigenvalue first eigenvector make version produce result version know method used version tried set method option version still unable get agreement edit agree comment right correct result curious change internal mechanism method etc produce different correct result use eigensystem calculating quantum mechanic problem called high harmonic generation sensitive small error result theory overall phase change effect result upgrading version noise floor result increase one order magnitude trying see happens first stop mathematica language guess would expect exactly result update compiler least know result different
