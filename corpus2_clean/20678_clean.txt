function available statistic library context called nconditionalentropy appears compute conditionalentropy thus statistic library nconditionalentropy output look definition conditional entropy wikipedia suggests expectation base log pdf marginal distribution p x call p x divided pdf distribution p x result weighted according distribution p x gave hope could recreate conditionalentropy expectation see really understood going thus write following code xv test data yv test data ed empiricaldistribution flatten outer list xv yv expectation log pdf marginaldistribution ed x pdf ed x x distributed ed n get write statistic library nconditionalentropy xv yv get case got order argument wrong also tried statistic library nconditionalentropy yv xv yield still match several theory discrepancy understand concept conditional entropy well enough code implementing conditional entropy missing something help appreciated
