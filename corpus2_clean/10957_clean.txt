many people noted graphic primitive circle work graphic environment several solution problem proposed site stackoverflow disadvantage result either rather ugly circle highly inefficient one circle generated polygon several hundred facet making interactive graphic incredibly slow alternative involve use parametricplot generate efficient graphic either yield primitive used geometrictransformation would like elegant solution creates smooth circular arc without requiring zillion coordinate resulting arc usable combination tube used geometrictransformation
