let take simple c program example include vector fun num std vector vec vec resize num forgetting moment pointer instantiation question content memory address stored literal know location content must allocated somewhere stack heap case instance allocated heap mean pointer also heap looking resize call vec might something like hood std vector resize num pointer vec question pointer come ie content num num bit memory address stored memory passed would presume normal member first thought mangled global sort storing unknown number vector see could achieve either stored relation content member refers standard something say would prefer answer reference standard note reason want know concerned sharing memory allocated modify member variable knowledge stored might affect padding decision
