tried expand besselj k x function taylor series series command k x function expansion variable lambda expansion derivative respect k x occur problem whenever term derivative variable mathematica leaf e g derivative besselj give numerical value end first thought assigned value exact since value besseljzero however also give numerical analytical result following easier calculation besselj k x k x k x n derivative besselj order differentiation change give numerical result besselj k x x k k x n work x besseljzero well first question case second possible handle series command
