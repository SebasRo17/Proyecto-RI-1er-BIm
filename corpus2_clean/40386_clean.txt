think problem hardest one hit want nsolve equation equation use transformation rule amptimes first used like amptimes tf th nsolve e th e tf th e tf amptimes real tf th worked get solution due clearity switched expression amptimes tf th nsolve e th e tf th e tf amptimes real tf th output amptimes stay get solution equation thought transformation rule may handle difference changed amptimes tf th nsolve e th e tf th e tf amptimes real tf th output fpr amptimes seems right get solution problem use transformation rule explicitly said supporting clearity plus problem get realy want know work way thought edit guess something precision
