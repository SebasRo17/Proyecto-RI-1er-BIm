computer scientist research field often tasked working alongside professional outside software domain think math people electrical engineer etc translating theory idea real world implementation often find difficult present theoretical problem appears somewhat disconnected reality saying theory bogus difficult translate real world situation example recently working software defined radio exploring many different area often math specialist group would present problem heavily grounded theory signal processing physic whatever often struggle time hard draw direct parallel theory real world implementation need develop say working energy detector theory person group would say need measure noise variance signal present lead think hell isolate noise signal reality many example hope see going question one deal implementation theoretical concept theory seems detached reality least connection clear perhaps person theory may ignorant real restriction note found hard question ask hopefully following suggestion could improve mean let know thanks looking edit bit clear understand situation like must learn specific domain extent e signal processing concerned theoretical concept appear grounded practice one would like
