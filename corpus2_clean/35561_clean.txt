let say several equation solution given negative series x sum n infty n x n x x mathcal x equation look like eqns mathcal x n rh given equation mean putting ansatz solution equation power smaller one given rh cancel end equation coefficient n instance frac partial partial mathcal x mathcal x x mathcal x mathcal give x x solved used elsewhere coefficient etc simple example since one solution reality dealing solution vector component similar expansion component like speed process finding component look like get equation mathematica even made simple ansatz different ofc sum n n n input equation collect gather stuff power x like see way make mathematica give coefficient equation need specify part equation series need kept example mathcal part cancel neglecting x x part ansatz way inputing collecting seeing mathcal x n component manually solve
