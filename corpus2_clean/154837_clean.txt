stack based virtual machine like clr jvm different set instruction theory behind devising instruction set creating virtual machine e g jvm instruction set load constant num num onto stack iconst 0 iconst 1 iconst 2 iconst 3 iconst 4 iconst 5 whereas clr instruction set load number num num onto stack follows num num num num num num num num num num need opcodes others like eager know reason behind difference opcodes different vms specific theory devise opcodes totally driven characteristic vm depends high level language construct
