want set pde model take two dimensional diffusion equation account key problem trouble solving two dimensional diffusion equation numerically consider following code l system c x c x x c x derivative c derivative c l c x c x l c x sol ndsolve system c x l l manipulate plot evaluate c x sol x l l mathematica graphic see artifact two edge neumann condition applied obviously c x solves system since initial condition mathematica trouble compute numerically tried various ode solver implicitrungekutta bdf adam seems problem spatial discretization perhaps neumann boundary condition variable x suggestion fix
