recently became interested agile practice software development since seen lot article point practice allow reduced overall cost logic behind usually go like requirement change reflect change next sprint backlog lead reduced cost designing new feature implementing close together term time cost go according famous rule later need make change requirement expensive satisfy requirement mid big software project complex sudden change requirement mean touch part system order satisfy requirement lot case architecture need modified significantly also mean need implement feature relied older architecture whole point reduced cost kinda go away course new requirement call new independent part system problem old architecture grows need rethought reimplemented opposite using waterfall suddenly realize new requirement introduced go change design requires existing architecture altered redesign really mess introduces new part system go work problem said seems like advantage agile development working feature complete build sprint lot people critical addition agile seems like result bad software architecture overall feature kinda get slapped one onto another agile team care feature work work seems like system grow complexity time agile development practice actually increase chaos overall product architecture thus eventually resulting higher cost since increasingly difficult introduce change whereas waterfall allows perfect architecture release anything somebody please point going wrong obviously lot people use agile production environment must wrong somewhere
