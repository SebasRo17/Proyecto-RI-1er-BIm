let say action time specifies need created dbobject etc assume also creation non trivial factory required obviously different type depend different thing one pdo another memcache create condition left option num create switch action outside factory order call different subclass factory call example case db obj new dbh break clearly bad since switch present everywhere needed num switch action inside sort factory factory num parent factory depend everything might create since might need database memcache order follow dependency injection rule need supply parent factory pdo memcache instance even use also sound pretty bad another problem create another depends something new add dependency theese factory instantiated horizontal change fact avoiding tell concept problem see right therefore question trying point even needed depend anything parses action still need dependency overkill di need reach global state use singleton registry also considered bad practice would good practice situation
