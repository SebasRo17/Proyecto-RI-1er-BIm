working graph multiple edge loop want eliminate isomorphic graph long list generated findgraphisomorphism function nice work simple graph looking find function equivalent multigraphs example two multigraphs possibly third party package maybe even external program would find graph isomorphism also possible compare graphic object mathematica see whether similar tried sameq avail graph self loop assuming result mathematica plot graph floating point value impossible two identical graph like function look similarity two graphic object think something like might trick case
