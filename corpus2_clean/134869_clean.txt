recently began new project implement core part automation since important tdding test various basic scenario well thing know old system find creating sandbox test exercise candidate algorithm complete isolation choose one best meet requirement also created test figure test failing coded sandbox manner test actual production instead simplification production environment alter find problem cause solution neither continuing regression pick algorithm may never use others test show another test failing correct initial test exercised production verify correctness longer care test hard coded exercise environment still fails learning tdd taught never delete unit test even test original purpose become irrelevant within test use developer model test refactored purpose later instead test become redundant irrelevant longer pas fail ignored generally accepted stance ignoring test potential abuse e g think matter anymore fails ignore
