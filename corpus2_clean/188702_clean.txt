plenty question around regarding random number generation find anything exactly matched question apology missed one random number generator software tend flat distribution given range number likely come next less obviously intention anything flat distribution entirely random number likely others however time flat distribution desirable example building game often necessary model real world scenario many normal bell curve distribution good prng existing rng popular programming language library fed simple equation equation bell curve sine wave distribution far assume resulting prng also good test test whether system purely random work system matter counting output long time seeing well fit desired distribution simpler eg analytical algebraic way check help would appreciated
