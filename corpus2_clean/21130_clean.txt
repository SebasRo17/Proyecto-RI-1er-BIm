describe question like say seen excellent answer posted managed get work data list value would like plot polar coordinate value represent position series coupled pendulum angle change radius sample data pendulum certain time position would like color pendulum based position first pendulum angle would colored purple next angle slightly purplish blue way last pendulum angle colored red purpose coloring pendulum vary time using manipulate would able track pendulum color attempt somehow work way intend n length transpose position position transpose transpose position range n n adding small modifier radius pendulum allow identify specific pendulum give color later pendulumcolor colordata rainbow defining colour function extract pendulum number relates color listpolarplot position plotrange plotstyle thick joined true colorfunction pendulumcolor line absolutepointsize point output look something like definitely intended color point different rather red enter image description edit response vlc request sample code provided n n number pendulum system pendulumplotstyle table directive pointsize large colordata rainbow mod n every ten pendula coloured span color rainbow manipulate listpolarplot list funcposition tdummy plotrange plotstyle pendulumplotstyle tdummy code function funcposition give position pendulum function time function numerical solution ode rather put length code work due presence funcposition give good idea
