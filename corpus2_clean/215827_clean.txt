situation prone deadlock process operating system like solve minimum semaphore basically three cooperating process read device process get device must read two consecutive want use mutual exclusion semaphore used synchronize p1 p2 p3 a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2 a1 c1 w b2 c2 z a2 b1 x x z w declaration initialization think would work semaphore num num num num num num num sure kernel programmer happen knock minute num diagram cooperating process one device enter image description seems like p1 p2 would start something like wait a1 b1 a2 b2 signal
