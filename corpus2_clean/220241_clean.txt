suppose float value following format num num num num num num num num suppose provided user mechanism user take num actually mean num meaning separate num using standard sorting algorithm bubble sort quick sort framework specific sort going result look similar following num num num num num num num num however required would following num num num num num num num num thinking way would iterate sorting check whether n decimal place elevate n num decimal place add leading num would lead two array one containing value n number decimal place raw user one containing value number decimal place sanitised user would mean sorting containing value decimal place would provide required result way looking faster algorithm lower overhead see common problem domain going guess multitude way fix algorithm used attain required result
