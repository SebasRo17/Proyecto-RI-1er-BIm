thinking solar collector several independent mirror focus light solar collector similar following design energy innovation solar flaw assembly solar proceeding following assumption lack thereof software know position mirror know position relates real world mirror account poor mirror calibration environmental factor may effect one mirror others mirror move num unit one direction num unit opposite direction end originally started would like use machine learning position mirror correctly focus light collector expect would approach optimization problem optimizing mirror position maximize heat inside collector power problem finding small target noisy high dimensional space considering mirror num axis rotation problem anticipate day even stumble upon perfect mirror alignment might time noisy sensor sun moving target move along path follows different path every day although could calculate exact position sun time know position relates mirror question solar possible machine learning technique would help small target noisy high dimensional space problem mentioned solar catalyst question good example machine learning technique find small target noisy high dimensional space edit additional thought yes calculate sun position real world know mirror position related real world unless learned somehow might know sun azimuth num degree sun elevation num degree might know mirror position num num tell mirror correctly aligned sun know let assume sophisticated heat measurement know heat level must num mirror correctly aligned question two mirror num correctly aligned one solution considered approximate correct alignment using neural network would take sun azimuth elevation large num value mirror correspond num axis mirror sure best training though thought mirror coordinate system software access software know coordinate system relates real world let say mirror position num num mean know neither software know move mirror around move back num num mirror position previously additionally two mirror may position num num pointing opposite direction real world yes lot quality sensor problem easy solve energy innovation business best tell probably used bunch really awesome sensor people said buy solar panel cheaper sensor system collector head
