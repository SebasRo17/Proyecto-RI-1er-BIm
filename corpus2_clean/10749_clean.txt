trying find root confluent hypergeometric function wonder choose initial guess choice beta eq n beta lambda hypergeometric f lambda beta n beta ed n beta k integer lambda findroot eq n beta lambda lambda k beta goal plot function x axis beta axis lambda need good lambda value beta problem beta lot root want choose beta depends previous lambda value initial guess find next root example start beta beta want find root lambda around besseljzero n k next beta want get root around lambda value beta beta want get root around lambda value beta iterative way think use loop sure use could help thank
