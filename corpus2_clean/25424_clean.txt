using linear stability analysis would like compute range stability fixed point cycle following iterative map x n x n mu setting x x mu using hand mathematica calculated fixed point x frac sqrt mu x frac sqrt mu two cycle fixed point two additional point x frac sqrt mu x frac sqrt mu struggling find range stability fixed point cycle using hand mathematica know need compute slope map point differentiate x mu calculate derivative fixed point x frac sqrt mu get x sqrt mu similarly x x sqrt mu set absolute value get sqrt mu sqrt mu problem find range stability x x hand work sqrt mu sqrt mu sqrt mu frac mu frac try find range stability x sqrt mu sqrt mu sqrt mu solution inequality conclude range stability solve problem using mathematica one way using mathematica think drawing cobweb diagram checking value mu method exhaustive time consuming efficient method help method code greatly appreciated many thanks advance
