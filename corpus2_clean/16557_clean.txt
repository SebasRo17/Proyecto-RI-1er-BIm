trying use horizontalgauge dynamic expt scalingfunctions log e gauge logarithmic scale creates error graph pink background monitoring output dynamic expt second gauge horizontalgauge dynamic expt scalingfunctions none indicates logarithmic horizontalgauge actually generates expected output unless somebody realizes mistake rather simple code must assume bug mathematica edit unluckily error corrected version scalingfunctions exp log sort work location tick mark course wrong order log exp error reproduced reported error
