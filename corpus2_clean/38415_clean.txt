consider series sum infty frac sum infinity enter mathematica get following frac sqrt pi tag sqrt pi far good change q get new answer frac f left frac frac q q right q tag hypergeometricpfq q q q ok bad let q remains almost unchanged form frac f left frac frac right tag try simplify fullsimplify change tried checking equality still got unevaluated expression using reduce gave true strange problem reduce ztest unable decide whether numeric quantity difference lh rh multiplied denominator equal zero assuming still computing difference f left frac frac right frac sqrt pi n give almost zero function indeed must simplifiable convince mathematica simplify hypergeometric function expression
