set space coordinate atom molecule could also transform sphere radius corresponding atom represent would like place molecule tightest possible rectangular bounding box determine coordinate box vertex graphic processing routine mathematica automatically need implement algorithm literature specific would like obtain minimum bounding box molecule allowing rotation etc able find solution special case molecule interested using sort lame trick rotational symmetry asking question like general case solution one way proceed would perform set random rotation calculate volume bounding box mathematica generates keep going obtain sufficiently tight fit way get coordinate graphic bounding box vertex
