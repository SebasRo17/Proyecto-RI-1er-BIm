trying solve partial differential equation using ndsolve specifying method option ndsolve give solution quite oke show oscilations suppose expected able solve using option like maxstepsize get rid least reduce oscilations however unfortunately use example maxstepsize get result make sense error like ndsolve mconly method ida machine real code available unable continue complex value beyond floating point exception really understand get error hopefully someone could illuminate also guess maxstepsize way give better solution option improve solution satisfied one far thanks advance simplification code tmin tmax xmin xmax rate b f rate eq x h x b eq x x h x f ic h x ic x bc h solution ndsolve eq eq ic ic bc h x xmin xmax tmin tmax maxstepsize manipulate plot evaluate x solution tmax plotstyle red imagesize x xmin xmax result x top graph supposed flat
