complex morlet function defined f c f b frac sqrt pi f b exp f b exp jmath f ct f b f c two important parameter modifying complex morlet wavelet seems mathematica support complex morlet transform support real morlet function interested use complex wavelet function mathematica gabor transform complex wavelet gabor transform one parameter tuned need complex morlet function run continues wavelet transform also want define f b f c complex morlet function make complex morlet wavalet transform changing gabor parameter change f b f c define new wavelet exactly like equation complex morlet p actually matlab user really know anything flexibility mathematica reason came mathematica inversecontinuouswavelettransform
