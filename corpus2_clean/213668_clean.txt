developed small scripting language started writing first native library binding practically first time writing native extension script language conceptual issue like write glue popular library used language design engine written achieved using c struct describing visible virtual machine along pointer thus native binding really global must obviously give preferably good c idiomatic put one function namespace prepending custom prefix name myscript parse source myscript bytecode custom shall ideally describe library part arises confusion let say writing binding libcurl case seems reasonable call extension library curl myscript binding like myscript api const curl myscript lib num collides curl namespace even thought calling lib unfortunately libcurl exclusively use curl prefix public apis contain macro like assume would clutter namespace well another option would declare myscript curl lib good long one writes binding since know namespace soon contributor start add native binding clutter myscript namespace done research seems example perl curl binding follows pattern sure think suggest variable general guideline followed
