trying analysis signal identify time frequency information example around time specific frequency arrives appears mathematica powerful wavelet analysis function builtin suitable job reading documentation still get particular really understand function continuouswavelettransform waveletscalogram example example document data table piecewise sin sin sin sin listlineplot data aspectratio enter image description cwd continuouswavelettransform data dgaussianwavelet automatic waveletscalogram cwd colorfunction rusttones enter image description example show map time signal time frequency representation question documentation say waveletscalogram plot wavelet vector coefficient really mean x axis represent understanding time frequency plot kind like musical score time axis horizontal frequency note plotted vertical axis understanding correct way see identify frequency signal plot example see four difference frequency plot read frequency corresponding value
