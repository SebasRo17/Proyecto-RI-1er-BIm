pretty new mathematica trying learn solve problem functional way problem solving list way could sum element list repetition sum less equal value code solves problem fine getsum l list n list total thread l n x x prepend map range floor list outer flatten arraydepth map getsum deletecases x x x tableform flatten sortby last tableheadings none append total however code check lot unneccesary case could problem bigger list longer question simply would mathematica esque way solve problem regard efficiency code elegance
