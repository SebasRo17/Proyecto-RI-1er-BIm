trying bruteforce optimization problem want generate roughly million function evaluation wondering would best term expression evaluated faster curently expression plain symbolic form tried using replaceall operator run really slowly expression quite large output text file amasses thopusand line equation yeah kinda slow optimize little term bruteforce single variable expression evaluates loop certain depth entire expression really evaluate gazillion time still kinda slow know trillion way tell mathematica thing turn expression function etc wondering type definition would make evaluation run faster tl dr basically simple somewhat noobish solution problem faster expression evaluation looking
