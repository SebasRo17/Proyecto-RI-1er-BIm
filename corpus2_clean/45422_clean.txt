following code intention plot f e sqrt pi f e sqrt pi l f f x nintegrate f x f x infinity infinity epsilon x log x x nintegrate l x f log l infinity infinity x epsilon x log x x nintegrate l x f log l infinity infinity x plot epsilon x x plot epsilon x x following figure enter image description enter image description good however want single graph probably plot epsilon epsilon x example x epsilon epsilon change x get pair epsilon epsilon x representable least point couldt ugly figure allow pair continuous density f f mathbb r f f f f relative entropy kl divergence
