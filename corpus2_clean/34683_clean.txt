starting study behavior pdes would like run simulation mathematica help visualize solution example prime example would like study left begin array cc delta phi u cdot nabla phi text omega phi text partial omega end array right fixed smooth enough u divergence free flow tangentially boundary one dimensional problem inputting boundary condition easy since typically two bounary point would like study pde variety different omega find anything mathematica documentation input arbitrary boundary condition make thing simpler restrict reasonably nice omega nice boundary suppose partial omega given implicitly f x e g x would easiest best efficient way input boundary condition phi x f x edit feel free use reasonable discretization technique assume function like isinregion x need
