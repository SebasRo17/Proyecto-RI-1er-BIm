trying basic differential geometry space curve example space curve gamma mathbb r mathbb r unit tangent normal vector given frac gamma lvert gamma rvert n frac lvert rvert want define function would compute tangent normal vector arbitrary curve tried higher order functional style like say haskell norm x sqrt x x tangent function norm normal function tangent norm tangent need define norm mathematica like differentiate norm unfortunately work let co sin test curve circle normal n return vector instead bizarre expression involving dot product vector idea begin figuring going less elegant way tangent norm normal tangent s s norm tangent s s s requires use dummy variable pretty tangent s s construction original implementation work simple way fix
