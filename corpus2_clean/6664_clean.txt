answering another question stumbled upon problem cannot easily resolve assign derivative function another function typically one set setdelayed f x sin x x f x evaluate sin x x give result since forcing evaluating setdelayed essentially using set however give rise naming conflict e x f x sin x x f x evaluate sin x x work bother lot reason always use setdelayed avoid sometimes difficult find type bug tried force kind local scoping find working solution using f x evaluate block x sin x x f x evaluate module x sin x x f x evaluate x sin work block release variable fast module renames locally seen f f f work using f x x evaluate sin x work even x already assigned value however look definition get f global f f x x evaluate sin x want evaluation delayed whenever original function sin x much complicated derivation take time need calculate lot value f stack huge amount time idea get name conflict safe derivative assignment evaluates definition thanks
