one map simplifying function summands expand fully expanding expression question first consider following example want integrate following product variable imax p product b imax imax define custom integration much faster general integrate customintegration exp exp k k use expand first problem expansion really eats ton memory even though final result actually much smaller bytecount p bytecount p expand p bytecount customintegration p give expansion requires around time much memory needed actual script currently need around gb memory could reduce
