suppose need call lot maybe thousand time every mouse mouse move us instance called transform func1 b c var new transform rotate scale b c num creating thousand new transforms call func1 lot instead creating new transform every time created small system allocate extra transforms needed use window util var arr util var temp arr pop temp undefined new transform temp temp util push temp instead could call func2 func2 b c var util reset rotate scale b c var result num util result using func2 several thousand time new transform ever called might suggest benefit number jsperf seem suggest want see two function action well transform take look jsperf especially num simulate occuring lot event jsperf test var var num num func1 num num v func2 may better way test advantageous missing something broadly reuse like still good idea scenario ever
