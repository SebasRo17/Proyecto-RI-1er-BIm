several algorithm would like test set compare result know design maximum readability maximum efficiency considered creating algorithm giving copy work seem right answer num set fairly large num num float numpy want copy one num time num many algorithm similar pre processing routine thus repeating algorithm seems wasteful num algorithm nearly identical except parameter different time one call per algorithm also seems wrong per num many call preprocessing function becomes difficult tell calling want able allow user easily call variety algorithm keeping clear possible keep thinking need inverse object method different need something member different method
