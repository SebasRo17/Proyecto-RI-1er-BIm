way simplify following equation p x b p b x q b x b x q x b q b x p b x b x b x x x b x assuming p q p q order get q x p x q b x p b x although fullsimplify work case using instead p q p q variable subscript according following substitution p subscript q subscript b p subscript q subscript b subscript b subscript fullsimplify cease produce desired result pretty unexpected behaviour
