looking nice one two liner randomly place number n graphic polytopes plane dimension x time specify k leq n one color e g red remaining n k another color e g blue possible would also like option randomly reassign color arbitrary number time perhaps clicking mouse without changing coordinate polytopes possible get started placing single red colored dodecahedron coordinate following line code graphic red scale translate polyhedrondata dodecahedron face boxed false background gray perhaps would want use map
