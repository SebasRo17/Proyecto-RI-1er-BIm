looking description algorithm pseudocode etc help frame problem find appropriate recursion efficient solution problem given graph weighted node starting node want generate weight ordered list node lying path start starting node proceeds jumping next adjacent unvisited highest node next etc longer continue e g adjacent node unvisited adjacent node node visited already correctly assuming variation traveling salesman problem suggestion pointer would greatly appreciated algorithm area expertise update comment homework question actually year empirical research behind simply able frame seemingly random behavior algorithmic problem without tackling group dynamic algorithmically able expand testing beyond initial sample unfortunately regression analysis trick
