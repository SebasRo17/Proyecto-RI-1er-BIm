basically coding interface played real world com various engineering complexity immutability published interface implementation etc consider following situation o level oriented library set published interface implementation provided o extension point provided third party extend specific behavior implementing subset published interface registering o programmer look whole set published interface say self seems like implement functionality better algorithm including area designated extensible programmer programmer implementation mash com style o implementation fails miserably programmer realize suite object implemented o rely heavily communication using non published interface published interface minimalistic blocked many opportunity optimization encoding decoding trans coding image sound video compression task well known certain pipeline stage cancel perform exact opposite operation inverse e g g f x x typical interaction like num consumer asks producer implement special interface x vendor v know num yes consumer talk producer using interface x see exact opposite num num yes consumer asks producer upper stage e bypassing producer num effect cancelled num num capability missing minimalistic published interface first glance seems vendor might chance provide well choose might also case providing performance oriented interface would severely pollute namespace end result whenever programmer provides implementation certain would either fail miserably ii perform slowly could interact rest suite using performance enhanced internal interface known suite frequent problem flavor oriented technology common flavor component based engineering advocate oop argue refactoring publishing interface would solve problem assumes possible distribute new version library along new set interface technology possible way matter com allows time query time response additional interface implemented equivalent would like library make heavy use instanceof interface internal package reviewer open suggestion trimming question essence correct term seems mixin thanks question answer partly relevant example focus lost opportunity optimization within single library basically third party implementer num implement encoder decoder num implement proprietary interface encoder decoder order detect bypassing operation cancel implementation get baseline performance inter operating different encoders decoder vendor
