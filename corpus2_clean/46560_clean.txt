following maple code simplify ab sin x sin x given condition pi x pi simplify ab sin x assuming pi x x pi tried thought would equivalent mathematica code fullsimplify ab sin x assumption pi x pi mathematica give answer expected another related example starting sqrt sin x sqrt sin x condition pi x pi want get co x thing tried sqrt sin x sqrt sin x sqrt x sqrt trigfactor x refine assumption pi x pi fullsimplify assumption pi x pi
