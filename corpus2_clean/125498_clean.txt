asking instead even know technology tag team embark project convert large part base use asynchronous file file storage medium increasingly locate across high latency connection basic experience asynchronous development larger scale previous work point even sure begin looking technology pattern documentation solve problem basic setup work within client application user interface sends file request locally running background process actual work communicating file storage service obtain proxy layer needed number client application need share file service cached result etc design head would client submit request service would turn submit request file storage service begin asynchronous job progress made downloading file service would receive notification would fire kind callback mechanism ui client report process completion mean need sort cross process mechanism executing callback previously use duplex wcf service implement something similar unsure work properly current case particular want handle case client submits request exit retrieval process service need able detect client terminated keep downloading file know wcf duplex channel would imply client channel closing would terminate service channel well addition would prefer require client app sit kind spin lock waiting async call finish research led believe duplex callback operate within context single wcf call would need keep calling thread around duration mechanism registering sending callback style message across process team would prefer fully managed solution though certainly open unmanaged option significantly better way
