caveat mathematica version matter define object parametricplot say following tube parametricplot co sin u pi u rendered fine save use eps format tex doc fine surface kinda crowded meshlines want draw student attention curve draw surface anyway therefore meshlines nuisance must go render without listing option rtfm searching help give promising hit edgeform mesh none et cetera none seem work parametricplot tried print tube using fullform order strip graphic header insert edgeform beginning something went wrong experienced enough mathematica user really figure look wolfram line help list mesh none option parametricplot must refer newer version work mine like think enough programmer build required list polygon insert edgeform command lot work kinda hurry upgrade work uni could get use departmental license upgraded version would behind license daemon easily use home et cetera charm old license version inser activation code whatever
