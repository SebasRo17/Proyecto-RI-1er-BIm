consider following code show graphic opacity sphere opacity blue polygon parametricplot sin th co ph sin th sin ph co th th pi ph pi regionfunction function x z ab x plotrange plotstyle red mesh none mathematica graphic doctored somewhat another question site produce sphere opaque red surface except two porthole allow one see blue rectangle inside consider following minor tweak replacing square text show graphic opacity sphere opacity blue text surprise parametricplot sin th co ph sin th sin ph co th th pi ph pi regionfunction function x z ab x plotrange plotstyle red mesh none mathematica graphic output know save rotating gif side question show blue text red sphere whether looking porthole reason help text drawn front object way treat text like graphic primitive indeed surprise look porthole get behavior similar blue rectangle perhaps clarify interested able change z order text fact rotate rest graphic object using mouse also kind annoying thanks
