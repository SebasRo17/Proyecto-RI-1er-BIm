question mind recently checking concurrent language like haskell go erlang point view huge benefit performance opposed language like c way handle function parallel question syntax language like c much different imo simpler concurrent language even though concurrent language executed runtime therefore possibility simplifying syntax example consider go sqrt package trivial example package package sqrt return approximation square root x func sqrt x float64 float64 z num num num z z z x num z z counterpart ported based sqrt example go def sqrt x z num range num num z z z x num z z see go syntax like assignment take complicated example syntax look like trying point go least weird looking language consider erlang looking even weirder qsort qsort list sort list item module qsort file qsort erl export qsort num qsort num parameter exported qsort list empty empty list nothing sort qsort pivot rest compose recursively list front element pivot pivot back element pivot qsort front front rest front pivot pivot qsort back back rest back pivot part caught eye convinced language look like reason help think simpler concurrent language like use runtime like javascript still safe know safe language advantage mix type still gotta somebody made concurrent language safety possible right seems like almost concurrent language one thing common bigger list possible valid syntax hope explained question well enough
