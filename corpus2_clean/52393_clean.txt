curious long mathematica arrives think time ask question new association data structure would used improve mathematica programming related aspect question fast key search association website said extremely fast would n n log n note added estimate stupid see benchmark answer recommended used lot key also fast operation inserting key assoication would n n previously use pattern matching implement similar functionality example f x f b effectively realize f x b advantage latter former seems key easily managed systematic understanding advantage new structure dataset built upon association efficient enough term memory space computational speed use dataset store calculate big data say table thousand row like mcmc chain previously used pure array example old code improved making use association read guide association basically collection related function would great usefulness function could get explained note added reply really great many thanks also benchmark testing association one leonid shifrin association thread range n range n n x axis plot observe one case sure worst case creation insertion middle deletion middle n insertion removal head tail logn lookup association take n memory space larger constant factor array note first figure deletion fast using rest delete store delete store slow delete store othernumber also second figure association dataset take almost memory thus visible enter image description enter image description
