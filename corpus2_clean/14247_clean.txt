would like show typical day energy load found clustering year worth data spread throughout year single graph color typical day cluster far please excuse probably sloppy coding still getting used mathematica way thinking previous r user python knowledge data pastebin divided daily load curve measurement cluster loadclust findclusters load num list within cluster represents daily load curve within year cluster contain amount day daily load list joined list corresponds hour year e first day second etc finding position daily list original ordered list since wanted keep different cluster order clustyearh flatten table table join range flatten position load loadclust j flatten position load loadclust j loadclust j length loadclust j j length loadclust made pair hour year load hour still maintaining order cluster four list containing paired coordinate cluster pair table transpose join flatten transpose clustyearh length loadclust flatten transpose clustyearh length loadclust giving list four list pair clust plotting problem first used listplot pair display point notice blue red cluster especially missing second include joined true join consecutive day cluster year cluster one day example join day question way color cluster within line graph whole year addition would love able apply manipulate scroll year within week week window using simon wood solution create list index clustered day loadclust findclusters load range make pair data give coordinate listplot adding data th hour day e first hour next day plot joined point load append load pair map sequence thread range append load load loadclust create manipulate graph view graph inside window added color originally used cluster manipulate listlineplot pair frame true ax false plotrange n n win plotstyle blue orange red green line pt line split pt n first hour win win window length manipulate plot big thanks simon cheer e
