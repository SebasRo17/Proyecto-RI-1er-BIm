want discretize constructive solid supported mathematica region functionality quality resulting mesh must controllable mesh must useful computation easy trivial example stuns simple derived region sharp edge r regiondifference ball ball regionplot plotpoints handle reasonably well regionplot r plotpoints enter image description create discretized mesh poor quality discretizeregion r enter image description edge noticeably jaggy understandable usually option like plotpoints fix kind issue discretizeregion numerous option affect quality output think played biggest difference seen use maxcellmeasure interestingly enough ugly jaggies stay even complexity mesh increase would need option like plotpoints apparently affect grid resolution marching cube style algorithm regionplot one discretizeregion suggestion
