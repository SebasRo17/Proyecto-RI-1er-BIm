looking around able find way solving conceptually simple problem short trying find charge density dielectric external electric field given begin equation overline p overline r int rho overline r overline r overline r dv end equation case overline p alpha overline e alpha polarizability overline e applied electric field sure really approach looked solving integral equation using mathematica nothing seen seems quite like problem
