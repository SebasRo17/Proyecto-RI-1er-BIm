trying numerically integrate function vector valued slow part much faster component shared component e integral form int b begin pmatrix f x g x h x end pmatrix w x text dx nintegrate nicely listable first argument feed list valued argument without problem however appears component completely separate integral result lot work calculated example simplified example integral samplepointslist reap nintegrate x x x co x co x x evaluationmonitor sow x give sample point diagram listplot transpose samplepointslist range length samplepointslist enter image description clear kernel initial sampling refinement separately component required sample point identical lot shared work feel fair bit room optimization aware since sampling requirement component slightly different binding completely require evaluation component would necessary instance example extra detail required first component around leq x leq would slowed slightly required also calculate second third component though require however component case similar enough think would issue way force mathematica sort separation integrand unification sampling way make aware previously calculated value sampling point speed process
