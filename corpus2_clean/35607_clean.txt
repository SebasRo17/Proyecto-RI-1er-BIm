developing model thermodynamic cycle mathematica wrote several function applied list containing starting value iterated model converge fixed fixedpoint f f nest f f f f nest f f startinglist would like see final converged value also value point cycle threw grid data prepend fixed starting point prepend f fixed condenser prepend nest f f fixed condenser prepend f nest f f fixed pump prepend f f nest f f fixed pump prepend f f f nest f f fixed heat exch prepend nest f f f f nest f f fixed heat exch prepend f nest f f f f nest f f fixed turbine prepend f f nest f f f f nest f f fixed turbine text grid prepend data point temp degree c pressure bar enthalpy kj kg enthropy kj kg k density kg viscosity kg quality frame work look clean second thing creating data mathematica performing nest might consume lot time going extend model way quicker
