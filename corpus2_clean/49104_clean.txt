following code sigma sol sum replacepart apply kroneckerproduct table id sigma id identitymatrix sol dimension sol sum replacepart apply kroneckerproduct table id sigma sol dimension see evaluate sum expression second time dimension result change give wrong result result must matrix put id sol would gotten wrong result first evaluation resolve problem think problem replacepart apply kroneckerproduct table id sigma assigning id position clear something like id id replacepart change position contains id sigma however assigning id position clear anymore cannot find solution problem
