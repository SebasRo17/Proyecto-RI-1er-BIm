mathematica mapping function like scipy multidimensional one mean something like mapping onto example looking interpolate see interpolation regard estimating line given point make clear mean simple example using linear mapping would onto would give value edited comment added greater precision would make question clear example would reading sensor give value using operate say servo accepts value scale exactly looking thanks possible use mapping order ex normal distribution quadratic mapping linear mapping
