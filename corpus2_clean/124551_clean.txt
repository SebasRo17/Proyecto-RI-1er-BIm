past used inheritance allow extension window form application form would common control artwork functionality would create base form implementing common control functionality allow control inherit base form however problem design num control one container time static control tricky example suppose base form called contained treeview make protected static derived instance modify display treeview would work multiple class inheriting treeview one container time would likely last form initialized though every instance could edit control would display one given time course work arounds ugly seems really bad design multiple container store pointer anyhow num state form button state label text etc use global variable reset state load num really supported visual studio designer well better yet still easily maintainable design use form inheritance still best approach update went looking mvc mvp observer pattern event pattern thinking moment please critique contain control event connected control event need sort logic handle pas immediately handle ui perform logical operation update model expose event fire upon state change presenter subscribe observe presenter receives event notification perform logic presenter modify view accordingly one model memory could potentially many instance therefore would solve problem synchronizing instance model question layer store stuff like last pressed button keep highlighted user like cs menu form please criticize design thanks help
