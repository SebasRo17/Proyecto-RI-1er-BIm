creating interface number existing class mocking reason many class also package scope method attempt give level encapsulation ensuring controller modify state thought could use change try get cleaner encapsulation well question two fold first considered viable use interface encapsulation could make certain method interface available could ibar getfoo return ifoo bar override getfoo bar problem anyone could easily cast actual really considered worthwhile encapsulation second question model would want model sort method ifoo object however want controller way fetch actuall foo implementation ie know ifoo foo access method interface considered cleanest way ensure controller access full class see interface casting interface concrete would considered rather sloppy
