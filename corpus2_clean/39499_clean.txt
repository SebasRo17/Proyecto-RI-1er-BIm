code work expected isdefined x x isdefined x print stringjoin tostring x tostring x produce output x x x code work would expect x x notdefined x print stringjoin tostring x tostring x produce output x x x start x x since value assigned variable isdefined x set equal second example code except instead comparing x variable isdefined compare x variable notdefined variable never defined instead giving error message stopping somehow indicating told compare value x something assigned value keep right going never give indication anything wrong real code example based lot input data create output data based calculation condition using input data changed variable name accidentally left old name statement result output looked like condition never met actually mathematica example programming language compile run try something like default option specify compile run looked preference online find anything like avoid incorrect output result problem anyone idea obvious solution making mistake first place
