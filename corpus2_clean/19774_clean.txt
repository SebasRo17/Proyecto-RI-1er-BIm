dealing problem requires use findinstance findroot nested non trivial way result dependent parameter value therefore use sol findroot calculation result take minute value faster others slower resulting plot sol take several hour want calculation plot sol learned previous question save result obtained using sol sol findroot however still requires redo calculation every time start mathematica kernel dy unexpected reason way save export result obtained within sol load beginning session apologize vague term please let know need clearify question
