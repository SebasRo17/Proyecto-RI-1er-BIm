recursion know one problem wrapping head around feel like achieving milestone programming voyage come actually using real world problem knowing mechanic recursion enough one must also understand nature problem recursion suitable solution question problem pattern call solution recursion recursion form divide conquer strategy form reuse design pattern right give u example real world problem recursion come mind immediate solution update lot answer referring real problem tree traversing factorial etc would prefer real real problem let give example large chuck text num mb text linked list structs needed make index full text searching needed keep entire index memory index text every num minute every num minute compare entire text two linked list newly generated chunk text see changed would index way could avoid index entire text remember needed find diff point two num mb linked list one colleague came fantastic program used heavy recursion compare line collect position differed yes know sound puzzling could recursion help point could see problem could solved smartly heavy use recursion
