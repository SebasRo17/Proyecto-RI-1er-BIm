package exist function take parameter n generates random n sided simple polygon convex non convex possibly within certain bounding box suffice simply generate n random point would figure connect point non intersecting manner sure algorithm solve particular problem would much rather use ready made function would guaranteed work rather code function introduce bug trying generate large number random test case algorithm supposed work polygon
