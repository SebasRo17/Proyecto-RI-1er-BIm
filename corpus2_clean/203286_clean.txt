getting started hobby detection project aim understand underlying algorithm end overall accuracy result currently important actual time starting trying find good image segmentation algorithm provide good jump point detection phase target image would real world scene found two technique mirrored thought go num graph based image segmentation num contour texture analysis image segmentation first one really intuitive understand seems simple enough implement second closer initial thought go combine color intensity texture information find region order magnitude complex least question algorithm looking provide kind result two specific paper arrived updated version technique already floating around like mentioned earlier goal relative accuracy image segmentation eventual aim achieve degree accuracy detection runtime algorithm able segment image naturally important component two algorithm varying extent found two paper couple day refining search term learning new one relevant exact kind technique looking reached end personal google creativity finally know better fit cstheory stackexchange even c stackexchange looked cstheory seems appropriate intricate algorithmic discussion broad question like also find relevant tag either please move appropriate
