quine computer program take input produce copy source code output many trivial quine mathematica hello world hello world f x f x f x undefined symbol hold n pi hold n pi trivial thinking perhaps interesting challenge mathematica multiquine program output another program b distinct b exectued output multiple level depth also allowed thus one might program executed output distinct program executed output another program distinct first two executed output original program also multiquines output distinct program different language program executed output original program question though challenge come multiquine mathematica
