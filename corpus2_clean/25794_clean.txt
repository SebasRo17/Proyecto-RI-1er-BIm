would like use spline function describe transformation one range real another would like function map value x simplicity let u assume x idea define smooth nonlinear function within boundary point alpha beta alpha beta also thus bezier bspline function seemed appropriate unfortunately see use spline function directly map x vice versa spline function one parameter give point curve e g spline spline find say corresponding x value tried something like f bsplinefunction findinstance last f getting false answer rightarrow correct answer far also tried reduce solve nsolve findroot giving start value course given domain real nothing work way without substitute simpler function spline function e g using interpolation
