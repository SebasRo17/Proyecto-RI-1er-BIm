writing game accompanying graphic engine top opengl c im also fan good coding process automated testing graphic testing seems pretty since often visual heavily visual oriented example imagine analyzing raw image stream rendered screen byte byte need test compare hard create obtain often rendered image identical byte level running different time small change algorithm wreck approach completely thinking creating visual unit test suite basically render different test scene showing stuff like shadow mapping animation etc etc etc part ci scene would rendered video file possibly leave executable different metric would still require manual inspection video file atleast would somewhat automated standardised think hoping better way
