working mathematica lab calc ran problem last night trying calculate midpoint approximation definite integral co x came clear b n f f x co x b n n b n sum f b n n fine try use nsum instead n sum happens clear b n b n b n nsum f b n n evaluation sequencelimit seqlim general form sequence could determined result may incorrect evaluation sequencelimit seqlim general form sequence could determined result may incorrect according documentation sum evaluates given sum n function give numerical value parameter also nsum give numerical approximation sum understanding n sum nsum missing something huge deal far typing like know work expected read online nsum apparently try work part sum symbolically even see could much different real answer
