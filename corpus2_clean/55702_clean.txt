number ugly way implement following pattern recognition task looking something elegant keep notebook tidy need define function six variable f b c b c known unchanged simultaneous interchange two b c corresponding b c begin align f b c b c f c b c b f b c b c f b c b c f c b c b f c b c b end align edit clarity given one definition get mathematica try possibility within restricted set permutation shown pattern matching need mimic effect setattributes f orderless concretely define special case f b c b c function call f x n match return x n f x n match thus return must returned unevaluated added question instead finding way get mathematica try possibility pattern matching would easier write code representative definition f made kernel automatically add definition f remaining permutation argument
