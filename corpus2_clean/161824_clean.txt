big database consider today system web front end allows user update let call original solution new user come come set new user user need web front end let call solution originally num solution original solution however need solution different set user factor need considered design original solution may choose implement solution update insert solution may choose receive updated inserted original solution update solution easily easiest solution would replicate entire database sort process write read solution however really high overhead come duplicate storage need would imagine storing kind delta would better imagine possible solution would design architecture much like source control system branch would new solution implemented branch original solution different update branch easily updated branch vice versa tip easily clone original solution new solution without replicating actual database perhaps design pattern use implementation
