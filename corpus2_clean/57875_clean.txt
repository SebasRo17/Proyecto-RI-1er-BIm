trying numerically solve partial differential equation eq eq given boundary condition cond using following code r p ceq z r q p p l cinlet eq c z c z z z c z z q z conds c z c cinlet c l z q z eq q z c z ceq z ndsolve join eq eq conds c z z l currently provides error c l z simply true even remove one boundary condition get conds c z c cinlet q z get error ndsolve derarg derivative operator derivative act pure function sure avoid error help would appreciated
