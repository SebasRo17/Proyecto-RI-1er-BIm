past alot success using net dictionary tkey consisting x coordinate merged together however read performance despite amortized constant time bottleneck design mine application need perform alot read would benefit greatly performance read similar high degree spatial locality attached image showing two graph distribution sample 2d plane sorry lack label left low spatial locality right look always single connected mass blocky form enter image description could use computing bounding rectangle around top height x left rebuild entire time height changed width increased question given high degree spatial locality dictionary really best choice another approach could take could get near like read performance yet rebuild added need ever remove
