question need solve x x x x x x b order solve coupled equation need boundary x convert question shooting method xsoln ysoln x parametricndsolve x x x x x x b b specific value b find value satisfies x b manually possibility find value value b instead plugging value b repeating process way getting value follows first set b plot xsoln locate region satisfies x use findroot find exact value naively set f b numericq findroot xsoln b b value xsol b well behaved set findroot around starting point differs different b seted plotting profile detect starting point another idea adding whenevent ndsolve like whenevent xsoln b equal change value calculation thanks folk
