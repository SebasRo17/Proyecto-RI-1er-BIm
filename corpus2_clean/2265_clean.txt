time time would like use mathematica purely numerically e g plotting function defined integral cannot solve analytically solution differential equation turn mathematica rather efficient would say comparable matlab know however mathematica even though incredible numerical possibility make numerical life quite hard problem occur try evaluate function analytically type something like f x x yet numerical value try symbolically preprocess expression check symbolicprocessing option nintegrate even know symbolic solution exists list properly packed somewhere pi appears get converted numerical value would like much would switch change mathematica purely numerical mode would include number converted machine number list packed b attempted symbolic operation function f x x number remains unevaluated course know trick define f x numericq numerical mode would save lot typing c turn symbolical pre processing way get required behavior c people suffer problem turn problem know deal however inexperienced user typically suffer bad performance would like use mathematica numerical mean fact mathematica marvelous numerical tool good plotting capability hope might even better hunting guess problem avoided problematic expression e g following plot im f x x plot know list argument running evaluate decrease performance f x evaluated twice looking put mathematica mode typical user typical problem suffer low speed typing pi result pi give packed array mathematica forget commutativity associativity addition since hold numerical problem
