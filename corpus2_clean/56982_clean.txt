let take example densityplot sin x sin x retrieve minimum value position minimum plot plot tell mathematica mark position minimum minimum within plot contourplot contourplot sin x sin x way mark exact minimum position within plot even though contour plot yes jens szabolcs would best way could manage write code still beginner mathematica managed far cope problem well think post piece code show deleted variable replaced constant simplicity reason eislexpl epsilon n x epsilon log e x x epsilon x epsilon n x eislminx epsilon numericq n numericq minx findargmin eislexpl epsilon n x x x eislexpl epsilon n minx ueislexpl epsilon h n n n epsilon n heavisidetheta n exp n heavisidetheta n n eislminx epsilon n h n n epsilon ueislexpl epsilon h n n function need find minimum problem call function eislminx epsilon numericq n numericq problem order function mathematica able find minimum plug n eislminx epsilon numericq n numericq part ueislexpl epsilon h n n determined time want find minimum ueislexpl epsilon h n n respect n anybody know find minimum ueislexpl epsilon h n n respect n n would happy learn thanks help well actual question answered kguler thanks question find minimum function source findminimum function
