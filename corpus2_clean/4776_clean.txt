question arose response comment leonid answer question noted unstructured grid interpolation use interpolationorder example data flatten table x x x datadelete delete data randominteger length data intd interpolation datadelete interpolation udeg interpolation unstructured grid currently supported interpolationorder interpolationorder order reduced give result much worse order interpolation question data largely structured missing one grid point way figure grid missing point would allow first use linear interpolation find good guess value function missing grid point add grid point dataset interpolate whole thing error interpolation localized reconstructed region something like datareconstructed append datadelete sequence flatten intd missingcoords intreconstructed interpolation datareconstructed manual example todelete randominteger length data datadelete delete data todelete intd interpolation datadelete missingcoords data todelete datareconstructed append datadelete sequence flatten intd missingcoords intreconstructed interpolation datareconstructed comparing two method using exact x x plot intd x exact x x mathematica graphic difference interpolated region worse missing point plot intreconstructed x exact x x mathematica graphic much better everywhere except missing point order set know grid point missing way figure missing grid point mostly structured grid
