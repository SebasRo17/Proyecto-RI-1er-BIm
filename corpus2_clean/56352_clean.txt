playing compressed sensing think single pixel camera application would like mathematica equivalent matlab package call convex optimization cvx specifically solving underdetermined constrained l norm minimization problem using nminimize slow compared matlab code written colleague want give pleasure thinking matlab superior sure long run time due poor programing skill solution sparse know add additional constraint anyway seems find good reference compressed sensing mathematica suggestion would great
