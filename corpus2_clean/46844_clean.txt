quite like able automatically generate c version certain mathematical expression manipulated mathematica resultant c code fragment going used independently mathematica mathematica provides cform function almost seems like want get basic conversion tell convert mathematica symbol c identifier example would like output cform x tostring x cform std pow obj x string need usable mathematica course actual expression interest lot complicated way telling mathematica symbol x renamed obj x valid symbol name mathematica use directly string manipulation conversion unreliable direct method preferred tell mathematica x array function give x instead obj x mathematica think want use power function really like use std pow perhaps cform suited task would still appreciate solution using available method possible really think mathematica able help know need bracket tried format x cform obj x tostring cform format power b cform std pow tostring cform tostring b cform tostring x cform course power protected second setdelayed give error tostring x cform output really weird power obj x tried use string format
