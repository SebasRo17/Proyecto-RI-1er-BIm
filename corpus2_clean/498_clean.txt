using nminimize function complex intermediate expression real end result quite often one get error lessequal nord example nminimize ab b b lessequal nord invalid comparison attempted lessequal nord invalid comparison attempted lessequal nord invalid comparison attempted general stop output lessequal nord suppressed calculation less nord invalid comparison attempted nminimize cvmit failed converge requested accuracy precision within iteration b case one find simple one happens also result clearly wrong result therefore desirable remove error message way get rid error change expression way trigger error however expression generally complicated enough feasible hand found combination following strategy work sometimes use complexexpand option targetfunctions im put entire expression ab despite known real construction use simplify fullsimplify appropriate constraint hope finish reasonable time ab course work result also nonnegative however strategy always sufficient therefore question good strategy get expression form suitable nminimize
