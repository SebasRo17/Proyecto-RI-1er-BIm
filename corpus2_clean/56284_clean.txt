trying symbolic calculation mathematica involving space dimension n arbitrary fixed often like work vector arbitrary fixed length n like vector defined like vec array v n course work n initialized integer value like apply differential operator like let say vec v anybody know elegant way maybe using new inactive construct mathematica p interestingly enough mathematica support sum arbitrary length example enables following kind symbolic computation x x x j nonconstants x kroneckerdelta j sum x n x nonconstants x yield correct result piecewise n
