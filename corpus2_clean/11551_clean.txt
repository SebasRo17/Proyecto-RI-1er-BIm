bootstrapping alien world mathematica came first wtf moment rrp p phi l l l v v co phi sin phi op p l dot op v v l v norm op v l l sqrt l wanted achieve recursively apply rule felt similar context free grammar form desired expression cyclic dependency rule alternative kinda expected expand correctly edit trying calculate position internal joint planar rrp linkage expressed procedural language probably like pseudocode p position external r joint reference point p joint phi direction p joint l length r r bar function rrp p phi l op p v co phi sin phi l dot op v v l v norm op v l l sqrt l l return l v else return since figured even debug tried output intermediate variable non terminal cfg terminology rrp p phi l op v op v v co phi sin phi op p l dot op v v l v norm op v l l sqrt l rrp sqrt gave sqrt op v expected wtf op v matrix figure much op tried manually substituting v rule rrp p phi l op v op l v v co phi sin phi op p l dot op v v l v norm op l v l l sqrt l rrp sqrt give correct answer confused even know following proper idiomatic way constructing complex function thanks arcane help came mathematica could anyone please either point problem kindly enlighten could construct equivalent function mathematica way edit lookup figured evaluation order op v blame added hold around culprit releasehold whole thing finish building expression work rrp p phi l l l v v co phi sin phi op p l dot op v v l v norm hold op v l l sqrt l releasehold rrp sqrt still confused could know need hold write code workaround found something wrong
