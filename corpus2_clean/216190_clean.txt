gui call another called contains bunch function perform image processing algorithm like gaussianblur contour map generation etc gui pass image performs one algorithm return image back gui display essentially library independent image processing function right called gui like image image algorithm procedure require many function done single even one function algorithm jam packed pretty messy sound library thinking making every algorithm shared interface say pas interface gui public interface public image process public public image process process calling gui like image image process new think make sense point view problem end class one think better design crap much better idea thanks
