currently using mathematica high performance cluster hpc consists many compute node around core currently run mathematica script node invokes core subkernels license parallel meaning use mathkernel license subkernel license problem limited mathkernel license using unfair everyone else although ample subkernel license way use single least fewer mathkernel license invoke subkernels need currently script launchkernels parelleltable launch local subkernels node could specify different node launch subkernels perhaps thereby would need launch one mathkernel could invoke subkernels spread across compute node
