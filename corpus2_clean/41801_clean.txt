suppose distribution point like spherical ball example ball num table sqrt co sqrt sin random normaldistribution random real random real pi num graphic absolutepointsize point ball boxed true boxratios imagesize sphericalregion true code produce ball shown spherical distribution point space obviously ball spherical symmetry could considered smooth distribution limit infinite set point would like randomly erode distribution get something look bit like fractal shape think eroded mountain could obtain smooth hill mathematica procedure could modify ball distribution act like random eroding process eroding mean removing randomly selected point several neighbor repeat process several time please suggestion compatible mathematica
