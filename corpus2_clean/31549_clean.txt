trying used coefficient command extract numerical value front chebyshev polynomial know numerical way presented numerical recipe already done think using coefficient function would easier possibly less prone numerical issue example use method numerical recipe mathematica think chebyshev coefficient imaginary part know certainly far test test sum test chebyshevt try table coefficient test chebyshevt resulted error trying getting coefficient one one see could figure issue please bear coefficient test chebyshevt evaluation coefficient ivar valid variable coefficient coefficient test chebyshevt coefficient test chebyshevt coefficient test chebyshevt coefficient test chebyshevt coefficient command working zeroth order first order chebyshev polynomial think understand work zeroth order coefficient function probably need symbolic argument number like anyway fix confusing fails first order chebyshev polynomial figure part code table coefficient test z chebyshevt z sequence z provide nasser seems work give starting understand fundamental problem trying give command coefficient test chebyshevt mathematica interprets coefficient test add together numerical coefficient front anything term ideally want mathematica output adding term front guess stick method found numerical recipe
