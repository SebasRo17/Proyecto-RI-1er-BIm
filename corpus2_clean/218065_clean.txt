currently working vector c coming point figure want implement function interpolation two vector first came implementing function directly vector public vector3d public static vector3d vector3d vector3d vector2 double factor public vector3d vector3d double factor always offer static two vector parameter one non static one vector parameter got idea use extension method defined seperate called interpolation example since interpolation really thing available vector could another solution public vector3d public static interpolation public static vector3d vector3d vector vector3d double factor example use different possibility var vec1 new vector3d num num num var vec2 new vector3d num num num vector3d vec1 vec2 num num vector3d vec1 vec2 num num extension method vec1 vec2 num num num interpolation vec1 vec2 num num really know design better also know ultimate rule thing like someone personally prefers really would like hear opinion better possible
