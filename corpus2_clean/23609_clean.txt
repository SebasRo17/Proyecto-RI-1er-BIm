question bear resemblance question mathematica se finding point intersection crossing curve know guidebook numerics entry whole curve crossing thingy seem find link right however question little different yes crossing curve involved two curve cross two point curve x x curve x plot curve curve x plotrange curve crossing root find point curve cross root curve curve x x x nice happy get data individual plot interpolate data fold interpolatingfunction unable use findroot root pic plot curve x data case normal pic line data data infinity intplc data flatten interpolation pic plot curve x data case normal pic line data data infinity intplc data flatten interpolation findroot intplc intplc x findroot nlnum function value interpolatingfunction automatic developer packedarrayform automatic list number dimension x question thinking using case correctly despite fact data listlineplot data listlineplot seem plot fine enough use findroot interpolatingfunctions find multiple root case situation right assume root well sufficient
