would like find connected periodic boundary condition component large binary matrix tried fair job morphologicalcomponents randominteger cornerneighbors false instance arrayplot morphologicalcomponents randominteger cornerneighbors false colorfunction rainbow imagesize large enter image description option missing periodic boundary condition morphologicalcomponents distancefunction impose periodic boundary condition idea give morphologicalcomponents use clusteringcomponents complicated distancefunction pain neck example let give example mean periodic boundary condition instance given input would expect get something like output arrayplots two matrix enter image description enter image description
