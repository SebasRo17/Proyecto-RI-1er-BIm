graph billion vertex connected num vertex random want find length shortest path two point care actual path used note sometimes edge severed added happens num time less often lookup also ok batch edge change let get better performance pre process graph take num step come back infinity acceptable wrong num time returning length long edge length num edge bidirectional looking algorithm psuedocode english description actual great could use seems optimized pathfinding thought using dijkstra algorithm step requires setting shortest path found attribute every infinity wondering use case underhanded c contest
