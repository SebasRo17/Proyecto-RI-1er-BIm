mathematica later version change determining notebook get palette input focus lead quite unfortunate behaviour use focus follows mouse know focus follows mouse mode give keyboard input focus window currently contains mouse pointer consider following situation two notebook palette open one notebook might help window mathematica basically notebook let say first notebook left second one middle palette right let also say working left notebook want use palette therefore move mouse palette press button want mathematica exactly intended effect mathematica remembered last interacted left notebook inserted input generated palette however mathematica input instead inserted right notebook course hard understand happens indeed problem restricted mathematica occurs also e g gimp however fact mathematica got right give hope option toggle initialization edit regain behaviour move mouse pointer left notebook palette course cross right notebook therefore focus mouse give keyboard input focus window course loses input focus move palette ultimately get input focus newer mathematica version obviously record window input focus last use determine notebook palette act therefore question option set recover old mathematica behaviour way get mathematica programming could put init file edit said comment answer deleted mean time found mathematica still behaves way want change obviously introduced adding information visible cannot see deleted answer case deleted answer including comment might eventually go away completely also note also wrote comment selectednotebook change way e follows focus unconditionally version change interaction v
