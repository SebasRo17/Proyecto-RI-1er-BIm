nintegrate number different type symbolic preprocessing integrand starting numerical calculation including change variable way find sort symbolic preprocessing done precise integrand nintegrate actually evaluating example possible find change variable yes exactly change motivation trying understand go wrong get different value change order integration question describes simple oscillatory numerical integral nintegrate give different result depending order integration variable warning one result wrong looking point sampled nintegrate clear mathematica different change variable depending order integration variable
