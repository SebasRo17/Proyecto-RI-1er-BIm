question best way cluster graph instance around specifically marked object object graph node reference directed edge graph better explain question let explain motivation currently use moderately complex system serialize used project marked object specific attribute store saving entry path associated file disc could done storage providing suitable interface serialized automatically eg obj save serialization marked contains implicitly object b reference directly b b indirectly c b b c basically define specific storage entry specific object container object num serialized similarly fact marked num serialize storage entry marked object direct reference b marked save call b save store b storage entry b serialize serialize automatically object reached reference graph possibly multiple entry want usually provides functionality need however structural limitation approach num multi entry saving work direct connection container object num situation undefined behavior two marked object b reference unmarked c case system store c b making implicit copy double storage size also change reference graph loading thinking generalizing process apart practical question implementation coding use pickle serialize object general question way attach cluster unmarked object marked one question important issue considered basically use graph parsing algorithm attach last marked node behavior work done problem practical theoretical aware example simple graph serialize circle object arrow reference orange circle marked object serializing b e serialized blue object reachable b serialized entry e file question choose serialize object c e b entry thinking example c reachable attached reach e necessary pas b e attached b serialization b loaded also loaded thus serialized b entry note added tag database think answer might come field even question really
