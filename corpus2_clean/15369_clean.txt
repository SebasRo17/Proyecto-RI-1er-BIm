trying create custom progress indicator parallelized computation using dynamic setsharedvariables display update progress indicator calculation two question best way allow parallel kernel update progress function accepts dynamic x argument something like monitor performcalculations dynamic progress progressindicator dynamic progress progressindicator dynamic progress performcalculations dynamic progress note progress list custom structure indicating various aspect progress kernel performcalculations dynamic progress module calc setsharedvariable progress calc stuff module part work updateprogress dynamic progress parallelmap calc data avoid race condition shared variable quick test indicates shared variable caveat running parallel kernel would expected test append test expression evaluated atomically kernel would build result kernel already executed however seems like kernel read value test writing race condition cause final value simply best way avoid issue
