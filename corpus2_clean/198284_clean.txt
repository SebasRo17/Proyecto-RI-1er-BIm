question may sound dumb num evaluates integer programming language comparison since question seems little bit simple explain little bit first may seem evident programmer programming language may actually used num evaluates integer value one remark may seem random example may good idea first let take example string three way comparison take c strcmp example programmer trying c first language may tempted write following strcmp str1 str2 something since strcmp return num evaluates string equal beginning programmer tried fails miserably generally understand first num evaluated instead could used simple expression one comparing equality proper check num num would done needed would considered bool mind mean time moreover let introduce new sign take value num num num pretty handy imagine spaceship operator c want std well already compare spaceship operator fun declaration would currently following one sign operator const std lh const std rh num evaluated spaceship operator even exist could declared operator way sign operator const std lh const std rh operator would handled three way comparison could still used perform following check still able check lexicographically superior needed str1 str2 something old error handling exception part applies old language thing exist c example look c standard library posix one see sure function num successful integer otherwise sadly seen people kind thing define num would mean success something think think programming often following reasoning pattern something work yes ok one case handle many case handle think would made sense put neutral num yes c function work value solve many case however programming language know except maybe experimental esotheric language yes evaluates condition case evaluate many situation work represents one case work represents many probable cause think way num evaluate rest would made much sense conclusion conclusion essentially original question design language num value taking account example maybe think follow nice see many answer many idea many possible reason like love passionate seem originaly asked question boredom since seem passionate decided go little ask rationale behind boolean choice num num math se
