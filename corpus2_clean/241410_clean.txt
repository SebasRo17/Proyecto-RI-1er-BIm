earlier today come idea based upon particular real use case would want checked usefulness question feature fair chunk applied language running inside vm maybe even outside real us nothing language specific please read mostly pseudo idea make unit testing less cumbersome adding way based human interaction codebase understand go principle tdd think anyone ever proved tdd better first creating test may even adapted fit tdd current goal show intended used copy one class need make unit test public implement private final private final public final final argument argument override public boolean final player player object player player hand hand player field field player getfield hand field field hand get instanceof override public performaction final player player object player player throw new hand hand player field field player getfield field hand play observe need following test constructor test valid constructor test invalid input test valid test invalid input performaction test valid performaction test invalid input idea mainly focus test invalid input writing test fun need ensure number condition check whether really return extended performaction exception need thrown case goal idea generate test indicating gui ide hopefully want generate test based specific branch implementation example num user click generate branch hand num tool need find case hold added relevant may clutter post ultimately num invalidate branch tool need find hand condition hold num need construct player hand capacity least num num notice capacity private hand need least num num search way set num fortunately find constructor take capacity argument us num num work need done succesfully construct player instance involving creation object constraint seen inspecting source num found hand least capacity possible able construct num invalidate test need set num num construct test asserts returned branch tool need work order properly need ability scan source including jdk figure constraint optionally could done javadoc always used indicate constraint could also trial pretty much stop cannot attach source compiled class need basic knowledge primitive type including array need able construct form modification tree tool know need change certain different order get correct testcase hence need list possible way change without using reflection obviously tool replace need create tailored unit test test kind condition certain actually work purely used test method invalidate constraint question creating tool feasible would ever work obvious problem would tool useful even useful automatically generate testcases could extended even useful thing chance project already exist would reinventing wheel proven useful still possible make thing still consider fun considered useful might make open source project depending time people searching background information used player hand class example please refer repository time writing uploaded repo yet done done unit test
