wrote application test performance evolutionary algorithm application performs algorithm consists several generation produced application look like text file containing metadata folder containing experimental text file containing specific statistic snapshot algorithm written never changed want examine application read metadata file open directory read rest fine recently hundred thousand file ran inodes system also loading copying extremely slow even though gigabyte seems fragmented since file quite small application written c us qt library filesystem operation using system header issue tar command archive writing un archive reading found tar must read entire archive find content problem since save operating memory time sometimes load sometimes considering change format would one file would something like table content beginning followed file concatenated table content would indicate beginning end concatenated file however sure good solution since std ifstream use read file cannot make random jump beginner programmer want waste lot time developing something would work ask advice solve problem
