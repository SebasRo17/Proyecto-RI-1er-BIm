trying solve electrodynamics problem numerically using b spline basis function please ask really wanna know assignment using following code successfully plotted b spline basis function two dimension given specific knot sequence respective x interval knot plot evaluate table bsplinebasis knot x evaluate table bsplinebasis knot x corresponding plot look like enter image description trying second derivative b spline using following code knot plot evaluate table bsplinebasis knot x x evaluate table bsplinebasis knot x however work produce empty graph lot red error message tried several combination table evaluate operator nothing seems work wrong
