symbolically calculate variance following random walk mathematica given several discrete random variable p z k p k small real number p z p random walk sum x sum limit z expectation given mathbb e x sum limit mathbb e z sum limit tp k p p k p would like calculate variance random walk var x tried using empiricaldistribution accept symbolic value edit bit research mathematica documentation found function tranformeddistribution since random walk unit step thought maybe distribution obtained bernoulli like transformeddistribution formalx k formalx distributed bernoullidistribution p could someone please show use calculate var x someone comment said variance x sum variance z point calculate e zi z tranformed bernoulli distribution like attempted
