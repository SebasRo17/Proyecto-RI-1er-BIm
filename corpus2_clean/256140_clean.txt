trying work string trying use c paradigm vector device name parsing matching po entry want sort final list attempt sort final list seem thinking want sort character item list illustrate struct d match vector positive match vector negative match bool include unspecified typedef struct d match d match d make match d match match const match config vector tmp tmp reserve num split tmp match config num num match positive match reserve match negative match reserve auto st tmp st num match negative match push back st num st size num match include unspecified num else match positive match push back st match include unspecified num sort intf list faster runtime lookup runtime search costly might convert hash match negative match size num sort match negative match begin match negative match end match

possible reason going map based algorithm amazing num generate many competing message arg differentiate operation called vector v vector naively assumed invoke operation would need use specifier like auto bracket particular element apparently clue stick appreciated
