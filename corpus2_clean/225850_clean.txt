trouble coming suitable way navigate set star coordinate coordinate system goal display within given range horizontal coordinate display square num degree length direction thought binning star cluster sufficiently large small enough equal right display one bin time display one display showing center bin four display showing point connecting adjacent bin binning simple navigate bin order select right one display appears problem around many bin touch application written c microcontroller resource memory cpu time limited coordinate read sd card format may custom algorithm imposes constraint fine additional thought tile divide sphere bin also constant necessarily equal size generated together lookup structure insertion time important structure used finding right bin change runtime loaded sd card ram startup word missing tile gamedev sx tile tag question answer look another one digging gamedev tile tag reveal lot could use coordinate also look like familiar enough underlying theory come suitable solution another idea add information adjacent bin bin display view moved scan neighbour find next one display centered think similar graph decentralized
