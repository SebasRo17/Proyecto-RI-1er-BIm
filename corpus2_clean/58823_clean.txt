dealing function finite number variable among operation wish differentiate repeatedly respect variable function happens defined term unknown function depends proper subset variable would like tell mathematica e purpose differentiation unknown function independent number variable following minimal example show trying failing f supposed function whereas g defined term f function x g x f f x f f x nonconstants f g x nonconstants f f g x nonconstants f f nonconstants f g x nonconstants f f nonconstants f x f x nonconstants f assume f infinitely continuously differentiable whence mixed partial commute hence second term absent could try substitute comprehensive rule test whether variable f depend appear v v defined f v nonconstants f however wonder whether perhaps simpler way thanks advance
