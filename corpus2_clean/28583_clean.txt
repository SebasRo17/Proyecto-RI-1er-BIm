long set equation mostly obtained introducing physic related quantity stand kind temporary variable eqns lx log en xmax lx nmu en fem xmax exp xmax fmu xmax exp xmax cic fem nmu fmu en cic equation variable would like eliminate variable except en obtain solution form en tried solve reduce eliminate tried taking pairwise etc result equation pair whole system mathematica run ever example work expected eliminate eqns lx giving log en xmax trying one eliminate eqns lx xmax return result imho make sense looking around stackexchange one find mathematica least v hidden rd argument elimination solve eqns xmax lx give warning lx proper domain specification lx used elimination unfortunately trying trick three equation solve eqns fem lx xmax return empty list would like see rule fem expressed term en please help remember older version solve used flexible like universal tool solving particularly equation solving case divided usage solve eliminate reduce etc also clear neither help tutorial mostly since simple example used illustration word expert subject welcome
