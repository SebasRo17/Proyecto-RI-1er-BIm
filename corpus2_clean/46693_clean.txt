suppose camera need measure speed ball tennis ball usually speed ball measured doppler effect pulse difference reveals speed want measure speed ball image mathematica suppose sec shutter speed would measure largest speed ball mathematica different method image difference method shoot two picture second interval difference image get length travelled delta delta l get speed range simply use mathematica image difference ii long shutter time method glow ball like light painting use fire ball glow ball light ball get one photo long shutter time black room ball glowing measure length glow certain time programmatically task measure length flight path iii motion blur method camera experience motion blur fast ball user suggested motion blur method could understand perhaps sharpen use method two test image ball travelled meter frame iv method get speed ball image video
