one year ago discovered wpf technology developed little application first experiment compare content two different directory content directory shown different datagrid time develop application using mvvm pattern experiment good worked much experience wpf design pattern proud work want rewrite application improving following recommended mvvm pattern actually designed application way mainmodel common algorithm mainview unique view application datagrids show result algorithm mainviewmodel take care handling connection two viewmodels mainmodel mainview one viewmodel datagrid way separate behavior two datagrids mainmodel contains algorithm used search file given directory like public mainmodel public mainmodel public list result getfiles mainviewmodel instantiate viewmodel viewmodel datagrid using property public mainviewmodel public mainviewmodel new new public get set public get set wanted apply design pattern help manage application like factory builder template think suitable application different usage condition design pattern sure design know correct implementation mvvm pattern promotes loose coupling high cohesion help design mine correct implementation mvvm correct one opinion thank
