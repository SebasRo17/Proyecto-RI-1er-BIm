bugging much ignore anymore interact notebook dynamic content example moving slider mathematica regularly brings open notebook window front mean interacting given notebook notebook already opened background pop front either blocking view staying lower left corner minimized focus changed still interact content original notebook back continue manipulation front notebook disappears reappear second later extremely annoying happens manipulate dynamic content contains something computationally expensive sjoerd comment confirm mostly complex plot manipulated directly e g rotate mouse indirectly mouse driven slider change parameter dynamic plot example rotating following figure mouse cause behaviour present plot sin x x reproducibility occasional sometimes happens fairly frequently sometimes less solid way reproduce error open fresh mathematica open new notebook e g ctrl n one pop front notebook window open another notebook paste code evaluate code dragging plot trigger glitch rarely bring front application e g firefox though glitch could happen even application running get back mathematica e g minimizing firefox dragging plot around time sec high chance trigger glitch manifest short jump open mathematica window one get front fraction second anyone else experience annoyance cause behaviour still reproducible mathematica window
