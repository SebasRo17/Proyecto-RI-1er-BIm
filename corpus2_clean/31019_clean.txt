split color class pixel image load mathematica would output like class name class name class name percentage refere amount pixel image colour class definition class would something like class name pixel rgb range colour example dark green light green tried code like image list dominantcolors imagefile n imagesize know split output class encreasing value n better precision right would love also plot normal distribution pixel x axis lie name class axis normalized scale go plot look similar enter image description possible would execute computation gpu cpu gpu togheter would like chose opencl cuda version code possible would code optimized perform computation core thread cpu p used example three class actually would like choose number class prefer every time run code
