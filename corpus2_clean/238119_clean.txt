given num string s1 s2 simple equality check considered n calculating algorithm efficiency using brute force approach rotated substring question efficiency n num take 2nd substring rotate num check repeat till rotation strlen matched however dictionary lookup considered num instead used dictionary sole element dummy key s1 instead compare checked existence s2 dictionary wouldnt complexity go n intuitively doesnt make sense guessing one assumption incorrect
