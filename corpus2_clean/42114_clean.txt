question example integral using assuming assumption give different result integrate co n x x pi assumption element n integer sin n n assuming element n integer integrate co n x x pi integrate co n x x pi assumption element n integer sin n n let clear system cache restart kernel like try different order clearsystemcache fresh start assuming element n integer integrate co n x x pi integrate co n x x pi assumption element n integer make thing even weird result affected order two version evaluated clearly due caching return different result always assumed using assuming assumption built function equivalent seems true imagine integrate us something internally e g refine affected global assuming assumption generally assuming assumption equivalent result quoted bug edit artes michael noted comment explained daniel lichtblau remaining worry result cached effectively depend order evaluation
