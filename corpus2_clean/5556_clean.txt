always wondered could start ndsolve intermediate time step mean code sample run solution tmin tmax realize solution converged yet could change tmin proceed larger tmax case solution coverges attains steady state example tmax often solve th order nonlinear pdes ndsolve take minute complete run long time million time step realize solution converged yet presumed working example change tmin tmax previous run change tmax larger run tmin tmax sol ndsolve u x u x x x u x u sin u u tmin tmax x plot evaluate u x sol tmin tmax x plotrange
