august discovery diameter rubik graph wanted make way visualize rubik graph since time vertex graph feasible store whole thing however cayley graph group generator regular given vertex v graph neighborhood n v generated using roman maeder wolfram demonstration project basis tried make way visualize graph one neighborhood time starting graphicscomplex solved operation twist simple enough operate rubik cube solved state transformed one front twist want construct graph display neighborhood namely configuration rubik cube reached r l f b u operation edge corresponding operation look like rubik cube first twist would like three thing given configuration v would like display n v edge looking like graphic make interactive click one configuration neighborhood output display cube object rotated part would nice necessary would go
