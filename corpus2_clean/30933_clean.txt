trying model rocket launch mathematica run little problem since know turn thrust using newton law universal gravitation plus added term rocket thrust trying find position function time code far basic stage moment constant mass drag added plus thrust never stop biggest concern right gravitational constant g mass earth rocket astronomicaldata earth mass rocket thrust radius earth r astronomicaldata earth radius numerical solution modelling gravitation interation earth launching rocket note rocket mass change time also add drag soln ndsolve x g x x z g x z z g z x z x z r x z x z maxsteps method stiffnessswitching rocketplot parametricplot x z soln axeslabel x z anyone know conditional statement used inside ndsolve thrust stopped certain position time help would appreciated cheer guy
