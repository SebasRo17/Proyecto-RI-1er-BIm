seen lot legacy system work function go something like bool todo cond1 lot cond2 todo todo word two part first part sort processing potentially containing loop side effect etc along way might set todo flag second part executed todo flag set seems like pretty ugly way thing think case actually taken time understand could refactored avoid using flag actual anti pattern bad idea perfectly acceptable edit first obvious would cut two method however question whether ever need modern oo language create local flag potentially setting multiple place using later decide whether execute next block
