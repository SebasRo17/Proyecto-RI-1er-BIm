situation would develop num project node j development environment p1 p2 p1 required development two simple module mod1 mod2 stored p1 lib one module resolve find external dependency p1 node module necessary dependency p1 installed folder via npm image want reuse mod1 p2 doubt come could copy mod1 p2 lib replication even consider option p2 reference mod1 p1 require project dir p1 lib mod1 good option way p2 would depend p1 put mod1 higher level directory using node path p1 p2 resolve require mod1 however deploying also deploy higher level directory seems bit dirty would like treat mod1 npm module easily installed project environment however particular case publish module npm cause project specific could create private npm repository put mod1 inside gist would set order accessed also production worth putting together node module external library would great since module required like require module also seems quite dirty sure npm link would work deploying creates symbolic link followed commiting via git svn npm install production also install linked module none quite satisfies know one suitable guy suggestion preferred way structure private library easily reused project
