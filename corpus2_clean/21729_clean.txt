suppose long list cartesian coordinate defining distribution random point space could remove point inside sphere radius sphereradius located coordinate spherelocation x z boolean subtraction probably trivial found useful info mathematica maybe trivial generalisation arbitrary closed surface instead sphere hole defined deformed sphere holelocation x z hole theta phi holelocation radius theta phi sin theta co phi sin theta sin phi co theta theta phi usual spherical coordinate
