would like know whether general approach obtain compact form equation mathematica used believe fullsimplify command would recently found necessarily give compact form found following equation fullsimplified left sec alpha left coth left l sqrt text bo co alpha right text csch left l sqrt text bo co alpha right text bo l r sin alpha r sin alpha sqrt text bo sec alpha right right left r sqrt text bo sec alpha right inputform convenience eq sec coth l sqrt bo co r sqrt bo sec sin csch l sqrt bo co bo l r sin r sqrt bo sec however run following collect eq bo fullsimplify get much compact form namely tan alpha l sin alpha sqrt text bo sec alpha text csch left l sqrt text bo co alpha right frac tanh left frac l sqrt text bo co alpha right r sqrt text bo co alpha someone explain get compact solution first collect equation certain parameter run fullsimplify whether general recipe get compact form equation p sorry long equation seems smaller equation behaviour make sort intuitive sense
