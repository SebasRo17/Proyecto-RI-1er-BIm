experimenting eigenfaces algorithm note experimental data collected mathematica notebook result experimental run table score smallest score corresponds best match facial signature database example test run match three unclassified face image database contains nine signature produce x list score like following display tableform make easier read would like add column header resulting table column headed image generated signature column database likewise would like add row header row headed face image generated row score added coolness would nice highlight minimum row somehow output rendering different color suspect mathematica loss exactly suggestion update example output formatted using accepted answer example
