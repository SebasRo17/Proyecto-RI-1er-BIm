coming oop background learning scala readily see advantage using immutable object individually hard time seeing one design whole application like give example say object represents material property designing game actually really problem like water ice would manager owns material instance one property would freezing melting point material freeze edit material instance singleton kind like enum want water say freeze ice 0c ice say water 1c water ice immutable cannot get reference constructor parameter one created first one could get reference yet existing constructor parameter could solve giving reference manager query find material instance need every time asked freezing melting property get problem manager material need reference provided constructor one either manager material cannot immutable way around problem need use functional programming technique pattern solve
