stacked partial differential equation follows latex expression equation frac partial partial frac partial x partial x left frac cosh x right x x mathematica code equation specific eq x x x x cosh x x x boundary initial condition bc bc ic x exp x exp solve plot ndsolve eq bc bc ic x x precisiongoal plot evaluate x x axeslabel style x italic style italic result look like enter image description qualitatively expect explained equation fixed point depending upon parameter may either solution like one shown image interested system behavior fixed point intermediate step interest reason plot result expecting solution already close enough fixed point let u check conversion obtained solution simplest way look evolution enter image description conclusion see far non converging checked output type showing non convergence seems time duration however solved equation comsol nicely converges small number time step five technical reason would nevertheless prefer solved mathematica rather whatever else question see workaround
