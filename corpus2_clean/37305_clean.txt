looking find average path length random graph following degree distribution vertex degree included done finding mean global clustering coefficient straightforward way mean globalclusteringcoefficient randomgraph degreegraphdistribution job quite well globalclusteringcoefficient way get average path length random graph intuition using graphdistance work per vertex basis work need complete graph else calculates distance infinity
