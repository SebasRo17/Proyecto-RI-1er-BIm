know abstract signal switch electronics underneath easy way visualize step assembling machine example open binary file notepad see textually formatted representation machine assume byte symbol see corresponding ascii character binary still part puzzle though missing even explain exactly seen assembler source written c obviously us c library put getc write function etc actually generate machine go assembly binary going behind scene mean c c language essentially binary signal switch key mouse press guess assembling really organizing byte structure logical hardware
