trying make program measure complexity specific program respect time let take problem problem possible way respect time complexity let say write specific problem n log n n log n n num record time case make scale value measure time complexity solution like num n num num m num log n num num m etc time num m program say given solution time complexity order n problem whenever program using ubuntu command time get different time time huge range num num happening make efficient scale import io p ef public static file extension po num extension num substring po num file num substring num po lang num num c c num try process compile switch extension case c compile runtime getruntime exec gcc g num file lang num break case c compile runtime getruntime exec g g num file lang num break case compile runtime getruntime exec javac num lang num bufferedreader new bufferedreader new inputstreamreader compile readline system println compile time warning system println readline system println double starttime time process lang num starttime system nanotime runtime getruntime exec file time system nanotime starttime double math pow num num else starttime system nanotime runtime getruntime exec file time system nanotime starttime double math pow num num system println runtime time m bufferedreader new bufferedreader new inputstreamreader getinputstream bufferedreader new bufferedreader new inputstreamreader readline system println runtime system println readline system println else readline failed num file f new file file txt bufferedreader br new bufferedreader new filereader f equal br readline failed num readline br readline failed num equal failed num break failed num system println failed system println either wrong according given format system exit num else system println submission successful catch ioexception e system println occured e printstacktrace system exit num time enter image description
