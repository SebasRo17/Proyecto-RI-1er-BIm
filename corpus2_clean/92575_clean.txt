big project working couple year control everything application advanced device heart firmware device quite advanced different functionality could say memory num handled one huge executable one hand program quite maintainable well modularized inside properly documented reasonable separation functionality directory file end get clustered one application everything remote database communication touchscreen handling handling dozen various communication protocol measurement several control algorithm video capture sunrise time date easter seriously needed serious purpose general stuff thinly related often related trickle far module could done several separate executables communicating say socket specific purpose maybe loaded unloaded needed specific reason made way one hand work work okay project simple without maintaining build multiple binary internal structure easier call read instead talking socket shared memory hand size scale thing creep feel like titanic always taught modularize everything one gargantuan file feel wrong one problem know heavy crash one even insignificant module crash quality assures really happen release version otherwise internal separation defensive programming assures still mostly correctly even half internal module fail normally reason danger overlook creep irrational fear unknown making serious big project way accepted practice either calm fear give good reason refactor version num multiple smaller binary
