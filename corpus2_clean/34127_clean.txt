function two variable f r x c r x variable c constant appears function would like write product two function f r c time f x c set c use fullsimplify automatically give function form f r f x however assumption c provided c fullsimplify work based physic problem trying solve reason believe able write function form f r x c f r c time f x c command procedure mathematica separate functional dependence given function two variable
