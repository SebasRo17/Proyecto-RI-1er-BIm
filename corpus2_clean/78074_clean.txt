know correctly subset sum problem np complete n integer given target sum number sum target possible problem solved polynomial time dynamic programming construct table n x take case like say last number surely included target becomes n case last number included target remains becomes size n num hence way keep reducing size problem approach correct complexity n polynomial belongs p also np complete hear p np surely missing something loophole reasoning thanks
