dna fluid assumed single component perfect gas e obeys equation p rt thermal conductivity assumed constant equation ndsolve g x g x u x x g x u x g x u x u x x g x te x x g x te x g x u x te x x g x te x u x x te x x x te x te te g x x u x u u g x te x u x x ran code got warning message ndsolve ndsz ndsolve eerr checked equation time think correct initial boundary condition also simple seems reasonable least perspective physic wrong well tell truth really want ask ndsolve lack ability solve system partial differential equation oh someone may feel strange boundary condition g x found four boundary condition necessary solving equation though know exact reason found time trial set g x constant
