working api add update item list ordered priority field set need contiguous must positive integer updating list member expensive operation want minimise number update want algorithm minimise number update required list reordered e worst case scenario use contiguous priority starting num e g priority item num num b num c num num e case move item e top list every single item would need priority updated naive solution though implement large number priority put priority half way interval two item item need placed e g priority item num num b num c num num e case move e top one update required set priority num issue act like binary search even case using starting number order num num take num operation priority could become contiguous better algorithm existing one use found via google someone suggest improvement
