two set point say randomreal b randomreal wanna find first n pair shortest distance two set current approach form nearestfunction first list map second say n f nearest c flatten f b get result n transpose c b ordering norm c b n output st pair nd pair rd pair question efficient way finding shortest distance pair two set mathematica edit actual case want determine intersection two shape manifold analytic form shape available compute point shape numerical process ndsolve want use enough many point approximate shape use intersection like operation find point lay approximately shape number point large eg point may high dimensional space eg excuse crippled english greatly appreciate suggestion thank much
