built method find shortest path two vertex graph question finding shortest path two vertex gathered quite bit attention path simple repeat vertex shortest path pair vertex number simple path two vertex huge would nice clean method finding simple path two vertex assume input graph undirected simple may cycle interested number simple path want explicitly enumerate furthermore note problem cannot solved polynomial time even writing output might take time polynomial number vertex one way listing simple path use depth first search maybe depthfirstscan useful dfs avoid repeating vertex marking visited recursion removing mark returning recursive call learned backtracking solution might fast
