written system calculates discount shopping cart based set rule rule implemented following interface c interface irule bool isactive bool cart decimal cart concrete implementation might look something like rule irule bool isactive bool cart isactive cart decimal cart cart 0m cart trying introduce logging system keep thing clean want jam rule thought make decorator irule handle logging irule irule bool isactive isactive issue running rule actually call isactive method happens decorator simply passed nothing logged suppose could make subclass rule would mean would make variant every irule implementation could potentially cause lot duplication could also put logging base use pattern want log anything num num time want log anything method called many many time worth potential overhead neither solution seems particularly elegant struggling find better alternative suggestion
