suppose long expression character contains mixture real imaginary term e g x g p q v c f g p q v c g h p q v c g h p q v b g p q v w g p v x sqrt g p v c f g p v c g h p v sqrt g p q v g f q v etc would like seperate real imaginery term work real term using complexexpand x targetfunctions keep getting message memory available mathematica shut try quitting application retry better way discard imaginary term group real term together without problem
