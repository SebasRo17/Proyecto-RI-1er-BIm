post extremely long apologize please bear explanation context question due long code included hyperlink see text look mathematica make everything easier read understand might help familiar classical control modelling first let explain trying writing problem automate solution control system assignment success question one two trouble completing question three code work inside manipulate trying explain detail first worth looking assignment question one question one succesfully modelled question two enter image description question two succesfully modelled problem lie first part question three enter image description question three problem lie going include image hand written solution part hand written solution question one enter image description hand written solution question two enter image description hand written solution first bit question three enter image description actually written mathematica code successfully calculates value k code embedded single manipulate let start introducing previously written code background actual code question first let u create block transfer function block b gain connect series gain ol expression call olblockab feed back upon gain cl expression clblockab blocka transferfunctionmodel blockb transferfunctionmodel k olblockab systemsmodelseriesconnect blocka blockb transferfunctionmodel k k systemsmodellabels none none feed back upon get closed loop representation clblockab systemsmodelfeedbackconnect olblockab transferfunctionmodel k k systemsmodellabels none none see thus far well old mathematica code consistent handwritten solution point copied pasted within transfer function gain normal algebraic expression use command mathematica expanded denominator k k expanddenominator k k reason need compare equation standard form equation standard form equation enter image description assignment actually give u value sqrt zeta hence set two equation standard form equation need one two equation equate numerator denominator solve system zeta omegan think called damping ratio natural frequency system control system term code wrote n solve subscript omega n k sqrt subscript omega n fullsimplify k subscript omega n match handwritten solution well question actually start thought put everything done single manipulate function input value b c work everything started programming manipulate work get question part one link page control website building download notebook code reformatted page manipulate column student number row b c g subscript g b c subscript c pi subscript c pi b subscript c pd subscript c pd c tf g tf transferfunctionmodel subscript g unit step time function g outputresponse tf unitstep step response g plot imagesize bode plot g bodeplot tf imagesize gain block k kblock transferfunctionmodel k open loop g k combo gsolblock systemsmodelseriesconnect tf kblock closed loop g k kg combo gsclblock systemsmodelfeedbackconnect gsolblock expression compare row fractionbox k superscriptbox subscriptbox omega n superscriptbox zeta subscriptbox omega n superscriptbox subscriptbox omega n denom fullsimplify subscript g k subscript g k expand denominator function denom denom expanddenominator solve k row nom numerator denom k subscriptbox omega n superscriptbox row nom nom k subscriptbox omega n superscriptbox re solve sqrt nom subscript omega n subscript omega n row spec subscript omega n re specific value subscriptbox omega n row given condition zeta sqrtbox stigma sqrt row denom denominator denom superscriptbox zeta subscriptbox omega n subscriptbox omega n superscriptbox row denom denominator denom superscriptbox fractionbox sqrtbox subscriptbox omega n subscriptbox omega n superscriptbox row denom denominator denom superscriptbox sqrtbox subscriptbox omega n subscriptbox omega n superscriptbox row denom denominator denom funct sqrt spec spec row denom denominator denom funct funct solve k b c guess question implement method previously solving k current example sorry made shorter copied pasted code reformatted fresh notebook went crazy loop exit kernel take look notebook also going provide screenshots output manipulate function see state play value variable b c handwritten solution enter image description enter image description enter image description enter image description enter image description apology extremely long post find hard getting head around got stuck point hope someone know move forward many thanks made reading far cheer
