believe question best illustrated simple example run functioninterpolation nintegrate b b get error form nintegrate inumr integrand b evaluated non numerical value sampling point region boundary guess mathematica evaluating expression plugging value trying interpolate admittedly code yield apparently correct result could turn error message done like address root cause possible correct way trying would spit error message first place
