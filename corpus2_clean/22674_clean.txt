apology advance title vague really sure call function call foo generates largeish polynomial natural make variable x x x get polynomial e g x x x like store function bar x x x foo whatever work course variable e g x x x etc instead could bar x x x foo whatever would work figured replacement rule would work e g rule x toexpression tostring x tostring look like work x x x rule give output x x x define bar x x x foo whatever rule bar output x x x instead obviously something really understand way mathematica handle variable name trying fix probably naive better way get around problem thanks advance help
