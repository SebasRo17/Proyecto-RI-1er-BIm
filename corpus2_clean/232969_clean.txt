currently learning design pattern think people would agree pattern great tool used moderation answer everything using much would complicate application little benefit pattern used best solution help creation good solution agree mind book reading head first design pattern frequently emphasizes importance loose coupling loose coupling following principle program interface implementation encapsulate varies basically pattern learned far exist mostly allow design loosely coupled thus flexible understand importance benefit loose coupling question much effort one actually invest creating loosely coupled flexible design oppose design pattern say cost using pattern often outweighs benefit invest lot time creating loosely coupled design using pattern reality loose coupling programing interface implementation principle might actually important like know much effort actually put creating additional level abstraction design allow application follow oo principle loose coupling interface etc really worth much effort put
