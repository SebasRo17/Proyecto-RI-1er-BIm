multinormaldistribution also single xy point would like able calculate probability point given multinormal distribution also plot ellipse probability point around mean distribution far defined multinormal xy distribution like bvn multinormaldistribution also fixed point xy plane previously thanks help user ubpdqn karsten previous question approached essentially two tailed gaussian integral normal distribution make multinormal distribution gave probability inside square represented visually plot pdf bvn x x plotrange meshfunctions mesh xl xu yl yu enter image description realize square exactly want instead want define ellipse constant probability around mean consistent xy point ubpdqn suggested several approach performing integration square including nintegrate pdf bvn x x xl xu yl yu reg implicitregion xl x xu yl yu x nintegrate pdf bvn x x element reg attempted modifiy implicit region becomes ellipse centered mean multinormal distribution bounded xy point like xl yl xc yc reg implicitregion x xc xl yc yl x nintegrate pdf bvn x x element reg although yielding sensible answer clear something wrong anyone could suggest modification approach would grateful
