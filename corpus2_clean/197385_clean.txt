sparse matrix contains several unknown size would like find highest peak consider matrix example num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num case would like get position num num num position num num num position num num num num num num num note consider num connected neighbour came solution scan pixel zero start flood fill pixel flood fill pixel zero keeping track maximum visited algorithm work well wondering faster solution target platform io access different vector processing framework like blas lapack provide function fast finding maximum vector matrix maybe one could implement faster solution help function
