pretty simple setup got cart cart item got many varying type product really boiled one thing even common ancestor instead decided simply create representation product contains information product needed make sale question come could handle three way see example say two type product widget gizmo two thing vastly different make sense inherit base num widget gizmo ability create cart item represent requires knowledge change require touch widget gizmo ideal obviously num create either widget gizmo would essentially factory pattern would require knowledge widget gizmo better num make change every kind product change remember change particular product must change factory still ideal murphy say forget num use something like controller glue action translate widget gizmo respectively really sort present problem num change need update product controller fact mix problem num must remember always maintain mapping something either side change however feel like job controller oriented dealing multiple type whereas feel wrong mix type model level num three see num would something yet consider one kind individual may happen suggest open comment missing something completely obvious feel free call moron point big moron like feeling stupid learning
