basically look like typedef set method revolve around typedef foo foo stuff registration stuff private typedef std map std std const std destination id static std const std message id called foo stuff thinking might clearer make little mini help logically separate method foo structure foo foo stuff registration stuff private struct public std map std std foo std const destination id private std std const message id foo stuff thing usually make derived class unless sake virtual method deriving standard container seems really weird overly concerned deriving standard container decorate method genuinely bad practice
