little bit debate coworker lately specifically using c could apply language nullable type say example represents maximum however maximum optional argue nullable number would preferable coworker favor use zero citing precedent granted thing like network socket often used zero represent unlimited timeout write dealing socket today would personally use nullable since feel would better represent fact timeout representation better require condition checking meaning none believe nullable conveys intent little bit better
