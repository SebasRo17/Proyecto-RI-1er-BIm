working bit turn based strategy game two class relevant question state immutable expose field either via getters another way felt appropriate state bit complicated decomposed several class package state command abstract immutable couple subclass like field field amount etc package command field public getters need one two method state command state state state apply command returning new state obtained applying command state using first look better first sight since dispatch different implementation subclass command unfortunately force fiddle many detail state command order make work need something like state builder many constructor state whatever using second look ugly force use instanceof ugly way simulate virtual dispatch otoh would concentrate working state think first way go command state package mean whatever get used building resulting state need public since friend real problem nice proper design
