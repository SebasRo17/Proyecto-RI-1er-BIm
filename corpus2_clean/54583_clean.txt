written small mathematica package contains module solves differential equation initial condition suppose solution differential equation defines function z want function return function z rule much ndsolve return rule evaluating function first naive attempt solveequation x xp x module z sol flatten ndsolve x x x x xp x x x x sol z return join sol symbol function symbol z function z correctly access value function rule solveequation x rule however call rule give x interpolatingfunction function z function z okay term human readability code used individual besides would much prefer x interpolatingfunction function z function z even better x interpolatingfunction x z way dependence function others made explicit possible achieve result somehow changing scoping variable need settle method work appears sloppy
