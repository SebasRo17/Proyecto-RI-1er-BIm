feel like common question find answer maybe using wrong terminology assumption id supposed unique across document attribute meant cs used j selector attribute appropriate id replacement since work element html num spec changed removed certain element think given something like page multiple widget widget unique id need able reference widget sub element like widgetid relative id unique within widget may duplicated outside scope using seems correct way
