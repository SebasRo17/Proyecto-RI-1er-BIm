short version cause passed expression evaluated prior passed parameter detailed version part standard committee discussion initiated general trying ban use iif general consensus want short length assignment okay reason want evaluate two expression try accomplish one explicitly purposefully evaluate expression seperate line call result else parameter asserting param1 expression stepped expression evaluated evaluated passed parameter asserted make sense sub dim integer num dim blnresult boolean iif num num integer tryparse num integer tryparse num num end sub expected blnresult conditional iif expression parameter resulting assignment else expression evaluated written order prior even stepping iif became num far concerned programatically expected result desired reverse side coin sub dim integer num dim blnresult boolean num num integer tryparse num integer tryparse num num end sub inverse previous issue expected blnresult conditional expression parameter resulting assignment case evaluated became num far concerned result desired programatically expected like see custom thing
