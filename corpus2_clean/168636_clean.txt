large project use maven build cycle one project used extensively project various application contained elsewhere honest bit mess various bit added different time specific purpose like clean bit also fully tested lot bit added without proper unit integration testing test take long time actually pas uh oh test switched maven build cycle uh oh thinking separating large project smaller specific project final sub project several sub project would pick various sub project would need thinking follows separate big project various sub project make clear project responsibility separating sub project clean testing sub project individually turn testing sub project maven build cycle slightly concerned impact might build time would imposing structure large project e smaller sub project slow also slight concern impact might editing time ides principally use intellij intellij seems build project turn dependency tree e c depends b depends change try build b unless compiles arguably advantageous found example change interface widely used b c take time fix error change another question use factory class aspect project depend external jar occasionally thankfully often updated migrate tend handle using factory point correct version external change implementation throughout base moment large project thinking switching sub project could develop new project implementation new external make sure sub project fully functional tested switch dependency factory user project however made complicated extensive use interface throughout large project example sub project contains interface sub project b depends interface old external jar sub project c depends b thus old external jar contains factory us b implementation interface need change external jar b create sub project b ii depends new external jar fully functional add c dependency b ii change factory use new implementation interface working remove c dependency original b desired remove sub project b sensible way going general question anyone experience breaking large project tip trick would willing share impact development build time advice could offer structuring break project
