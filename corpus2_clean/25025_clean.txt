simplest example change sought greek letter typed plaintext nu may replaced symbol expr nu kx ky expr nu yielding kxky however need make variable subscript correspond large number different subscript value many different possibility x k x one equation easy enough change couple variable visually comprehensible counterpart manually using method along subscript trouble finding efficient way mathematica take given kz output corresponding subscript k z output method achieving automatedly mathematica taking glance plaintext system equation would great thank edit talking bill briefly comment suggested upload example far hope accomplish array better way handle majority input even conjunction subscript time willing use examplary equation r signifies rate change z z rh coincidentally contains function bracket notation due use software r kf z mu z z mu kd z kd z r kf z mu z z kd z kd z r kf z mu z z kd z kd z see number option x k x f input rule easily manually however avoid confusion plaintext input form z x mathematica traditional single function notation would like change z x z x z subscript x regardless specific x however different value rather manually inputting rule less practical current goal simplify appearance allow symbolic manipulation parameter hope curve fitting eventually anyone advice approach scenario either via subscript array suspect possibly torules involved sure yet answered please see answer interested efficiently replacing symbolic expression another see comment answer
