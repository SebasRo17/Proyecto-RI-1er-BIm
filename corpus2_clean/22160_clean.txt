let say want minimize function us table named conjugate gradient method findminimum instinctively following findminimum sum co method conjugategradient obviously get following message result evaluation part partd part specification longer depth object evaluation part partd part specification longer depth object overcome little difficulty tried following findminimum sum co method conjugategradient evaluation part partd part specification longer depth object evaluation part partd part specification longer depth object obtain error message came dirty manner findminimum co co method conjugategradient time provided actual result last alternative work simple example table containing two value become impossible example findminimum sum co method conjugategradient sort aware might something wrong approach find another manner set
