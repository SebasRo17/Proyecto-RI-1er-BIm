frequency analysis encrypted plaintext tally character make basic task quite easy count number time character appears sorted alphabetically plaintext pre sanitized carry sort tally character plaintext nuanced cryptanalytic approach also want count frequency digraph pair adjacent character trigraph triple n graph tally still work fine original splitting task previously performed character slightly complicated want function ngraphlist ptstring string chunklength integer output list including repeat chunklength graph found ptstring chunklength function give identical output character okay problem really hard quick approach ngraphlist ptstring string chunklength integer table stringtake ptstring k k chunklength k stringlength ptstring chunklength thing drive crazy though seems like terribly easy string operation sort mathematica would able snap solution clunky find better idea documentation show different way smarter prettier way related clif question hint possible usage stream method know little subject look equally clunky
