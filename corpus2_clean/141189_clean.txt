study computer science called programming technique purpose teach u good oriented design principle semester homework program must write demonstrate learned lab assistant demand homework specific design pattern used example current homework application used processing customer order demanded use either factory abstract factory design pattern get even worse end semester must write program something complex must use least one creational pattern least one structural pattern least one behavioural pattern normal demand mean forcing u design program way specific design pattern make sense beyond consider ok car mechanic huge tool box use certain tool box situation demand less design application demand use abstract factory example implement sure yet senior lecturer agrees lab assistant demanding want talk need solid argument approach problem p sure must better way teach u thing maybe making u week read num design pattern next week giving u test small specific programming architectural situation problem goal test would identify design pattern would make sense could implemented way see understand edit homework num program quite lot requirement fairly complicated reason num num week deadline agree practicing best way learn smaller program application used something demonstrating purpose big program lot requirement class etc
