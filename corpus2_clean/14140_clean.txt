one annoying feature mathematica plot family extrapolation interpolatingfunction without warning sure discussed hell previously cannot seem find reference mathematica se know simply overcome problem defining global variable domain interpolation time time forget spend day figuring numerical error originate avoided plot give warning consider following example ode system defined integrated two different time range ode b b b b sol first ndsolve ode b sol first ndsolve ode b querying function value point outside range give correct warning sol interpolatingfunction dmval input value lie outside range data interpolating function extrapolation used done use function plot show plot b sol plotstyle thick red plot b sol plotstyle thick blue mathematica graphic tried force warning avail following example still drop warning return plot error interpolatingfunction dmval check plot b sol error interpolatingfunction dmval interestingly one sure interpolatingfunction dmval turned inside plot family following example loglinearplot able drop warning sampling domain ignored unrelated see post also seems fixed v drop warning sampling loglinearplot b sol interpolatingfunction dmval input value lie outside range data interpolating function extrapolation used even disturbing see plot check lower boundary upper thanks j comment plot b sol interpolatingfunction dmval input value lie outside range data interpolating function extrapolation used oleksandr pointed lower v upper bound first point v rest plot b sol interpolatingfunction dmval input value lie outside range data interpolating function extrapolation used question plot give warning extrapolating interpolatingfunction higher level consideration justifies behaviour higly annoying feature surely unexpected case maybe bug one force plot give warning workaround force interpolatingfunction dmval attenuated inside plot please note interested solution make sure use value integration plotting e defining global time variable want make sure plot never extrapolates without giving warning
