trying example trig modelling simple hoping use real data get weather data live make pretty reasonable sinusoid datelistplot weatherdata edmonton meantemperature month joined true weather data looking simple overlay actual sine graph period would year guessing midline would degree amplitude degree phase shift much math question mathematica question like said need trig regression least example want illustrate process student approximate b c general equation b sin c x show transformation function reasonably match data find plot reasonable overlay two graph also figured sunrise sunset time would better source data see anyway access mma though could get alpha yes non math major non mathematica expert lame question help appreciated okay help b gatessucks made progress though still value feedback help get weather data data weatherdata edmonton meantemperature month changed list numerical form first entry number second since jan newdata absolutetime data wanted graph reasonable number use example high school student got number second jan data start absolutetime subtract every entry time scale jan newdata newdata take divide number second year since like time axis represent year year newdata year newdata give plot list plot let write sin function using reasonable number note know fit intended visual exercise transformation sine function enter image description show listplot newdata joined true plot sin pi x x plotstyle dashed plotrange imagesize
