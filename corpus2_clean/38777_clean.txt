trying use mathematica solve coupled differential equation equation form begin equation ddot x il partial l jk dot x b dot x c b c end equation x x function constant vector happy set zero begin help get solution problem hand two coupled pdes x x time matrix jk given begin equation jk frac x x x begin pmatrix frac x x x x x x frac x x x end pmatrix end equation lastly matrix ad inverse matrix attempted solve using dsolve produced following code x x x x x x x x x x x x xdot xdot xdot xdotdot xdotdot inverse x x xdot xdot st xdotdot x xdotdot x xdot x xdot x x x qx qx system st st dsolve system x x fairly new mathematica produced code lot help friend code work fine simple example pdes coupled case get output dsolve e able solve understand coupled pdes much harder solve given x matrix hope doable thought trying use ndsolve get numerical solution since apparently mathematica good problem sure initial condition way get exact solution perhaps give approach bit thought hope explained problem well advice solution greatly appreciated thanks
