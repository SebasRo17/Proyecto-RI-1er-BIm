trying grasp new control system function mathematica like connect controller model model plant simulate behavior system define simple servo model servo statespacemodel x u x x u x x position servo u input voltage simple pid controller pid transferfunctionmodel assumed could link pid controller servo model using systemsmodelfeedbackconnect loop systemsmodelfeedbackconnect transferfunctionmodel servo pid system behave would expected input unitstep unitstep output outputresponse loop input plot input output plot lot overshoot pid optimized would expected p part controller would pull output target input eventually seems p factor scale input rather error
