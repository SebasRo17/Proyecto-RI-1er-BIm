first post hopefully figure formatting easily please forgive post ugly repeatable problem run code everything work fast output displayed program error erases kernel maybe correct term basically variable reset mathematica go back opened software context output secular variation model e e e e real piece exponential really zero except numerical error want chop however machine make dong sound standard mac error sound mathematica kernel reset would guess repeatable anyone else try well completely quit mathematica reopen copy paste block new window chop end result spit right answer step loop need variable stay defined reason someone see happening edit guess mathematica need real component exponential know though take bit use complexexpand chop give equivalent form sine cosine
