member stack overflow couple week answered question read others answer mostly c c learned thing example undefined behavior past knowing going inside cpu generation seemed defined worked expected understand conforming rule undefined behavior good even though know pc work without flaw however time got negative point answer involving using macro certain code make wonder among people strict rule example almost time talk macro people say use function instead understand function better many way many place macro fit macro frowned upon another example reason write simple find character get lot comment telling use prewritten function instead get negative point suggesting loop understand function standard library kind checking probably efficient general crime write simple specific case asking general mere example seems among user stack overflow defined written standard coding c c way accept saying bad saying learned lot thing made portable however almost thing turned much restriction thing like work computer encode character ascii think people always want possible computer bit much simpler faster know work computer know program would seems better solution completely portable one great code seems judged would get worst result code linux kernel implementation stl come g mesa3d implementation opengl look code eye flooded macro bitwise operation condemn programmer linux kernel would rather opengl library drop num possibly 16bit microprocessor occurred people stack overflow strict judging others code unlucky enough stumble upon minor edit master student robotics bachelor software engineering master project library kernel module project funded european union got offered phd subject writing software also fun num year familiar c c num year actively mean start programming yesterday update research found lot c programmer hate c lot c programmer hate c someone find beauty language maintains coding style mixture two find absurd however seems majority programmer either language hatred least extent longer see reason continuing argument came conclusion would write answer way see fit ignore everyone start throwing fit use vector something seth carnegie 7th comment however would put note bottom saying meant copy paste may lacking checking demonstrate blabla work necessarily easiest way legal stuff know like see eula
