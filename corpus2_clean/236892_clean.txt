creating scoring system competition somewhat obscure resembles olympics term high level structure therefore ask question term abstracted fictional version olympics since everyone relate degree assume following hierarchy class score event one sport e g num olympics etc one one per team per event calculated adding team particular event sport one element e g etc one one per team per sport calculated adding team particular sport element one round e g etc one one per team per element calculated adding team particular element scoring algorithm let call particular depends element round belongs example element double double double algorithm element double double double algorithm different algorithm even though parameter would seem eliminate overloading viable option element double time bool algorithm although seeking general architecture guidance specific question associate different method different element use interface inheritance overloading approach e various method located conceptually imagine element interface however make sense create different different element seem right feel like need kind lookup round pick particular depending element belongs sure would correct oriented way
