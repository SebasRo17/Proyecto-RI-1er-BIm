although question may entirely irrelevant sensed pattern programming language official implementation interpreted byte interpreted language like lua etc usually extremely lenient easy syntax generally less require developer explicitly write type source compiled language like c c pascal etc usually strict syntax generally type mostly require development time language whose official implementation jit compiled like c usually unique compromise two best feature modern compiled programming language like vala gnu implementation perhaps exception rule resemble syntax feature jit compiled language like c first question really relevant coincidence interpreted language easy syntax jit compiled one moderate syntax feature etc secondly coincidence like example feature implemented programming language say jit compiling
