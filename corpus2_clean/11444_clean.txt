suppose following list called mylist mylist would like split mylist run consecutive element placed sublist define two consecutive element real number differ second element either greater less first element although reality make sense second element greater first element actual application mylist list time e elapsed time second example system sampled every second time never move backwards least world result would like thinking splitby would appropriate application splitby list f split list sublists consisting run successive element give value f applied however looking documentation clear adjacent element defined mathematica information say splitby performs comparison adjacent pair element thus f use tried splitby mylist splitby mylist neither work splitby define separate slot first second element pair thanks time
