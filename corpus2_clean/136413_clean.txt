asked profile using tool jvisualvm couple implementation traveling salesman problem find minimum path visit given set city context algorithm analysis design graduate course taking consideration brute force approach algorithm wondering though best use tool instance jvisualvm analyze spatial temporal complexity algorithm algorithm spatial complexity n basically grows linearly number city n temporal complexity math issue playing bit referred tool hard time understanding use problem sure see method used time used one actual memory footprint regarded hint optimize seeing cpu actually used io access never occur program see actually learn something algorithm tool math referred concern using profilers analysis algorithm also put basic time recording capability embedded program maybe could use profiling tool better job thanks
