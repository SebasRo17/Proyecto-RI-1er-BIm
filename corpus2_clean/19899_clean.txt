first post stackexchange made mathematica notebook simulated data set day learn basic making different graph creating linear regression etc figured notebook created would able open notebook completely continue left previous session said model linearmodelfit data x x however type mo suggests model extend behaving typed say model bestfit get function form instead reloaded saved notebook model already defined input model bestfit output model bestfit simply without quote function would processed instead complaining case seems likely missing something simple saving reloading would allow completely continue left without first processing input order anyone know solution problem thank xslittlegrass nasser clarification dumpsave tell performs asking succinct way state question would save kernel state asked following link question copy pasting answer link xslittlegrass posted currently save kernel state restarting kernel previous state would need modify instantiate sort thing ruebenko true save full state kernel case may enough purpose save symbol definition context global whatever context interest done via dumpsave like dumpsave state mx global mx file generated dumpsave platform specific though using get later point reconstruct value stored symbol context saved get state mx stated already ruebenko generally fully reconstruct kernel state manage correctly account symbol defined affect computation depending circumstance may enough many practical purpose leonid shifrin also following mr shifrin step important note name file state mx whatever like chose mx specify location dumpsave command default saving document folder c user user document mx likewise use get command reloading mathematica moved file default document folder specify look mathematica fail find thanks everyone input
