attempting first time use mathematica serious linear algebra would like solve system equation form u n n f n b n expression u n n general form u n n f n delta n n f n n using nested table command easiest efficient way build matrix mathematica entirely sure large need make matrix result discretizing integral equation number row column many need get accurate solution guess could large x maybe linearsolve efficient enough handle sized system standard desktop pc parallelization automatic need something manually found solution going need feed solution another equation find quantity actually interested anything outset make life easier later apologize general nature question new ground sure general guideline practice best
