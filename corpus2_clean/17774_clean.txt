earlier today discussion representative premier support question asked past couple day seeking strategy deploy function securely without front end launch player pro kernel independently front front end neither conversation answer question produced solution good compiling function c code leaf problem function need deploy us high level mathematica function maybe readily compile choleskydecomposition identitymatrix linearsolve simplify yesterday made progress developing adapting solution procedural version choleskydecomposition identitymatrix least compile given anticipated use function maybe get away without using simplify would leave still needing procedural equivalent linearsolve mean compiling maybe simpler need mylinearsolve everything mathematica version interestingly conversation guy support suggested given limited nature wanted thought setting option linearsolve give reduced scope version linearsolve mathematica could compile specify option let explore typical use linearsolve current function look like c sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt linearsolve c symbolic processing imaginary number sparsearray object always square matrix c always vector usage always output real vector question anyone insight set option use linearsolve compile even possible note oleksandr answer inwhy mainevaluate used linearsolve compiled may bearing way forward come may still chance implement limited procedurally based procedurallinearsolve distant memory serf one use inverse square matrix problem addressable linearsolve might give specific way forward except mathematica implementation inverse fall list compilable function either found code calculating inverse square matrix even certain language probably follow logic port proceduralinverse function mathematica background take second question question creating procedurallinearsolve proceduralinverse seem like viable way go anyone tried kind thing succeeded anyone point direction resource solution could help
