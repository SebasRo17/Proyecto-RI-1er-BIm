working net num application performs rather expensive calculation two double returning double calculation performed one several thousand item calculation performed task threadpool thread preliminary test shown calculation performed would like cache n result cache full would like throw least often recently used item edit realized least often make sense cache full would replace result newly calculated one one would least often used immediately replaced next time new result calculated added cache order implement thinking using dictionary double would mini storing two double value store input cached result however would also need keep track result used last time think would need second collection storing information would need remove result cache getting full concerned constantly keeping list sorted would negatively impact performance better e performant way maybe even common structure unaware kind thing profiling measuring determine optimality solution
