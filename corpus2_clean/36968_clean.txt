plotting dataset listpointplot order give idea density point used opacity problem opacity point behind one another added multiple point overlap opacity added need way opacity overlapping point added minimal example listpointplot plotstyle directive pointsize opacity viewpoint infinity mathematica graphic first two point overlap completely thus opacity add latter two point overlap x differ z thus opacity add want get opacity first two point add well
