often see advice try make library independent yet reality never seem achieve b advice actually possibly realistic way example write 2d vector library use make 2d collision library build 2d physic library us 2d vector library 2d collision library seriously expected figure way make physic library depend num library likely eventually want able serialize deserialize physic collision mean want make depend serialization library another example library lot function think endswith str ending startswith str start whatever write templating library us library rarely seem able write new library use library could write interface write adaptor attempt decouple one library another unlikely performant often model different library mean even could decouple interface trying use different library one originally decoupled end impossible massively non performant original advice b way actually apply advice real world
