want solve matrix equation x x b using leastsquares method suited equation like x b matrix x b b b b b b b b b b x x x x x x x x x x b x update figure special type equation trying solve special case sylvester equation case look like x x b write form x x b c c consist item tried solve mathematica lyapunovsolve give zero trivial solution want check non trivial solution exists seems find test matrix b non trivial solution sure resultant equal solution exist mathrm resultant mathrm det e mathrm det b e tried real matrix example b maybe problem b matrix defined experimentally small error matrix resultant due erorrs know may close enough question write condition existence non trivial solution sylvester equation abstract form particular formula preferably mathematica also understand mathematica give trivial solution try solve equation parameter example tried bm b b b b b b b b b cm lyapunovsolve bm cm give also tried multiply matrix get equation solve function solve also give
