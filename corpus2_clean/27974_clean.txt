reason never entirely clear mathematica built takewhile function since version equivalent dropwhile function mean find periodically writing since function use fairly frequently like version fast robust also kind function write bunch way tested variant depend loop using scan throw using position version using position fastest found dropwhile list test po position list elt trueq test elt head false po fail drop list fail trueq slows thing bit match observed behavior takewhile take element long test function return true good way make function work faster
