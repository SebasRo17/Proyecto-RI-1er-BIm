straightforward integrate interpolatingfunction however even simple functional interpolatingfunction integrate return unevaluated ifun first u ndsolve u u u u u integrate ifun integrate ifun former integrate return real latter expression unevaluated second integral evaluated symbolically non mwe symbolically important solution pde two argument one would like integrate nintegrate work solution apply complicated functionals e g ifun solution applies functionals restricted certain family linear would still helpful
