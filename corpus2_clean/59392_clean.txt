bug introduced earlier persists least problem findroot killing kernel real application want findroot black box function containing ndsolve take list unequal length list input output goal find limit cycle forced system differential equation sometimes work time kill kernel run beep dead kernel message real example horrible minimal example f x vectorq flatten numericq sin x findroot f x x x loop almost assures failure mathematica mac idea fix whatever reason using single level list seems ok maybe solution
