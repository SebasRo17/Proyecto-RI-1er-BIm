recently thinking general exceptionhandler could initialize app context inject everywhere idea quite simple interface public handle exception ex according exception decide maybe log show alert message user maybe kill whole app question way write handler without lot instanceof unfortunately googling give default exception handler runtimeexception introduced num first idea create enum field exception appropriate execution point example concrete exception handler also implement interface public handle exception ex required casting already upd alex thought option reason felt ok us acces file simple copy local storage require three exception wrap malformedurlexception ioexception use num catching may result repeating three time handle e readable anyway think fault use num maybe suggestion best still doubt
