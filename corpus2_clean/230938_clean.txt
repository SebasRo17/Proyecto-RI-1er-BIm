currently binary tree template setup using string make question answer game using knowledge base work interface binary tree us access node binary tree class seems work fine inserting rearranging node necessary think design pretty bad usually best put node binarytree class file since neither independently useful even standard using binary tree make node nested inside tree sure use assuming bad design unless away knowledge base without knowledge base able see private node member able move current node pointer around tree question guess unless passed current pointer reference binary tree moved time also setup binary tree really anything except provide root node k base handling inserting rearranging differentiating question guess sure move traversal etc functionality btree without making bunch function call btree counterpart way use std swap file node tree base also without polluting utility header design look bad oo wise help appreciated
