last time asked use command discretewaveletpackettransform data filter spike detection got answer mostly based automatically defined threshold case crucial first define threshold distinguish real spurious data built function favorite developed version code use filter like haar would difference spike point filter work inherently pair number mathematica version using command problem read link given already use would great someone enhance code differentiate two consecutive spike data table sin x random x data data enter image description dwt discretewavelettransform data haarwavelet sigma mean ab dwt mean dwt lambda n sqrt log length dwt thresh lambda sigma shr c wind ab thresh c dwts waveletmapindexed shr dwt listlineplot inversewavelettransform dwts haarwavelet enter image description
