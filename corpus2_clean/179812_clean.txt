designing logic analyzer would like implement matrix algorithm several channel one represented row matrix every element column would state example channel num num num num num num num num num num channel num num num num num num num num num num channel num num num num num num num num num num would like detect pattern inside matrix example detect match bitmap inside matrix num num num num think accomplished testing element element think better way api way api arm optimized instruction would great also mandatory num matrix num num row num column approximately matrix fixed change every time scan constantly receiving need process 500ms less working arm platform dual core num 2ghz 1gb ram android num num thank much advance
