series hardware device connecting create path sanity checking make sure potential path valid intended properly need know device source path information everything set infer source following path backwards however first boot infer state send request parallel multiple device may get connection order trace connection back source know connection c exit yet aware b trace c back yet mean hard checking right add connection question sanity checking three option none entirely like num trust job right bad request made num try store source connection created skip straight source logic checking without tracing path backwards done theory afraid trust pathing logic say something source right source never change well logic inferring source connection come hardware generally seems potentially inelegant maintain num try sanity checking soon full path add b check b c good problem throwing exception device b report issue connection made device c seems confusing num make connection without validating sanity someone else charge sanity check path hooked immediately
