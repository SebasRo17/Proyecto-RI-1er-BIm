imagine system source need kept sync simple example model view binding mvc intend describe kind system source hub source publishing subscribing event hub relaying event source handling event source change state described event publishing event source put current state event source use information change state accordingly problem system event reflected hub source put system infinite async infinite sync example source b source h hub h reflection hub h b h reflection another source sync relatively easy solve issue compare current state event equal change state raise event async could find solution yet state comparison work async event handling eventual consistency new event published inconsistent state causing example x h b x go parallel b h x first change x state b change state b change x state change state eternity think algorithm solve problem solution possible extend prevent caused multiple hub multiple different event etc update think make work without lot effort think problem syncing multiple database distributed system think really need constraint want prevent problem automatic way constraint suggest
