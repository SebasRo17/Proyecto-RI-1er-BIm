wondering possible ask mathematica draw graph provided set vertex v v n v connected edge e e e length edge l l l explicitly specified obviously expect mathematica built semidefinite convex optimization package find approximate solution graph realization problem rather wondering possible utilize ball spring approach mathematica already us displaying arbitrary fixed edge length graph update response comment lot theory literature solving graph realization problem graph various topology recent focusing semidefinite convex optimization method however trying focus question specifically getting mathematica try ball spring minimization process realize graph provided specified topology set edge length certainly anyone know sdp solver graph realization implemented mathematica love hear however somehow doubt implementation exists
