like illustrate two variable function discontinuous zero function f x xy x unless x case f thought could draw plot mark two sequence point x n n say x prime n prime n converging f x n n f x prime n prime n converge different limit something like f x x x x p plot f x x show p listpointplot thread table n n table n n table f n n n dot barely visible like bigger blacker achieve
