please consider following zero data deletecases data zero head zero real integer understanding integer e g element real number e g would mathematica delete zero form data know one solve deletecases problem via deletecases rationalize data point edit following test may explain problem slightly better set integer real complex test table element j set j zero false true true true true true test return expected element integer real complex reason would expect deletecases data zero following result latter deleted data called delete integer whereas first case zero deleted called delete real note instead could use also value matter
