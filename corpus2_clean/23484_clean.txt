evaluating expression sinh x cosh x fullsimplify get cosh x indeed simplification case would want happen much complicated expression want simplify generally still wish stay sinh x cosh x circumstance wish change cosh x similar expression way explicitly tell mathematica use trigonometric relation use trivial cosh x sinh x none composed one preferably maybe switch disables sensitivity mathematica trigonometric relation entire notebook
