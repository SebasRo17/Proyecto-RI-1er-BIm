paired data x x n n download link represents frequency amplitude spatial object surface mesh quite lot cell data see histogramms x frequency amplitude z number cell specific frequency data bin range enter image description enter image description data get plotted visualize distinct spot sample surface different amplitude different color frequency dynamic happens arrayplot gridmatrixpair mesh false colorfunction pink gray aspectratio enter image description different frequency narrow amplitude range arrayplot gridmatrixpair mesh false colorfunction pink gray true white colorfunctionscaling false aspectratio enter image description wondering would solution show combined spatial frequency amplitude distribution one picture think something like rd picture picture actually dhistogram like picture bar height represents amplitude bar color frequency actually visualization data represent frequency lightblue darkblue amplitude lightred darkred color mixed according rgb represent mixture green probably good visual contrast data cover range need covererd one could also probably use simply rd picture project xy plane listplot think mm take amplitude z data starting point big overview mm looking tip right direction give good visual contrast range
