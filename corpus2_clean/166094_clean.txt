given fragment would like find shortest possible single contains fragment fragment overlap example fragment bcda abc following contains fragment made naive appending however better shorter employ overlap abc bcda looking algorithm problem absolutely important find strictly shortest shorter better looking algorithm better obvious naive one would try appending permutation fragment removing overlap would appear np complete started work solution proving quite interesting like see people might come add work progress question
