graphic table geometrictransformation cuboid rotationmatrix co sin pi pi boxed false followed documentation center page rotating cuboid along space curve make code creates stair spiral staircase want follow though would like understand everything typing researching primitive know cuboid b c e f creates cuboid corner b c opposing corner e f sure else going guess going make feel confident mathematica usage specific question table reading cannot make sense need code graphic creates image based upon primitive directive entered correct else know make sure understand primitive directive clearly table primitive graphic geometrictransformation primitive table cuboid rotationmatrix primitive geometrictransformation boxed directive graphic thing like b c parameter equation primitive correct sorry may read like riddle final question exactly geometrictransformation basically saying like rotate something cuboid axis shape helix vector matrix coming play read help much understanding
