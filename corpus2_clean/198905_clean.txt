planning stage making similar astyle uncrustify originally going contribute one project reviewing source led conclusion different design goal source written way make difficult outsider easily contribute astyle example instead building sort ast us num state variable etc deciding using scanner parser generator flex bison writing parsing system would better approach compiler university experience scanning parsing theory advantage thought generator arguably simpler faster develop possibly optimized initial stab custom parser though custom one might leave room improvement custom parser arguably easier programmer seems prefer custom lexers parser past question anyone want decent lexer use lex fewer dependency could possibly allow parsing since developing parser need nearly strict detailed one parallelization flex bison seen use global state want parse multiple file separate thread custom solution would simpler compartmentalize
