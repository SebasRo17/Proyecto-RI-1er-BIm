following coursera course algorithm came thought divide conquer algorithm closest pair problem want clarified per prof algorithm see interested given set point p two copy sorted x direction px py algorithm given px py num divide point left half q right half r form sorted copy half along x direction rx num let point p1 q1 num let rx p2 q2 num let delta minimum dist p1 q1 dist p2 q2 num unfortunate case let p3 q3 px py delta num best result clarification want related step num say beforehand suggesting barely improvement still interested read ahead prof r say since point already sorted x direction find best pair step num need iterate point strip width num delta starting bottom inner need num one think possible seemed little difficult explain plain text drew diagram wrote paper uploaded enter image description since one else came pretty sure thought literally thinking hour post head someone point going wrong
