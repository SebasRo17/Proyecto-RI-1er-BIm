writing interface hardware communication bus communication timing sometimes critical operation device common developer spin new thread handle communication also terrible idea whole bunch thread system case multiple hardware device may many many thread control application certainly common two thread per device one reading one writing trying determine pro con two different model think would love help programmer community num device instance get handle thread share thread communication device thread may exist writing one reading requested writes device api buffered worked writer thread read thread exists case blocking communication us call back pas read application timing communication handled communication thread num device given thread instead read write request queued buffered application call dowork interface allows read writes take place fire callback timing handled application driver request called given specific frequency pro item num include finer grain control timing communication level expense control whats going higher level application level real time system terrible pro item num include better control timing entire system application expense allowing driver handle business anyone experience scenario love hear idea approach used
