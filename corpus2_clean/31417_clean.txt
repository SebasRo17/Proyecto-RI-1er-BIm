new mathematica looking efficient way implement loop b c constant also using list loop possible implement nestlist able find example list used inside nestlist x tanh input b x c x yout append yout length input thanks sorry confusion tried simplify code sake brevity x tanh win input wres x wbias wout x yout append yout length input win wres wbias wout appropriately sized matrix loop part testing routine reservoir computing type machine learning help answer rewriting f wout tanh wbias win wres yout foldlist f x input try thanks help
