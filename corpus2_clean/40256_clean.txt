trying adapt nasser method using control variable inside manipulate selectively choose part code recalculated depending control changed also read previous note last version seems much simple something follow need functionality simulation working field line electric dipole simulation possible move two charge q q generating field also move third point p point p serf see field line passing p since single field line originating p different graphical parameter field line background field created two different streamplots fieldlines general field fieldpoint single line p combined together show command problem similar one addressed first link move point p want streamplot fieldlines electric field line recalculated streamplot fieldpoint dealing single line p contrary streamplots recalculated two charge generating field moved changed following nasser model come following example code intended simulation much complicated manipulate tick show f f grid q po slider dynamic q po q po f fieldlines q po q po f fieldpoint q po q po pt tick tick dynamic q po q po slider dynamic q po q po f fieldlines q po q po f fieldpoint q po q po pt tick tick dynamic q po pt slider dynamic pt pt f fieldpoint q po q po pt tick tick dynamic pt tick false none q po none q po none pt none f fieldlines none f fieldpoint none trackedsymbols tick initialization field x real real module heavy computation go x q po euclideandistance q po x x q po euclideandistance q po x q po euclideandistance q po x q po euclideandistance q po x fieldlines q po q po module heavy computation go streamplot field x x streampoints pnts streamscale imagesize fieldpoint q po q po pt module heavy computation go streamplot field x x streampoints pt thickness rgbcolor arrowhead automatic forwardbackward imagesize pnts tuples problem code first run slow second run ok must problem inizializaton move point p see streamplot background field line recalculated fine wanted anyway single field line loses specification arrow thing happens one charge q q moved like use three locator instead three slider q q p simulation found yet possible help
