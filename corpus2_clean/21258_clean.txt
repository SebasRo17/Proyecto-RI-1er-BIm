solving second order differential equation n x solved dsolve ndsolve plot n function x look great want calculate gradient n x point x plot function v know execute calculated gradient every point plot get expected shape curve also v x axis value axis high code eq gx dif subscriptbox partiald x n x x kr n x n bcs n n n exp e alpha v kb alpha e kb gx dif kr n sol v x ndsolve eq bcs n x x maxsteps re table sol v listplot table re x joined true frame true imagesize gx complicated function x integrate list input result dsolve big need stop calculation gradient soon becomes zero plot n x x cross x axis value v calculation stop appropriate result graph displayed need negative value derivative need mathematica calculation best way execute another problem result high never change sign theory result look like cannot post image see desired graph link cdn com fcontent fimage f gr jpg b x axis voltage axis current density calculate gradient point x j dn x dx x current related density gradient diffusion coefficient proportionality constant multiply resulted derivative dif change enough multiply whole equation e give correct unit result small picture evident value axis changing slowly thank answer
