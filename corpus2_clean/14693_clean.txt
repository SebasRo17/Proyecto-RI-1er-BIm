wrote module numerically solves ode using ndsolve result e g either interpolatingfunction interpolatingfunction depending whether independent varialbe global local module far care global everything worked fine imho source upcoming trouble would like switch local variable version therefore use replacement rule like interpolatingfunction extract single value plot function tried wrap function following minimal example demonstrates compute module re f point table x x x re interpolation point f x re x f using code work fine ex compute ex want run computation different parameter put paralleltable resulting list contain correct function anymore symbol paralleltable compute f note work perfectly paralleltable replace normal table explain happens something definition function living sub kernel passed back main kernel edit another aspect problem solution would help following multiply interpolatingfunction number try extract value work would expect using example assuming tha re returned indicated use re following fcn re fcn interpolatingfunction maybe workaround
