currently process modelling generic form transcription difficulty finding proper oo modeling area human num type g u c strand num type eg trying model generic sense want able decide number nucleotide type runtime model need able represent arbitrary number nucleotide type initially thought nucleotide typeid member way could sequence nucleotide instance arbitrary type feel right huge fan storing also comfortable essentially definition information set every instance instead defined get around come far previous project would singleton object represented another would simply reference singleton prevented u multiple instantiation definition type great imo remember entity framework generating dynamic proxy runtime could something similar could base runtime define derived class believe possible reflection sure performance impact approach would assume one time overhead defining class better oo approach
