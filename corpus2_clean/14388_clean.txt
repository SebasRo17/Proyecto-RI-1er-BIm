currently working dynamic simulation mechanical electrical system case kitchen scale main simulation running smoothly building nice gui around simulation encountered problem creating plot using manipulate problem would like plot either full plotrange toggling radio button togglerbar checkbox slider control vertical plotrange tried putting evaluate around dynamic variable well putting dynamic around plot common outcome radio button togglebars checkboxes jump position plot update moving slider afterwards toggling slider mode result correctly scaled ax code manipulate dynamic plot sin plotrange evaluate scalefunction scalefunction full scale scale controltype radiobuttonbar scale since method work tried without manipulate following line creates variable scale like use plotrange switch full scaleintern scaleintern planned checkbox dynamic scale full evaluate dynamic scaleintern evaluate dynamic scaleintern dynamic scale slider control scaleintern slider dynamic scaleintern following line creates dynamic plot dynamic plot sin pi plotrange pi evaluate scale strange error message window plot prng value option plotrange pi full automatic positive machine number appropriate list range specification number interactively bound slider due correct format range specification error message help find problem code would really appreciate aid solve issue really care method going work end interested solution interest sake
