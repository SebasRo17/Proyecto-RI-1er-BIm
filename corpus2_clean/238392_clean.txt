please consider program user chooses algorithm list strategy pattern utilized set algorithm model operation example image application number algorithm used manipulate image darken brighten contrast etc encapsulated object controller set model use algorithm list algorithm also need presented ui work user select algorithm list gui controller notified set suitable algorithm model later model called model operate delegate operation current algorithm classic strategy pattern also view need access name algorithm order allow user choose one list question store algorithm somewhere controller fetch need set algorithm model controller instantiate new algorithm whenever need set algorithm model answer good store algorithm somewhere model make sense model encapsulates business logic app view fetch name algorithm controller make sense controller one set algorithm model also offer view technically hold business logic object algorithm different anyone interested fetch algorithm name sure lot application user selects operation appropriate algorithm set model application
