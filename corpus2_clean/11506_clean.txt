recently teaching bayesian calculation bug language jag particular however find wondering one might use mathematica similar calculation perhaps based around nintegrate would interested building model using awesome combined computing graphing facility mathematica provides copy bayesian logical data analysis physical science excellent enjoyable book think focused analytic solution numerical seems complicated model would quickly outpace ability obtain analytic solution example consider problem inferring difference two rate taken lee wagenmaker book model prior rate theta dbeta theta dbeta observed count k dbin theta n k dbin theta n difference rate delta theta theta given k n k n might translate mathematica get e g posterior density theta difference rate suppose p delta k k n n example k k n n knowing done would go long way toward able build solve model
