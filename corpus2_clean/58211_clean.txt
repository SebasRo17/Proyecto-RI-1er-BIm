feel like simple keep running wall say someone give coordinate vertex pentagon center point hexagon way get ordered list boundary point let try put picture instance someone gave list pi plus center point c plot find c pi anyway extract list pi cyclic permutation ideally would like able differentiate orientation clockwise v counterclockwise really care cyclic permutation thanks help advance big crucial edit thanks everyone help trying lot suggestion let crucial element point seems routine convexhullmesh findcurvepath etc work coordinate thinking trying project onto plane perpendicular central point since know center might lengthy point center neighbor
