using extreme value fitting method result parametric distribution value exceeding threshold value geq smaller value like use smooth kernel distribution pasting two together usually small gap jump distribution looked possibility fix point smoothed distribution found thing way force smooth kernel distribution density take right end value make big difference simply real reason jump density update course possible shift empirical smoothed density scale empirical density part obtain continuous density really convinced seem like optimal solution attach two plot illustrate problem enter image description enter image description thank
