given symmetric square matrix apply permutation row column e permutation row column way new structure matrix follow new row column order consider order row column according element set arranged matrix order range matrix table subscript j j tableform matrix tableheadings order order mathematica graphic take permutation row column order neworder randomsample order findpermutation find appropriate permutation cycle new order permutation findpermutation order neworder permute order permutation cycle question easily elegantly apply permutation preferably cycle form matrix yield following one mathematica graphic note matrix always square symmetric column head order always identical bear mind order consequently matrix big e g order since matrix big looking method applies permutation locally without reconstructing whole table every time without applying replacement function enumerating element thus dispatch table used rather important could new order swap two column row nothing else
