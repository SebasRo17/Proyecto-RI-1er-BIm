interesting conundrum coding implementation basic set mathematical number natural integer rational irrational real complex mostly fun also want properly represented number started rationalnumber added two field denominator overloaded basic operator able using c define mean add subtract etc object thought extend definition upward make extend could fill elsewhere except intuitively number system operates contrary definition illustrating mean consider starting basic natural number extend natural number include negative number well zero already including call new group integer would imply integer inherits wanted write accepts integer parameter logically one would assume could use natural number well way inheritance work fly properly model relationship set number inheritance put natural number
