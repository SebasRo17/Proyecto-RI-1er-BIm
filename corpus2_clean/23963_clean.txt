nonlinear equation solve parametrically pg p p solve c pg gc gl c pg gc gl gl fd gl fd gc fd pg p p p gc fd pg p p p gl c gc pg gl c gc pg gc gc c c gc gc gl gl fd get root problem however complex solving model change numeric value alpha beta gamma get memory error avoid want put condition variable since root meaningful take time memory calculate ex leq fd leq c c take positive value want solve condition put nonnegativity bounding condition variable mathematica solve command least could put nonnegativity condition would get rid negative root matter use reduce instead would appreciate comment help
