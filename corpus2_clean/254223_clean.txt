written program solve special puzzle kind stuck following problem num point node dot point connected point usually num num theoretical limit num num exactly one starting point num exit point probably exit point connected many num point probably connected neither start end point way like separate net point connected least one point need find shortest number hop go entry exit distance point unlike road train routing problem number hop count need find solution shortest number hop one solution potentially also solution one hop etc expect solution num num hop go start exit already tried num randomly trying possibility starting count bigger previous solution got first solution num hop got num minute looking solution saw problem like unnecessary loop stuff tried optimize bit like going back came etc optimization possible random thing find best solution take long num recursively way start chess problem like breaking try reached previous point looping length num node try chain probably far long calculate num possibility num node reaching num possibility possible calculate called depth first search dfs found meantime maybe try breadth first search adding queue connection point actually move make game point game look like made move would algorithm use problem using c net language matter
