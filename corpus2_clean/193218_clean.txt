recent project working use lot function kind look like static bool double plane latitude double plane longitude double plane altitude double plane roll double plane pitch double plane heading double roll double pitch double yaw target x target double zoom image width pixel image height pixel double target latitude double target longitude double target height want refactor look something like static gpscoordinate gpscoordinate plane target zoom appears significantly readable safe first make sense create class would better using std pair make sense use double intuition behind using class everything based assumption num class everything would impossible pas weight expected would difficult provide wrong argument num likewise illegal operation would cause compile error adding gpscoordinate another gpscoordinate num legal operation easy represent typesafe e subtracting two gpscoordinate would yield however c seen us lot primitive type imagine must good reason good idea use object anything downside aware
