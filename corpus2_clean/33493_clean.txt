problem using pattern vector assumption use pattern assumption input simplify element anything element anything output true mathematica assume variable matching element anything however replace anything vector n mathematica longer assumes input simplify element vector n element vector n output element vector n complex expect get ouput true problem update problem exists v vector introduced built function thanks ri ozols clarifying michael e gave solution replacing element vector n holdpattern element vector n complex partially solves problem want really assume vector see following code input assumption holdpattern element vector n complex element x vector n element z vector n input simplify element vector n element x vector n element z vector n output true true element z vector n complex input tensorrank x z ouput tensorrank tensorrank z x behaves vector z holdpattern make element vector n true make vector want behave like x
