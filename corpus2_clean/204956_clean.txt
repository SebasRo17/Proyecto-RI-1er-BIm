currently working collection implementation javascript need mutable immutable version thought first something like collection mutablecollection extends collection immutablecollection extends collection issue want implement specific collection like list set could still inherit collection mutable immutable implementation could inherit mutablecollection immutablecollection made think whether three collection mutablecollection immutablecollection would actually bring significant benefit alternative approach came would collection collection prototype freeze would also introduce collection used function explicitly requiring mutable collection concern putting everything collection prototype definition getting much bigger compared mutablecollection prototype well would hold operation alteration guess could solve defining second file anyhow would extend basic collection definition additional operation operation documentation signature actually care mutable v immutable require basic collection would look less pretty take param mutablecollection collection collection v param collection collection collection yet made immutable collection would natural way javascript especially without interface check considering flatter chain inheritance would also implement set map collection everything one approach seems intuitive
