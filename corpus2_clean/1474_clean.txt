mathematica built function valueq quoting doc valueq expr give true value defined expr give false otherwise valueq give false expr would change entered mathematica input work nicely symbol ownvalues x print boo valueq x true work nicely function though f x print x valueq f true give true also evaluates f completely printing clearly dangerous important aware unfortunately doc make mention possible issue section happens clear look implementation valueq non symbol valueq expr hold evaluate expr hold expr question possible implement robust version valueq evaluate argument unexpected possibly dangerous way
