using mathematica numercially solve following equation f r r r f r r r f r r f r r r f r r f r r r f r r r f r r r boundary condition f f f r r r f r r r take small say everything fine however take large e g mathematica complains give crazy result error message get ndsolve bvluc equation derived boundary condition numerically ill conditioned boundary condition may sufficient uniquely define solution computed solution may match boundary condition poorly ndsolve berr significant error boundary value residual returning best solution found anyone help deal issue appreciate help
