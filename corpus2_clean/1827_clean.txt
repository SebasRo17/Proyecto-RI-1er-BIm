given directed acyclic graph always possibility plot graph layer node always send edge one direction usually successive layer never backwards layereddrawing option value graphlayout fails miserably built somewhat obsolete layeredgraphplot obviously part new graph paradigm would efficient elegant algorithm lay graph row graph imagesize vertexlabels range graphlayout layereddrawing imagepadding layeredgraphplot vertexlabeling true imagesize mathematica graphic note topologicalsort give top sorting vertex usually multiple solution topological sorting thus multiple way layer graph also algorithm must take account child parent end layer see e g vertex right plot nice algorithm laying arrow welcome well
