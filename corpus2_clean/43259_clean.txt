rd order ivp x x x x x x initial condition given follows first assumed value initializing shooting method using rk rth order method problem infinity equal want loop shooting method using runge kutta th order method way calculation check value sufficiently large value x experimental result x f use rk method redefined equation like l x x z x x l z x x l z could write one loop rk method proving bit tough generate list different value f also variable range step size deal equation simultaneously solving c programming efficient dont know go ahead anyone could throw light
