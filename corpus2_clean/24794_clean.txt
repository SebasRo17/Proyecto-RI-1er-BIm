functional polynomial expression form expr f x f x g w conjugate f g z conjugate g z g w f x f g w conjugate f conjugate b conjugate c would like write function selects term linear e zero first order function f g eg case correct output would f x conjugate g z g w conjugate f conjugate b conjugate c note function complex conjugate term also considered basically want neglect second order term higher
