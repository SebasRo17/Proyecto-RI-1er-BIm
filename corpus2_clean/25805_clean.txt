quatity r defined complicated expression term ldots n function x x would like know efficient way substitute r expression plot function x interested plot concreteness consider following code vecup table ab nn vecdown table ab nn r ab orbr vecup ab orbt vecdown v n sqrt n sqrt sign v ab sign v ab would like plot r vector orbr orbt large expression increase nn vector increase size causing expression element also increase size eventually making r impossible plot efficient way operation large expression r help keeping plotting time reasonable
