need fit data dropbox form x need fit function derivative calculation derivative curve smooth tried bsplinefunction data splinedegree also interpolation data interpolationorder derivates smooth therefore ended using least square fit lsf using polynomial varying degree polynomial dop find best fit dop lsf fit data evaluate table x x dop x problem even choosing high dop experimental data fitted well important section curve local minimum maximum fit v experimental blue experimental data red lsf derivative seems start oscillate beginning end curve example beginning pointed black arrow enter image description zooming experimental curve first section reveal something could cause error enter image description something runge phenomenon solve easily
