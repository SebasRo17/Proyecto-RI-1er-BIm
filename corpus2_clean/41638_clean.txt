running symbolic calculation mathematica simplification algebraic expression important part often final result simplified considerably typically expression involve many variable categorised group use denote group letter variable within group distinguished index e g b etc point found tried discus simplifying using assumption fullsimplify command best work variable without subscript example result simplification cardinally different depending whether using plain letter frac p x frac q x frac p b x frac q b x letter subscript frac b left x right left left x right left x right left right b left x right right left x right left left right left x right b left x right left x right right left x right left x right left x right left x right clearly prefer first form therefore using rule replace indexed variable plain letter perform simplification using rule replace plain letter original indexed variable however convenient method also view fact number letter finite therefore question way teach fullsimplify work efficiently indexed variable normal one two equivalent expression first one contains letter f p x b p b x q b x b x q x b q b x p b x b x b x x x b x rule p q p q fullsimplify f rule lead first equation second one f x subscript subscript b x subscript x subscript subscript subscript subscript subscript x subscript subscript b x subscript subscript subscript subscript x subscript subscript x subscript subscript x subscript subscript b x subscript x subscript x subscript x subscript rule subscript subscript b subscript subscript b fullsimplify f rule equivalent first one however returned unsimplified least version mathematica mac o x two expression equivalent following command show fullsimplify f f subscript subscript b subscript p subscript p subscript b q subscript b q return thank advance
