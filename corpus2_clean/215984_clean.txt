looking algorithm handle following problem calling bad apple algorithm problem got n process running sandbox n impractical give process sandbox least one process badly behaved bringing entire sandbox thus killing process sandbox single badly behaved process could use simple put half process one sandbox half another sandbox found question one process badly behaved including possibility badly behaved naive algorithm work guaranteed work within sensible bound simplification sake argument let assume bad process brings sandbox instantaneously good process never
