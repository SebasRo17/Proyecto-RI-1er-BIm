using following function f nintegrate x csch x x method automatic symbolicprocessing apply large list well use fitting routine like nonlinearmodelfit already significantly reduce evaluation time switching symbolicprocessing option way speed evaluation f significantly close real case example would following data table f data absolutetiming sure minimum maximum argument function would edit sorry confusion min max argument range vary worst case min max data therefore simplification yield correct result within range edit symbolical integration would perfect due polylog function relative error become large especially small also even time consuming f numericq nintegrate x exp x exp x x method automatic symbolicprocessing h integrate x csch x x assumption element real loglogplot ab h x f x f x x plotrange full loglinearplot ab h x f x f x x data table f data absolutetiming h data absolutetiming would like relative error less
