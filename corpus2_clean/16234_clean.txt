function f x z ldots three variable x z would like find simultaneous instance variable say x z f x z ldots function pretty well behaved mostly low order polynomial factor square root know solution exists manual searching already narrowed area must pretty small region would like preferably use exact solver find exact solution alternatively use numerical search narrow region optimum tried working function like n solve findminimum findroot seem work well program run forever result main question best solution problem mathematica maybe problem complicated mathematica solve even numerically though routine call case best chance getting answer would also curious know general suitable real difference efficiency solve findminimum minimize findroot etc end sharing optimized algorithm internally thanks
