got interesting design problem honestly know tackle application ran dozen workstation workstation impossible know given time many using application every num hour local time application would check database perform change problem one try major complication need way one application perform update one running thinking creating file would reside network drive application would append workstation address turned remove turned every num hour local time application would check file whoever top would one update problem application shut way remove top list update appear option put application server besides storing file question anyone know solution problem seem wrap brain around edit implemented right convert toint32 datetime tostring mm num num new system timer timer num enabled elapsed new system timer look like convert toint32 datetime tostring hh num num change file num num make equal num update database stuff number stored file server done every application start every application unless started absolutely exact second difference num minute num num millisecond plus second account start ups simple file holding number target hour application check look number comparison let say num num case num num give u num time update application check file see num num equal greater num change current hour num num num next application timer elapses minute later num hour mod look file see num greater num anything guy think solution work hundred workstation since chance application trying time higher dozen workstation pull unless someone better solution
