set point plane would like glow would like point glow individually would also like increase intensity corresponding increase density point come couple idea using densityplot neither quite hoping describe need point say pt table e im e first idea consider density function like frac epsilon min text pt operatorname dist x code eps exponent distfunc x eps min table x pt k pt k exponent k length pt show densityplot distfunc x x plotpoints graphic pointsize point pt produce enter image description non differentiability density function lead sharp division glow get around considered adding distance instead taking minimum like sum text pt frac epsilon operatorname dist x definition distfunc x sum x pt k pt k exponent eps k length pt varying parameter eps exponent get part want example eps exponent get nice smooth glow around outer point inner region becomes hot enter image description eps exponent middle longer hot brightest glow density outer point longer significant idividual glow enter image description yet found way nice strong glow center well distinct nontrivial glow outer point appreciate idea may also new mathematica really know colorfunction work easy increase range light dark e increase contrast color function used densityplot render picture would like darkest color near black picture possible
