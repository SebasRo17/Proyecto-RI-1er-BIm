hopefully small problem numerical integration algorithm specifically want integrate imaginary part complex valued function e g f u exp iuk k mathbb r mentioned interested im f example sin u k integrate mathematica nintegrate f min root root max root root accuracygoal agoal precisiongoal pgoal workingprecision wprecision get two different result depending f use sin u k return somenumber use im f return list somenumber two treated differently crash program question mathematica sometimes return list sometimes value distinguish list value e xyz list something else something else end idea one could avoid different return type manual anything found useful far
