given rather complicated function h z best approach check symbolically whether holomorphic tried checking explicitly cauchy riemann equation z b h e sqrt z sqrt z sqrt z cosh sqrt z sqrt z sinh sqrt z hre fullsimplify complexexpand h b real fullsimplify complexexpand im h b real hrea assuming b real hre hrea simplify hrea b real himb assuming b real b himb simplify himb b real simplify hrea himb b real would expect result either true equation b need satisfy order cr equation fulfilled would mean function holomorphic everywhere complex plane problem encounter call simplify complete computation reasonable amount time hour aborted checking whether hre harmonic necessary condition h holomorphic seem easier second derivative h even longer way speed even completely different approach derivative long manual inspection option note correctly pointed murray cauchy riemann de fulfilled alone already imply holomorphy additional property need given e g continuity h continuity derivative
