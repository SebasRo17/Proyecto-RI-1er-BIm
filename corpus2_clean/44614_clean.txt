want calculate area percentage function certain regime constant threshold example f x sin x x threshold g x k would hand would identify intersection point two function calculate integral right one substract value g x f x get volume threshold depending number intersection quite number integral consider thought let mathematica leg work well quite novice mathematica soon realised vague idea mathematica probably even better way described middle paragraph end could also approximate enclosed area numerically anyone show edit thank much answer solution small correction probably explained poorly wanted solution rasher worked fine understood code used also try learn chenminqi solution look defintely sophisticated exceeds current mathematica knowledge thanks everyone
