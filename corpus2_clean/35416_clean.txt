using ndsolve solve set coupled differential equation certain event occurs want two equation set changed radically example x b c x x x f purpose first tried use trick shown mathematica featured example acdc full wave rectifier wrote equation like x go b go c x x go f set event like whenevent go go whenevent go go jump back forth two pair equation want use time event triggered however two division zero error occur assume ndsolve still trying solve part multiplied zero apparently method work type problem anybody know right way
