dynamical system given left begin aligned x phi x x z z end aligned right phi x mu x nu x b mu nu positive real parameter obviously origin equilibrium point want determine kind equilibrium depends sign real part eigenvalue matrix linearized system linearized system given x ax begin pmatrix nu b end pmatrix characteristic polynomial given p lambda b lambda nu lambda nu b lambda ab nu pure hell solve may something fact family system chaotic anyway tried throwing mathematica spit page symbol tried reduce order find whether eigenvalue negative positive real part sadly give page symbol really help anybody know good way deal tl dr compute sign real part matrix possible value b nu criterion positive also edit tried following input b sigma sigma b eig b sigma eigensystem b sigma table reduce eig b sigma b sigma real output displayed mathematica large output generated sample basically list lot different case course expected real problem ton root
