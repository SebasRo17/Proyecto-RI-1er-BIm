need numerically integrate highly oscillatory function semi infinite domain infty int infty frac sin x sin x x mathrm dx since levin rule recently added mathematica starting version developed specifically oscillatory integral thought try an nintegrate sin x sin x x x infinity method levinrule precisiongoal maxrecursion using exact solution integral confirm relative accuracy mathematica result time moreover calculation quick first led believe levin method work great problem turn mathematica must automatically switching non oscillatory rule behind scene forcing give poor result an nintegrate sin x sin x x x infinity method levinrule methodswitching false precisiongoal maxrecursion nintegrate ncvb nintegrate failed converge prescribed accuracy recursive bisection x near x nintegrate obtained integral error estimate way find alternative non oscillatory rule mathematica automatically selecting tried guess rule used manually specifying rule result obtained rule inaccurate slow an nintegrate sin x sin x x x infinity method clenshawcurtisrule accuracygoal maxrecursion nintegrate slwcon numerical integration converging slowly suspect one following singularity value integration highly oscillatory integrand workingprecision small nintegrate eincr global error strategy globaladaptive increased time global error expected decrease monotonically number integrand evaluation suspect one following working precision insufficient specified precision goal integrand highly oscillatory piecewise smooth function true value integral increasing value globaladaptive option maxerrorincreases might lead convergent numerical integration nintegrate obtained integral error estimate like know rule mathematica using try adjusting option best performance possible need calculate integral several hundred thousand time innermost integral nested double integration furthermore come publishing result would like able state integration strategy actually used rather mathematica knew handle
