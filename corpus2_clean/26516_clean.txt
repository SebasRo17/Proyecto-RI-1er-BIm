currently trying fit planck law b measurement thereby determining planck constant list triplet containing wavelength temperature measured intensity list triplet error like datalist b b errorlist b b although nonlinearmodelfit fit function type r r seems accept one dimensional list weight tried nonlinearmodelfit datalist b h hlit weight errorlist could course propagate partial uncertainty create one uncertainty triplet thereby one dimensional weight list instead seems bit unethic would possible fit planck curve measurement without combine error first edit exact error message get nonlinearmodelfit wts value option weight list real number pure function used data function example
