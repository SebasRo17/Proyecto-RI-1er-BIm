really trivial appologise advance made stupid error somewhere chasing strange result using nintegrate integrands involving max pdf simple example follows f x x pdf multinormaldistribution x x nintegrate max exp x exp x f x x x infinity infinity x infinity infinity gave answer however tried matlab got used monte carlo block rho data rv rv path sum sumsquared mean var stderror data table rv random normaldistribution rv rho rv sqrt rho random normaldistribution max exp rv exp rv path sum total data sumsquared total data mean sum path var sumsquared path mean path path stderror sqrt var path mean stderror one run gave agreeing matlab result also noticed replace max exp rv exp rv exp rv exp rv issue arise idea going
