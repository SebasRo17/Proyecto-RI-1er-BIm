function randomgraph spatialgraphdistribution n r generates random geometric graph vertex connected within distance r one another would explicitly specify list point generating random geometric graph using function specifically need enforce minimum threshold distance point clarification point list going come random sequential adsorption rsa simulation circle plane mean two point closer minimum threshold distance set radius circle deposited two point share edge closer threshold distance
