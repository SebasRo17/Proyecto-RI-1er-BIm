simple question appears already answered forum built functionality return degree multivariable polynomial example polynomial want mathematica return automatic solution could somebody please suggest simple fast implementation edit removed solution actually work simple example tested four solution presented far degree polynomial variable bytecount poly used absolutetiming determine answer chose fastest run time evaluation quite bit faster closest competitor run time evaluation update tested improved version solution one random real found run time slightly worse still far better competition evaluation
