got system equation look like theta e phi co omega z tilde w co theta sin omega z sin omega z frac lambda co theta sin omega z phi e phi co omega z sin theta sin omega z similarly one want solve equation z treat algebraic equation extract condition theta phi mean want check condition constant equation solution hand would write series expansion sin sin omega z like term integrate pi make term vanish since expression horrible wondering mathematica could help getting condition least insight kind problem much general class equation least common calculation physic people usually interested could useful lot different scope apart toy problem
