calculating set lattice vector mathbb z taxicab norm r example executing solve ab c ab c ab c ab c c c c c integer yield lattice vector taxicab norm less work fine r point solution however r solve ab c ab c ab c ab c c c c c integer simply return according documentation solve yield set solution full dimensional clearly case finite though large number solution also far could tell nowhere documentation specify cap number possible solution question reason way coax solve returning correct answer know obvious though tedious mathematical trick reducing problem several lower dimensional problem like solve directly possible
