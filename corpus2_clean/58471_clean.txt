working simple software application written mathematica composing several nb file application centered around simple mathematica gui includes several numerical input field selection option produce output graph wish keep gui somehow hide source code user would access machine remotely cannot edit see algorithm producing gui know two potential option may converting cdf recompiling mathematica code c interested possibility two specific question based option export multiple nb file single cdf would way view algorithm underlying gui compile mathematica code c would still able produce gui
