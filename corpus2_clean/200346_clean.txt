torn oriented vector based design love ability structure safety object give whole architecture time speed important simple float variable really help vector based language library like matlab numpy piece wrote illustrate point problem adding tow volatility number x two volatility number sum volatility x num num num assuming certain mathematical condition important want perform operation fast time need ensure people add volatility wrong way x important oo based design would something like datetime import datetime panda import volatility def init self self def str self volatility str self def add self volatility pow self self num aside new add override operator let say add tow list volatility value n num series map lambda x volatility num x num range num n series map lambda x volatility num x num range num n aside series sort list index want add two t1 datetime t2 datetime t2 t1 addition run num second machine result given include time addition timed thing using numpy array series map lambda x num x num range num n series map lambda x num x num range num n t3 datetime numpy sqrt t4 datetime t4 t3 run num second num time faster see oop way give lot security people adding volatility wrong way vector crazy fast design get sure lot similar design choice work choice language immaterial know lot would advise use c may faster vector based language anyway point need use host library available language constraint need optimize within know lot people would suggest parallelization etc want maximize single core performance first parallelize version thanks advance
