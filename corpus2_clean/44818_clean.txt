suppose function variable f depending parameter b example fun f b sin f co b f plot manipulate function independent value parameter b manipulate plot fun f b f b enter image description suppose would like give discrete value parameter change time example define two point sequence b sequence plot plot fun f f plot fun f b f try combine order include possibility manually choose b manipulate plot fun f x f x b obtain empty plot instead would like get plot two button b corresponding two different pair value parameter b tried use list instead sequence failed work also tried row adding brace nothing happened problem code thank advance
