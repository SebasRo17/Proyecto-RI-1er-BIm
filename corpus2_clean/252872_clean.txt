server model consists several object attribute persist relational database crud operation supported common usual need support several synchronization scenario need synchronization client server client well defined subset model based permission client able perform crud operation model eventually synchronize server client always connection server client may modify model change arrive client soon possible ideally near real time latency network framework send message server client vise verse full duplex network available seems similar microsoft exchange synchronizing mail database mail folder contact etc outlook client certain extent centralized source version control perform synchronization general idea keep version entity maintain log implement conflict resolution algorithm using guid id etc sure covering detail ideally looking library framework platform providing mean send message somehow define model one could thing common enough problem already investigated implemented library exist looking tip paper web site pointer
