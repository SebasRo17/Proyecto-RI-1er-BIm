matlab following series nested loop update matrix code someone else trying replicate know start example think need since k specified user n size var k j k var j var j end end k j k var n j var j end end k j k var n j var j end end k variable less n term size k n look q alternative procedural loop iterating list mathematica avoiding rewriting nested loop however sure apply guidance think confused reference j non mathematica part want use nested part best fastest efficient way certainly sequence shown basic example var randominteger n dimension var k
