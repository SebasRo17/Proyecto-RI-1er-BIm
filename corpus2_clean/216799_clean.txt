currently thinking database structure modify scale specifically thinking using elasticsearch provide search functionality one common pattern elasticsearch seems user routing pattern using routing ensure one user resides shard great client specific search e g gmail application constraint user maximum thousand document pattern seems like good candidate however search need work across user well targeting specific user might search content alice content content similarly need provide full text search across timeframe recent month several year ago thinking combining user routing index per time interval pattern create index month default search aliased recent x month result found search previous x month grow reduce interval x document routed user id let u following search user search across num shard search time search num default across shard reasonable approach considering may scale multi million document denormalizing somehow user search performed totally seperate index date search thanks pro con scenario
