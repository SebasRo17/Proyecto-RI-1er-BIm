experiment need basic timer function tried various method neither fully satisfactory need button start stop timer reset timer restart update variable well besides timer trigger effect started stopped also customizable text button let see trigger behaves first define switch test whether counter active total time continuous variable running time timeleft active false time total timeleft trigger switch active update time timeleft trigger dynamic time time timeleft total active total total dynamic column time timeleft active however following issue seems way stop timer trigger pause button way active set wasteful unnecessary test every timestep sadly way could figure call function trigger started stopped tried play start end argument dynamic var start update end success perhaps layering button trigger see next issue label given button option appearance seem effect even remove button via appearanceelements cannot overlay normal button wrap eventhandler pass event trigger trigger object cannot set imagesize button eventhandler overlay button dynamic active stop start trigger dynamic time time timeleft total total appearanceelements triggerbutton pausebutton resetbutton mouseclicked active active passeventsdown true dynamic column time timeleft active mathematica graphic also tried construct clock function follows us global clock start immediately cell generated thus always run background actual stopwatch created subtracting start time moment button pushed global clock active false total start end time column dynamic globaltime clock total time globaltime start globaltime dynamic active time end start dynamic button active stop start active end globaltime start globaltime active active mathematica graphic note actual dynamic value globaltime upper value copied correctly via szabolcs otherwise magnificent image upload palette show less time lower value however annoying feature globaltime appear screen dynamic updating done thus want hide wrap style opacity also time constantly unnecessarily updated even button pushed question reliable built way provide functionality would solve problem interested idea last month construct gui three different timing function always something new request issue feature deal
