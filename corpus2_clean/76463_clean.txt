reason putting generated file tree parallel source tree example eclipse usually choose put source src generated file class mixing single tree look dirty however find advantage separation theoretically could backup source easily using git ignoring file everywhere trivial version control system easy theoretically help find given source file faster tree polluted file actually seldom need ide offer much faster way looking class using view abstract directory structure theoretically may tool requiring aware two disadvantage separation ide copy non file resource source tree generated one ide notice changed resource old version classpath e generated tree find running program working old version may cost quite lot time upon time need find file corresponding given file vice versa take quite lot time real advantage separation question eclipse specific however problem navigating parallel tree aggravated fact tree tend deep directory structure mirroring package structure world wide package naming convention
