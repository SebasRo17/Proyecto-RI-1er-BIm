interpreted language typically go representing floating point number bytecode example suppose got program double num num look like program bytecode see two possibility num writing bit level representation memory number bytecode reading back memory need probably problem portability size double different machine vary store number bytecode portable way num write canonical representation number bytecode decoded program execution time come literal num might serve purpose wasting execution time parsing floating point number runtime question strategy common efficient best feel free cite example different interpreted language compile bytecode lua etc merely point direction resource relevant article necessary googling quite bit virtual machine well documented
