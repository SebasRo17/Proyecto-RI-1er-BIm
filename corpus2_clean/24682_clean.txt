first know continuedfraction convergents implemeneted think immaterial question number x associated continued fraction representation finite matter two sequence x x defined like follow implementation fraction action due number x n consists setting n repeating action x n interested possibly efficient way extracting number x preferably using functional programming mathematica clue lead would much appreciated know give base code work annoying really expect anyone come forth solve someone else problem start end said hopefully comment regarding annoyance spared
