trying implement algorithm jenkinson pollicott calculate hausdorff dimension julia set map f c z mapsto z c described page paper calculating hausdorff dimension julia set kleinian limit set seem get part finding periodic point period n work idea partition line c complex number use newton method c using solution one initial guess next c know solution root unity also take another precaution avoid sensitivity initial condition prevalent newton method find root f c n instead finding root f n c operatorname id f c n z langle f c z n f c z dot f c z n rangle threw together partitionsize f z c z c fdim z c f c rotateleft z findperiodn n c nest findroot fdim z z z c partitionsize nestlist n n partitionsize findperiodn work anybody know simple way implementation thing
