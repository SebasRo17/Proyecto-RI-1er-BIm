background info tried within two mostly distinct environment say research production need structured parameter file file contains thing like database connection table parameter nothing unusual current approach two distinct parameter file say params txt params prod txt production also case help actually using txt using markup language detail really matter question information duplicated two file leading lot copy paste plus version control everyone manually make change two file trust propagating change checking thing needless say lead headache resolve divergence happens file tried workarounds like writing test check file identical way need perfect science since structure file change definition exactly must identical change one idea use single file create sub section within file sub section general parameter always shared another section thing treated default parameter research environment setting another section production environment setting already parses parameter file instantiates object load etc etc based parameter could go back add option load according sub section parameter file told use ignores parameter section benefit num everything one file trusting people propagating change num also require copy paste since anything shared environment need appear one section top one parameter file num anything make parameter file modular easier use num save time cost would spent creating complicated test based work arounds check whether file propagated together check in version control need case cost num time spent making newly formatted parameter file specification xsd validate ensure backwards compatible num cost need make software interface parameter file option whether use research production num property currently considered sub section shared suddenly become thing want different option research production would refactor parameter file move item section num seems like biggest worry also force u constantly factor parameter file good thing view besides want flexibility assigning parameter one sub section another ought better way achieve duplicating entire file question significant pitfall failing realize proposed idea regarding repeat v build flexibility trade offs parameter file design
