using compile function mathematica compute say following f compile x real co x compute f x x taking real value ok let say expression like tmp co x question following way compile expression assigned tmp without explicitly typing co x compile function e want something like f compile x real tmp work seems principle like value assigned tmp somewhat huge complicated symbolic function x would like compile numerical efficiency
