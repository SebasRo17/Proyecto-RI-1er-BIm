creating networking application mathematica run non stop simulation periodically receives new information remote server affect simulation whenever value certain variable inside simulation change mathematica need send update value remote server way catch event mathematica corresponds change value specific variable example assume initially two variable b b throughout simulation one variable change second one remains b possible write event handler know variable changed new value seen discussion triggering action variable set recommends using upvalues set setdelayed var set var value block true print var set value var value trueq seems cover possible case variable might change requires defining upvalues every variable better way
