thinking recent question mi posted belonged math noted following contrived example probability b probability b distributed discreteuniformdistribution b distributed discreteuniformdistribution output expected one complicated predicate say ten variate involved would messy predicate manually course one could use various facility build auto magically use something like keeping simple one see make extension many variate simple probability total unitize b distributed discreteuniformdistribution b distributed discreteuniformdistribution return expected result however something intuitively seems work like probability count b distributed discreteuniformdistribution b distributed discreteuniformdistribution somewhat worryingly return result invalid rather error warning unusable predicate result occur nprobability rhyme reason around work method get mathematica use construct directly least spit back
