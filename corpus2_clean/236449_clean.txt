well known split whole application several bounded context emerge ubiquitous language practicing domain driven design general num bounded context num archive file ready deployed jar ear dll etc question concern bounded context deployment regarding hardware optimization suppose want optimize one specific service within specific bounded context optimization could powerful cpu ram etc good practice create specific archive file meaning split initial bounded context thus order deliver specific hardware tune usage consider num bounded context unit therefore optimizing bounded context whole even specific service need increase hardware power
