periodic function ff ff function x piecewise ff x x x x ff x x plotting work fine plot ff x x plotrange mathematica graphic integrating like integrate ff get recursionlimit reclim recursion depth exceeded iterationlimit itlim iteration limit exceeded keep running abort evaluation problem thanks edit thanks answer avoid confusion signal actually integrate bit complex wanted know reason integrate went sawtooth signal x function piecewise x pi x pi pi x pi co x pi x pi pi x pi x pi x pi plot command plot x x plotrange mathematica graphic edit using much simpler automatically periodic definition signal seems problem integration function x piecewise co x co x co x still answer question mathematica able integrate signal defined like
