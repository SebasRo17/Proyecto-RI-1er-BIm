interested evaluating two dimensional interpolating function produced solving wave equation code includes resulting interpolating function pde x x x x solnderivative ndsolve pde x exp x derivative x derivative derivative derivative derivative derivative x x ifunderivative first derivative x solnderivative wanted first integrate squared ifunderivative respect get new interpolating function function x first problem ran evaluate integral spit back input integratedfunction integrate ifunderivative x x go numerically integrating interpolating function squared respect obtain solution depends x please help thank
