want use mathematica generate random matrix given dimension entry coming finite set determinant also coming finite set important generation matrix random ideally process would give result making list matrix given size possible entry one acceptable determinant picking one random implementation easy solve x case determinant integral entry enter solve b c b c b c integer easily extend problem broader set possible entry e g b c fraction denominator essential following condition need one random matrix need quickly mathematica take forever via trick generate possible x thought trying use findroot together seeding process random value find control single function trick mind writing function mathematica looking much newbie mm much advice give would greatly appreciated edit per gpap excellent answer code ended modified answer work fraction det module sequence solve det candidate apply det randomchoice quiet randomchoice select candidate memberq last
