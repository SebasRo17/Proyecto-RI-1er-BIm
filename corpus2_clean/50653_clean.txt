first want greet community first question hope able help answering others member question although quite new working mathematica would like work numerical solution integro differential equation partial p frac hbar int tg tau p tau e frac hbar k tau tau k constant function defined g tau frac hbar sum n n alpha n exp omega n cdot tau f tau tau deciding solve numerically applied laplace transform equation mind convolution product got p go restore p mathcal l p need solve bromwich integral finding pole function analytical solution certain point use numerical method prefer start solving equation numerically beginning learn honest first try mathematica would appreciate help comment focused code writing thank much
