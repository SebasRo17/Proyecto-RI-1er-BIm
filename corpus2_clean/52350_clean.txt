got x matrix l want find solution matrix equation l x rho l defined l b c e f assumption element b c e f real long put specific number l e g l linearsolve l rho rho something like rho find solution within fraction second making even one argument symbolic say l linearsolve find solution rho defined linearsolve nosol linear equation encountered solution solution least value tried manually added linearly component l even det l nonzero solution assume something pretty wrong anyone help edit sample matrix l b c e f fewer dimension x linearsolve work probably best sample big l matrix less spare example look l b c e f c dsin f sqrt co f sqrt co f sqrt sin f sqrt c e sin f sin f sqrt co f sqrt c e sin f b c variable imaginary unit
