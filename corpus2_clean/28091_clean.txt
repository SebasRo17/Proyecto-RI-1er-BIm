trying solve system partial differential equation boundary condition got error message saying ndsolve icfail unable find initial condition satisfy residual function within specified tolerance try giving initial condition value derivative function understand due absence system equation derivative time function g x l x solve system effected numerical method line remove global pde derivative derivative x x g derivative g derivative x g derivative x derivative x x l x x x derivative x l x derivative x x l x boundary condition bc x x g l desired x x g l ndsolve pde bc desired tried discretize system space using finite volume method maybe somebody know alternative method solve type equation system differential equation describing process countercurrent extraction top extraction column enters two liquid component gas phase enters bottom column liquid component different solubility gas phase due separated coming top column gas phase enriched one component liquid phase exiting bottom differential material balance component gas liquid phase boundary condition taken known composition feed liquid phase top column z known composition gas coming bottom z also assumed initial time corresponds equilibrium two stream full lack mixing constant parameter removed readability equation detailed description output system equation described article author solved similar system using method line software package gproms system discretised space using finite volume method trying solve problem software package math using methodoflines technique unfortunately far without success would grateful help matter apologize english native language
