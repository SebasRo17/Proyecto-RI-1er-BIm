wish get list inwards edge node incidencelist provides inwards outwards list course filter case using following way better way built function inboundedges graph x case incidencelist graph x directededge x use inboundedges function one simulation function getting maxformatdepthexceeded exception even smaller number nested operation need around number iteration let take example g graph incidencelist g incidencelist g inboundedges g incidencelist g give need get inboundedges written however efficient solution
