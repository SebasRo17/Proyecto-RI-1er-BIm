titled question jokingly sure depends specific question working software many deep layer dependency team become accustomed using mocking fairly extensively separate module dependency beneath therefore surprised roy osherove suggested video using mocking something like num time guess sitting somewhere num num seen similar guidance time time well define consider two category integration test distinct really given different name num process test integrate multiple module num process test talk database file system web service etc num concerned test integrate multiple module process much community guidance read suggests prefer large number isolated fine grained unit test small number coarse grained end end integration test unit test give precise feedback exactly regression might created coarse test cumbersome set actually verify end end functionality system given seems necessary make rather frequent use mocking isolate separate unit given model follows enter image description also consider application dependency depth go much deeper could fit image multiple layer n num num layer num num layer want test simple logical decision made unit num every dependency constructor injected module depends say num num num constructor injected module num image would much rather inject mock num num num num otherwise would need construct concrete instance num num num difficult extra typing often num num num constructor requirement challenging satisfy according graph according reality project need construct concrete instance n num satisfy constructor num num num situation becomes challenging need num num num behave certain way test simple logical decision num might need understand mentally reason entire graph tree get num num num behave necessary way often seems much easier setup x x return new right test module num responds expected module num tell go right test concrete instance num n num together test setup would large mostly duplicated test failure might good job pinpointing location regression failure test would independent another supporting link granted often reasonable state based rather interaction based testing bottom layer since module seldom dependency seems mocking almost necessary definition isolate module bottom given anyone tell might missing team overusing mock perhaps assumption typical unit testing guidance layer dependency application shallow enough indeed reasonable test module integrated together making case special perhaps differently team bounding bounded context adequately
