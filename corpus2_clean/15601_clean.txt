suppose expression form b c x z fullform plus time b c time x z suppose want set expression containing product b c zero naive way b c x z time b c however work nothing replaced background info expanding term using series would like cancel product dx dy first order term remain even confusing use time generic function f work even assign attribute time f f setattributes f attribute time attribute f f b c f b c flat listable numericfunction oneidentity orderless protected evaluate use new kernel f protected replace expression containing product assuming order argument known worry fact expression b might left one solving would another question
