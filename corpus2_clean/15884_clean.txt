need typeset large number equation used plotlabel title look nice hence use traditionalform holdform work well except tiny little annoying thing example traditionalform holdform v w sin w display frac v sin w frac v w sin otherwords sin x put numerator well like remain typed used hint leave sin alone hint nothing easy fix use holdform around small sub expression follows traditionalform row holdform v w holdform sin w generates frac v w sin small example much larger equation would nice could tell mathematica type using another trick please group subexpression example like equation look exactly appear text book big issue really use holdform many time force shape look exactly wanted thought check someone know easier way shown thought possible use latex directly typeset thing mathematica purpose display e would nice one write something like text frac v w sin mathematica interpret latex typeset latex output possible write everything latex string problem solved mean follows help explain point matlab text frac v w sin interpreter latex fontsize generates latex formula notice tell matlab use latex interpreter really nice able something like mathematica possible using string also avoids many problem typesetting symbolic expression mathematica since string inert raw symbol value thanks
