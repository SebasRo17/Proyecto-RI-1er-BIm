background dealing large tiff image file imported processed exported using mathematica many algorithm work array representation image pixel value stored form nested list currently using function imagedata directly convert image array representation problem struggeling increase memory usage converting image array representation using imagedata wondering convert image imagedata allocated memory four time higher compared image memory example consider following example first create stack image exported tiff file import file option data check memory import compared importing file without option take four time memory export testfile tif constantarray image constantarray bit filebytecount testfile tif memoryinuse imgdata import testfile tif data memoryinuse import file without option memory used byte give factor memory needed repeated several time admit explanation question simple explanation increase memory usage reduce amount allocated memory using array representation attempt reading function developer topackedarray mathematica packed array tried convert data array hoping would give decrease memory usage nevertheless really sure using function correctly case code tried following packed developer topackedarray import testfile tif data system specifictation o window professional service pack bit processor intel xeon cpu e ghz processor installed memory gb mathematica java version additional question still one problem remains clean way mathematica could reduce number bit used integer change amount memory used array representation imagedata without losing information stick image case
