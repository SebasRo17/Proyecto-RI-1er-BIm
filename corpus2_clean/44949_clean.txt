mathematica implemented permuations function compilable tried write permutation implementation called permutationsnew want compile later unfortunately implementation came far us recursive programming look like permutationsinternal function list listfixed length list join listfixed list table permutationsinternal drop list append listfixed list length list permutationsnew list flatten permutationsinternal list length list implementation seems work fine recursive structure cannot come approach compiled mathematica trouble compiling list encountered permutationsinternal anybody idea compile approach offer idea different compilable solution
