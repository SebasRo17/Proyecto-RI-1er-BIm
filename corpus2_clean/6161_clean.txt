mathematica trying render polygon set vertex directed edge far graphic polygon see mathematica graph pathgraph command directededges option seems like control position vertex command could customize fill edge stroke polygon command would acceptable seeing look like command specifically meant draw filled polygon also ok custom mathematica routine draw want using loop multiple line command within graphic command see draw line arrow sure could make routine three line per edge really think missing something
