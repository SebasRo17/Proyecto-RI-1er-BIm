program work list point could well make difference within loop keep adding new point list calculate coordinate new point need use nearestfunction generated list existing point new point added list nearestfunction need rebuilt well rather time consuming using list existing point possible efficiently append new point already constructed nearestfunction perhaps making use knowledge internal structure nearestfunction example illustrate question better point randomreal lot point nf nearest point corresponding nearestfunction appendto point randomreal add extra point nf nearest point need rebuild nearestfunction scratch inefficient rebuilding nearestfunction large number point efficient way add single point efficiently making use existing nearestfunction
