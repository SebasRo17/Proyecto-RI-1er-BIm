year using c net bunch house project one library grow organically one huge stuff called util sure many seen one beast career many part library much standalone could split separate project like open source one major problem need solved released separate library basically lot lot case might call optional dependency library explain better consider module good candidate become stand alone library parsing command line serializing class xml performs check compiled assembly report compilation fail library colored literal lingo translating user interface library used completely stand alone used together useful extra feature example expose post build checking functionality requires similarly allows option documentation provided using colored literal requiring support translatable documentation via lingo key distinction optional feature one use command parser plain string without translating documentation performing post build check one could make documentation translatable still colored translatable etc looking util library see almost potentially separable library optional feature tie library actually require library dependency stuff really still basically require library want use one established approach managing optional dependency net
