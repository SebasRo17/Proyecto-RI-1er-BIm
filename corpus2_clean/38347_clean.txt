let say degree homogeneous polynomial variable x x x distinct monic monomials forming basis vector space polynomial degree another polynomial degree x x x find coordinate expansion returning list according chosen ordering monomials desired output would list number example let say want ordering x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x want output corresponding polynomial x x x want output array degree arbitrary choice therefore dimensionality method need least work fixed degree time necessarily put degree beginning always work also eventually want take array polynomial want generate list list coefficient hopefully method suggested amenable thanks
