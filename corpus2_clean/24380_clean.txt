another question passing list need generated dynamically sorry posting two question one day search found similar post think fixed length list hope misunderstand code findrootsofresult point module c result e pi w x e pi w x w x findroot result w j hold c paralleltable releasehold im releasehold j c deleteduplicates c ab ab point join point c trying assign value variable x pas list findrootsofresult function compute corresponding root function w certain region finally get rid duplicate root save root list passed calculation since number root given region change different x length list dynamically changed well use join last line like assign many different x compute root save list simple example would findrootsofresult an expect an contains root x however mathematica give many error message like recursionlimit reclim recursion depth exceeded join head head join list position expected list an nothing useful inside think ok maybe mathematica know an list object make an empty list an findrootsofresult an still get error message set shape list shape really know pas list expected execute command findrootsofresult line line manually work perfectly guess really understand mathematica pass list object anyone could give brief explanation previous discussion would appreciate
