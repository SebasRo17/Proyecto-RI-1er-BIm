first time posting although experienced user wm problem regarding graphic cannot seem fix asking help start set point x range time rectangle point generate triangle mesh later use finite element method solving eigenmodes rectangle coat cylinder torus moebius depending kind boundary condition use fem membrane coat object like case moebius strip want draw surface moebius strip set point x z normally using parametrisation equation found equation moebius strip work perfectly transformation x r co co r co sin z sin pi pi x new point surface plot shoud look something like case cylinder cylinder draw point moebius strip get weird anomaly two case tried listsurfaceplot get weird anomaly tried tweaking maxplotpoints trick first case listplot work bit better also fill hole draw weird joint second case data sample rectangle original data sample transformed case moebius transformed plot code data p graphic point data boxed false aspectratio boxratios automatic sphericalregion true plotrange imagesize p listplot data boxed false ax false sphericalregion true aspectratio boxratios automatic maxplotpoints plotrange imagesize mesh automatic plotstyle magenta show p p listplot also changed listsurfaceplot really appreciate help
