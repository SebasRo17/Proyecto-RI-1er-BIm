easy seem find right way equation form x b x c z z like solve relation parameter b c etc equation hold value x z etc simplified example kind equation dealing actually variable x ldots parameter b ldots making nontrivial short sample equation different variable could parameter could appear multiple time different parameter far best attempt solve forall x x b b yield correct solution smaller equation variable parameter far slow one specific technique could use optimized kind problem specifically leaving forall yield solution term x variable kind useless edit nikie mentioned much better way comment thanks
