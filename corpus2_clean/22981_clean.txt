recently noticed dealing notebook local context cannot successfully dumpsave variable rather call get non empty mx file notebook recognize variable test created two notebook one global context local context latter notebook ran command setoptions evaluationnotebook cellcontext notebook notebook defined variable contained list point standard normaldistribution plotted using listplot used dumpsave filename mx datavariable plotvariable preserve data plot long story short save close notebook restart mathematica neither notebook recognizes variable used data plot using get global notebook notebook recognize old variable furthermore run dumpsave command local notebook save entire context e dumpsave filename mx evaluate context get back definition solve problem though want preserve variable code working saving entire context specifically definition associated context would require much memory application mind solution using dumpsave resort method update pasted exact code setoptions evaluationnotebook cellcontext notebook distribution normaldistribution thedata randomvariate distribution theplot listplot thedata dumpsave test mx thedata theplot
