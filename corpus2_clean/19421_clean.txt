hi new mathematica real problem concern much difficult equation many parameter want check method good made test equation test equation root equ x z x z x z sol x solve equ x problem looking parameter z root equation less zero edit real part less z real number root complex reduce sol sol sol im z z answer think z function reduce calculate reasonable time proceed edit day equation parameter equ b x x x b x x c x x x x x x reduce forall x equ element b c real x b c good code waiting waiting response mathematica maybe would faster program could write one numerical answer
