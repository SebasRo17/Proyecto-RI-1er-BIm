data expressed elementary function would contain non differentiable point would like able use something like interpolate convert data function differentiate somehow still preserve non differentiability property point mwe list table j max j j data come continuous function differentiable x fint interpolation list dfint x fint x x plot dfint x x axesorigin derivative look like enter image description instead like enter image description update may lista deletecases list listb deletecases list ga interpolation lista gb interpolation listb dga x ga x x dgb x gb x x g x piecewise ga x x gb x x dg x piecewise dga x x dgb x x plot dg x x axesorigin give enter image description however dg guess need get indeterminate
