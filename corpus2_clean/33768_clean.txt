contemplating balance testable design using dependency injection providing simple fixed public api dilemma people would want something like var server new server worry creating many dependency graph dependency server may developing worry much use ioc di framework handle using lifecycle management aspect container would complicate thing dependency unlikely implemented case almost purely testability decent design rather creating seam extension etc people num time wish use default configuration could hardcode dependency want lose testing could provide default constructor hard coded dependency one take dependency messy likely confusing viable could make dependency receiving constructor internal make unit test friend assembly assuming c public api leaf nasty hidden trap lurking maintenance two constructor implicitly connected rather explicitly would bad design general book moment least evil think opinion wisdom
