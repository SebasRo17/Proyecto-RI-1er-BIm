video show different mathematica expression represented internally object graph demonstrate transformed evaluation asking believe help develop better intuition evaluation process particular part expression shared copied happens different scoping construct evaluated part expression modifoed evaluation rule selected downvalues pattern matching performed etc found interesing animation mostly intended give intuition result built function rather evaluation process
