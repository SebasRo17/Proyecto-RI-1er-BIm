following piece code x x x sort select x nsolve x x real less x xx piecewise x nsolve xx part partw part exist geq x pick smallest list element xx x domain x defined want nsolve return value xx error show give input xx get output required put xx nsolve apparently evaluates xx first rather immediately putting numerical value yield error fix nsolve return value tried reduce findroot well give error note seems like huge hassle easy function applying complicated function seemed irrelevant mention edit apparently problem lie select sort part since nsolve equation solver first put variable computes x selecting positive real make sense since yet number start putting value solution would create another equation solving function one mathematica
