trying put together algorithm display node degree every node breadth first tree graph assume bfs called assume undirected graph sure get node degree node going graph thinking adding every occurrence node every list adding occurrence within node list since undirected sure implement answer pseudocode need algorithm implement later language bfs get degree occurr v num v g v u adj v adjacency list v u occurr v occurr v think right track definitely right sure go edit came better think run v e sure bfs node degree vertex v v count num vertex u adj v count node v degree count
