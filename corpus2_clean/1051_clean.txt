started diving mathematica using much computer software symbolic computation analysis hand blank sheet calculation using python matlab computer typesetting presentation using latex mathematica could least great supplement step however frustrated mathematica rendering mathematical notation got mathematica mac o x automatically display unreadable variable name nicer mathematical notation output notebook quite bad mathematica typesetting take reference equivalent latex latex typesetting difficulty distinguish overbar mathematica often close letter find monospace font inappropriate letter thick bold still disproportionately thick compared line mathematical element seem screenshot maybe decoration non literal element integral sign sqrt overbars fraction bracket thick enough comparison particularly increasing font size seen linked example spacing token symbol unnaturally large slightly insufficient two separate symbol e g spacing b b compared ab also maybe function name could benefit slightly different style although certain default font size small increasing font size sufficiently compensate poor typesetting make information take place acceptable screen official documentation math typesetting boast mathematica world sophisticated tech explain much automatically adjust spacing font used another typesetting guide missing maybe downloadable stylesheets redefine spacing make use computer modern high quality font would time write stylesheet idea even begin ready made one would preferable edit response answer example traditionalform side side equivalent latex output clearly difference spacing bad latex version crowded around fraction bar mathematica version bit tight integral sign upper limit operator like bit smaller mathematica version enter image description
