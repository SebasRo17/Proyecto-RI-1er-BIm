many literature reference suggest binary labeling problem converted graph cut problem solved max flow min cut algorithm trying understand formulation given presentation reduction binary labeling problem consists partitioning n item segment overlapped region two image two disjoint set way minimises energy denote partition vector x 1 x n whose element num num also per item fitness function define per item pair transition v j discontinuity energy given e x 1 x n sum p p x p sum p q v p q x p x q particular case num segment num num possible vector evaluate could evaluate e combination performing num num evaluation get minimum energy combination achieves intuition suggests impractical complexity exponential therefore want use graph cut approach understand formulate graph num segment node graph would weight edge would capacity
