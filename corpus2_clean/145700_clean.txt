please look link theoretical algorithm given consider space maze large grid cell like large chess board cell starting four wall starting random cell computer selects random neighbouring cell yet visited computer remove wall two cell add new cell stack analogous drawing floor computer continues process cell unvisited neighbour considered dead end dead end path reach cell unvisited neighbour continuing path generation visiting new unvisited cell creating new junction process continues every cell visited causing computer backtrack way back beginning cell think animation right us algorithm generate maze though incorrect feel animation us algorithm num start unvisited cell make part maze mark visited num add unvisited neighbour cell set cell considered next num choose one cell set mark visited num check cell neighbour visited except one one caused cell added set first place else go num num continue till cell visited wrong
