function trying visualize reason plot show small snippet graph function function relevant value follows g c j gamma rmin sqrt j r theta g r c r j co theta sin theta gamma c r j c g j r sin theta c r j c co theta gamma g r j sin theta c r j c co theta exact value gamma j particularly significant although j meant large trying plot graph function using plot plot sqrt x arccos x sqrt x x regionfunction function x z rmin sqrt x really new come working mathematica seen online sometimes varying plotpoints maxrecursion help fix plot tried setting plotpoints well maxrecursion value high low w r mathematica default setting changing tended make mathematica really sluggish moreover produce plot also tried setting clippingstyle none plotrange none effect thinking maybe could large value might throwing mathematica impression mathematica could deal astronomical number literally anyway anybody insight going wrong helpful advice would much appreciated edit comment mentioned potential problem analogous function j gamma g r theta r r j co theta gamma sin theta r j r j sin theta r j co theta gamma r j sin theta r j co theta principle encounter issue plot manages fine
