far know turing machine widely used model computational theory know whether something could computed computed computed finite time p np following doubt num turing machine essentially black box model set input give set output could interaction computation interaction mean computation variable altered external factor num extension question non deterministic function turing complete num turing machine efficient model quantum computing going learned far answer num turing machine cannot handle interaction random behavior guaranteed even turing original paper num non deterministic function may bring turing machine halt num since turing machine cannot efficiently support superposition bit note well versed either computational theory quantum computing lot link beginner stuff would lot helpful reading article inspired question
