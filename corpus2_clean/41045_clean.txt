imagine chain ring labeled sequentially want make random size set number randomly chosen ring duplicate number allowed example set want count link member different set rule got one number n set next successive number n exists set b called link length next successive number n member set look closest successive number n existing set called link length next successive number also set loop ignore two end chain member set dangled ignore output number link length example cluster cluster link length link length link length link length loop cluster free end ignore count link length length length length also need know total number link two given cluster example cluster link cluster link cluster link
