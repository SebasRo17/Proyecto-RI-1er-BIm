let say following architecture module keyring keyring keyring new keyring def key def add key def update key def remove key encryptor connection def id def user id def protocol def include keyring def host def port def username encryption id def encryption id def passive def username decrypted given encryption key id keyring key self username encryption id def password decrypted given encryption key id keyring key self password encryption id see us keyring keyring coupled keyring module want use another project bring along keyring implement another module exactly right bad design
