thinking might others sure getting let explain mean static dynamic source static datastore meaning state non changing changed would new state old would considered stateless meaning longer known exist exist another way possibly looking static source might read written back without modification checksum exactly regardless duration time reading rewriting example photo file database record dynamic datastream meaning state known flux never expected per example live video audio feed stock market feed first let say loose mapping concept welcome feedback next onto core question two type source guess yes hybrid version two streaming fixed state example streamed checksum given unique checksum known single instance static flip side static could chained via say version control system played back version might viewed segment stream thing fact played back make source static another might source organically discovered simply unknown state question feedback request comment thanks
