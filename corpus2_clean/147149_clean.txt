recently building basic ray tracer c scratch learning teaching project previous release project let call reflection diffuse shading program render scene around made release b add highlight naturally assumed rendering time would increase imagine surprise scene rendered speedy result absolutely since object scene actually highlight curious tried narrow part actually making faster think narrowed calculation made reflection component component calculating reflection vector iteration ray tracing calculate vector input sharing two wondering c somehow caching result would account performance increase reflection rendering private color ray ray vector3d normal vector3d level calculate reflection direction var ray direction num ray direction normal normal normalize create reflection ray outside intersection point trace var new ray globals epsilon get color reflection var level num calculate final color var highlight public color getcolor light vector3d vector3d vector3d normal reflection vector var num normal normal normalize var dot dot product zero less mean angle two vector num highlighting occurs dot num var math pow dot var new color update previous number program running mode switched release number expecting first place without seems mode somehow culprit
