superuser asked possibly silly question processor using mathematical shortcut would like look possibility software application concept like write simulation japanese multiplication get benchmark large calculation utilizing shortcut v traditional cpu multiplication curious whether make sense try enter image description question like know whether software math shortcut described actually shortcut question programming concept utilizing simulation japanese multiplication program actually capable improving calculation speed doomed start answer question required determine whether experiment succeed rather whether logically possible thing occur program using concept example theory since addition computed faster multiplication simulation japanese multiplication may actually allow program multiply large number faster cpu arithmetic unit think would interesting finding prof multiplication number immense size shortcut calculate result via less instruction faster traditional alu multiplication would consider experiment success
