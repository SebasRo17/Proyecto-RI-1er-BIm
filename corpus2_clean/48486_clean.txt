unlike regionplot regionplot cope poorly logical combination predicate result sharp edge region plotted instead edge usually drawn rounded sometimes severe aliasing artifact observed many post site problem regionplot regionplot contourplot tailoring regionplot plotpoints regionplot plot always seem home made look limitation regionplot make edge appear jagged one solution noted silvia halirutan recently jens use contourplot instead appropriate regionfunction produce much higher quality result think would useful general purpose solution along line want single function used drop replacement regionplot automatically produce high quality result setting appropriate instance contourplot test example inspired post regionplot x z x x z enter image description look like created increasing plotpoints even edge perfectly sharp enter image description
