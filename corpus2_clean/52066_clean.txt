using mathematica want solve integral function contains determined undetermined part look like r theta z sqrt h z g theta h see h root term determined g remains undetermined function theta take integral function z theta v integrate integrate r theta z z h h theta pi result v int pi left frac pi h g theta frac h g theta frac pi h right theta see last term contains dependence theta therefore would like part integral solved particular would like result look like v frac pi pi h frac pi h int pi g theta theta frac h int pi g theta theta way force mathematica solve part function dependent known dependence variable towards integrate
