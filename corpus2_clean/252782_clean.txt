reviewing another programmer implementation calculate normal distribution cdf made suggestion either replace entire implementation built function use scipy common scientific library another programmer pointed neither math erfc scipy stats norm cdf provides precision guarantee documentation therefore cautious replacing approximation algorithm taken respected source documented bound honest thought doubt accuracy precision built library never crossed mind calling function like sin sqrt year without much thought math erf scipy stats norm cdf different concerned question num general documentation make special mention implied kind function completely accurate last decimal place within precision offered ieee double precision floating point num math erf scipy scipy stats norm cdf particular tell num man page sin say function may lose accuracy argument near multiple pi far num caveat exist sine periodic symmetrical seems burden placed caller obtain optimal accuracy hand mozilla documentation math sin say nothing accuracy precision mean fully accurate common knowledge math sin would accurate certain circumstance javascript like everywhere else
