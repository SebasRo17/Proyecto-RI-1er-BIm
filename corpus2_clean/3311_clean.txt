trying scan parameter space varying number parameter subject constraint interested number constraint curiosity reality constraint actual would look something like testscan c cm list listn ci constraint list take form x x initial x final x increment fed loop problem want change actual value x c j function x know x changed value example might constraint like x z want scan value z solve corresponding value x store possible solution list putting variable want scan array seems easier since mathematica see size array run proper number loop obviously put variable function like testscan c cm x x initial x final x increment would call like testscan c x x x x initial x final x increment x x initial x final x increment work since know mathematica know argument c thing x appears elsewhere would change code every time change number variable constraint naive straightforward generalization work try pas x x initial x final x increment list case mathematica might replace element list something else need able change value x
