recently faced task creating densityplot logarithmic colour scale providing appropriate legend since could find resource effect site like document solution definiteness suppose want plot function f x mathrm sinc x mathrm sinc frac sin x sin x diffraction pattern square aperture box side problem function reason logarithmic scale necessary function lot detail wide range order magnitude f thus naive densityplot produce either whited part sharp boundary region contrast acceptable one bright spot lot detail completely lost enter image description image produced densityplot sinc x sinc x colorfunction colordata deepseacolors plotpoints plotrange u u set automatic full respectively particularly plotting function zero solution problem must take argument minimum maximum value range interest range interest intrinsically hard impossible automated range finder obtain ok supply value hand give concrete example goal let nick final image answer
