complicated function f want plot function f x defined definite integral f x f x int x f mathrm dy apparently f cannot integrated closed form use nintegrate instead f x nintegrate f x plot f x x would like improve efficiency computation telling mathematica f simply f nintegrate f example mathematica save value f whenever f f needed mathematica substitute value f compute integral remaining interval essentially looking continuous version trick one us compute fibonacci sequence f n f n f n f n simple way implement help much appreciated
