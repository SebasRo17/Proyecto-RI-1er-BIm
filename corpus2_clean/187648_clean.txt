every example neural network image recognition read produce simple yes answer one exit node corresponds yes human face one corresponds human face understand likely simplicity explanation wondering neural network could programmed give specific example let say classifying animal instead saying animal animal would want response like dog fish bird snake etc one final exit node animal recognize sure must possible trouble understanding seems like due training algorithm train one exit node e dog weight neuron changed ideal state another exit node previously trained e bird begin deviate vice versa training network recognize one category would sabotage training done another category thus limiting u simple yes design make recognizer impossible misunderstanding algorithm two thing think either could train one neural network thing want classified somehow use construct greater super network example network dog network bird etc somehow add together create super network animal create kind ridiculously complicated training methodology would require incredibly advanced mathematics would somehow produce ideal neuron weight state possible output word insert math magic side note num specifically looking multilayer perceptrons kind neural network side note num first bulleted possible solution specific neural network iterating receive yes response good enough know could done fairly easily simple functional programming rather machine learning want know possible one neural network feed information receive appropriate response
