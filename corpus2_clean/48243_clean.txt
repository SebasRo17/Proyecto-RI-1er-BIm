following data test plot data mathematica get following figure overview way physical non local spin valve signal given temperature need method find two switching field actually negative value also considered present following hand make two linear fit one area signal constant mohm one area signal decreasing mohm mohm temperature first area nearly second area strong decrease signal fit line hand example would two line get intersection point interessted method take min intersection point hand ok one data set data set would take relativly long time looking way automate final result look like final result find especially difficult getting mathematica find correct value second line usually measured point line hope someone respond nice idea done automatically
