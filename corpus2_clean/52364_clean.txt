addition previus post regarding plotting surface bius strip realised eigenmodes bius strip either oscillation scalar field vector field meaning eigenmodes object shown wobble direction normal surface bius strip orientable like cylinder learned fact following represent transversal oscillation wobble direction normal surface mean oscillation vector field one component succesfully done help previous question solution case cylinder need represent longitudinal oscillation oscillation scalar field usually done showing change color object like shown example cylinder enter image description problem would like plot data x z f set polygon made using delaunaytriangulation mesh using graphic case bius strip x z data point f color previous question noted listsurfaceplot listplot working properly case bius strip solution plot strip set polygon generated mesh uniformly colored polygon surface look like enter image description want would like color polygon color equal average value f surrounding point provided data code original data rectangular time membrane data import nb transformed data parametrised bius strip color data th column data import nb code draw strip without color data f tri first case listdensityplot join data polygon idx idx infinity graphic graphicscomplex data yellow edgeform polygon tri boxed false aspectratio boxratios automatic sphericalregion true plotrange imagesize large tried find answer posting question solution either discrete point smooth plot andi need color specific polygon thank help hope problem clearly stated
