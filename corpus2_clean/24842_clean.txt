visualization need combination cylindrical segment visualize incident reflected refracted beam light surface got far following code graphic polygon polygon opacity cylinder cylinder scale cylinder result following output mathematica screenshot obviously remaining stump cylinder segment respective side reflection plane need removed want go complex approach like using parametric surface similar mathematical description cylindrical segment mainly performance reason method getting rather slow plot interesting method documented mathworld link extrapackages hidekazu knife package broken recent link end checked wayback maybe much simpler hack remove unwanted cylinder area
