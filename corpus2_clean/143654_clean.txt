wanting find solid answer question whether runtime check validate purpose ensuring client stuck end agreement design contract example consider simple constructor foo public foo bar handle bar handle throw std exception invalid would argue case user attempt construct foo without valid seem right verify bar valid inside foo constructor simply document foo constructor requires valid enough proper way enforce precondition design contract far everything read mixed opinion seems like num people would say verify bar valid num would say example consider case user verifies correct second unnecessary check also done inside foo constructor
