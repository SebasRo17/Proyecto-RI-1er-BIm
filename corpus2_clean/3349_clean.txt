using mathematica solve nonlinear partial differential equation doctoral research last year expert mathematica mathematics engineer trying express thermodynamic fluid dynamic phenomenon math equation subsequently need solving using numerical method find mathematica definitely way go big fan ndsolve function short background question publish numerical result obtained mathematica go obviously validate result previously published data thing say non linear pde h n h x h h x n h x nonlinear part scientific publication would mention method used solve equation eq bdf method newton kantorovich method etc solve mathematica vanilla style without using method option ndsolve thus allowing mathematica adapt select method cite method come across publication ask realize trace option available allows user figure method used intuitive suggestion input
