background store polygon color assigned face level occasion want use vertex color want store data efficiently e want duplicate data vertex level necessary consider following simplified data structure mind work tf tableform def def array def col def def pcl col col col col col col col tf col tf pcl tf pcl tf def represents data one instance shape def represents data shape p mm symmetry copy col def def represents main data structure currently store two shape pcl col col col col col col represents desired data structure currently store two shape first four vertex second two vertex set col show pcl far good however overwrite vertexlevel pcl mathematica generates set noval symbol pcl part assignment immediate value message question set required data structure change face level propagates vertex unless vertex modified particular shape
