task design search algorithm find secret number num num num test low test num second test high allowed test next num second every second add num subtract num number tell done may random also might random find approximate number fast obvious answer use binary search since penalty high guessing high would think need adjustment background need find speed system speed change slowly take num second guess guess low problem high system causing num minute delay goal get decent estimate speed relatively fast
