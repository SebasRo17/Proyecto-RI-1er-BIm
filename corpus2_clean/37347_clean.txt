since emphasis question finding workaround decided post question emphasis explanation behavior mathematica bessel function satisfies following identity j n z n j n z qquad n mathbb z accordingly fullsimplify n besselj n z besselj n z n integer true however fullsimplify n besselj n z besselj n z n integer besselj n z n besselj n z result expected work expected workarounds suggested previous question using tostring complexityfunction answer fullsimplify n besselj n z besselj n z n integer complexityfunction stringlength tostring question fullsimplify specified option value complexityfunction thus using default leafcount simplify j n z n j n z zero n mathbb z
