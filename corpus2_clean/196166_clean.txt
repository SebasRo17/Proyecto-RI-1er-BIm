hard time transforming math formula solve paper easily hard bring form generally possible bring math formula directly program transferred taking example theorem b c b defined straight forward apply formula c sqrt pow num pow b num currently hard time bringing intersection solved paper program assuming defined l one find intersection two line setting equal l1 o1 d1 l2 o2 b d2 o1 d1 o2 b d2 using pen paper would already defined value solve equation splitting equation three sub equation applying simple hope read hand writing enter image description actual problem substitution applied algorithmically know equation l1 l2 must transformed generalized formula directly translated like b c know hoping step step explanation either answer linked come formula algorithm searching know quite many website describe intersection two line would like understand find algorithm mathematical starting point
