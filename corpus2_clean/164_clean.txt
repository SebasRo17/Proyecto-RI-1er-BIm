way mathematica find currently free memory system mathematica run like utility free show command line found function show memory occupied mathematica course also program running system taking share memory number sufficient estimate free memory background currently something might fill memory forget call free hand subtract safety margin use memoryconstrained order prevent memory get completely filled quite unpleasant consequence like automate certainly could call free mathematica parse output number like avoid know next system update make subtle change free parsing fails give correct number
