programmer really interested mathematics actually excuse coding good also interested implementation mathematics result programming language hobby yesterday asked question mention way coding reason one decided delete first thanks rm rf compassionate advice combination two optimization problem one bilevel optimization like min x max omega f x omega linear programming min beta alpha leq b alpha begin bmatrix x beta end bmatrix mean combination two optimization problem sth like min x left theta max omega f x omega theta beta right alpha leq b theta mathematica try answer enter code f x w x exp w x exp exp w exp w exp exp w x exp w x exp g x numberq numberq nmaximize evaluate ab f x w w w nminimize g x x x bilevel minimization use linear programming command sth like p linearprogramming b b data matrix problem combine two optimization problem code idea explain problem mathematica one linear programming min max nature another minimax problem think may better convert linear programming min max form also read documentation findminimum nminimum make sense
