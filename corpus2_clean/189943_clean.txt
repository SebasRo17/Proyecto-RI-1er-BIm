currently implementing nasm like preprocessor assembler wondering correct way handling recursively included file see two way deal without hanging preprocessor even o num set maximum include depth num disallow including file recursively confused disallowing including file twice also far see second approach essentially job produce nicer message compare clang compiling file containing include cpp file included cpp num repeated many time file included cpp num cpp num num include nested deeply include cpp current way handling preprocessor similar include num mov asm num file home project test num mov asm num file home project test num mov asm included recursively approach disallowing recursive inclusion produce imho readable question preprocessor technique would killed disallowing recursive inclusion question language agnostic feel free give example language
