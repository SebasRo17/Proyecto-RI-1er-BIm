recurrence relation grows exponentially expressed closed form need integrate function plot think mathematica evaluates recurrence numerically every level recurrence grow huge expression nintegrate however seems trying find closed form equation integrate even turn symbolicprocessing tried option think including extracting relation function adding simplify recurrence completely stumped force mathematica stop using symbolic manipulation expression term anyone idea howavefunctions function q n recurrencetable sqrt q sqrt pi e q sqrt q n n plot howavefunctions q n n q nintegrate howavefunctions q n n q turn n work fine guess ultimately looking way tell recurrencetable evaluate lazily evaluate term variable numeric value never ever expand relationship symbolically tried inserting simplify recurrence mathematica apparently ignored
