designing compiled programming language bad idea require specific order compilation separate unit according dependency illustrate mean consider c c opposite suggesting multiple c file depend separate unit compiled particular order linked together final executable later mostly due header file enable separate unit share information thus unit able compiled independently language dispose header file keep source file option would actually include unit meta information unit file however would mean unit depends unit b unit b would need compiled unit unit could import unit b file thus obtaining information required compilation missing something really way go removing header file compiled language
