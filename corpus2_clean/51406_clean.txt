according excellent answer given leonid shifrin compile effectively really use indexed variable compile although may appear separately szabolcs writes use indexed variable indexed variable used symbolic calculation useful number variable used need changed programmatically back recently learning indexed variable getting head around generating formula programmatically simple example sum sine f x sin x b sin x b number term function variable generating function programmatically generate function two term run sinfunction b sin x b variable b range total sinfunction variable sin x b sin x b generated formula n term stay size call function many time different parameter looking see compile offer advantage like able compile function run various benchmark see happens compared uncompiled case obviously small expression probably benefit compiling documentation using exercise improve knowledge mathematica future hardcoded effort impractical probably somewhat redundant complexformula sin x b sin x b complexcompiledfunction function complexformula compile real b real real b real x real function complexcompiledfunction alternative need rethink approach altogether
