trying calculate point coordinate intersection vector plane using following code pointplaneintersection x z x z x z x z x z module det x x x x z z z z det x x x x x z z z z z x x x z z z found vector point origin vector vec pt however rather know plane defined point pointplaneintersection code need group plane triangle defined point triangle visualised show graphic yellow specularity white directive opacity edgeform gray thin polygon triangle red absolutepointsize point pt blue thick arrowhead arrow pt pt vec plotrange lighting neutral boxed false ax false tick none axeslabel x z axesstyle gray boxratios automatic aspectratio automatic imagesize viewpoint vec enter image description also note graphic produced vector direction away collection triangle looking solution matter whether vector towards away triangle ie code effectively flip vector round anyone suggest solution selecting triangle plane vector pass alternatively could anyone suggest good way fit surface eg bezier surface point find intersection vector surface thank reading problem dime
