let say want analyze running time algorithm sometimes say want find running time algorithm size n worst possible case denote n sometimes though see book paper saying need find expected time algorithm also sometimes average running time used expected time case useful find expected time instead worst case time edit think subtle difference expected running time average running time sure post want know exact difference
