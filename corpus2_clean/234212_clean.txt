like give lot context also state basic question top concisely possible feel free read little lot working music sequencer happy far using publish subscribe approach help decouple major component application helped testing refactoring however wondering component share awareness certain state without adding dependency new singleton abusing published event cache copy state specific example playhead another example explained playhead trivially represented instance immutable timecode measure beat tick essentially sub beat unit component subscribe beat event grab timecode update internal playhead property get functionality like editing see component track playhead also want track sequenceevents active playhead time e g note also need add functionality step region time segment say num measure similar playhead single moment time component similarly need track stumped represent object application without introducing tighter coupling current approach component listen event seem good fit right sequencer component emits beat event subscriber use update enhancing event include note etc smell bad event typically meant transient consumed occur event consumer update private state especially private state would identical consumer also event beat could signal change playhead e g user click another part score event approach seems multiple component dependent new playhead component bidirectional binding several component could detect change playhead set state even using dependency injection reduce dependency sake testing feel wrong case even context help illustrate problem read app currently several immutable type larger component may dependent may use without knowing timecode meter tempo fret pitch larger component construction time dependency include sequence represents score queried iterate random access sequence event sequencer handle playback timing currently emits beat note event scoreview render sequence tablature sheet music visually show playhead neckview show guitar neck actively playing note gui contains number simpler control including clock display update playhead component also instantiates scoreview neckview component wire way time wiring internal component via pubsub subscribe eventname handler pubsub pro con worked well point however case approach break num guitar neck show static marker currently selected note addition playing active marker animate note played requires tracking state note start time current playhead num clicking guitar neck toggle add remove note active sequence current playhead position would also updated score view num new feature allows step region allows stepping score increment like whole measure current step could larger single time point neck score view able display static marker note within step region seems duplicate problem applies playhead yet another approach smell bad new entity managed owned sequencer component publish event specifically like contain necessary seems bad misuse event update redundant state several component might mitigated event referenced immutable least subject change e g playhead state maybe would less bad approach still problem component cannot change playhead step region without publishing request sequencer handle change seems wrong maybe others solved exact problem elegantly thinking pointer appreciated
