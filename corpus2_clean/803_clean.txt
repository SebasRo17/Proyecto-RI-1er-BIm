background want explain sylow theorem detailed possible therefore rewriting proof using concrete example since answer question mathematica often always exceeded expectation lack tool adequately show table start compact description question elaborate required course question possible create group action table mathematica example let g left b ba ba right b ab ba let set subset size g left left right left b right left b ba ba right right define map f g time rightarrow g mapsto g group action table illustrating map f would size x cell containing element experience mathematica abstractalgebra package accept answer gap also
