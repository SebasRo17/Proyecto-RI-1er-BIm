writing simulation discrete event continuous system simulation example use state chart system dynamic queue side side theese reduced devs mathematically defined executable modelling formalism became stuck organize system architecture like use kind mvc pattern thought let make state machine model controller state diagram let make system dynamic model controller stock flow visualization also expressible via devs model would bit complicated translation devs fly inside controller multiple model representation reduced devs base model work directly devs base e g state machine visualized state diagram internally automatically converted base model architecture would recommend
