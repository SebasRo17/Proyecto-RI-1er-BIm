sometimes mathematica express result integration summation term symbolic derivative hypergeometric f function cannot simplify derivative using functionexpand fullsimplify case able express derivative term elementary function well known mathematical constant required manual work case case basis table hundred derivative already dealt function automatically replace value example contains case like derivative hypergeometric f sqrt sqrt sqrt sqrt log sqrt sqrt log sqrt sqrt arctan sqrt sqrt derivative hypergeometric f log log log catalan wonder anybody else tried solve problem found general automated approach anybody comprehensive table derivative willing share publish table anybody interested kept calculation yielded result
