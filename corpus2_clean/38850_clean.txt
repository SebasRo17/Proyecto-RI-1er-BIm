looking good approximation function containing logarithm especially value close zero used mathematica series command found something unexpected mathematica seems expand expression containing logarithm differently singularity expansion point example function log x x b x singularity x use series expansion point greater zero get expected taylor expansion however expansion point zero get frac log x b frac log x x b x strike logarithm retained function x result approximates function much better simple taylor series mathematica somehow separate logarithm expansion find quite intelligent would like know technique mathematica us called never came across thing would interested learning understand series use several expansion choses appropriate one depending problem maybe special procedure treat expression logarithm also found trial error mathematica result equal one would get first taylor expansion expression treating logarithm constant reduced logarithmic argument lowest power x justified
