taylor series cumulative normal distribution coefficient g piecewise sqrt pi mod sqrt pi however sum g x infinity give e x frac frac erf frac x sqrt expected plot sum g x x get something looking like exponential expected plot evaluate sum g x x get something looking like cumulative normal distribution expected trying understand different plot looked limit sum g x n n sum g x gave left frac e x gamma x frac x sqrt pi frac x sqrt pi frac right choice n tidiness similar result hold n tried clearly equal substituting x give frac presumably explains getting incorrect answer infinite sum different plot result depending placement evaluate explanation get different result without limit work around infinite sum case motivation trying combine coefficient infinite sum corresponding cumulative distribution sum gaussians centered different position giving result differ series expansion otherwise would obtain using series tested mathematica linux edit turn sum evaluate mathematica trace previous definition lying around caused evaluate solution avoid piecewise definition explicitly sum odd term
