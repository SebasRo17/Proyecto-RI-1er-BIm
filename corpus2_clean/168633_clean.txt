sorry confused question looking pointer working mostly application layer vague understanding operating system hardware want understand much lower level computing get really overwhelming somehow university took e processor get hard wired implement asm code always thought get done learned low level one question even possible hardware get hidden almost completely developer accurate say operating system software layer hardware one small example programming never come across need understand l2 l3 cache typical business application environment one almost never need understand assembler lower level computing nowadays technology stack almost anything guess whole point lower level provide interface higher level hand wonder much influence lower level example whole graphic computing thing hand theoretical computer science branch work abstract computing model however also rarely encountered situation found helpful thinking category complexity model proof verification etc sort know complexity called np kind impossible solve big number n missing reference framework think thing seems kind different camp rarely interact last week reading security issue somehow much different layer come together attack exploit almost always occur lower level case necessary learn detail osi layer inner working o etc
