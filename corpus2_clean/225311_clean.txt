trying implement graph structure c following interface public interface ivertex tvalue tvalue get ivertex tvalue neighbour get get get public interface tvalue ivertex tvalue source get ivertex tvalue destination get weight get public interface bool addvertex ivertex vertex bool bool addedge ivertex source ivertex dest weight bool ivertex source ivertex dest see responsibility vertex implementing ivertex interface tell adjacent vertex neighbor degree degree etc designing told friend mine graph one implement take responsibility operation like retrieving adjacent vertex finding degree etc point operation valid vertex becomes part graph point vertex standalone exist even outside graph vertex provide operation one think correct please share thought
