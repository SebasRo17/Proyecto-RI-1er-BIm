question asked site often look like dynamic enum answer range possible compile time solution question want dynamic enum generated look table db want something else similar solution using t4 build time generate enums db table work fine look table active flag mean look table anymore changed want somehow regenerate without redeploy table change often currently app want populate dropdown something query db value mostly remain static go db every time hence use enums also added benefit getting rid magic string number would static structs better sort caching look table advise welcome
