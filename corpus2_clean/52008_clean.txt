exercise wagner book p mathematica graphic attempt clear curvature define curvature function curvature x z module v x z v v norm v simplify norm norm v apply function co sin curvature co sin mathematica graphic could see get expected answer applying curvature function also would reduce even value substituted curvature co sin mathematica graphic however following wagner solution defines separate magnitude function work clear curvature define function find magnitude vector mag vec sqrt vec vec define curvature function curvature x z module v x z v v mag v simplify mag mag v apply function co sin curvature co sin mathematica graphic seems pretty clear using norm find magnitude vector work case specifically using norm seem simplify trigonometric result unless substituted norm co sin norm co sin simplify mathematica graphic fuzzy matrix knowledge really appreciate explanation norm seem return expected answer case also way find vector magnitude give correct answer without defining new function
