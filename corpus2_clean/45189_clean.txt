trying create function generate large random graph fixed degree sequence v v dot v n n number vertex graph mathematica function work randomgraph degreegraphdistribution v v vn unfortunatly useless large graph extremely slow number node increase tried build function instead generating new graph given degree sequence start non random matrix desidered degree sequnce v v dot v n rewire link keep degree fixed code partm b b confmodel module x old po pick x dimension po position x x pick randomchoice po old pick pick pick pick pick pick pick pick pick randomchoice po replacepart pick pick pick pick partm old pick pick pick partm old pick confmodel nest confmodel total boole positive however also function slow large graph cannot generate real randomized graph network theory model called configuation model would nice function directed undirected graph find test matrix would like generate random matrix degree sequence matrix thanks suggestion
