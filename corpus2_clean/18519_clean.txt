running mathematica following admittedly silly example suppose list list whose entry either true false suppose function truthfun evaluates randomly either true false would like call truthfun print false truthfun evaluates true first time one way using loop exit loop early using break documentation state break exit nearest enclosing loop example following work truthfun randomchoice true false truthfun false print false break print finished false false finished however often recommended mathematica user avoid using loop relatively slow mathematica think possible accomplish using table probably faster tried following unfortunately appears break work table truthfun randomchoice true false table truthfun false print false break false false false hold break also mathematica give error message break nofwd enclosing found break analogue break table thanks time
