basic gist agile method feature done developed tested many case released supposed happen quick turnaround chunk time sprint scrum process common part agile also tdd state test done first team work gui program lot specific drawing order provide test testing team need able work something least attempt perform thing trying test found way around problem much see coming trying write software targeted basically mysterious interface hard time although behavior fairly well specified exact process interacting various ui element come automation seems unique feature allow tester write automated script drive something exist even could lot thing end turning later missing specification one thing considered tester write test script like set step must performed described use case perspective automated human performed developer writing feature verified someone else tester later get opportunity automate script regression purpose mainly end catching team though testing part team actually falling behind u quite margin one reason apparently extra time developing script human perform happen crunch keep u developer waited get nothing done fault really bottle neck working fast possible process seems set often end go back month done fix bug tester finally gotten checking ugly truth like something team solve fail cascade get tester ahead u make actually time write test feature sprint without making u sit twiddle thumb meantime currently going order get feature done using agile definition would developer work num week tester work second week developer hopefully able fix bug come last couple day going happen even agreed reasonable solution need better idea
