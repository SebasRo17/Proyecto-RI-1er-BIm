half implemented proper key management dev shop soap web service key management web service used retrieve password system instance might make request service password say production postgresql db hit web service ad credential determines whether authorized receive db password sent response use service across software component instead storing db password static config file like tomcat context xml etc problem course automated process ad credential passed web service need stored somewhere obtain password db secured resource one simply need gain access used store ad credential submit web service authenticate authorize password requested resource classic key management problem hence trying figure way protect ad credential used access service someone mentioned kerberos began dig little bit understanding kerberos would num component client key management web service key management web service kerberos ticket granting ticket server understanding num client somehow obtains kerberos num client issue request resource say db key management web service supply ad credential instead supply num key management web service take ping kerberos server valid request num kerberos server responds say yes honor request db password sending back client response first anything understanding incorrect please begin correcting assuming less correct question setup num would client first obtain kerberos num kerberos expiration date would client request new num key management web service need implement specific tcp protocol speak kerberos http suffice kerberos protocol libs implement know easy google kerberos sure specifically looking confident understand architecture
