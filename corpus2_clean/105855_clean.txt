short question best way create maintain distribute software development tool chain background trying develop workflow process create isolated environment install deploy software tool chain embedded target tool chain typically would contain ide small set common tool looked two solution limitation hope find solution best implementation rational behind stand alone tool chain developer would able build exact matching crc etc well able rebuild x number year support legacy third option would use central build server plan nightly build still need able build fly working test bench remotely using build server suffice ideal goal deployed tool chain work window xp vista num excluding driver contain required information use tool chain excluding driver possible option option num full stand alone virtual machine pro open source packaging via virtual box num isolation guarantee tool interact one another con licensing multiple copy window best one developer could legally use window vm time running vm physically different lap top macbook pro dell num dell etc typically window see new cpu motherboard force activation large file maintain option num virtualized application pro packagers like application nearly version window note also free little licensing issue tool ides purchased compiler might additional restriction current compiler support usage smaller file maintain via scm svn git con difficult even possible get single file contains entire tool chain difficult even possible get tool see work one another seen issue closing thought may solution meet design goal would like find anyone else successful deployment
