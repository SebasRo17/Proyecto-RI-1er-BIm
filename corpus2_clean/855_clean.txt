solve differential equation numerically using ndsolve sometimes get error like ndsolve mxst maximum step reached according mathematica doc solution increase maxsteps example used maxsteps limit x mathematica calculated x increasing step maxsteps solve problem problem got mathematica evaluation ndsolve mxst maximum number step reached point x even want got limit x step time larger take huge huge computing time much may take core processor way compute quickly solve problem maxsteps way ode v x v x v x ini v soln ndsolve logicalexpand v x h v x ini v v x x x h matrix
