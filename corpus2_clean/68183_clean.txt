first background teacher training trying introduce boolean operator 10th grade teacher mentor looked worksheet prepared commented could let use single denote operator thing aware difference bitwise operator intended use integer perform bit twiddling conditional operator intended use boolean value prove point operator always thing set find example using bitwise boolean value would lead found example boolean bitwise boolean conditional num j num bitwise j num num num system println bitwise num conditional j num num num system println conditional num bitwise j num num num system println bitwise num conditional j num num num system println conditional example show changed second half expression would lead difference result since bitwise eager operator conditional behaves short circuit evaluate second half first half case case issue example would want change time comparision seem like robust way always averse multiple operation single production seems like something coding cowboy conscience maintainability would know domain need compact possible surely poor practice general explain choice encouraging use accepted coding convention software engineering could someone please give better even real world example using bitwise operator conditional expression
