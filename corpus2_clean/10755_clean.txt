new forgive question well posed duplicate earlier question although searched similar question without success trying present plot connection element correlation student performance set test question actually something like option omitted test graphplot test method circularembedding vertexlabeling true edgelabeling false mathematica graphic label question want order vertex ascending order e want vertex consecutive label adjacent circle like clock e image construct making connection less consecutive test graphplot test method circularembedding vertexlabeling true edgelabeling false graphic mathematica idea insists ordering vertex order encounter list connection e example sorting list connection fix problem issue seem well documented suggestion workaround thanks advance
