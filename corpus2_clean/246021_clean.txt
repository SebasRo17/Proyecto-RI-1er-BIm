looking reasonably space efficient way encode arbitrary precision decimal e g bigdecimal sorting bit pattern encoding lexicographically number sorted numerically related stackoverflow question one simple naive approach would convert number ieee like representation num byte exponent rr obviously quite inefficient representation perhaps approach optimization possible arbitrary precision integer encoding need support operation sorting possible decoding number reasonably efficient mean cramming bit together byte like ieee num want unnecessarily large field remain mostly empty large number situation would case num byte exponent motive encoded number later processed scheme take millisecond per byte runtime efficiency encoding decoding hand much issue anything less num m num byte still overshadowed runtime scheme liked also note decimal representation precision issue due binary stuff
