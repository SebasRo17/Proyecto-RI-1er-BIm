possible piecewise function process vector comparison example input vector x would like define function give x x x otherwise e would like output define function myfunc x piecewise x x x x obviously work way let mathematica know want compare x elementwise apply particular value segment appropriate used r programming use ifelse function job relatively new mathematica know possible thanks
