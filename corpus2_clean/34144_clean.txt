trying reproduce textured head mathematica using kind net head contains feature face texture look like enter image description supposed look something like enter image description code using listsurfaceplot import inputimage obj vertexdata plotstyle texture texture mesh none maxplotpoints texturecoordinatefunction give enter image description another problem texture reflected origin ie face plastered back head well instead black back head mesh suppose suppose head centered origin also need texture follow head change coordinate mesh later attempted using graphic edgeform texture texture graphicscomplex mesh polygon polygon vertextexturecoordinates mesh give instead enter image description need able reproduce mathematica coordinate transformation need apply thereafter wrap mesh texture possible edit link model located edit tried converting obj ply import inputimage ply userextensions import inputimage ply userextensions gave output texture u texture v bunch number length guess texture coordinate u horizontal v vertical per link provided rahul narain attempted create list coordinate two list following manner texturecoord import inputimage ply userextensions import inputimage ply userextensions transpose tried graphic edgeform texture texture graphicscomplex mesh polygon polygon vertextexturecoordinates mesh give enter image description
