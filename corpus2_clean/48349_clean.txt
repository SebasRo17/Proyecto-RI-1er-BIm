get mathematica return function call conditionally unevaluated expect may use slightly mysterious hold function toy example suppose want define algebraicq algebraicq x return true false element x algebraics evaluates true false otherwise return algebraicq x like predicate function ask element x algebraics true unevaluated edit first thing came mind work see definition algebraicq element algebraics function algebraicq pi e return element e pi algebraics instead desired algebraicq pi e parens used place bracket platform limitation tried posting recommendation tried fresh kernel pictured result also tried algebraicq true element x algebraics algebraicq false element x algebraics based earlier suggestion seems work final working solution based szabolcs answer algebraicq result element algebraics result matchq result true false test expected algebraicq pi pi e true false algebraicq e pi
