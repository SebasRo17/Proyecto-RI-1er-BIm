note question duplicate one specifically pattern matching engine explicitly excluding pattern call back full evaluation e patterntest condition others like consider excluded well state problem specifically given problem yes answer decided finite time appropriate turing machine always exist mathematica pattern involving neither patterntest condition together appropriate encoding input data match iff turing machine would give yes input data make clear mean give example problem solvable turing machine pattern matcher given natural number determine whether number even odd obvious turing machine solve problem finite time pattern matching solve problem encode natural number list many etc pattern implementing test simply patternsequence
