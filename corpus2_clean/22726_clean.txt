suppose following list monomials x x x x x x could manipulate get x x x x x x order total degree multivariate monomials important although x x degree x come first detail vague sorting condition let define problem following could considered pascal triangle monomials x x x x x x x goal ultimately extract number monomials triangle symmetrically centerline starting top moving outward centerline moving next line triangle needed example want monomials get x x want monomials get x x x x x tricky case want monomials x x x x x x form form triangle creating following matrix easily generated x x x x x x x x x x x x need list n monomials assuming n valid number lends symmetrical requirement generate size ceiling sqrt n matrix flatten resulting matrix obtain list similar one originally posted feel could sorted based symmetry rule would allow obtain desired number monomials anybody better approach would grateful
