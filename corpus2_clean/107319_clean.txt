read wikipedia iterative deepening depth first search space complexity bd b branching factor depth goal wikipedia also give decent pseudocode def root goal depth num solution none solution solution root goal depth depth depth num solution def node goal depth node goal depth node goal depth depth num node goal node child expand node child goal depth num none question space complexity include branching factor assume expand node take b space expand us generator take constant space case would space complexity still branching factor situation even possible expand constant space generator
