using basic mathlink programming work wanted create sophisticated mathlink program came across book mathlink network programming mathematica written around era mathematica version neat interactive gui example using mathlink based around piece mathlink code created author book called serializer exe essentially mathlink template program designed sit kernel front end communicate modify communication work almost run machine using mathematica one little sticking point maybe someone help give idea whats going starting point mathlink template program compiled using c thing called serializer exe program added custom evaluator mathematica via kernel configuration option code run kernel e run serializer exe sent actual kernel program spawn raw mathlink program added list evaluator option frontend evaluatornames try set mathlink connection front end going code step step place stuck pair line code look like frontendexecute evaluatorstart nameofrawmathlinkevaluator messagelinkactivate messagelinkactivate custom function defined c code seems similar linkactivate usual math link activation function user mathlink know linkactivate called kernel block evaluation end program activates well program hang activate never answered however evaluatorstart defined anywhere throw error message recognize packet evaluatorstart wait forever return linkactivation never happens give exact instruction recreating error comment say exact error come evaluatorstart changed random string letter sure program really definition evaluatorstart trying deduce right line code put googling seems frontend token called evaluatorstart would called something like frontendexecute frontendtoken nb evaluatorstart nameofrawmathlinkevaluator messagelinkactivate nb argument must refer notebook sure put tried evaluationnotebook luck help would appreciated following question mathematica frontendexecute evaluatorstart name could recreate functionality mathematica anyone use serializer exe modern version mathematica anyone else created advanced interactive mathlink program like interactive graphic system featured mathlink network programming mathematica publically available code edit recreate would require adding serializer exe mathematica launchdirectory running short code mathematica provide file code anyone actually want help try solve
