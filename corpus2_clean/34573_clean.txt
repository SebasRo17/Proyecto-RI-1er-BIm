interested deriving finite difference equation mean play around indexed quantity example function f x could discretize grid grid point j typical finite difference model might give f j g j j f j b j f j c j f j know g b c might want thing like rearrange f j find expression f n j arbitrary n find coefficient f j etc might also want use simultaneous equation like best way representing kind math perform manipulation thanks mark edit simple example two difference equation f j fold j g j g j g j gold j b f j f j function f g fold gold b known would like able solve g j term knowns g index eg g j paper use first equation give expression f j f j insert rh bottom equation would like extract coefficient thing like g j final expression g j mathematica
