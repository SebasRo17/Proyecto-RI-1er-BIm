suppose two matrix b whose entry function x suppose product entry form sum k ik b kj two summands corresponding k k want evaluate two summands point say x pick larger summand function x form new matrix c write code follows think mistake data type c x x x b x x x first create matrix c whose entry set forj j j c x j j j j k k k c j k b k j c x j x k b x k j c x j c x j table c x j j matrixform output see entry resulting matrix wrong
