experiencing curious behaviour simplify handling expression involving power mathbf mathbf x x unknown example take equation x ask mathematica simplify calling simplify x rightly answer original equation equivalent hence clearly mathematica simplify know taking power something non zero cannot produce zero however ask x result simplify merely x e started remains true adding assumption x integer changing simplify fullsimplify e fullsimplify x assumption element x integer would much convenient obviously serious problem nuisance need simplify number equation would like quickly see result relatively uncluttered form also curious thing work way e complex power treated much differently real power thank solution problem explanation phenomenon solution would way teach mathematica eliminate factor like x equation like x something
