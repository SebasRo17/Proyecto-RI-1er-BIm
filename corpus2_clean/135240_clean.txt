starting research project need nail programming language 3d graphic api creating environment field molecular cell biology simulating large range experiment ongoing project keep expanding growing size experiment done discrete time encompass complex physic engine pretty graphic importance audio ubuntu environment developing pair investigated thus far flexible scalable lib dependency organization maven oo full control graphic full game library includes maybe bit overkill need c high speed low level oo opengl full control graphic maya built physic engine infrastructure already place proprietary free matlab heavily math based difficult maintain scale simulink proprietary free least familiar maya suggested friend good approach would maya good solution would good selection case thinking jmonkey would overkill kinda feeling maya pairing investigate also anyone experience modifying existing physic library flexibility complexity ie bullet unsure point start scratch try modify expand existing one thought feedback suggestion would greatly appreciated thanks
