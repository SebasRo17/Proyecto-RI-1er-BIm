trying integrate following expression f p p p p f p p p f p p f p f x u e x u e x u e pdf logistic distribution also positive integer tricky part want integrate value p value result forming valid probability distribution ie p variable must greater zero less one sum tried using definite integral following limit substituting p p p p p p p p p p work simplified version problem f term p variable soon use take minute return input instinct analytically found term term also findable term question anyone suggestion get mathematica working larger problem tied logistic distribution using thought simple cdf would make problem easy mathematica anyone suggest similar shaped distribution would make problem tractable
