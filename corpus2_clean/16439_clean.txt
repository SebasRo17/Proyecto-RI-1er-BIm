trying find root solution differential equation using nsolve reduce get root using iterative method found physicsforums com method solves problem choose increment thus case might give headache wonder general approach following sample code data ndsolve x x sin x x pi x x x interpolatingfunction first attempt success sol nsolve x data nsolve ifun inverse function used nsolve solution may found use reduce complete solution information inversefunction interpolatingfunction second attempt success sol reduce x data reduce inex reduce unable solve system inexact coefficient system obtained direct rationalization inexact number present system since many method used reduce require exact input providing reduce exact version system may help reduce interpolatingfunction third attempt work fine manually choosing dt could cause problem equation dt tmin tmax union table findroot x data tinit tmin tmax tinit tmin dt tmax dt dt sametest ab elegant method find root range
