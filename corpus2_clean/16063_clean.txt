trying oscillator algebra mathematica trouble sorting simplifying expression using ncalgebra package help improve property noncommutativemultiply mathematica however create huge list rule replace term using algebra quickly becomes impractical since get enormous expression sift term see simplifies add rule wondering way write sorting function would take elementary expression change list permute element list sort expression fairly new mathematica would eventually like write small package would allow kind manipulation example term like b c dagger b c etc commute dagger dagger would like sort thing dagger operator left mathematica use fact b c commute rewrite expression right assigning rule every type term appears calculation number term become unmanageable
