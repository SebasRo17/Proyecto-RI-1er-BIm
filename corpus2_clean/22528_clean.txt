following problem one may showed plotting large data collection suppose data set say million point listlineplot use point create plot unfortunately point close together overlap plot become irrelevant wondering quick way mathematica get rid redundancy plot term redundancy depends course image resolution size let u work following example rx n accumulate prepend randomvariate exponentialdistribution n ry n accumulate prepend randomvariate normaldistribution n x rx ry listlineplot table x length x one many possible plot generated random sample plot generated point may even visible since point overlap part point question built function give u way remove redundancy thus reducing size figure precise plot exported raster plot jpeg png problem problem arises export pdf eps resulting vector format plot point take display reality point display naive way remove point initial data follows listlineplot table x length x figure imagine happen skip point time listlineplot table x length x figure possible solution first idea came mind loop data see point close sufficiently close use parameter decide remove one solution remove point initial data set want make remove important feature plot rd plot possible solution solution export rasterize final figure wanted line plot excludes ax object done outline plot make vector figure keep mind trying reduce size point plotted making plot resemble mathematica plotted naively idea implement idea even better one achieve desired result
