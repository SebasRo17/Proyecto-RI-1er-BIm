say range value anything else want iterate range stop indeterminate point stopping could anywhere range iterating sequentially good cause early value accessed often later value bad thing wear also reduces performance since must traverse extra value randomly iterating better average increase hit rate fewer value accessed finding right one also distribute access evenly average problem standard randomly jumping around result value accessed multiple time automatic way determining checked thus whole range exhausted one simplified contrived solution could make list pick one random remove time pick one fromt set remaining item unfortunately work small list forced example say creating game program try guess number picked show many guess took range num num instead asking num num num guess randomly could create list num number pick randomly remove range num num really create num billion item list seen couple implementation supposed provide uniform distribution none area also supposed unique e repeated value practical way randomly uniquely iterate range
