trying create dynamic environment specify using two locator initial condition position x velocity angle alpha particle simplify assuming initial position restricted circle velocity angle always respect angle relation normal vector perpendicular tangent vector mean end would like parameter x initial position positional locator initial angle defined angle vector positional locator angle locator normal vector main problem resides coupling positional locator angle locator move positional locator would like angle locator moved way initial angle preserved manipulate using two locator one position initialpoint one initial angle pt dynamicmodule initialpoint pt style graphic dashed circle locator dynamic pt pt initialpoint normalize initialpoint locator dynamic initialpoint initialpoint normalize plotrange aspectratio selectable false however dynamically pick initialpoint second locator follow order keep pt always initial angle preserved
