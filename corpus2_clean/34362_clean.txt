old would like make locator follow plot giving coordinate move really know start one would like dynamic plot look something like enter image description code follows plot sqrt x x plotrange epilog pointsize large red point locator showing coordinate moved along plot obviously movement locator need constrained plot constrained coordinate circle wolfram documentation example enter image description following code deploy dynamicmodule p graphic red disk locator dynamic p p normalize plotrange basically behaves similar way google graph enter image description coordinate appear top right plot new timothy wofford solution gave work great function like sqrt x run difficulty complex value encountered example enter image description generated code f x pi x zeta x x pi zeta x manipulate plot f x x epilog pointsize large red tooltip point p f p plotlabel p f p p locator appearance none appearanceelements none show red screen locator move screen imaginary value generating error screen follows enter image description way preventing happening ie stopping locator moving past
