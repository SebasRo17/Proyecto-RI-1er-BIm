following code ser x fourierseries pi x x n chop give series try plot surprisingly result even similar function passed fourierseries comparison used code plot ser x pi x x pi pi output fourier transform function given documentation work correctly one tried using directly formula given documentation default formula used nintegrate give expected result done wrong bug addition answer comment code one see fourier coefficient computed via nintegrate quite different one generated fouriercoefficient update pointed comment setting generateconditions true appears yield correct result generating condition though needed
