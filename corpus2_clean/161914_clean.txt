dear fellow programmer developing software simulates vehicular traffic part process called assignment concerned assigning vehicle route use kind shortest path finding algorithm traditionally people dijkstra certain scientific literature seems indicate alternative give significant improvement perhaps due nature graph hence using dijkstra well small problem arose treat traffic link span road intersection edge intersection node get classic uni directional graph approaching intersection turn frequently depends coming whereas traditional graph take edge node resolved problem quite easily representing link intersection pair call node since need traverse link get subsequent point choice edge would defined traversal get typical graph result stored simple table n x n n number unavoidable drawback typical network simulation say num intersection somewhere around num link e n obviously counted term intersection v log e might argue num num constant factor practical standpoint slow thing quite bit increase storage space x anyone idea restructure improve performance necessarily alternative algorithm perhaps structure fit graph way
