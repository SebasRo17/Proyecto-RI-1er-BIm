note fixed mathematica display large sparsearray object default way look something like sparsearray mathkernel process keep using cpu front end hang eventually display kernel responding dynamic evaluation abort continue waiting dialog pressing abort kill kernel process looking way avoid work around reproducing problem try g randomgraph adjacencymatrix g note missing semicolon second result displayed mathematica hang sense beachball cursor show intermittently o x kernel us cpu one core subsequent evaluation impossible kernel killed mathematica hang observation displaying sparsearray putting semicolon adjacencymatrix g avoid problem displayed form sparsearray short true even cell expression problem caused overwhelming amount data sent front end still want keep track many non zero element sparsearray would like display disabling dynamic updating evaluation menu change anything would usable temporary workaround problem appear using command line version kernel mathematica killing kernel manually using front end cause internal self test error kernel c believe bug contact support analysis problem happens would useful work around perhaps way find number non zero element quickly maybe could write alternate format sparsearray object version system info happens mathematica o x gb ram someone o x try reproduce problem
