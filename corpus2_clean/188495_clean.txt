follow question asking unit testing library scientific algorithm similar problem different project working 3d graphic engine framework abstraction directx opengl webgl silverlight wpf basically whatever 3d api c called rendering net scenario following project developed small team colleague mine working office computer scientist much software engineering community practice even hard time convince switch subversion git publish project codeplex project getting big around 80k line c cover directx opengl shader model num one man project like one described linked question also want encourage open source community collaborate far testing writing small application involve initializing device resource setting scene drawing thing know make different mean design small test case test specific feature framework like resource allocation primitive tessellation shader compilation etc without recreate entire engine initialization case think useful mock general test correctness rendering algorithm visual image animated scene right clever thing come render scene software renderer directx opengl compare pixel pixel tiny variation apis make resulting image different enough fail test without actual bug correct testing approach
