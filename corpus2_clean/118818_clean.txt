hear lot keeping method short heard lot programmer say using region tag within sure sign long refactored multiple method however seems many case separating region tag within superior solution refactoring multiple method suppose whose computation separated three rather distinct phase furthermore stage relevant computation extracting new method gain u reuse benefit extracting phase far tell gain readability separate scope phase help prevent modification particular phase accidentally breaking another phase however achieved without extracting phase region tag allow u collapse form readable added benefit longer leave place file decide expand examine simply wrapping phase creates scope work benefit way pollute level scope three method actually relevant inner working fourth immediately refactoring long series short method seems reuse equivalent premature optimization introducing extra complexity order address problem many case never arises always extract one phase later opportunity reuse arise thought
