happy build environment linux based ubuntu num equipment embedded software developing would like optimal mix wish use proven tool library able develop linux window ideally use tooling platform fast development cycle especially window note paying good stuff definitely option note also c linux two hard requirement everything else open debate currently use boost stl library obtaining much platform independence possible codeblocks cross platform ide use gcc tool chain linker debugger make excellent open source project limitation biggest problem current environment num compared m visual c feel gcc slow lot time spent compiling especially linking gcc pre compiled header support give way near performance gain vc boost really need also statically linking boost library take forever would using dynamic linking change much num codeblocks support vc property file make difficult enforce build option project workspace num related build speed codeblocks compile project support like vc changing single source file codeblocks spends much time checking need compile file know changed thought far biggest issue fast reliable linker platform develop solved development multiple platform intel c compiler option really need performance optimization compiler consider cross compilation use make based build seems solution prof difficult use ide build tooling window linux find make difficult holding back single product equivalent maturity visual studio ide tool chain available window linux matter linux much simpler would life decided develop linux right use window supported non development software window limited linux expertise company thought please
