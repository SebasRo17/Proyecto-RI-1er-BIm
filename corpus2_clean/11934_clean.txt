greeting first post also seasoned programmer advice pertaining coding directly related problem stated welcome trouble piece code seemingly compute intend fact seems nothing certain line question actually contain two part specific problem located trying make computation kernel c involving data gathered kernel kernel b data gathered b complex number send c form table difference modulus squared table data result computation c real number structure defining relevant table purpose become clear go datalist datalist datalist datalist datac letting kernel aware definition also letting certain table shared among kernel distributedefinitions datalist datalist datalist datalist datac setsharedvariables datalist datalist code us parallel kernel two run rather heavy numerical integration third kernel given purpose control stop integration via control object ndsolve stepmonitor gather data complex number table datalist also datalist integration point chosen occur regularly point time pas data table datalist datalist shared among kernel want use table data kernel c run problem kernel c want make said table contain real number act stop letting code progress condition met go go shared real number act control parameter set kernel b piece code occurs kernel c go go pause appendto datac sqrt sum ab datalist h k datalist h k k h print broke computation halt command nothing come kernel c never get see message broke checked yes indeed kernel c get data datalist intended since could let print number screen ok kernel c halt point mentioned computation loop kernel c usually fast one change table data done length time enough loop take second change made datalist second nothing lost parallel way entire thing parallel paralleltable kernel mention set work paralleltable three kernel active set three space table computing two ndsolve one control computation perhaps bad way thought desirable standpoint ndsolve ii regarding parallel computing communication sharing data kernel seems rather stable tool setsharedvariable like incorporating data gathered kernel used computation parallel kernel b situation seem get delicate dont situation know say thing seem concrete example would specific problem thanks advance advice patrik edit response jagra jagra hey thanks input looking post linked although link incomplete missing guessing post data gathering indeed gathered master kernel since direct communication kernel kernel b made impression function setsharedvariable kernel b read alter shared variable alteration made master kernel aswell parallel kernel power case kernel b produce table data set shared variable kernel c read data gathered b master kernel thus kernel c hindrance create new table data data b code get stuck create simple table edit found found going wrong instance problem detail written loop concerned evaluating wrong evaluating although subtle manner problem taking long whole parallel process gave nothing useful kernel clashing kernel made change taking long time loop wanted insert value table specified get whole list data pick current one go take considerably longer time ask whole list data evaluated form noticed time go loop approximately doubled time good since list data kept growing solution simply use unevaluated time wanted write said table took element interest evaluated form reduced computing time back constant time loop computed subtle part loop computed processor usage went almost zero jumping around somewhere interval naturally thought something died computation guess kernel communicating real slow master tip coding parallelism use unevaluated increase speed instance like read every book library day go get read one book actually wanted read day merely acknowledging rest book available day want read
