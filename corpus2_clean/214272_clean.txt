presently clock app calculates scratch every iteration mean num corrupt bit double heavy creation deletion well wary running indefinite calculation double float n corrupt bit normally accompany every step would like know alternate way io app transform position clock hand num maybe log n corrupt bit n step particular wondering corruption would step rotate hand back zero position meaning rotation transformation num last rotation hand received rotate forward new angle hand step objective c floating point arithmetic ever case excluding exception like indicating number corrupt x x num exactly case seen illustrating floating point corruption bit include saying num num num num num seen textbook example form x x num exactly question whether raster image transformed angle x angle x original self may preceding suggestion would work fine num angle usual corruption image drawn transformed minimum corruption complexity meaning fewest corrupt bit end n calculation rendering clock num log n approach thanks
