suppose want solve ode diracdelta source term following example dsolve correctly ndsolve understandably miss delta provides solution corresponding zero right hand side ex first dsolve x x diracdelta x x nu first ndsolve x x diracdelta x x plot ex plot nu plot dsolve solution plot dsolve solution plot ndsolve solution enter image description anyway around using ndsolve without converting system integral form happy lend ndsolve hand say telling look piecewise continuous solution x provide jump condition example eps eps dsolve solve real equation really interested multidimensional nonlinear bit messy replicate
