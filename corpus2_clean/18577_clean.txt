written code need little feed back want make subscript distributive across addition multiplication mimic short hand added vector example p k p k lh short hand rh index allowed coefficient finally need exception numeric quantity allowed take index go code clear subscript subscript plus b idx subscript idx subscript b idx subscript time b idx time subscript idx subscript b idx subscript numberq idx define subscript function already built symbol mathematica code seems really work know deserve pat back clever reprimanded overwriting built symbol bad coding behavior also obvious way anyone see piece code going wrong thanks
