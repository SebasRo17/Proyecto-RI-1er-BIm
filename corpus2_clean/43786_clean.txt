help distinguish various dimension model output vector series time interval construct list model next would like compute outer product vector time step think something like following tdim vecdim modeldim veclist supposed represent output model veclist table v model model modeldim tdim vecdim outerproduct x outer time x mapthread outerproduct veclist veclist think right thing mix model time step far tell taking outer product appropriate level however would like able case model model different number time step see neat way model different number time step get error rank list changed tdim tdim veclist table v model model tdim vecdim veclist table v model model tdim vecdim veclistall join veclist veclist mapthread outerproduct veclistall veclistall problem mind list much much larger finding efficient way would great help suggestion would hugely appreciated
