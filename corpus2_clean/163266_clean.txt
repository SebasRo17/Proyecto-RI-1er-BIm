wondering difference inheritance composition examined concrete relevant argument particular example inheritance def self self doa self dob def doa self pas def dob self pas def doa self def dob self b x v composition def init self b self self b b def self self self b x doa dob note composition missing actually shorter particular advantage one think composition useful plan reuse doa another context inheritance seems easier additional reference variable initialization doa access internal good bad thing inheritance group logic b together even though could equally introduce grouped delegate inheritance provides preset user composition initialization factory user assemble logic skeleton basically like examine implication inheritance v composition heard often composition prefered like understand example course always start one refactor later
