trying solve pde reaction diffusion equation getting decent looking solution also getting inconsistent bc initial condition warning wanted check logic coding ok whether utterly wrong set equation like ko omega ro eqn p r p r r r omega p r p r ko specify boundary initial condition initially region r p across write iv p r boundary condition r steady concentration oxygen diffusing region towards r slowly consumed rate frac ap p k reduced zero r give boundary condition believe dirichlet bcs bcs p p ro solve plot write ndsolve eqn iv bcs p r r ro plot p r r ro plot something look relatively like expect however warns boundary condition inconsistent plotting think plotting something remiss code logic also add guess r likely underestimate however increase say r get error stating warning scaled local spatial error estimate direction independent variable r much greater prescribed error tolerance grid spacing point may large achieve desired accuracy precision singularity may formed smaller grid spacing specified using maxstepsize minpoints method option wonder condition unrealistic ie oxygen would consumed point true boundary something subtle missing
