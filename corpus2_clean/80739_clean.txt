developing oop sometimes interface contract given library cannot alter let call interface j consumes object implement interface inside small part interface definition needed class created project let call one overhead implementation everything inside interface j want implement subset functionality interface j solution far satisfy implementing every aspect j throwing notimplementedexceptions user object would seem object conform interface j consumer object accept object implementing interface j rely integrity object implementing newly defined interface prohibits using object implement interface j although interface j fully compatible interface letting custom object implement interface j would create significant overhead need functionality able alter interface j would create super interface k subset functionality interface j make interface j inherit interface k cannot alter interface j oriented solution problem best solution still implementing interface j oop way superclass interface without altering
