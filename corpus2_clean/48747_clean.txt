believe relatively easy problem solve able find elegant solution need compare two binary image count element either image intersect overlap would like count many blob intersect quadrilateral blob may intersect multiple quadrilateral intersection would count multiple intersection within quadrilateral blob count would like count number quadrilateral intersecting blob would like count number blob intersecting quadrilateral image quadrilateral blob created bounding box based blob image following createpolygon image module binarizedimage boundaryboxescoords polygon size size imagedimensions image binarizedimage binarize image boundaryboxescoords last componentmeasurements morphologicalcomponents binarizedimage minimalboundingbox polygon graphic red polygon boundaryboxescoords imagesize size plotrange first size last size tried count image item overlapping element counting object consisting amalgamated color help condition blob intersect quadrilateral multiple time using inverse also helpful solving two problem hoped createhits quadimage blobimage module compositeimage graythreshold hit compositeimage colorconvert imagecompose binarize blobimage quadimage grayscale graythreshold hit first last componentmeasurements morphologicalcomponents binarize compositeimage graythreshold count createhits image image think ideal solution lie approach tried however visual solution like extract coordinate blob quadrilateral area compare object list determine overlap e g blob share coordinate quadrilateral figure however use output morphologicalcomponents find information retrieve coordinate object store cluster separate item bothersome morphologicalcomponents clearly identified thing could brute force code create separate image blob quadrilateral comparison computation way besides much computationally expensive said particularly elegant
