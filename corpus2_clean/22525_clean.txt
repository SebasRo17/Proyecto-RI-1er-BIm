problem find procedure give coefficient make certain functional expression vanishing example polynomial p x one variable x given p x x x would like mathematica give solution p x consider complicated example closer real task dealing suppose equation k x e x k e elliptic integral matter linearly independent function x unique solution course case polynomial one require vanish coefficient p x x similarly one expand k x e x power x find make several first term expansion absent elegant standard way handle task would like somehow explain mathematica expression fixed coefficient x variable equation must hold every x thus giving constraint
