planning implement websocket protocol currently learning handshake header must structured according link num prove handshake received server take two piece information combine form response first piece information come sec websocket key header field client handshake sec websocket key header field server take present header field e g base64 encoded version minus leading trailing whitespace concatenate globally unique identifier guid form unlikely used network endpoint understand websocket protocol sha num hash num bit num num base64 encoded see section num concatenation returned server handshake concretely example sec websocket key header field server would concatenate form server would take sha num hash giving 0x4f 0xc0 0x4f 0x06 base64 encoded see section num give would echoed sec websocket accept header field actually decode base64 decoder decoder give e think going decrypted original using sha num properly far understanding num server received sec websocket key client combine guid generated server becomes like num server applies sha num base64 encoding onto key becomes send back order turn websocket accept original need decode using base64 decrypt sha num must receive original back however actually attempt give weird mentioned could please correct part wrong thank
