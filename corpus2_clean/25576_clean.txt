visualising addition new node edge graph watch grow something mathematica suited default however type animation really help convey emergence graph feature like clustering untrained audience seems lot interest many user working graph mathematica example two question topic one two going ask basic question specific seems jlink popular tool many user seem comfortable advocate use programming java generally example see leonid answer previous question unfortunately programmer documentation jlink us terminology head hit wall frustration really need pointer good java tool dynamic graph visualisation example graphstream question visualise growth dynamic graph question using jlink graphstream third forth element list beginning end time period edge exists dynamicgraph infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity infinity many part question many solution guess answer need address one part step process actually use graphstream jlink consists bunch jar file notebook directory start something like need jlink installjava addtoclasspath notebookdirectory quick summary layman term basic jlink would great workable approach generate graph mathematica export file supported graphstream eg dot graphml use jlinked tool read file display animation little like szabolic answer yet understand format make graph readable dynamic format answering part would huge help execute code ideally within mathematica hope question use many others answer cover step process link example using jlink might aid learning would greatly appreciated
