two dimensional streamline plot fluid dynamic simulation wondering possible somehow allow mathematica treat streamline plot plane three dimensional plot apply camera perspective transformation resulting three dimensional plot provide bit information three dimensional scene example shown running fluid dynamic simulation result simulation obtain series two dimensional windflow velocity field cross section true three dimensional windflow velocity field field quantify direction speed wind environment subject geometry constraint scene user defined parameter boundary condition three dimensional scene d max red plane inserted provide desired perspective planar streamline plot visualization purpose interested transforming overlaying one two dimensional streamline plot velocity field onto three dimensional scene two dimensional streamline plot take place red plane image although could simply rasterize streamline plot treat texture plane render scene d max hoping overlay streamline plot vector graphic addendum per yves suggestion supplied subsampled version windflow velocity field using plot using wonderful script able take two dimensional streamline plot rotate scale three dimensional plot data liststreamplot data streampoints fine arrow pt arrow pt graphic three dimensional streamline plot mathematica remaining question change camera perspective parameter plot specifically would like change perspective three dimensional streamline plot bounding box around plot take shape trapezoid streamline trajectory modified accordingly aware graphic viewangle viewpoint viewvector option unsure use context yves script
