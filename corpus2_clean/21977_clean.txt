back good ol day would copy shareware onto floppy friend also used fair bit assembly common practice micro optimization would stare stare line assembly figured way express one fewer instruction even saying mathematically impossible always remove one instruction given changing runtime performance small constant factor major issue programming today programmer transferring micro optimization effort elsewhere word best practice taken extreme state longer adding anything instead wasting time example programmer waste time generalizing private method called one place time wasted reducing test case programmer still overly concerned reducing line two great example looking num spending time finding right name even renaming everything num removing even minor tenuous duplication note different question optimize asking programmer seem maximize stigma micro optimization thus productive use time
