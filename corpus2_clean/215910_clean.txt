company produce software hardware used perform automatic adjustment electronic test equipment well perform equipment result put onto certificate calibration sent customer along equipment calibration certificate state various condition calibration hardware model serial number software version used perform calibration well thing like environmental condition etc making assumption software used produce listed calibration certificate used certificate calibration must gone test release process must considered released software also mean software used adjustment must also released believe software environmental condition etc used present adjustment matter really matter end result calibration condition present calibration whether equipment within specification real question hoping get answered reputable source e g somewhere similar address question searched thinking high volume production run unreleased system used perform adjustment long released system used perform since time required perform adjustment much longer calibration unreleased system eventually become released use currently also please distinction adjustment calibration definition international vocabulary num operation specified condition first step establishes relation quantity value measurement uncertainty provided measurement standard corresponding indication associated measurement uncertainty instrument secondary standard second step us information establish relation obtaining measurement result indication followed note num emphasis original text calibration confused adjustment measuring system often mistakenly called self calibration verification calibration side note sure got voted regarding software use release use believe best practice applied hopefully primarily opinion based
