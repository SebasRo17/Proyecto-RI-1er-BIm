working model social interaction mouse mouse box simulation output mouse stay box time period problem obtain end meeting two mouse box overlapping period right mysql database simulation directly insert stay result another tool written scala retrieves stay result portion hundred loop asks database stay overlapping insert pair database like box id1 re id1 id2 re id2 dt typ mean mouse id1 id2 box box interval duration dt meeting typ could four type meeting depending mouse box e g one entered exited relative re id1 re id2 tell stay result used generate meeting result obviously inefficient would better way constrained using rdms though would easiest reading analysing r afterwards would make sense stay text file use hadoop generate meeting somehow anything else duration approximately one quarter one trial simulation generate around num million stay result
