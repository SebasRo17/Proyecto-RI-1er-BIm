context graduated college couple month ago working software engineer company build software product consider lucky work one business application product working authentication solution would say mass market understand product could built without deep understanding domain either industry addressing particular set protocol use case scenario case solution like domain knowledge deep understanding authentication protocol used potential client scale used usage scenario solution going interact question relatively new industry would suggestion towards education think important dig deeper domain currently working dedicate time read book blog experiment free time set protocol standard tool building authentication solution maybe better idea would dedicate time get better understanding computer science fundamental taught detail university like example language c c anything model understanding really source translated assembly augmented expect really laid memory considering optimization trick etc done time advanced multi threading technique knowledge beyond basic like shared r w lock task decomposition basic memory layout memory model exact implementation advanced algorithm massive datasets deal enormous amount failure tolerance etc believe second category make better engineer help designing sort product future awareness existence domain knowledge scope product also valuable important would thankful sharing thought matter
