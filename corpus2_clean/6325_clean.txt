use mathematica mac osx bit gcc c compiler trying write librarylink function deal large positive integer e greater dealing mean two different case function take large integer input return large integer output function take standard integer input output produce intermediate large integer therefore probably declare use unsigned int long long int integer type available function margument getinteger args margument setinteger re seem handle bit integer ranging mint way transfer different type integer tried declare use unsigned int unsigned long long long int local variable c function either compile declaration somehow ignored integer fact considered mint wolframlibrary h file tried change definition mint int unsigned long example without success would like stick librarylink framework apart problem find relatively predictable easy implement aware mathlink function mlgetinteger mlputinteger mathlink machine proven desperately buggy copy pasted entire example minimal effort method integrating c function mathematica associated conversation often work thought mathlink nature asynchronous sensitive low level communication protocol among process forever control additionally reason use libraylink speed mathlink brings overhead suspect would slow process
