purely design question want port nice educational game bug brain game design neural network consist three element neuron node neuron used perform kind processing signal produce desired connected neuron node connection uni directional weighted think node junction also connected neuron node connection also uni directional weighted weight cannot change weight connection connection two element sum neuron node input output neuron node input output processing q would design structure sketch produced far screenshot design operation connect two join e neuron node three responsibility add add join add join b decided put static controller course could avoid two directional relationship element keep track output input limitation eg num o per join iterate every time add connection see still place add case game many connection would hit performance like know deal situation general foundation whole logic project like properly made suggestion warmly welcome
