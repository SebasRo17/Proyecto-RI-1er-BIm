use mathematica equate coefficient non power series equation example would like take equation like following af x frac b f xf chf x f x e af x f xf bhf x produce following system e frac b c b edit rather small example possible would prefer solution requires minimal human inspection original equation equation working many perhaps hundred partial derivative term would unfeasible thing like individually pick ideally would like specify unknown interested case b c let mathematica take
