know perl lua obviously c ansi standard afaik support faster looking numerically indexed array hash lookup anything like javascript also example mean case perl num num something slower num num something else var num num num foreach var look fancy faster foreach key key hash look fancy given following def methodone num number num two operation similar speed involve hash lookup hash new methodone num num num kind lookup slower num num num num num iterated faster num num mean list iterate faster tuples javascript support numerically indexed array differently array believe javascript support array associative array compare two speed wise
