would like able pas unquoted string parameter mathematica function writing show without evaluation string happens defined thus would like clear global f x print tostring x f middle print string middle middle f middle print string middle obviously cannot work way written yet legal write plot g x x plotstyle black black happens protected variable never defined emulate come close emulating behavior willing put compromise function invocation syntax particular option syntax opt middle would fine apology somewhere doc find thanks addendum j solution answer question posed would also like following work clear global setattributes foo holdall foo x print tostring unevaluated x table foo b c print expected table foo evaluate b c print b c expected table foo evaluate b c print b c would like last line print b c like one like evaluated asking much context part larger function computes something different way depending setting mode parameter want able pas mode parameter without evaluation hence original question also want able invoke function inside table function simple example clear global setattributes foo holdall foo x block z tostring unevaluated x x square x x table integrate foo evaluate x square xyzzy table integrate foo evaluate x square xyzzy since second invocation parameter foo value value achieve behavior
