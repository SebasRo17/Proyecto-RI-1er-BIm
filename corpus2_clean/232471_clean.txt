attempting teach basic finite automaton exploring difference deterministic finite automaton non deterministic finite one thing pop quite often example lecture slide video various c instructor epsilon transition problem none good job explaining epsilon transition kind pop nowhere mysterious property allows jump one state another without reading character k get arbitrary jump facilitated create automaton take image example let say two epsilon transition s1 s4 decided one go go s1 backtrack try b say arrow seem infer conceived wrong could automaton actually state s1 s2 concurrently also s3 s6 epsilon transition s7 two accepting state s3 s4 instead finally s2 two path react s5 two path react b work practice path follow determined answering please try limit use esoteric mathematics use operator symbol explain one clearly math nfa epsilon transition
