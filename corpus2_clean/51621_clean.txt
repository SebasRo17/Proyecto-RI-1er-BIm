question regarding graph traversal problem graph working graph enter image description problem following want find cycle graph completion cycle traversed edge graph exactly twice ended starting point saw mathematica built function findeuleriancycle g want want except edge traversed exactly idea double edge e add new edge node graph get following error message graph supp mixed graph multigraphs supported apparently multigraphs still supported mathematica multigraphs mathematica way implement solution mentioned problem mathematica using mathematica note graph shown simple example need solve mentioned problem much bigger undirected graph vertex odd degree
