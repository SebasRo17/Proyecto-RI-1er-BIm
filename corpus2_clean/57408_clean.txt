looking modelling response system excited multiple pulse period time way find response time take convolution impulse response response system infinitely short pulse multiple excitation pulse range response int excitation tau impresp tau mathrm tau wanted plot function time would need evaluate integral every point wanted put plot clearly expensive code moment pretty simple define gaussian pulse impulse response define function take convolution plot convolution function gaussian amp mean std amp exp mean std gawindow amp mean std w piecewise gaussian amp mean std mean w mean w imp exp twopulse gawindow gawindow conv integrate twopulse imp plot conv plotrange plotstyle green tried built convolution function perform convolution negative infinity positive infinity combined step function make function time offer speed benefit regular integral perform go discretized version function using listconvolve although unable recreate correct plot working code using plotpoints maxrecursion argument plot increase speed whilst sacrificing quality graph nicer resort seems lot information optimization infinite range convolution none ability apply multiple finite range convolution problem thanks advance suggestion could improve speed efficiency
