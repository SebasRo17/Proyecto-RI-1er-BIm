writing program solving shortest path travelling salesman problem twist multiple salesman partition city among thus creating two part problem namely partitioning graph among salesman solving salesman problem partition using mathematica moment using genetic programming ie generate random partition combined order travel breed solution weight better solution thus allowing solution included diversity stay good actual breeding quite complex procedure question another forum another time alpha version work amazingly slow would hopefully end commercial use start firm asked look need speed making program complex figured small benchmarking one problem generation random number needed breeding breeding happens ten thousand time tested method randomnumber thus timing randomnumber null timing randomnumber null intolerable ask distribution use would like discrete generate number larger n sum n p probability property p p p cdots p n would also like able control fast probability get smaller moment use monstrosity randomnumber n floor inversefunction harmonicnumber randomreal harmonicnumber n n property described even control slope changing number harmonicnumber n method slow clearly thinking complex suggestion
