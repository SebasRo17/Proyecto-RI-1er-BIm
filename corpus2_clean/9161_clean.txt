trying understand exactly workingprecision accuracygoal precisiongoal mean result ndsolve presume workingprecision simply mean number decimal place used internally mathematica various point throughout calculation scratchpad therefore essentially give upper limit accuracy precision final result understand accuracy precision somewhat lab sense accuracy close true value precision repeatable value get sense use dartboard analogy near bullseye accurate hit outskirt place time precise accurate sure know correlate mathematica concept set accuracygoal precisiongoal ndsolve say function get spat look like definition help page accuracygoal would mean significant figure correct whereas precisiongoal would give digit decimal correct e g answer spat mean though case say significant fig correct digit decimal place also correct seems inconsistent rule thumb help page also state accuracygoal precisiongoal p mathematica attempt make numerical error result size less x p mean accuracygoal precisiongoal ndsolve spat numerical error would cdot answer really pm different definition numerical error thanks clarification
