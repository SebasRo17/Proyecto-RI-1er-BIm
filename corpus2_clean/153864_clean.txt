lately become frustrated modern programming language worked c c c f ruby j little language support determining subroutine actually consider following simple pseudo var x dosomethingwith determine call dosomethingwith actually mutate copy depend global local state dependent change global local state closure affect outcome call language encountered almost none question answered merely looking signature subroutine almost never compile time time support either usually way put trust author api hope documentation naming convention reveal subroutine actually question exist language today make symbolic distinction type scenario place compile time constraint actually write course support modern language different level scope closure separation static instance lambda function et cetera often seem come conflict instance lambda usually either purely functional simply based parameter mutate parameter way usually possible access static variable lambda turn give access instance variable break apart
