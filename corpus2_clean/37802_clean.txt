want able compute explicit exterior algebra vector space example given real vector space v time matrix want consider expression form v wedge w lambda v would like mathematica understand v wedge w w wedge v v wedge w v wedge v wedge w etc particular want able define linear operator lambda v basis decomposable element extend linearity element example would like define inner product b x wedge z wedge w langle x rangle langle z w rangle langle x w rangle langle z rangle mathematica understand b e wedge e e wedge e e wedge e e wedge e e e e e v orthonormal far attempt tricking mathematica thinking v wedge w ordered pair v w problem make computation work decomposable vector since think e wedge e e wedge e e e wedge e e e e e e e e e e e want rule command wedge mathematica meaning make nice display tried using tensorwedge get answer back result expression explicitly also gave couple package try like grassmann ricci feel easier way thought
