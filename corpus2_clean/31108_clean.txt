came across problem evaluating following integral int sqrt x dx evaluate get conditionalexpression hypergeometric f issue negative int sqrt x dx get hypergeometric f seems okay since number however int sqrt x dx text get undefined issue need keep symbolic still able use negative number later understand must positive especially since mathematica seems able compute negative anyone know happening fix edit actually looking general solution function code used calculate arc length function case x example working actual code basefunction function x x secondfunction sin r fullsimplify p norm secondfunction b integrate sqrt derivative basefunction x x element real p norm vector function b constant want able use function basefunction though need general solution
