typical programming designing come use go like num id problem required num make program something simple num test num make program little bit num repeat num micro problem solved program whole basically incremental design piece split apart micro problem solved micro problem great job cohesion reduces coupling sometime future program come across problem like problem built requires little extra say add functionality program make adding functionality already established working logic edited make new functionality work suddenly seems like messing something designing every program developed added onto without compromising working logic example word yes maybe word yes maybe word yes maybe split sometime future comma inside quote must ignored properly get entry adding functionality ignore single double quote would severely alter logic ifs check even stack keeping track starting quote scenario avoidable make addition painless less compromising working logic
