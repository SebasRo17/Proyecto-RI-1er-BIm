statistician searching efficient way select row column table data mathematica let pose question part sql style table data list id variable variable alpha beta alpha formatted grid look roughly like id variable variable alpha beta alpha part data header table example id set name list column ideally result would allow following id alpha beta alpha would one need write function dissect header row line header name name list corresponds appropriate header although one might ask refer everything position avoid renaming headache entirely extremely cumbersome working ten hundred column variable use meaningless position reference variable part individual row subset row returned table essentially looking equivalent clause sql subset function r example id column might want retrieve row id alpha create method iterates id list store position list value element equal alpha concatenate list contains value position list confident could write function mention seems unconscionable mathematica would overlook rudimentary data manipulation task understand also datamanipulation package allows sql query believe hope way native mathematica quicker thank indulging apology advance mathematica aficionado might see corrupt question trying program another language mathematica
