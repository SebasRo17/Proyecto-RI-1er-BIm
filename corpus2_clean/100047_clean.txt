studying operating system x86 architecture reading segmentation paging naturally curious modern os handle memory management found linux operating system essentially shun segmentation favor paging reason found simplicity portability practical us segmentation x86 otherwise ever see robust operating system using continue favor paging based system know loaded question curious segmentation would handled newly developed operating system make much sense favor paging one consider segmented approach say shun segmentation implying linux us far num segment user kernel segment reading intel documentation got feeling segmentation designed robust solution mind told many occasion complicated x86 found interesting anecdote linked linux original announcement linux said post later simply say porting impossible mostly c people call write c us every conceivable feature num could find also project teach num already mentioned us mmu paging disk yet segmentation segmentation make really num dependent every task segment max num task 4gb anybody need task tough cooky guess experimentation x86 led ask question linus stackoverflow implemented try
