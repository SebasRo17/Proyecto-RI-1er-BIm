want plot eigenvalue matrix dependant parameter well actually want plot tight binding electronic band structure dimension hamitonian matrix greater course analytical solution anyway use eigenvalue directly mathematica give result containing root use root plot thought theoretically plot fine root searching process mathematica search root little little eigenvalue curve fine turn thing simple give code written follows n h table n j n b h b e k e k n h b null h b null h b e k e k n code generate hamiltonian matrix dimension n eigen eigenvalue h plot x x eigen k pi plot follows eigen quite good beginning totally messed end first question wrong ugly tail finally plotting eigenvalue one method calculate eigenvalue discrete point within range parameter listplot method disadvantage eigenvalue random order point belongs curve judged eye using method plot different eigenvalue curve different color especially two curve intersect better solution
