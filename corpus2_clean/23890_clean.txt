two function need inverse fourier transform trying get mathematica help tried simply using inversefouriertransform function since complicated function took hour gave nothing thought ninversefouriertransform would good alternative keep getting error message think using function correctly ran couple easier function first check result came expected function look like uq alpha oneoverr ge alpha alpha heavisidetheta dot ge ge oneoverr uq alpha oneoverr ge alpha alpha pi arctan dot ge ge oneoverr alpha oneoverr constant ge vector leaving minimise evaluation time trying find method work tried need fourierseries plot ninversefouriertransform uq w w plotrange got error message saying integrand evaluated non numerical value sorry bit rubbish incredibly new mathematica help would greatly appreciated
