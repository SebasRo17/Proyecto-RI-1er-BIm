performing finite precision operation matrix know precisely call result b operation taking square root b matrixpower quite relevant point form output contain lot entry equal simply lot invariant subspace spanned standard base vector would like see resulting matrix like first approximation interest many non zero entry problem entry b supposed come small real type time tried applying n b modest requirement precision seem help ideally would like set entry b approximately precisely help would appreciated p occurred take function f map small number identity otherwise apply b element wise elegant solution seems
