trying evaluate integral numerically int infty j q r tanh q mathrm q large value r make integrand oscillate quickly mathematica give incorrect answer deal trying increase maxrecursion nintegrate simply coding r nintegrate besselj q r tanh q q accuracygoal precisiongoal maxrecursion throw error also increase computation time give correct answer set minrecursion large value larger default value nintegrate attempt see increase computation time r nintegrate besselj q r tanh q q accuracygoal precisiongoal minrecursion maxrecursion get error saying nintegrate minmax minrecursion greater maxrecursion find confusing implicitly set value maxrecursion code mathematica allow min max recursion delete bessel function tanh nintegrate thought built property besselj mathematica also evaluate besselj arbitrary precision see reason limit number numerical subdivision anyone know workaround p code quickly produce plot integral function r f r numericq module nintegrate besselj q r tanh q q loglogplot f r r plotpoints maxrecursion axesorigin code work r gibberish anything larger thanks
