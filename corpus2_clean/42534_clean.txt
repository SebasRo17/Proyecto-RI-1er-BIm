interested calculating root equation change one variable equation evaluated numerically rather symbolically edited code simpler original one remove global mig kappa n x x mig estar x kappa mig n x lambda x mig n x estar x star x kappa estar x estar x mig n x q z sum z n e e n q mig n q mig n n n n infinity part q z nintegrate q z infinity rootfcn q z estar estar kappa kappa part q z z question interested solution z rootfcn q z change q increase point q two root value smaller value one interested one us integrate instead nintegrate simply take solution solve rootfcn q z z use get derivative q yield however unfortunately actual problem possible complicated cannot evaluated symbolically nintegrate must used also cannot use definition derivative solving rootfcn arbitrarily close value divide epsilon problem time consuming due high precision required get reasonable answer time numerically evaluate solve rootfcn q z z take minute since solve equivalent problem derivative question thousand time prohibitive seems like probably possible using numerical derivative sure help would appreciated
