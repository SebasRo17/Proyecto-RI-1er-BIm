dynamic programming technique avoiding repeated computation value recursive program value computed immediately stored value needed computed simply looked table use orthogonal polynomial fair bit work since mathematica support classical one often write function instance monic charlier polynomial satisfy three term recurrence c n x x n c n x c n x c x c x x want able use monic charlier polynomial mathematica charlierc x charlierc x x charlierc n integer x x n charlierc n x n charlierc n x problem route course effort expended generate say charlierc x used evaluating charlierc x one argument recursive function e g fibonacci dynamic programming fine dandy saving evaluation effort multiple argument function imagine would happen one used definition charlierc n integer x charlierc n x stuff executed plot charlierc x charlierc x x way reap benefit dynamic programming multiple argument function storing result recursion variable n charlier example change
