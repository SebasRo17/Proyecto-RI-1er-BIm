backtracking general algorithm finding solution computational problem incrementally build candidate solution abandon partial candidate c backtracks soon determines c cannot possibly completed valid solution wikipedia pseudo code backtracking algorithm look something like procedure bt c reject p c return accept p c output p c first p c bt next p root p return partial candidate root search tree reject p c return true partial candidate c worth completing accept p c return true c solution p false otherwise first p c generate first extension candidate c next p generate next alternative extension candidate extension output p c use solution c p appropriate application backtracking algorithm start call bt root p trying program efficiently possible mathematica already coded pertinent root reject accept first next function since need obtain one solution output throw catch combo given one basic logic root reject already coded alternative way program backtracking loop procedure bt mathematica mind substitution something mathematica friendly fold map idea
