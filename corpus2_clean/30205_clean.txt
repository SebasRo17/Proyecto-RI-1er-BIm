suppose evaluation function f x take long time output complicated polynomial x say x evaluation long many reason one lot previous defined function called continue define function g x easy operation f x course evaluate g x symbolically numerical value call f x right hence evaluation g long also define g x easy operation x evaluation fast however relation f g less obvious definition g question mentioned correct find reference get basic idea principle optimize code like
