really simple program written c ncurses basically front end sqlite3 would like implement tdd continue development found nice c unit framework however totally stuck implement take case example user type letter l captured ncurses getch sqlite3 query every row call callback callback print stuff screen via ncurses obvious way fully test simulate keyboard terminal make sure expected however sound complicated thinking adding abstraction layer database ui callback populate list entry list later printed case would able check list contains expected value however would struggle structure list program sqlite3 already example user want see list sorted way would expensive throw away list repopulate would need sort list implement sorting sqlite3 already using orginal design could query sorted differently previously done tdd command application really easy compare expected way would add cli interface program wrap test program around cli test everything way git git test framework question add testing tightly integrated database ui
