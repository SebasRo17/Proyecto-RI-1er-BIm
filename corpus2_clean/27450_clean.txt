still new mathematica first time wanted something complicated plotting changing parameter mathematical function want make simple simulation bus station two skewnormaldistribution different parameter give rate arrival service basically program draw number arrival distribution draw number service distribution subtract arrival go next simulation step possible number represented graphically instance drawing arrival distribution could represented list circle far know something could made animate maybe table even know start thought using loop using pause end step think good way edit procedural code want arrival skewnormaldistribution departure skewnormaldistribution entry round randomreal arrival service round randomreal departure remaining entry service remaining remaining print entry print service print remaining print n
