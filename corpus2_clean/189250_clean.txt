difficulty understanding whether right process use flow chart illustrates process involved algorithm assume following 1d x num num num num block split 2d block x num num num num block total energy counted total energy less threshold block removed energy higher kept algorithm move onto next block flow chart enter image description way look start algorithm split signal frame calculate energy signal 2d energy remove frame end algorithm energy higher threshold look signal block 2d passed back algorithm energy signal calculated question num say end block num specify block x n n could passed calculate energy alternatively look fine apply description process work written text help would greatly appreciated
