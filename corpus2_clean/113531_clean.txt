apparently two major judging criterion effectiveness heap num much minimize amount space take num fast operation heap carried eg malloc free wondering two criterion related namely tradeoff faster heap make difficult smaller heap size also particular allocation alignment need exist instance num num byte word size clearly num byte allocate double allocate location num allocate double location num somehow keep track fact double word located location would eliminate lot fragmentation within heap
