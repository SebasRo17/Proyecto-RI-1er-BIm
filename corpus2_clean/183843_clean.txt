want write multithreaded server application able process request multithreaded fashion keeping execution order incoming request client example client sends message m1 message m2 server must process request exactly order first m1 m2 however guarantee thread process incoming request process message order example thread t1 consumes message m1 thread t2 consumes message m2 completes processing message able accept message t1 finished job message processed result passed process processing one exists whole computation process schedule sending response client mutliple thread exist purpose preprocessing process particular problem sound like problem pipeline characteristic first m1 m2 m3 etc however wanted much possible achieve higher number communication cycle server client architecture pattern technique well suited task
