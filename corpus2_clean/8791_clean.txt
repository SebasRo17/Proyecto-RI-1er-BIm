trying make plot photoluminescence data wavelength x axis intensity axis also would like graph boxed upper x axis unit energy ev connected wavelength function energy wavelength tried use ticklabelfunction levelscheme package partly succeeded control number decimal point tick energy scale reason n work also energy tickmarks seem follow wavelength tick e one energy tick wavelength tick would like tick spaced nonlinearly independently axis e g increase step ev small code hope illustrate problem test list listplot test frame true imagesize plotrange framelabel wavelength nm intensity u energy ev frameticks linticks linticks linticks ticklabelfunction function x n x stripticklabels linticks input appreciated either using levelscheme package thanks
