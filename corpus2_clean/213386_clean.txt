computer scientist please bear lately wrote program perform expensive spatial search holding lot memory tried improve performance tried different approach see question example first maybe surprisingly found great performance difference running two different machine num x faster one machine however much surprise running exactly machine two different day showed great performance difference give rough idea mean great machine num day num num minute machine num day num num minute reboot meantime way question really could possible reason difference make sure system ready high performance start running program
