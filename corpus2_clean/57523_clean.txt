would like evaluate following simplified expression mathematica frac delta delta j exp j x k x delta j x k x delta differential operator independent j depending x thing want write explicit expression delta since necessary way apologise question basic quite new mathematica hard time understanding work thanks advance edit additional detail operator delta differential operator form box typical kg flat metric helpful question need actually compute exp left frac j left frac delta delta j right right exp j x k x delta j x k x thought expanding exponential sum apply sum exponential right see pattern could found order get analytical expression differentiation hand quite long tedious wanted see whether mathematica could help
