computing certain power series number term figured try speed computation much series defined follows let f laurent polynomial edit integer coefficient two variable x sum ge const f const constant term naively could try constantterm function coefficient coefficient function x function order sum constantterm function order seems stupid expensive part computing power polynomial approach repeat computation term instead taking advantage result previous term tried classical loop construction something like tmpfunction tmpfunction function step show whole thing clearly barking wrong tree absolutely appreciable difference execution time even high order going mathematica secret trick optimize naive construction executing overhead manipulating counting variable loop big enough offset expense computing f made efficient
