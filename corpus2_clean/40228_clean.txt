trying learn functional style seems prevail mathematica trouble accomplishing following let say multiple list arbitrary data using two list keep simple b also multiple arbitrary function using two keep simple take input order use generate different output f function u v u u v u v v g function u v u v understand build list result threading list b mapthread fout mapthread f b gout mapthread g b however reality dozen function f g etc dozen list data b etc end dozen mapthread command long list argument creating wall text far elegant looking tried merge single mapthread command work fout gout mapthread f g b way mapthread many function onto many list data assuming function expects data order possible would like avoid creating new variable function intended compiled think would create redundant data
