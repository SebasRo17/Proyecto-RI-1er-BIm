interested finding closed form inverse map projection equation general course always possible hoping mathematica help trickier one practice run thought would try use mathematica invert lambert azimuthal equal area projection course closed form inverse equation mathworld wondering would go finding using mathematica tried using solve reduce example k sqrt sin c co co x solve u v k co sin x k c sin co co x x luck far perhaps need specify constraint example know longitude latitude x x wonder eliminating variable might also help solving routine
