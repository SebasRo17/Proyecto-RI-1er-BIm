suppose two list n num num vector integer need find quick way say running time n num epsilon find vector first list 1st coordinate vector second list course could following naive u list 1 v list 2 u num equal v num u v end end end however would require n num loop feel sorting two list according first coordinate look collision perhaps fast way etc would probably take logn time really see search collision sorted list help would appreciated
