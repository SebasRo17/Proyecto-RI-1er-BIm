ask mathematica try solve recursive relation defines sequence function example suppose know g n x g n x n g x e x ask mathematica find closed form g n x placeholder equation highlight question know answer g n x n e x n geq less trivial instance problem would hermite polynomial recursion h n x xh n x h n x see convince either dsolve rsolve solve dsolve unhappy n used rh dsolve g n x g n x x g n x rsolve echo input rsolve g n x g n x x g x exp x g n x know finding closed form solution going hopeless instance seems like case like g n x doable unable find example mathematica documentation addressing type problem
