working problem need integrate function numerically function quite complex take almost hour mathematica make plot speed process thought could implement parallel nintegrate function using paralleltable believe successfully accomplished single numerical value limit integration something wrong since try make plot got bunch error code instead horrible integrand used function f x x paralellnintegrate imin numericq imax numericq step imax imin total paralleltable nintegrate u u step imin imax step step plot paralellnintegrate x x kernel nintegrate nlim u x valid limit integration kernel nintegrate nlim u x valid limit integration kernel nintegrate nlim u x valid limit integration kernel nintegrate nlim u x valid limit integration kernel nintegrate nlim u x valid limit integration kernel nintegrate nlim u x valid limit integration kernel general stop output nintegrate nlim suppressed calculation kernel general stop output nintegrate nlim suppressed calculation somebody help p also doubt step think could use post clear realize post one question per post somehow related seems silly open post divided interval integration region since cpu work thread could somebody tell thinking correctly
