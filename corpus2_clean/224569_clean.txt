network responsible routing signal think network directed graph node hardware edge really pipe capable fitting specific bandwidth route signal index pipe may multiple signal different size going across pipe worth signal predetermined size always simple multiple two know defragment single pipe easily enough however theoretically possible could move signal around across multiple pipe create enough room fit new signal trivial example could two edge b enough space fit signal size num available signal size num fit signal across would move signal pipe num num num completely freed living full num slot available new signal routed detect properly defragment sort cross pipe issue course real world may route signal completely different device perhaps signal take less direct route free enough space new signal given pipe short across entire system network want num find get signal destination crowded environment may move multiple signal take different path destination order free sufficient space given pipe num figure minimum number signal physically moved num approach minimizes need running step minimizing fragmentation much possible complicated series requirement looking answer though answer welcome
