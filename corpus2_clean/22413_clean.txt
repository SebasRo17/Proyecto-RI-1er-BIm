new mathematica would like learn bit functional programming moment assignment like programming different numerical method integration trapezoidal rule simpson rule differential equation euler method midpoint runge kutta implementing method procedural programing loop loop eluer method started using functional programming used table foldlist instead loop come together quite nicely example euler f symbol tz tk h module tz h h n ab tz tk h foldlist h f table h n table h n table n j j j n listplot joined true plotrange would like something similar midpoint runge kutta method know procedural code midpointrk f ta tb h module ta ta tb tb h h n g n ab tb ta h n h f ta h g f ta h h g table n ta j h j j n listplot joined true plotrange someone please help regard explain little command
