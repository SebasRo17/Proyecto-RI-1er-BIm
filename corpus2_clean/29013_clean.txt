perhaps poor programming part would like create function us variable optional parameter var f var desired output would f var f however optional maintains value var f defined var f var var f f work around somewhat making optional value dynamic var f dynamic var f var output update imagine fun type behavior want moment possible set optional parameter updated also happily accept answer tell would bad idea
