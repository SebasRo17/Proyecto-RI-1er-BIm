purely academic question context working algorithm meant arrive consensus distributed system intended tackle byzantine fault algorithm implemented several algorithm published ieee paper need platform test algorithm wanted test merit existing algorithm implemented thousand linux container system want message passing say simulate distributed system question flowing must fault genesis question need something sophisticated rng need attach real credibility work want tackle real world application generating fault rather fix fault generated algorithm need simulate factor result byzantine fault quote need develop testing strategy deliberate number fault test fault handling summarize say running program distributed environment factor might end generating byzantine fault possible factor simulation need program make small mistake every know mistake made need make multiple mistake one set algorithm rather plan making say num num run program need make mistake num time importantly must num num n mistake n total result generated using program result talking anything quantifiable verifiable like eg value something like 1for num num num one fifth time put garbage using random num j num j num j num j j using rng step num hide fault present simplistic trivial real enough thought could use algorithm built around mathematical bound fail num 5th time could think p please tell need understand problem
