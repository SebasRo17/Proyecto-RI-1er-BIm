trying create something similar heatmap within building suppose room dimension length width height respectively set data form x z temp x z represent coordinate room along axis room temp temperature particular point idea create color coding scale like temp degree color cordinates within building blue temp degree color green temp color point red temp data available particular point transparent block need arrange cuboid row predetermined like say cube along length building cube along width room cube along height building correctly dont shape point cuboid equal side rather readjusting based dimension building rearrange along building trying achieve something like readjust along dimension building able generate point code cuboid data hue want precise color coding like way mentioned question edit w l h backwall l w l w l h l h side h l h l side w w h w l h w l floor w w l l top h w h w l h l h front w w h h leftroof h w h w l h l h rightroof w h w h w l h w l h roofback w l h w l h l h rooffront w h w h h data randomreal binning binning binning binned bincounts data binning binning binning dims dimension binned coordswithdataall table x z x z x dims dims z dims coordswithdata coordswithdataall mytemperaturemap null opacity mytemperaturemap opacity colordata temperaturemap rescale temp flatten coordswithdata coords flatten coordswithdata cube graphic flatten mapthread cuboid mytemperaturemap temp coords fig graphic opacity style polygon backwall side side floor front leftroof rightroof roofback rooffront lighting ambient green axeslabel x z boxed false rotationaction clip show fig cube want arrange cuboid nice along length width breadth warehouse provide visualization heat map within warehouse pointer thanks regard anu
