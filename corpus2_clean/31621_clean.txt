learning quaternion right wanted play around concept learning e g take rotation point axis specified angle th v sqrt j k q co th sin th v qinv co th sin th v p j k r q p qinv expand r r j j k k j k j k j k k j k j k j want rotate point p three dimension angle th axis given unit vector v basically need use replacement rule like result get j j k k tell mathematica replace etc would thought mathematica would smart enough use rule figure generalizing question manipulating symbol quaternion specify replacement final answer simple possible
