playing around net biginteger basically wondering number estimated answer would fine point deviation curve graph increase time required operation v biginteger designed deviation plot increase time required operation v biginteger num infinity smooth curve way example assuming array designed capability handling num item mean num item operation f num time num item operation f num time num item operation f num time since designed handling num item operation done num item g num g num f num implemented properly complexity biginteger arithmetic smooth curve example time complexity multiplication nm n number digit first number digit second course practical limit could pick n large number fit machine anyone know document claiming implemented
