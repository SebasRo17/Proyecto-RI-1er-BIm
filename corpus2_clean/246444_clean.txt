new di would like know di might used help resolve problem implement latitude longitude given two produce distance using variety algorithm also reasonably pick one best algorithm design time without losing sleep however since user rarely physical coordinate may need instead compare zip code something similar order resolve zip code coordinate could apply naive algorithm us concatenation etc rough guess physical coordinate could pick random set coordinate etc likelihood need resolve zip code using sort database mapping zip code coordinate new di would like know following reasonable application di overthinking return implementation us pattern zip code well known provide best effort guess coordinate implementation us database maybe dbcontext somehow else coordinate must depend sort repository context connection something access database unless literally hard coded mean need dbcontext something similar get lost thinking right way legitimate scenario dependency injection discriminate say different connection string v different strategy altogether resolving zip code coordinate edit forget another realistic option
