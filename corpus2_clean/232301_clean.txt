puzzled lately idea wonder known extract executed source large complex algorithm try elaborate question scenario complex algorithm large amount people worked many year algorithm creates measurement description complex measurement device algorithm large set parameter let call recipe based recipe algorithm executed recipe determines function loop else construction followed within algorithm algorithm finished set calculated measurement parameter form measurement parameter device perform measurement problem since algorithm become complex large time difficult find way algorithm want add new functionality recipe basically person want modify function block affected recipe dig whole algorithm analyze see relevant recipe process new functionality added right place even simple addition people tend get lost huge amount complex solution extract active path brainstorming problem think would great way process algorithm parameter recipe extract active function codeblocks new set source file structure actually talking extracting real source active extracted isolated result subset source fraction original source structure much easier person analyze understand make modification eventually change could merged back original source algorithm maybe modified extracted source also executed lite version original algorithm extra information talking algorithm c c num file maybe 100k line compiled build custom visual studio based build environment really know idea naive stupid feasible right amount software engineering imagine similar situation world software engineering know quite experience software engineering definitely level designing large complex system would appreciate kind answer suggestion comment thanks advance
