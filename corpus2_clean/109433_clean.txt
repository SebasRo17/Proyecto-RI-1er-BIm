float sorted smallest largest need able pick nearest float greater less passed necessarily present naive approach would simple linear search might look like float std vector float float min float max assert num size num num size min num max obviously get larger become slower slower anyone idea algorithm would let find optimally already switched binary search improved matter somewhat still lot slower like since actually looking specific exists never terminate early information floating point value necessarily distributed evenly could consist value num f num f num f num f num f num f num f num f operation hundred thousand time amount pre processing float improve lookup time absolutely change use something vector store help
