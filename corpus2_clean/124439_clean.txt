want write offer two sequence element user first one let call primary use num time second one let call secondary less important still need question interface offer user looking stl style single sequence element offer begin end function traversal like insert erase modification offer second sequence two idea expose two container user law demeter provide container stl interface expose second one example include vector public std vector primary std vector secondary private std vector primary std vector secondary b public std vector iterator begin std vector iterator end std vector secondary private std vector primary std vector secondary class implementation case num auto primary begin primary end auto secondary begin secondary end case num b b auto b begin b end auto b secondary begin b secondary end c ish way one best solution context problem came context exercise writing simple database access framework class involved question table column row field table consists sequence column sequence row use table manipulating access add remove row deeper hierarchy row made column field user ask field corresponding given column column time column add modify remove table every row need modify reflect modification want interface simple extensible combining well existing like stl boost
