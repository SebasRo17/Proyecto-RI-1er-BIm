easy parallelize map mapindexed shown mma help parallelmap parallelize mapindexed default levelspec however many case need mapping deeper level example image data array tried parallelize found failed switched sequential evaluation whenever levelspec explicitly specified actually even levelspec enter image description page sal mangano mathematica cookbook seems written function use parallelize mapindexed able specify levelspec enter image description know achieved example detailed enough see intended effect actually suspect default levelspec parallelize could conveniently distribute element first level list across different kernel like breadth first search level using queue c however need go deeper mapindexed depth first see help search parallel implementation would difficult true parallelize mapindexed work default implicit levelspec others mr sal mangano forum could also comment
