new programmer first wrote num noticed relatively easy create program exhibit quite complex element today thing like net framework example creating visual interface sorting list done command learning program also learning computing theory parallel thing like sorting algorithm principle hardware operates together boolean algebra finite state machine noticed ever wanted test basic principle learned theory always lot difficult get started much technology obscured thing like library framework o making memory efficient program required num num year ago enough memory expensive programmer paid close attention type instruction would handled processor nowadays might argue due increased processing power available memory concern priority question older programmer see innovation like additional layer abstract might think younger programmer benefit learning low level programming exploring realm expansive library
