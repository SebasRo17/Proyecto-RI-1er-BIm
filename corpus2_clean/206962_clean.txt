reading book o got confused different terminology hope get doubt cleared question might basic expert find platform best suitable clarification process cpu whole operation managed o single core cpu instant one process running cpu save state process process control block start running another process waiting switching fast feel like process running simultaneously need different thread process felt get fine grained control process mean process waiting bound operation even process selected cpu anything multiple thread running one process one thread take care activity thread real computation provided process selected cpu question multi threading effective task involved activity multi threading preferred multi processing thread share memory space multi core processor better multi threading think better even use multi threading excitement multi threading anyway thread different process share memory two thread running different process different core like running different process parallel real parallel pseudo parallel
