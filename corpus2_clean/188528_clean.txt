working matlab model reduction algorithm basically processing pipeline generate property freq generate result freq dom sim freq red prima red order potentially time consuming activity work pretty big num num matrix previous implementation separate script execute one one manually master script stored mat file next program would read write result another directory would like use framework store dependency various piece point time ask generate num check present workspace num check consistent expected property check config num load file exact path file pre specified num check consistent expected property num compute command associated pre specified would like recursive effectively last module automatically run check actually computes piece already available consistent give suggestion design already called something assume must please point
