messy expression variable would like simplify assumption certain ratio variable small example consider sqrt x expanded small frac x x simple enough hand pull sqrt x define new variable frac x expand variable cannot figure mathematica edit since realized actually want complicated example consider following expression sqrt sqrt b expanded small frac small frac b b following artes answer solution series b z z z z z z b solution work intended due order operation mathematica performs upon command need done replace z expand z replace z replace z b expand z finally replace z b one mathematica obviously example gave separated two expression expanded separately cannot done complicated expression actually trying expand
