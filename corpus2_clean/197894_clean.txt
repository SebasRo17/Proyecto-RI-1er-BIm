trying applet saw path finding algorithm called jump point search yield significantly faster result dijkstra num second enter image description dijkstra num minute num second enter image description jump point search less num second enter image description needless say quite astounded result visual representation jump point search seems making lot random guess probably intelligent one finding path block selection least yet found test case algorithm yielded worse result dijkstra algorithm work efficient comparison dijkstra
