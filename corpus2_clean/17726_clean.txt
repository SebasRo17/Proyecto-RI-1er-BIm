working two multi variable function b depend counting factor n n primed integer larger equal zero additional real variable x z function actually complicated simplicity assume example nn np x z nn np x z b nn np x z factorial nn factorial np x z would like use statement assign either b become definition third function v example needed prevent division zero tried different variation v nn np x z nn np nn np x z b nn np x z cannot figure correct syntax would like accomplish use statement assigns expression given function function v n n prime zero assigns function b function v either n n primed zero
