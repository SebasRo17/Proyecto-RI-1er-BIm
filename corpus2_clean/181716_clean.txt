confusion regarding use static variable reference feel like may entirely figured implication keeping something static say public static one instance per one instance per assembly example user control say wpf app user control public static coordinate various thing within control form client application us user control multiple instance control per form many instance public static created guess one modified every control actually need instance control one one across instance control single form using singleton pattern lock keyword solve issue e create one per instance user control issue singleton pattern solve option solving design problem note resorted creating internal non static global passing around carefully instead going static route working fine looking see another option please bear question sound naive read bit posting seem stuck finding answer explains clearly
