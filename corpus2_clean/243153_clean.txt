writing simulate supply chain supply chain simulated either intermediate cross docking configuration wrote two simulator object since two object share certain behavior e g making shipment demand arriving wrote abstract simulator parent two simulator object abstract simulator take parameter till simulation parameter contains field common simulator object however want include field specific simulation e intermediate simulation cross docking simulation current idea take put worried however approach lead duplication edited currently defines call abstract method defined concrete child class public abstract public params params params protected abstract protected abstract one difference intermediate configuration tier num facility submit report tier num facility cross docking configuration tier num facility submit report tier num facility thus implementation method worked thank answer inspired answer sleeping came answer based refactoring see
