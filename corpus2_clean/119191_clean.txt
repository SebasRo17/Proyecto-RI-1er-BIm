last year sport accident since left eye little bit sensitive especially looking bright shiny color get tired fast literally focus anything white worst color ever unfortunately application use work environment firefox eclipse visual studio tetri bright white background really hurt eye easy way generally use color scheme laptop everything bright obviously could everywhere change default color scheme simpler solution recommendation good color scheme less bright still clearly readable
