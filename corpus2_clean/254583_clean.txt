lately working small personal project basically entity component system framework system pretty good idea way framework work lack experience trouble actually keeping everything decoupled detail framework entity defined component system responsible actually modifying entity changing component order improve locality reference instead keeping component appropriate entity component stored homogenous vector entity keep list index vector since system modifies specific component keep list entity corresponding component dealt componentmanager entitymanager systemmanager class however tight coupling need access componentmanager order handle size index list mapping component also need access actually add component appropriate vector another coupling entitymanager systemmanager whenever entity created need added list appropriate system general event bus would appear help sure implement without making global improve design removing coupling still maintaining system functionality
