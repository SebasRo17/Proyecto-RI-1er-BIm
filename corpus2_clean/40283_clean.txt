want rotate iteratively triangle point increasing iteration length side proportion change color side came solution triangle x line x x sqrt x randomcolor apply rgbcolor randomreal show array graphic rotate thick randomcolor triangle pi simple output show array graphic rotate thick randomcolor triangle pi elaborated certainly better way achieve result however first attempt solution use nestlist felt suitable could proceed line rot gr rotate gr pi graphic nestlist rot triangle figure repeated expected way start iteration evaluate value function triangle current value nestlist iterator
