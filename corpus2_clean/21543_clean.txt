suppose j k l n pair non negative integer satisfying following constraint j k l n j k l n ordering pair implied last set inequality lexicographic one e g j k l iff either k else k j l possible cardinality set j k l n would like find subject constraint possible configuration equality inequality relationship among element set would yield cardinality example cardinality one configuration would k j l n brute force solution problem would generate possible configuration equality inequality relationship among six variable weed one inconsistent either internally relative constraint finally classify remaining configuration according cardinality imply think write mathematica code generate possible configuration sure weed one inconsistent incompatible constraint give example mean configuration consider simpler problem three variable j k one constraint j following three possible configuration j j k k j j k k j j k k first one ok second one internally inconsistent third one incompatible constraint enter expression mathematica return verbatim j j k k j j k k j j k k j j k k hoped first expression would evaluated true second one false mathematica provide convenient way weed invalid configuration
