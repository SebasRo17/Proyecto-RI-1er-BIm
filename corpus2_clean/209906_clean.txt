given list edge set n vertex atmost three edge joining vertex arrange vertex straight position numbered num n sum length edge minimized length edge b difference position vertex b atmost num vertex algorithm work within time limit num second actual problem tried solving problem trying permutation finding total cost edge work num num test case problem worst case total number operation proportional num num size n small think solution might similar trying possibility need complete solution problem want try come hint optimize algorithm work within time limit thanks
