find question specific case try make generic need extractor base set document example document specific property ultimately document want provide common extraction operation even though document said somewhat different may property may let imagine document base abstract class inherit said would defend best way implementing two option empty virtual method base empty virtual method base would allow programmer override method make sense different type document would default behavior abstract base would returning default method like public abstract document public virtual default public document public override specific implementation public document implement concrete empty method concrete method throwing notimplementedexception since others could either default could throw notimplementedexception would depend program written thing could come something like default public abstract document public abstract public document public override specific implementation public document public override default throw exception public abstract document public abstract public document public override specific implementation public document public override throw new notimplementedexception section personally think abstract approach better since mean hey need able get document care virtual mean hey good enough feel free change way get think first one sign oriented programming smell opinion
