experiment yield functional dependence two variable f x imagined map known function factored follows f x fx x gy gx x fy given tabulated f x would like numerically find four unknown function fx fy gx gy clear full generality problem ill posed unique solution however several constraint known priori fx x fy non zero finite interval ii gy gaussian profile gx x decay exponentially x give example let u use following definition fx x exp x exp x gy exp fy exp exp sin gx x exp x exp x f x fx x gy gx x fy looking four graph resulting function cross shape plot f x x plotrange plotpoints dplot many idea find fx fy gx gy numerically trying use fitting procedure however work like get put seeking general solution perhaps help fourier wavelet analysis would grateful idea
