first bit long introduction problem week mathematica experience creating mathematica application calculates material property steel based metallurgical function include multiple chemical element currently chemistry stored vector list element stored second vector length example element c mn p si cu ni cr v cb mo sn al ca b ti n ce pb bi w zn sb chemistry created function called elem look element name element find corresponding entry chemistry chemistry list proper format elem chem element chem flatten position element element example want look nickel ni chemistry list use following get elem chemistry ni neat thing write formula using elem function list element used print formula user friendly way verification example titanium nitrogen ratio one simpler formula interest tibyn chem elem chem ti elem chem n called chemistry return number call tibyn element return formula ti n way print list formula format metallurgist read audit application question one performance need optimization involving formula think method indexing chemistry one big bottleneck way precompile function like elem list element position looked every element every formula every iteration optimization thanks
