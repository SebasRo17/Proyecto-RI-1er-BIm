find velocity profile pressure driven pipe flow look like u frac h mu frac mathrm p mathrm x left left frac h right right fluid flow two wall separated distance h pressure gradient mathrm p mathrm x drive flow vertical coordinate axis plot velocity profile velocityplot try plot px h vectorplot h px h x get following figure enter image description however velocity profile parabolic look like enter image description apologize low quality vector plot ansys went wrong vectorplot definition
