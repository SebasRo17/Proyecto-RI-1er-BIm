like theory question practical one although using arduino labview work independently platform arduino board controlling set pump use standard motor arduino read like command usb serial port pump valve part working move pump around using arduino serial port firmware arduino async accepts non blocking call basically pump working send command pump execute execute several time command id id sent back serial port work done coded using simply fsm every pump represents state firmware blocking every physical action big wait step case anymore also labview vi working accepts parameter user pump id speed creates command sends pump also work first vi problem block stay pump finished cannot execute action hardware question labview novice although general software pattern question general fix pattern template use block vi pump working
