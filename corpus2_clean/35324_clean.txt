attempted calculate following integral integrate sqrt x exp x x assumption sqrt e besseli besseli besseli besseli obviously incorrect since applying rule rightarrow yield mathrm whereas correct result obtained nintegrate two question anyone know correct answer perhaps importantly anyone idea simple integral resulting completely incorrect output find disturbing program capable yielding incorrect result without warning user case answer obviously wrong complicated expression note removing assumption option still yield incorrect result
