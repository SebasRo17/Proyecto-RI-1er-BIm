write function input expression f return log derivative frac f frac df dx use conditional pattern test function accepts symbol input except list show attempt question certain way wrong wrong new mathematica still familiar work attempt f x func f frac f f frac x x attempt wrong first using conditional pattern test also using sign cannot differentiate function f x func f frac f f output using delayed assignment output f x func f x frac f f frac x x adding another argument x redundant make difference f x func f module f switch f symbol frac f f output frac f f syntax might make sense struggling find way fix might used symbol incorrectly symbol trying write function less general way f x func f frac f f x output frac x method course work change input f function return output one way solve changing func f frac f f think considered cheating since really answering question meeting requirement set question really make struggle compute derivative compute derivative input function respect independent variable also fully understand switch condition mentioned mathematica help switch evaluates expr compare form turn evaluating returning value form value suppose write function f x switch x x x f f f x using wrong form detailed help greatly appreciated thanks
