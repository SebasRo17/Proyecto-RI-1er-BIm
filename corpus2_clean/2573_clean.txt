part physic homework need answer hand got correct frac g g sin theta answer would liked solved following system equation shown e put subscript something similar equation wanted solve subscript subscript x subscript g sin theta subscript subscript subscript g subscript x subscript tried following given answer clearly false solve subscript subscript x subscript g sin theta subscript subscript subscript g subscript x subscript subscript seems least two problem equation asking solve think treating variable typed part solve asks variable solving term light blue enter subscript loses highlighting would seem least perfectly valid answer solve would x would useless answer want answer term g theta term compound variable note tried subscript less version solve x g sin theta g x still got answer using mathematica going enter equation normally solve term specific variable
