consider following expression heavisidetheta x heavisidetheta x mathematica simplify theta x theta x zero considered generalized function since get zero integrate test function int dx theta x theta x varphi x long list similar expression variable x x heavisidetheta x heavisidetheta x heavisidetheta x x x x diracdelta x x heavisidetheta x x x x x either one integrate test function varphi x x get zero get mathematica recognize expression zero timely way tried defining function procedure expr would yield zero expression one way work fouriertransform four variable however take hour expression completeness let write full version two example term appear application exp b x b x heavisidetheta x heavisidetheta x heavisidetheta x x x x exp x b diracdelta x x heavisidetheta x x x x x extra prefactors make difference mathematically either term still zero generalized function may make difficult mathematica thanks
