may well simple problem difficulty two connected vector v v v begin origin end point v begin point end point default constraint moving point via locator arrowhead affect length direction v v affect position word resultant v v remains unchanged circumstance would fine however want implement composition vector displacing affect neither length direction v moving must move remains invariant want maintain effect moving effect v effect v word changing v change v vice versa mean independent component figure left scenario notice located located figure right show situation displaced notice v stretched rotated slightly clockwise direction would prefer v would displayed like dashed black arrow displayed would correspond idea changed v without changing v idea done vector code manipulate graphic pointsize large point red arrow text offset dashed arrow text offset blue arrow black text offset plotrange basestyle ax true true locator locator
