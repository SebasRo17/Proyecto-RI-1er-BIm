understand svm take discrete number x value learn given new x value map one category possible use svm something similar instead map x value probability value let give example say x value array two integer x num num num num num num num num two category b b b e num num num num map num num num num map b given x num num svm would probably predict category given another x num num svm would probably still predict part category looking given x value specified predict looking would tuples category form category probability x category example case would look something like num b num application would somewhat like fuzzy logic system using pseudocode x almost certainly category something x likely category something else system like already would go implementing something like currently using learn something like could library would best
