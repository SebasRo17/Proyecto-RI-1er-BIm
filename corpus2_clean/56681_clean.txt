little general try make specific possible used mathematica fair amount derive check analytical solution problem theoretical economics lot derivative integral probability distribution root finding etc also find using manipulate plot function lot investigate basic behavior shape equation help conjecture solution outcome however feel like large amount absurd kluge notebook rapidly become unreadable mess often find accidentally clashing variable definition mi specifying function definition plot probably end restarting kernel time session improved time simply learning language developing workflow feel like little inefficient probably inventing wheel octagonal wheel lot online printed resource people use mathematica thing alternatively anyone else use mathematica type exploratory work short list best practice
