trying write function produce square matrix certain characteristic function two input number row n number time element range n repeated matrix assuming function called koch koch mean matrix x repeated respectively time matrix row output nondecreasing finally function find possible matrix code prepared following koch n num module list list flatten table range n n list deleteduplicates sort tuples list n list deleteduplicates sort tuples list n n list list flatten position map count list num list notice reproduce large pool possible matrix filtering regard constraint number repeating inefficient function work n even though take second n n fails memory constraint shooting error general nomem current computation aborted insufficientmemory available complete computation need compute n therefore need better algorithm find possible matrix given constraint
