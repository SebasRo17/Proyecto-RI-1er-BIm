store set positive x coordinate sorted way say arr num num num num num num etc maximum distance k go one point another point let k num given two point x arr x arr need determine reach x able reach x distance every two hop less equal k suppose x num num go num num num num since distance num num greater num go case reach x num num reach simply solved n created arr x arr pair point check distance less equal k want better algorithm thinking something like binary search anybody please suggest good algorithm
