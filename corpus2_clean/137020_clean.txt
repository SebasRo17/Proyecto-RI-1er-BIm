essentially model represents xml structure use model system model shared project used number different solution order generate common xml structure usage number application one application involved provided wrapper one xml model class wish perform number operation model however part program also need access calculation need moment setup note example represents structure num public private readonly model public propertyx get model propertyx public model model model method need us property exposed e g public performoperation propertyx num something else something else appears ok problem another programmer un used private model seems could end hidden issue fact two way get put logic public exposed get property could miss directly reference private alternative thought num public public readonly propertyx public model propertyx model propertyx set property wish expose method need us property exposed e g public performoperation propertyx num something else something else another option reading post num public private readonly propertyx public propertyx get propertyx public model propertyx model propertyx method need us property exposed e g public performoperation propertyx num something else something else thought would good idea hide model wanted wrapper anyway method expose model well thought might overkill save part going something like model propertyx etc question would better solution overkill better practice edit added another option num need set property exposing necessarily want private set set constructor hence readonly private used get part exposed property also found stack overflow question num c immutability public readonly field say better preferred solution current c limitation idea num implementation best practice
