first tried directly overflowed evaluation general ovfl overflow occurred computation evaluation general ovfl overflow occurred computation indeterminate indeterminate using double log help either log log log log log log evaluation general ovfl overflow occurred computation evaluation general ovfl overflow occurred computation overflow overflow tried use wolframalpha function seemed able handle even much higher tower wolframalpha mathematicaforms true wolframalpha mathematicaforms true discovered failed perform certain comparison wolframalpha mathematicaforms sometimes even gave wrong answer even seemingly trivial case wolframalpha mathematicaforms false anybody suggest correct robust method compare two expression given form hold b z b z positive integer
