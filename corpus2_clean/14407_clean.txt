stumped trying write using vector nd derivative expanded like expected system equation projectile quadratic drag gravity linear drag ignored negative z x horizontal plane write equation one coordinate work fine rather use vector since shorter least obvious going plus since new mathematica would good learn better way use gravity withdrag p v drag ndsolve p p p v p drag norm p p gravity p withdrag get ndsolve ndfdmc computed derivative dimensionality consistent initial condition ndsolve p p p norm p p norm p p norm p p p formatted output make error obvious element p vector three element p one really p dim something like clue wrong
