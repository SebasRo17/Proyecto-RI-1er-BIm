background revisited old great site age language shootout started programming c c several year ago since working almost exclusively due language constraint project involved remembering figure wanted see approximately well c c term resource usage execution time still relatively good worst performing 4x slower c c average around 2x due nature implementation surprise performance time actually lower expected real brick memory allocation worst allocated whopping memory c c memory absolutely nasty right memory comparatively cheap question speak term target platform strict limit working memory e embedded system like memory usage concern picking general purpose language today asking part considering migrating scala primary language much like functional aspect see even expensive term memory however since memory seems getting faster cheaper plentiful year seems increasingly hard find consumer laptop without least 4gb ddr3 ram could argued resource management becoming increasingly irrelevant compared possibly implementation wise expensive high level language feature allow faster construction readable solution
