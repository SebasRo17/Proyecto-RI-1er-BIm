peirce quincuncial projection cartographic projection sphere onto square short would like see implemented mathematica code clear inversepeircequincunicalmapping inversepeircequincunicalmapping x real real module cn th phi cn jacobicn x elliptick elliptick th phi arctan ab cn arg cn th phi zf th phi co th xf th phi sin th co phi yf th phi sin th sin phi contour correspond equation theta frac pi besides expected tilted square also includes diagonal anti diagonal artifact proven contour inverse peirce mapping line make suspect projection right way would glad see prototype implementation mathematica thank
