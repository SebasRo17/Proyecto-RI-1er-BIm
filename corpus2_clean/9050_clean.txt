hope much basic question looking mathematica function know one background recently read simple technique reading body pulse rate using camera built computer eg isight camera top imac idea put finger camera reasonably well lit room record movie second analyze frame varying light intensity somehow indicate pulse far technique seems promising code getdatafromlist frame module mean flatten imagedata colorseparate red channel best frame absolutetiming testframes currentimage testdata getdatafromlist testframes listlineplot testdata testdata start like etc plotted data left forefinger look like might working could least vaguely human pulse pulse data probably large include might camera finger could generate something similar plot look pulse time absolutetiming pulse rate holding finger screen hard work obviously question mathematica function use extract actual pulse rate similar set data
