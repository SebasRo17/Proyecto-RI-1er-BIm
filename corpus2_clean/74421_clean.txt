mathematics notation asymptotic lower bound upper bound tight within constant factor bound describing growth function general make sense three might relevant algorithm analysis asymptotic notation usually used describe growth time space requirement seems logical may interested maximum minimum expected requirement ignoring expected requirement might interested lower bound best case minimum space time upper bound worst case maximum space time imagine ever interested lower bound worst case upper bound best case since lower bound kind best case upper bound kind worst case seem like best case worst case worst case best case mismatch several occasion reply answer comment suggest may failure imagination part failing imagine consider statement along line quite common say lower bound worst case blah algorithm blah answer question unless also say people care
