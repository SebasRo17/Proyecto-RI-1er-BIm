currently two list first list contains independent variable x second list contains dependent variable form f x f x f n x want combine form x f x x f x xn f xn x f x x f x xn f xn x f n x x f n x xn f n xn easy format listplot example data range b c fa b c one easily table table j fa j length fa j length c knowing mathematica many function thought might easier way tried well transpose mapthread tuples transpose fa multiple transpose call figured would slight performance hit v second vector mm element machine easier efficient way combine list
