creating vector editing program c need shape interface concrete class implement requirement implementation inheritance allowed design doc say need polymorphism use interface need reuse use composition shape interface shape public virtual get num virtual set num virtual get linewidth num virtual set linewidth num num getters setter virtual draw num virtual area num virtual rotate angle num circle circle public shape width angle rotation radius public get set num getters setter area pi pow radius num problem except common property repeated shape solved using inheritance allowed use create width angle rotation public get set num getters setter property interface virtual property num user would shape shape new circle shape property set shape shape property set width num area shape area question good design bad design obvious problem could made better
