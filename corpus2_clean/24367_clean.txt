got impulse response data would like transform via fourier get amplitude frequency characteristic performing loudspeaker final goal show e g via listdensityplot calculated amplitude frequency characteristic dependant window choose transform truncation low frequency issue get fourier behave like desired unable reproduce frequency response got another rd part software issue samplerate option fourier got sampling frequency khz following example illustrates issue data table sin x x listplot take log ab fourier data fourierparameters floor length fourier data fourierparameters joined true plotrange full fourier periodogram data fourierparameters samplerate plotrange full scalingfunctions db periodogram
