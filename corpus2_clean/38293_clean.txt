trying understand effect sawtooth waveform mechanical system model example system plate box try oscillate plate order need calculate inertial force caused sawtooth waveform find inertial force need calculate second derivative sawtooth waveform know sawtooth waveform differentiable everywhere think make approximation using smooth sawtooth waveform enough smooth mean substitute upper tip bottom tip sawtooth waveform circular curve certain radius short question make sawtooth wavefrom dull tip mathematica although said sawtooth would better applicable triangle waveform edit triangle waveform made completely arbitrary piecewise function f piecewise mod x mod x mod x mod x plot evaluate f x enter image description still possible
