reasoning behind explicitly storing length c way see overwhelming reason many support standard c89 instance num length available buffer prevent buffer overrun num style arr length clear avoids programmer maintain many stack dealing several array num parameter become cogent perhaps motivating reason opinion usually space saved without keeping length would venture say us array involve dynamic allocation may case people use allocated stack one call stack handle num num byte extra since heap manager track free block size used dynamically allocated anyway make information usable add additional rule checked compile time one manipulate length explicitly unless one would like shoot oneself foot thing think side length tracking may made compiler simpler much simpler technically one could write kind recursive automatic storage elaborate case storing length may indeed result effectively space usage
