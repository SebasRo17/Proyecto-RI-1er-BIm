computing infinite sum residue want something like sum sum n pi residue w nu n w nu n nu n nu n n infinity infinity evaluated like give zero however choose specific value specifically sum n pi residue w nu n w nu n nu n nu n n infinity get nonzero result problem generic sum n pi residue w nu n w nu n nu n nu n n infinity zero nonzero thought could make work using hold holding evaluation residue releasing outside infinite sum appears applying releasehold fix problem still evaluates residue generic case fitting specific one way make work get correct answer infinite sum way know case term besides zero need infinite sum setup need treat case term nonzero
