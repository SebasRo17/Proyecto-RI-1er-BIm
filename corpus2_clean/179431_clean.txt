reviewing basic algorithm book called algorithm robert sedgewick came across problem mergesort sad say difficulty solving problem sublinear extra space develop merge implementation reduces extra space requirement max n based following idea divide n block size simplicity description assume n multiple considering block item first key sort key sort using selection sort ii merging first block second second block third forth problem problem based idea sedgewick recommends following set array sorted num num num num num num num num num algorithm use following num divide full subarrays size num selection sort subarrays num merge subarrays using recommends ii encounter problem store result merge lead wanting increase size auxiliary space needed handle least two subarrays time merging based specification problem allowed also considered using original space one subarray using auxiliary space second subarray however envision solution end overwriting entry first subarray idea way done note suppose stackoverflow com please let know move posted question academic
