ran unexpected behavior randomreal function inside block environment simplify problem wanted use two random local variable second one would less first one initialized inside bracket like clearall x block x randomreal randomreal x z randomreal print x print print z print x print print z got following result warning randomreal unifr endpoint specified x endpoint uniform distribution range real valued randomreal unifr endpoint specified endpoint uniform distribution range real valued value x seems time value z change note value change even variable called explicitly value z third line greater value second line value x never change want generalize soon executed upper code several time value z never greater value x since wanted value x z fixed canged code clearall x block x z x randomreal randomreal x z randomreal print x print print z print x print print z got wanted output someone please explain block work explain behavior construct first case described read documentation find answer probably missed something thanks pela
