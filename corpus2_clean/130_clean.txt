never used asserts mathematica trying see advantage argument check additional definition function capture unwanted input example one would think better clearall f f x assert x sqrt x assert f f last call generated console beep message assert asrtf assertion failed could also write clearall f f x sqrt x x f f second call return unevaluated f want beep could always something like clearall f f x sqrt x x f x throw f x supported negative value something along line since asserts seem used assert input function within range supported function benefit method shown one look using asserts inside function e middle computation check intermediate result within expected range also would use simple check instead return error code caller prefer use throw example help show myfun x block x assert sin call assert myfun generated assert asrtf assertion failed write instead myfun x block x throw sin call myfun also generate message beep well place guess looking mathematica use assert would better recommended way checking guess assertion code disabled enabled easily effect run time e testing code disable asserts final version run faster since check done run time manual checking code remains time thanks
