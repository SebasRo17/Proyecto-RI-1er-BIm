algorithm mental block designing way transition green red smoothly possible potentially unknown length time transition testing purpose using num model timespan methodology algorithm design need flexible enough account larger even smaller figured using rgb would probably best transition open color creation type assuming native net vb c currently num x num z num low green num num num mid yellow num num num high red num num num lastly sort optional piece account possibility low mid high color flexible well assume would need check make sure someone isnt putting low num num num mid num num num high num num num outside anomaly handle based best approach evaluate color question would best approach transition low mid mid high would potential pitfall implementing design
