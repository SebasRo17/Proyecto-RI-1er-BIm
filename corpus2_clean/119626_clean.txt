work field accelerator physic synchrotron radiation high energy electron large ring produce x used variety different kind science running improving facility requires controlling modelling electron beam ring model basically requires tracker follow electron element something called integrator computation different parameter associated motion problem code every facility maybe num num different code multiple version principle complex modelling project one might think general interest want able create track space watch electron circulate matlab based called accelerator toolbox creator longer field put sourceforge basic resource set integrator written c compiled mex interfaced via matlab useful put sourceforge order exchange community user quite small busy put much time collaboration term really improving think successful piece picture could recreated without much difficulty overall bit complex lab installation lot added locally developed tool people find hard really work together share somehow think need involve wider community development use standard tool suppose need general interest think integrator may general interest part plug architecture build ring ought fit pattern option accept problem general interest work harder within small community suggestion anecdote analogous experience would appreciated
