wikipedia anytime algorithm computer science anytime algorithm algorithm valid solution problem even interrupted time end algorithm expected find better better solution time keep running hill climbing hill climbing often produce better result algorithm amount time available perform search limited real time system anytime algorithm valid solution even interrupted time end hill climbing algorithm stuck local even run infinite time result better hill climbing called anytime algorithm
