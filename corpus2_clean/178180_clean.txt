intensive io app using coredata support icloud synching yet object created unique key use simple long long initialized current time need new key increment num worked well year app running isolated single device want add support automatic sync across device using icloud app written possibility two object created two different device could end key need avoid possibility looking idea solving issue requirement solution must meet num key need remain single integral converting existing key compound key would affect entire base likely result bug worth num solution depend internet connection user must able app add even internet connection still resolve properly later syncs icloud connection available accept one exception rule option available may open requiring internet connection first time app initialized one idea toying around head logically splitting integer key two part high num num bit could used sort device id rest represents actual key fuzzy part figuring come non conflicting device id fit bit viable since need deal million device need deal device would shared given icloud account open suggestion thanks update giving thought decided take short term hit right way using guid definitely best long term option using approach eliminates need various option deal handing key range translating key internet connection made original requirement prevented guid option neither sqlite io support simple num bit integer since large existing base written key simple integer type require major refactoring database schema end decided short term pain refactoring weighs long term issue dealing solution taking hit give much simpler less prone solution last long term
