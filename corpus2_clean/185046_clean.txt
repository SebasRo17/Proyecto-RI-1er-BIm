recently going learn haskell great good guide practice wanted solve project euler problem num specifies smallest positive number evenly divisible number num num decided first write determining whether given number divisible number x x mod num num num calculated smallest one using head sm head x x num x finally wrote display result putstrln show sm unfortunately took num second finish thing number num num yield result almost immediately result much smaller solution num num solved earlier c result num num also calculated almost instantly lead believe misunderstanding interpret problem haskell looked people solution found putstrln show foldl1 lcm num num fair enough us built end result much slower tutorial tell use haskell see much help transforming algorithm fast
