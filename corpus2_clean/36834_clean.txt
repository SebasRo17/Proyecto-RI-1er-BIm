created couple two variable plot form f x x number result curve representing answer image example usually plot least curve imperative labelled properly come solution form result range plot x x range plotlabel x plotrange range epilog table inset framed result n background white sqrt result n range range result n sqrt result n range range n dimension result result produce following result labeled plot seemingly confusing part specify inset coordinate fact search point result curve intersect linear function cut plot quadrant half satisfied aesthetic solution would like duplicate plug n play effect plot log scaling loglinearplot logplot loglogplot however dabbling better part today reached moment confusion made forget everything anything know log function plot anyone rescue loglinearplot x x result unlabeled logplot thanks advance r
