creating random graph suitable property exporting dimacs format already rather small graph say k vertex k edge export take several minute high end machine hope export much larger graph reasonable time g randomgraph degreegraphdistribution table export graph col g output file plaintext file roughly e line e number edge graph export run slow way speed export another way faster imagine make mathematica slow extracting edgelist graph writing file
