library function need load external data file look path default path library function path mathematica currently way make dynamic library use current path default path example consider library function read integer file example txt directory dynamic library file example txt contains one integer number cat example txt source library function include wolframlibrary h include iostream include sstream include fstream include string using namespace std dllexport mint wolframlibrary getversion return wolframlibraryversion dllexport int wolframlibrary initialize wolframlibrarydata libdata return extern c dllexport int readstring wolframlibrarydata libdata mint argc margument args margument re int string line ifstream file example txt getline file line istringstream iss line iss margument setinteger re return library error code ifstream file example txt try load file directory library file since current directory directory mathematic cannot find file example txt crash kernel two solution know use absolute path example change ifstream file example txt something like ifstream file user xslittlegrass example txt change current directory mathematica something like setdirecotory user xslittlegrass calling library function question solution somehow tell library function search current directory use library function parallel may many copy library file different location would prefer clean way call library function instead manually changing path time call
