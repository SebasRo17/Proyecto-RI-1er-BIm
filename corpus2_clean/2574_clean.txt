please consider following fresh mathematica kernel randomvariate efficient normaldistribution randomreal uniformly distributed noise randomreal normaldistribution timing null randomvariate normaldistribution timing null randomreal timing null randomvariate uniformdistribution timing null evaluate get timing result much similar randomreal normaldistribution timing null randomvariate normaldistribution timing null randomreal timing null randomvariate uniformdistribution timing null caching distribution definition really matter much obviously randomvariate advantage generate data mixed fully continuous fully discrete distribution general one generating random number standard distribution like normal poisson advantage performance otherwise using randomvariate instead randomreal randominteger
