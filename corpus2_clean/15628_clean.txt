using mathematica taylor series poly normal series e x x want produce log linear plot error easy enough following code logplot ab e x poly x produce log linear plot want plot even smaller value error particular want plot sensible near zero tell logplot use high precision follows logplot ab e x poly x workingprecision however destroys labeling axis bad behavior logplot anyone know gone wrong fix
