trying integrate function planar polygon fairly straightforward using either answer question use second answer use equilateral triangle centered origin polygon f po list basetri sqrt sqrt sqrt inpolyq poly pt total vectorangle transpose rotateright pt poly integrate function f case function return area triangle nintegrate f x boole inpolyq basetri x x min basetri max basetri min basetri max basetri pretty close exact value sqrt yes bunch error thrown also done infinite bound see answer nintegrate f x boole inpolyq basetri x x infinity infinity infinity infinity also pretty close exact value leave alone question bound give better result problem arises nintegrate f x z boole inpolyq basetri x z x infinity infinity infinity infinity z infinity infinity give error nintegrate izero integral error estimate integration subregions try increasing value minrecursion option increasing minrecursion help suspect planar polygon trouble figuring exactly infinitesimally thin plane satisfies inequality actually integrate function arbitrarily oriented planar polygon worth least would acceptable answer current problem work triangular region figured leave question general way
