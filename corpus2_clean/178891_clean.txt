working personal project designed help manage medium library specifically recording created window medium center going following part application window service monitor recording folder new recording completed meet specific criterion call several 3rd party cli application remove commercial encode video hard drive friendly format controller gui able modify setting service specifically add new show watch modify parameter cli application standalone gui based desktop application perform many function window service expect manually specific file instead automatically based specific criterion mentioned limited experience application complexity absolutely zero experience window service since 1st 3rd bullet share similar functionality design plan pull common functionality separate library shared part application num component need interact otherwise 2nd 3rd bullet seem share common functionality gui help define similar parameter one send service send directly cli application see advantage combining application hand standalone application bullet num really need interact service except possibly sharing common default parameter easily put xml common location seems make sense keep everything separate controller gui 2nd bullet stuck moment roll functionality allow user interaction service update setting criterion standalone application would better design decision keep separate specifically worried adding complexity communicating window service standalone application need wcf right approach allow controller gui interact window service better alternative moment envision need significant amount interaction maybe adding new task occasionally tweaking parameter something changed expect window service immediately use new setting
