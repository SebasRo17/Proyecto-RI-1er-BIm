answer probably obvious moment wondering somebody better sorting algorithm help lead right direction homework legitimately trying work within existing design something work related essentially start unordered list object represent something similar forum comment object may explicitly one one direct parent word parent num num num child child reference parent however parent cannot see child explicitly typically sorting list one would pas comparator given two object collection integer number represents distance two object graph distance two completely unrelated comment based timestamp issue two object compared timestamp object parent branch example do1 time 1000ms time do2 time do1 do2 compared result negative number two sorted correctly relative do1 likewise correct assume branch comment must less problem come comparing do2 thought compare highest order parent do2 case work child trying figure current graph even enough information comparator correctly appropriate number two comparison perhaps comparator need initialized unordered list first build tree structure see list child given parent explicitly perhaps need refactor stage concerned performance thank
