consider lalr num parser file format allows integer number floating point number usual something like num shall valid integer valid float conversion background might parsing rule floating point number integer number expected rule integer number expected e g foo1 bar float buzz bar buzz foo2 stuff consider something like foo3 bar float xyz float abc float buzz position rule instead float also shall allowed turning rule num rule one rule combination float option consider rule num num number using rule like float float help general rule reduce float rule like foo2 longer parsed grammar large enough one token lookahead cannot avoid shift reduce conflict resulting rule lexer see number without decimal point cannot decide whether parser currently expects float handled elegant way
