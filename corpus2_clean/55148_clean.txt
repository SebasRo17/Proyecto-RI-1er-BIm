using shared variable progress indicator via setsharedvariable counter dynamic counter keep track parallel computation however seems massive overhead ask paralleltable increment counter absolutetiming paralleltable counter mycompiledfunction null exact computation without counter time faster absolutetiming paralleltable mycompiledfunction null anybody know solution note happen use table cannot take advantage core
