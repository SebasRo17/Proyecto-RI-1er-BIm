know gaussian integral get analytical result many gaussian integral treat following general form integrate x n x n x n xd nd exp x x x xd matrix x x x xd c x c x cd xd x infinity infinity x infinity infinity xd infinity infinity matrix symmetrical positive definite matrix get analytical integral result general form however difficult task mathematica deal similiar expression take much time written package treating problem still sufficient need deal lot kind integral expression computation time important ever seen package kind gaussian integral give suggestion problem thank much thanks concept multinormaldistribution helpful way transform following integral expression standard form multinormaldistribution simple way vec r x r r z vec r x r r z vect r x r r z r x r r z vcof c c c c c c integrate exp vect mat vect vcof vect vec vec n vec vec l vec vec r x infinity infinity r infinity infinity r z infinity infinity r x infinity infinity r infinity infinity r z infinity infinity mat symmetrical positive definite sparse matrix n l integer thanks
