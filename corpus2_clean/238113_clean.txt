fairly new mvc trying get better understanding endless information theory general responsibility part mvc app read good deal find constantly second guessing implementation currently application setup model provides number method effectively crud work application method like add document path update account id status point work feel clunky effectively decide whether want write update every property model whether want one handle updating property given method interact model object sqlalchemy db toolkit orm lately considered possibility passing orm object back forth model controller controller would change property pas back model would handle session commits condition seems much easier writing ton crud method also seems break division responsibility allowing controller touch orm object hoping get guidance whole ton crud operation normal mvc apps acceptable pas orm object model controller controller ever update property model handle session database work also open alternative idea separate responsibility elegant way
