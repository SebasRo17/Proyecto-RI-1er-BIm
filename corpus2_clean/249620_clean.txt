list sound played user press button generate random number within range list pick sound index also prevent sound played next time button clicked since easy would like concentrate selection algorithm leave exclusion behind since make possible sound played repeatedly pattern would like adjust algorithm file played get moved end list sound beginning greater chance played end therefore minimizing repetition instead assigning weight index want one factor determining probability example would set factor num mean index num time probable played following one hopefully produce nice probability fastest solution seems mathematical map random number range index way set interval directly calculate result based random number cannot figure math behind idea need lay algorithm used android app programming language using
