attempting compute one loop contribution higgs mass one loop integral somewhat difficult decided try get mathematica see answer point right direction inputted integrate k k p k k x p p x x k infinity integration variable k rest constant mathematica outputted enter image description e simply wrote integral even attempt compute someone tell behaved like happened integral past make perform integral even output error message p please feel free edit improve tag closest found integration numerical integration
