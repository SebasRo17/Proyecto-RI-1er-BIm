despite long title question fairly simple let say cube 3d space want rotate along three ax based set instruction provided user elsewhere program would simplify set rotation simplicity sake use notation involved rotating rubik cube also programming unimportant x would clockwise rotation along x axis x would counterclockwise rotation along x axis x2 would two clockwise rotation rotation along x axis let say set instruction x x set instruction thing single instruction z would done simpler case x x x2 x2 rotation cancel question best way programming perspective simplify set instruction
