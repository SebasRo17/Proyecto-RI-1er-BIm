unit testing idea make appropriate field use yet clear something like exists would possibly called ordinary unit test combine test logic expected outcome essence testing framework check booleans match expected result result generalize test reference audited function also result value like unit assert test num looking separation concern test contain tested logic outcome result handled unit testing assertion framework example unit probe test probe actually double collector first afterwards verification expected num mentioned test stored managed elsewhere scheme called would call hope find actual implementation proper terminology obviously pattern unfit tdd strictly regression testing also obviously cannot used case simpler test subject analyzed way anything else ordinary unit test setup assertion step required yes could manually accomplished crafting would still require test logic also keep mind inquiring use scripting language aware xunit pattern originates hence elaborate btw discovered one test execution framework allows shortening simple test notation test num thus result longer coded comment still complete separation course would work scalar result
