want compute inverse matrix say dimension time defined large finite field extension gf using package finitefields mathematica computation time exponential respect matrix dimension following code illustrates problem finitefields table ext first absolutetiming inverse array gf ext randominteger ext n n n using intel xeon x ghz bit o mathematica v received following timing result believe source problem finitefields package defines many upvalues downvalues subvalues time plus head gf consequently pattern matching argument degraded anyone know patch finitefields package faster substitute providing similar interface many thanks
