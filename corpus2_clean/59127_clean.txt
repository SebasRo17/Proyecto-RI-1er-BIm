summary since mathematica version pacletmanager seems engineered escalating hijack path variable add package need pacletinfo file documentation function correctly however use file also seems trigger override path variable control file loading break functionality wolfram workbench using mathematica example suppose minimal example test directory userbasedirectory application directory contains pacletinfo file read paclet name test version well file foo txt containing text application directory also homedirectory another test directory containing text file foo txt reading home directory mathematica behaves would expect empty path variable get find either foo txt file put homedirectory path find file homedirectory note clearing path variable interfere stuff like searching documentation probably want run fresh kernel restart path get test foo txt evaluation get noopen cannot open test foo txt failed path homedirectory get test foo txt home directory mathematica different behavior even empty path find foo txt application directory homedirectory path find foo txt homedirectory path get test foo txt application directory path homedirectory get test foo txt home directory mathematica however always find text file application directory even homedirectory path path get test foo txt application directory path homedirectory get test foo txt application directory pacletinfo file get expected version behavior version side note effect result change name test directory userbasedirectory application directory something else get behaves foo txt directory whatever name listed pacletinfo file discussion seems happening new kernel started manually call pacletmanager rebuildpacletdata list path scanned pacletinfo file name entry file registered directory search path corresponding actual directory pacletinfo file located recent version path take precedence search path path behavior version interferes way wolfram workbench supposed work launching mathematica workbench put local development folder beginning path variable directory list development version package loaded rather installed version application directory pacletinfo file present however installed version always loaded question curious anyone insight whether current behavior considered desirable clearly list documentation directory maintained necessary path overridden anyone workaround get workbench load development version package obvious method either overwrite delete installed version application directory clumsy elegant would manually add development directory beginning paclet search path well path found way yet
