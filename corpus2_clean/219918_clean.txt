done piece creating sample think heavy algorithm every time call recursive create new vector passed way making algorithm faster algorithm description already said creates sample recursively n number element found equal num sample else sample passed add every element population create vector everyone new sample call new sample n number element found decremented private static n vector float population vector float sample exit condition n equal num fuction self call n num showmessagedialog every element population added sample recalled x num x population size x vector float new vector float sample add population elementat x n num population
