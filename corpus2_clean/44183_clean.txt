suppose two sparse array l sparsearray r sparsearray problem construct another sparse matrix whose entry coming matrix specific property well need get arrayrules obviously instance need get sparse matrix p whose nonzero entry union positive entry entry l r e position l resp r positive entry p also positive entry union position taken easily union case arrayrules l r x positive x r case arrayrules r r x positive x r problem notice entry first list second list sometimes opposite situation say collision happens position output sparse matrix maximum possible value possible write neatly also need make sparse matrix n whose non zero entry common nonzero entry l r caveat collision defined corresponding entry minimum possible entry advanced thanks help
