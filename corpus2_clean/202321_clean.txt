reading article isp seem two contradicting definition isp according first definition see num num num isp state class implementing interface forced implement functionality need thus fat interface interface b c myclass split smaller interface 1 2 interface 1 b interface 2 c myclass 2 since way myclass able implement method need c without forced also provide dummy implementation b c according second definition see num num answer isp state myclient calling method myservice aware method myservice need word myclient need functionality c instead myservice public public b public c public client myservice service service c service segregate myservice method client specific interface public interface 1 b public interface 2 c myservice 1 2 client 2 service service c service thus former definition goal isp make life class implementing interface easier latter goal isp make life client calling method myservice easier two different definition isp actually correct num going split smaller interface method end decided based cohesive member make sense put cohesive method within interface thought isp pattern need client take precedence cohesiveness interface word thought isp lump within interface method needed particular client even mean leaving interface method sake cohesiveness also put inside interface thus lot client ever needed call also adhere isp pattern put inside also even though two method highly cohesive num think confusion stem hidden assumption first definition implementing class already following single responsibility principle implementing class following srp referring class implement class implement 1 2 assume referring class implement assume already follow srp thanks
