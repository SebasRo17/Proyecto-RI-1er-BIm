equation parameter involve integration limit integral defined analytically also require equation solving eventually couldnt incorporate everything nice way solve code density function f e sqrt pi f e sqrt pi likelihood function l e inverse likelihood function log integral limit yu yl problem parameter findroot l yu sqrt f yu f yu yu findroot l yl sqrt f yl f yl yl whenever known easy find solution yu yl equation follows h integrate sqrt f sqrt f yu infinity integrate sqrt f sqrt f infinity yl integrate sqrt f f f f f f f sqrt f f f f f f f yl yu h integrate sqrt f f yu infinity integrate sqrt f f infinity yl integrate sqrt f f f f f f f yl yu using findroot solve follows findroot h h stepmonitor print step one see h h involve yl yu solution another equation equation numerically evaluated point eventual aim solve last findroot code simple word would mathematica would guess would go first findroots code solve get yl yu numerically using value would obtain h h eventually would go last findroot code see h h satisfied would change equation satisfied course worst way solving equation mathematica would better way suppose modify code mathematica could start solving equation horrible take case alot time thanks reading problem help
