building internet thing solution number real time feed need make couple design decision regard store reporting looking two deployment model local small linux server capture multiple stream usually new point second record length small basically fixed format message num byte model cloud based transaction rate much higher num point second concentrating local model first prototype us sqlite mono work fine traditional rdms manner however aware rdbms optimal time series system possibly nosql solution might better think sql approach due real time analytics requirement want able easily report sum count average mean sd min max potentially time series datasets basically system recalculate new point although done performance testing see year dataset size going pretty large num byte second year 600mb could num different time series datasets great real time calculation average etc normal sql also want keep size cost server low able add cpu memory disk space ok option system store delta change real time feed instead regular point save num disk space however know easy way set calculation like running average storing delta far know possible standard sql statement could wrong given use case num question num seriously consider nosql store suggestion advantage nosql store model num best real time set calculation like average without lot complexity hardware platform option either mono node linux window num efficient real time set calculation especially average majority calculation either sqlite nosql db storing delta
