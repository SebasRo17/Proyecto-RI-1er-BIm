trying find number unique element vector compared multiple vector using c vector sorted order size num num num suppose v1 num num num num num v2 num num num num v3 num v4 num num num num num num num v5 num num num num num num num number unique element v1 num e number num tried two approach num added vector v2 v3 v4 v5 vector vector element v1 checked element present vector num combined vector v2 v3 v4 v5 using merge sort single vector compared v1 find unique element note sample vector v1 vector merged contains v2 v3 v4 v5 num unsigned compute unique element 1 vector unsigned sample vector vector vector unsigned vector merged unsigned duplicate num unsigned num sample vector size unsigned j num j vector merged size j std find vector merged j begin vector merged j end sample vector vector merged j end duplicate sample vector size duplicate num unsigned compute unique element 2 vector unsigned sample vector vector unsigned vector merged unsigned unique num unsigned num j num sample vector size j vector merged size sample vector vector merged j j else sample vector vector merged j unique else j sample vector size unique sample vector size unique two technique see num give faster result num num efficient way find element running std find vector element v1 num num extra overhead comparing vector v2 v3 v4 v5 sorting better way edit vector sorted order
