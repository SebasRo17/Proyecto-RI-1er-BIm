fully automated memory management increase productivity integrity greatly usual implementation gc critical problem non deterministic controllable cause many problem burst cpu load critical realtime application kind optimization incremental concurrent gc reduce problem still non deterministic eliminate problem completely thought gc never solve problem recently learned realized gc operation need fully hidden gc also deterministic cpu burst free exposing properly designed behavior control think rc manually invoked cycle detection look efficient better approach deterministic controllable fully automatic memory management implementation get link example implementation edit added line make question clear deterministic controllable context mean user track creation destroying explicitly also control amount time memory management operation load fully automatic mean allocates clear memory like gc without extra concern
