experience difficulty using custom transformation rule give two concrete problem interested fixing understanding wrong attitude issue general suppose try make symbolic computation involving gamma function gamma z effective particularly want mathematica make use property frac gamma z gamma z z simplification evaluation simplify gamma z gamma z return gamma z gamma z order handle task let define first transformation function tf e e gamma x gamma simplify x evaluation simplify gamma z gamma z transformationfunctions automatic tf indeed give z however execution simplify gamma z gamma z transformationfunctions automatic tf result real simplification give gamma z gamma z well one unwitty way deal problem define separate transformation function ratio square ratio third power require third transformation function would like handle possibility universally tried something like tfuniversal e e gamma x gamma n simplify x n work way solve problem second chapter adventure includes teaching mathematica identity gamma z gamma z frac pi sin pi z problem come right start define transformation function tf e e gamma x gamma simplify x pi sin pi x evaluate simplify gamma z gamma z gamma z gamma z transformationfunctions automatic tf give pi csc pi z gamma z gamma z simplification occurs first case second wonder problem overall often troubled issue possible find reference literature using custom transformation rule help highly appreciated thanks
