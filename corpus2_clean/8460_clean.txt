trying use sphericalplot create image surface get rough edge surface around boundary however rotating image slightly anomaly go away like find way create smooth image without rotating picture manually also strange spot pole also problematic seems inevitable tried numerous setting automatically rotating image nothing seems help edge distortion code top view surface b epsilon log log freq n sqrt n n n pi freq r theta phi epsilon sin freq sphericalharmonicy b phi theta sphericalplot r theta pi phi phi pi pi theta pi mesh false viewpoint infinity boxed false ax false lighting spot gray specularity pi spot gray specularity pi spot gray specularity pi directional gray plotstyle specularity preserveimageoptions false mathematica graphic
