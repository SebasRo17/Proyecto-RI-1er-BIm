research work need put comparison different community detection algorithm instead implementing algorithm would like use method already provided mathematica would anyone help figuring different algorithm used findgraphcommunities found method get community structure among method centrality possibly use algorithm girvan newman edge betweenness centrality method modularity work similar algorithm proposed newman girvan however different version kind algorithm literature would like put proper citation algorithm could find detail implementation algorithm please provide information also please provide link full documentation function findgraphcommunities option available method could able find option reference document thank
