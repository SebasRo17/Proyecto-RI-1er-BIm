generalizing previous question define log negative real evaluate lower edge branch real positive value x mathematica polylogarithm function polylog x yield result whose imaginary part negative defined evaluated cut example polylog spirit previous question linked cleanest way get mathematica evaluate function cut get positive imaginary part desired output edit polylog appears inside definition larger function using need use function analytic numeric purpose able evaluate numerically also able differentiate without giving lot non analytic garbage associated deserved change anything get property
