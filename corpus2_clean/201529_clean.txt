took test recently found could touch comfortably around num wpm given sort autocorrect intellisense would even faster know maybe num wpm definitely program anywhere near speed led wonder exactly one become faster programming look problem design algorithm solve problem solved know going give take run take much longer actually program found general coding done typing word even letter number num cannot simultaneously think mean come stuff typing ability look ahead either one example writing might feel go finger hit keyboard really know going say next change get ability think ahead typing take advantage typing speed also general one become faster problem solver know usual list practice problem particular excercise one emphasize train mind example playing various logic game sudoku etc carry much help improving sense logic area programming sorry bunch question sort related p possible use program heard user achieve speed like num num wpm assuming somehow think faster would pretty cool obviously fast programming good programming always training become better programmer hurt able fast
