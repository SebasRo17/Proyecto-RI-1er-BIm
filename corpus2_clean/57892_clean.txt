trying compute dimensional volume sphere radius r using monte carlo r f piecewise sum x r nintegrate f x x x x x x x x x x method montecarlorule point result always factor e p ep correct factoring wondering wrong enter image description also want clean code nintegrate f x x x x x x x x x x method montecarlorule point try nintegrate f table x r r method montecarlorule point work table give list need make sequence somehow trying apply sequence table still give list anyway get around
