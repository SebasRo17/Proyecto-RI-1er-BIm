want define function take two integer indicating length vector solves simple set expression set point find value vector far managed successfully create function exactly say except rather taking two integer argument take two vector forgive length next code fragment solution svec nvec nsolve table approx svec nvec co n pi length nvec length svec exact co n pi length nvec length svec n length nvec length svec join svec nvec co n pi length nvec length svec part set point work fine attempt change take integer following step one create function take integer give vector length integer nvec q table unique n q svec table unique step two replace svec nvec previous code fragment nvec q svec could also get rid length obviously solution q nsolve table approx svec nvec q co n pi q exact co n pi q n q join svec nvec q step three call function sol solution reason work never get error never finish evaluating help would much appreciated
