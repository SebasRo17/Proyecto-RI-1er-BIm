simple mathematica expression solve sqrt b b b b sqrt b b return version also version b b b b b b b b first solution seem correct example putting b satisfy either equation hand add verifysolutions option solve get right answer solve sqrt b b b b sqrt b b verifysolutions true return b b b b b b b expected behaviour seems bit odd add option solve make check solution returned actually satisfies original equation
