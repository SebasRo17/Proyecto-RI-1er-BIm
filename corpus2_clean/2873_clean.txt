found alternative way express old solution pwd sqrt pi integrate exp sum exp n pi integrate exp z tan degree n z exp z tan degree n z z plus n solving partial solution pwd exp sum exp n pi integrate exp z tan degree n z exp z tan degree n z z plus n plotting indefinite integral time used following code function sqrt nintegrate pwd tabulate table function finalfunction interpolation tabulate loglogplot finalfunction finalfunction plotrange frame true used code similar solution positive result specific solution get work seems would take long time could someone provide alternative way help mathematica along
