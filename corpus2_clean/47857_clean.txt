want solve linear equation ax b mathematica using kylov subspace solver method preferably bicgstab suppose delta omega following laplacian angular momentum operator enter image description instead using finite difference matrix evaluating delta omega using derivative fourier space higher accuracy derivative description operator one solve linear equation delta omega psi phi equation delta omega x psi b phi ax b one extract delta omega plug linearsolve b clearly depends upon psi used linearsolve b delta omega depends x psi get correct result one solve matlab using following function x bicgstab b attempt solve system linear equation x b x function handle afun afun x return x analog function handle operation mathematica linearsolve deal matrix depends x ax b help appreciated
