given png image three leaf like extract individual leaf write png file using mathematica note original image box bounding component may possibly intersect another component need taken care e output png one complete leaf part another leaf segmentation look quite easy use alpha channel say hopefully simple problem experienced mathematica user mathematica happens within reach figured might good tool use could code go directory image similar one perform desired operation png image save output image another directory would great component image png saved image png image png etc edit would obviously unrealistic expect segmentation algorithm work universally based single sample image showed unfortunately one suggested failing case clearly two example hoping author able modify answer work image hopefully image like one particularly problem cropping trimming masking step opposed image preprocessing step might need tuned work example mention interested special case png image alphachannel might used advantage happy solution offered far generally applicable need able deal case component quite close together touching
