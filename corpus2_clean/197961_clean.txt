single responsibility reason change entity uniquely identify word responsibility eric evan ddd book pg num basic responsibility entity establish continuity behavior clear predictable best kept spare rather focusing attribute even behavior strip entity definition intrinsic characteristic particularly identify commonly used find match add behavior essential concept attribute required behavior beyond look remove behavior attribute object associated core entity beyond identity issue entity tend fulfill responsibility coordinating operation object num strip entity definition intrinsic characteristic particularly identify commonly used find match add behavior essential concept entity assigned unique id identity established would assume entity need behavior maintain identity help identify thus understand kind behavior author referring besides find match operation behavior essential concept num strip entity definition intrinsic characteristic particularly identify commonly used find match beyond look remove behavior attribute object associated core entity behavior help identify entity still characterize behavior intrinsic characteristic entity e barking intrinsic dog flying intrinsic airplane laying egg intrinsic bird put object associated entity example put barking behavior associated dog entity num beyond look remove behavior attribute object associated core entity myentity delegate responsibility resp b resp object b respectively even though resp b resp work done b instance client still served resp b resp myentity mean client perspective two responsibility belong myentity thus mean myentity also resp b resp responsibility violating srp b even assume resp b resp belong myentity myentity still responsibility ab resp coordinating operation object b myentity violate srp since minimum two responsibility uniquely identify also ab resp myentity private private b b public geta public b getb coordinate operation object b public encapsulates single responsibility resp b encapsulates single responsibility resp b b b update num behavior context refering semantic behavior example property e attribute domain used uniquely identify behavior represented directly expected behavior duplicate value property would almost never need actually implement behavior e operation would somehow maintain entity identity since explained behavior exist concept domain model form id attribute entity translate id attribute part semantics lost e part implicitly make sure id unique lost num property age context outside person entity make sense move different however information could easily stored separate location unique identifier hence confusing reference behavior age could lazy loaded age property lazy loaded may call behavior even though semantically age attribute num could easily operation specific address verification valid address may know design time whole concept break object smallest part agree lose context moving age different context lost moved dateofbirth property different usually move reason move address another dateofbirth dateofbirth intrinsic person entity less chance somewhere future may need define operation specific dateofbirth num must say still know whether myentity also resp b resp responsibility myentity also ab resp considered violation srp num behavior author referring behavior associated entity behavior modify state entity understand correctly saying entity contain behavior modify attribute e state b behavior necessarily modify state entity still considered intrinsic characteristic entity example barking would intrinsic characteristic dog entity even modify dog state include behavior entity moved object num far moving behavior object author referring object specifically though quote include author mention paragraph case behavior attribute also get moved entity though understand benefit moving behavior vos num assuming myentity see question num original post violate srp would say responsibility myentity among thing also comprised resp b resp ab resp ab resp coordinate object b b ab resp delegating resp b resp object b associated myentity num eric evan ddd book pg num customerid one identifier customer entity figure num phone number address would often used find match customer define person identity often used part mean determining example phone address attribute moved customer real project choice would depend domain customer typically matched distinguished example customer many contact phone number different purpose phone number associated identity stay sale contact customerid one identifier customer entity figure num phone number address would often used find match customer define person identity often used part mean determining quote state attribute associated identity stay entity assume author mean entity contain attribute often used find match entity attribute moved b attribute moved example assumption address attribute used find match customer thus want move address attribute customer instead customer address create property customer address address move address attribute associated vo address would say customer still contains address attribute c example phone address attribute moved customer real project choice would depend domain customer typically matched distinguished example customer many contact phone number different purpose phone number associated identity stay sale contact author wrong since assume many contact phone number customer belong particular customer say phone number associated identity much customer one phone number num reason author suggests stripping entity one initially creates customer entity tendency populate attribute one think associated customer centric approach behavior ultimately leading anemic domain model topic thought anemic domain model result moving behavior entity example populating entity lot attribute would result customer much behavior since probably also include customer behavior modify additional attribute thus violation srp thanks
