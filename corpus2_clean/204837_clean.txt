currently set component named datavalues first one defines abstract base datavalue contains whole load implementation num component define interface similar minus also contain bunch implementation num depend datavalues dependency word component currently contains whole inheritance hierarchy recently watched robert c martin clean coder point one common mistake made package design made realize exact thing going described package question best improve upon current component design luckily none component seen first release yet thing still moved around boundary still redefined release horizon though better get right thinking create new component hold mentioned abstract interface component would also contain exception component perhaps trivial implementation interface new component would needed current one one needing current one later category number component depend new get rid current dependency much concrete unstable one containing interface implementation great stable dependency principle equally nice reuse release equivalence principle however rather bad come common closure common reuse principle concretely mean component need interface care one still depend package thus affected good reason considering abstract stable new component end really see causing much problem looking idea better draw component boundary concern suggestion alternative described
