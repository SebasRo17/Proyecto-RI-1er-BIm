curious whether possible get mathematica simplify manipulate expand basic expectation conditional expectation sum random variable etc simple example might var x e x e x e trivial show expanded var x e x e xy e e x e x e e simplified var x var x var cov x sort manipulation easy enough hand exploring lot different possibility easy get bogged make mistake etc would nice get mathematica manipulation however able figure get mathematica perform sort operation without defining actual distribution thought
