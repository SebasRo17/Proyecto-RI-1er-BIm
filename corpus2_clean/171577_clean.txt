started introductory material absolutely horrendous get excellent grade accepted master degree hence beginner question assignment write algorithm pseudo yet solve board game sudoku essentially note say algorithm specification treatment applied get question lie wording algorithm could probably seem put paper coherent way game board one algorithm write find solution looking num square either horizontal vertical see one three sub square match number looking none match number looking place one num set num sub square see image get better idea note task write complete solver algorithm solve particular case described really get head around formulate solution term described maybe simple thinking num dimensional set size num num solved number search ouput num dimensional set size num num either solved partially solved treatment scan set square column 3x3 square check number match column move next column proceed next 3x3 square column rinse repeat make sense algorithm written plain english looking answer algorithm per se rather formulation algorithm plain english enter image description note apparently clear solving possible solution solving particular set rule make assignment case even remotely relevant focus question
