update would like produce plot explores difference squarefree count expected mean without using squarefreeq something along line primeomega range b primenu range listlineplot zeta accumulate flatten inner b list filling axis primeomega range b primenu range plot x zeta accumulate flatten inner b list x filling axis hope achieving something similar plot x log x primepi x x filling axis alternatively slightly alter artes cf plot see instead cf count range squarefreeq range using something like primeomega range b primenu range cf count range accumulate flatten inner b list range much clumsier realise would like avoid using squarefreeq old would like mathematica output instance primeomega x primenu x given range clearly example output set square free number primeomega range b primenu range count transpose b primeomega range b primenu range count transpose b work slow b clumsy wondering succinct way putting addition would like ultimately create plot essentially counting function primeomega x primenu x etc way
