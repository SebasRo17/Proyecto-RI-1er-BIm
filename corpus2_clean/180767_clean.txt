trying implement version algorithm vector hidden removal e like avoid form rasterization found description algorithm mention actually deal implementation difficulty precise write well even least pseudocode result yield face subdivided point interior either front facing back facing hence traversing edge segment visibility increment going body decrement coming underneath simulate traversing edge idea implementation lay behind basically description bit overwhelming since scant image pseudocodes share grateful
