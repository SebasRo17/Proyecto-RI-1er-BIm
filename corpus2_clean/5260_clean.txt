possible attach assumption symbol relates question work involves physical equation e basic assumption variable always hold true physical sense current example involves higher order laguerre gaussian mode u p w r r sqrt p discretedelta p exp p w sqrt r w laguerrel p r w exp r r w example consider p psi psi give electric field distribution basic gaussian mode get mode intensity sure concise way writing assumption assuming real w r r r r real real ab u w r r simplify frac e frac r w pi w back question define function simplifies without explicitly listing assumption every time perform algebraic operation said function looking previously linked question define function v p w r r assuming real w r r r r real real u p w r r simplify operation applies definition operation ab v w r r simplify frac e text left r left frac w frac pi r lambda right right pi text ab w simplify defining function using pattern condition e f positive allow algebraic manipulation f remain unevaluated hesitant use assumption whilst would work specific example see several problem like use approach setting global assumption would cause issue
