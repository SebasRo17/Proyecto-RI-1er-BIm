designing set apis application working want keep style consistent class write found inconsistency introducing know best way resolve example specific c would apply language similar mechanism class need implementation purpose necessarily want expose api make internal whereever needed generally would design normally would e g make member public protected private necessary change visibility level internal might class look like internal interface addto set internal private readonly parameter public small item parameter public addto set internal abstract private readonly parameter public composite item parameter public abstract get protected parameter internal private readonly parameter public big item parameter public override get public addto set another generated part parser scanner structure contains field possible value represent generated internal control visibility member decided make internal well internal partial struct valuetype internal internal internal myitem internal internal static eq scanner internal static scanner internal static scanner feel odd first set class necessarily make member public well could made internal internal member internal accessed internally anyway make public like idea way write class change drastically e change us public internal internal thought make sense might want make member declared public internal less clear declared internal
