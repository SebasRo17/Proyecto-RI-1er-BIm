working event processor framework simple game writing multiple type event handled since event carry distinct piece e one carry player position another carry message timestamp ended creating different class though still implement common interface currently marker interface within event processor event set event handler implementing corresponding interface e g anonymous implementing handle since interface implemented javascript engine rhino unable use single generic interface trying implement actual engine currently follows method inlined show idea behind compact representation instanceof return list eventhandler due limitation generic eventhandler eh foohandler obviously bunch else instanceof block catch handle classcastexceptions problem seems like mi use oriented language stringently verify hand retain safety alternative know event extends eventhandler certain use polymorphism dynamic dispatch would require reflective cast polymorphic handler would still break complete safety another layer top interface multiple event processor would lead duplication would imply separate thread current event processor designed retain single thread processor would need single queue whose declared back square one approaching completely incorrect manner
