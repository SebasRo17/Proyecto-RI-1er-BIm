sequence binary string want find match among set longer sequence binary string match mean compared sequence give lowest average distance element shorter sequence matched sequence one longer set let try explain example set video frame hashed using perceptual hashing algorithm video frame look roughly hash want match short video clip set longer video see clip contained one mean need find sequence hashed frame short video lowest average distance compared long video short video sub string want match hash long video src clue string need match specific order given e g always match element always match element example would map thusly question algorithm finding lowest average distance order element compared matter na approach compare substring sequence every source cut course need something preferably match much shorter sub set million element looked mvp tree tree similar everything seems take account one binary sequence num num num num num num num num num added calculation example distance correct matter num dist num dist num dist num average num num dist num dist num dist num average num num dist num dist num dist num average num num dist num dist num dist num average num winner sequence num average distance num
