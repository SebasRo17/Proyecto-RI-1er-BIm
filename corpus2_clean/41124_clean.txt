beginner question creating plot mathematica want grid line multiple constant value e g following plot vertical grid line multiple pi enter image description corresponding mathematica code manipulate plot sin x x n pi gridlines pi range n none gridlinesstyle dashed n since equidistant grid line common wonder easier way use complicated expression like pi range n generate equidistant grid line mathematica provide anything simpler
