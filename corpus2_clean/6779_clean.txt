let say want build list first prime simple enough absolutetiming plist table prime take second also find number prime less million th prime using absolutetiming primepi take negligible time impression way get precise primepi n result without actually finding prime less n mean create list first prime take negligible time believe though instead reusing intermediary generated previous prime n call instead start scratch every time take long run write function memoize see could built additionally case memoise process something cannot general assume many case involving table would significant saving saving partial term previous iteration assume way way enable optimization wishful thinking update thing regardless prime primepi implemented taking second generate first million prime rather ridiculous simple little sieve c million prime time think stand reason work perhaps better example absolutetiming list table sum q q took second computer little excessive possible way think took long every iteration optimized hopefully less hopefully every time q q every time evaluated instead absolutetiming list table q q q take second much better way get always turn first second additionally would tend doubt realizes different term form linear equation would easier two addition two division three multiplication division
