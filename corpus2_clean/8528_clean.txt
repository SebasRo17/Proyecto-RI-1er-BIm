looking straightforward way find partition set integerpartitions seems provide useful start thing get bit complicated imagine want find way partition list mylist b c e f integerpartitions give breakdown number element subset breakdown integerpartitions length mylist following function g take list breakdown outputting useful result clearly possible result g g break g drop first break rest break append take first break g mylist integerpartitions length mylist matrixform matrix output suspect may better alternative g perhaps even straightforward list manipulation command btw would need use permutation mylist ensure partition permutation mylist would instrumental table g k integerpartitions length mylist k permutation mylist
