longer analytic expression several variable containing special function others mathematica bring tool package examine stability evaluate expression numerically want understand variable accuracy numerical result lowest order see rewrite expression improve result finite precision note goal obtain high accuracy result telling mathematica use digit rather want expression evaluates accurately using relatively small number digit since obvious achieve length expression would like help mathematica telling optimize expression
