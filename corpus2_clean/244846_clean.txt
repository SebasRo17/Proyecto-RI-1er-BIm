relative newcomer oop bit trouble creating good design come interface consider n public method number class b c interacts different way access subset n method maximum degree encapsulation achieved implementing interface e etc however b c etc also interact combinatorial explosion interface maximum n n num precise benefit encapsulation becomes outweighed bloat best practice scenario whole idea restricting access public function different way different class silly altogether one could imagine language explicitly allows sort encapsulation e g instead declaring public one could specify exactly class visible since feature c maybe misguided try back door
