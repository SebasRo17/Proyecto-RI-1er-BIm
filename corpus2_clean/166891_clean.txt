simulation evaluate certain x simulation several time save x vector v run finished evaluate mean standard deviation vector v approach work implies saving value x computer quite old limited ram wondering way update mean standard deviation knowing x n num th value n run update mean standard deviation simulation added set please note conceptual example save one number x thousand simulation really problem running big number run keep past value memory
