suppose two curve f x f x want fill area using color corresponding vaule f x f x filling line segemts length rendered color question using built command like filling fillingstyle colorfunction etc direct call colorfunction help specification colorfunction function x g x x refered always absoulate coordinate however need refer case figured get done using pure function write code sketch similiar idea suggested question treatment universal besides already example documented mathematica listlineplot accumulate randomreal colorfunction rainbow filling axis actually similar case question f x always equal zero think solution using built command furthermore indeed solution simply generalize relation merely f x f x interesting form
