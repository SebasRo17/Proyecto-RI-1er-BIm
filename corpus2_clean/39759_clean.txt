row vector p p p p obtained following constraint p p p b p b p b p b known p p p p geq furthermore may one p vector satisfying constraint want use p vector following equation plot x dimensional space x p x p x p x p p p x known would thankful anyone idea best thank much help code gave many idea since beginner mathematica point putting p every step finding corresponding dimensional line always correct may solution whose p equal maybe explain properly problem looking following set constraint p c p p p p c c c c c known p p p p p known p e p p p p e e e e e known p p p edited p said may several p vector satisfying constraint furthermore may non negative p vector e g p satisfies constraint obtaining p vector based want plot following x variable dimension x p x p x p x p p p furthermore way problem modeled sure line tried many different method found internet unfortunately none worked would grateful anyone help case
