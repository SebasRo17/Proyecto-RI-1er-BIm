tried program simple linear optimization model know mistake lie function sum z product two constant e h decision variable x first constraint say every decision variable x z take value second constraint say every decision variable x select one option z therefore sum x z equaling third constraint say second way around nminimize sum subscript e subscript h z subscript x z z u forall z subscript x z element integer subscript x z forall sum subscript x z z forall z sum subscript x z z subscript x z
