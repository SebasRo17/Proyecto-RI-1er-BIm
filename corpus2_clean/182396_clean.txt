designing simple gui allow user create route clicking repeatedly map panel faced design dilemma represent node route construct abstracted follows user click n time screen sequence create chain n node chain completed user add node either selecting node middle inserting existing node simply automatically appending end next click first determined use collection represent chain unexpected difficulty surface would appear perfect example linkedlist consider follows user wish insert node middle chain first chooses node screen wish insert new node node belongs linked list need maintain reference encompassing list somewhat unusual practice think even still locate node list insert find node linear time insert new node constant time try thing arraylist also performs best linear time find node linear time insert new node linear time neither case really seems desirable briefly idea using linkedhashset allow insertion middle linked list seem fundamentally correct use set implementation something like came node node previous node next chain chain node maintains reference previous next node well chain belongs latter part seems unconventional possibly even wasteful convinced may necessary chain node first node last chain know first last node user want insert node middle chain selects node simply update first last reference neighbor want add node end chain simply selects node screen aware chain belongs therefore last node chain chain immediately begin updating link reference last node node added well keeping last reference date really wanted use collection approach seems better love thought criticism experienced programmer thanks
