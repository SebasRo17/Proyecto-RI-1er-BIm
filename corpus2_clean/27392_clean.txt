edit answer posted jens work built function however starting wonder related mathematica install somehow version example mathematica documentation center implies ask inversefunction find inverse non built pure function able however test tried duplicate result documentation center give inversefunction b c b c using exact input get inversefunction b c inputted command documentation center talking version fundamental difference version use inversefunction workaround also tried use definition inversefunction solve case solve us inverse function find solution evinced message get inversefunction ifun inverse function used value may lost multivalued inverse example following jens answer inversefunction g z q solve g q z q give answer g z replace g log head built function give answer example inversefunction log z q solve log q z q give answer e z correct function using solve deal non built function e g q solve log q z q z course right answer problem trying implement workaround based jens solution hang error reason namely know non built function relatively inexperienced programming mathematica sure workarounds may also seems strange documentation center example work although say think probably version issue anyone idea want able take derivative one function given variable w r different function variable e frac df x dg x know use chain rule appropriately recast form frac dh dy h f x evaluated x g g inverse function g couple semi related question already posted one asking take derivative log arbitrary function already asked question variationald initially thought wanted referenced third question dt command figure get want either messing around dt found weirdly actually special case example log x log x log x log x log x however command log x log x x log x return zero dt meanwhile head right direction example dt log x log x dt x log x x correct except know make evaluate even though sure mathematica handle inverting function use chain rule want use logarithm function example want able take derivative fit complicated functional form experimental data w r different complicated function principle could hash equivalent derivative w r x really want
