solve equation numerically findroot returning quadruple solver sometimes find root depending parameterization equation select replacement rule full filling equation select rule memberq eqns false question following easily calculate deviation application replacement rule quadruple containing false check badly equation met problem soon apply rule equation result type boolean numeric needed calculating deviation note back substitution previous solution solver variating parameter see thank suggestion
