something like public byte myobject obj unit testing like byte new byte num 0x01 0x02 0xff assert isequal myobject edit two way seen proposed num using hardcoded expected value like example num using decoder decode encoded byte comparing object problem see num brittle requires lot hard coded value problem num testing encoder depends decoder working correctly encoder decoder broken equally place test could produce positive may well way test case fine asking question see better strategy testing reveal internals particular encoder working asking general would solve problem feel internals important assume given always produce byte
