suppose arbitrary differentiable function g depends g suppose want following integral int d frac partial g partial however know exact form g cannot integral expand one method integration part think integration allows rewrite integral boxed int d frac partial g partial sg int d g would like verify make sure making mistake way use mathematica verify boxed equation left hand side indeed equal right hand side tried integrate g g integrate g mathematica running version know automatically evaluate
