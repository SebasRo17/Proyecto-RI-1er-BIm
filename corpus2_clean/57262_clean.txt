x x x airyai infinity analytic solution ode airy function x airyai x use ndsolve solve ode know express boundary condition infinity first tried set error message mathematica ndsolve bvluc equation derived boundary condition numerically ill conditioned boundary condition may sufficient uniquely define solution computed solution may match boundary condition poorly ndsolve berr significant error boundary value residual returning best solution found tried replace x x tan u u pi boundary condition finite location however still receive error message use ndsolve ndsolve bvluc equation derived boundary condition numerically ill conditioned boundary condition may sufficient uniquely define solution computed solution may match boundary condition poorly ndsolve mxst maximum number step reached point u ndsolve berr significant error boundary value residual returning best solution found ndsolve mxst maximum number step reached point u equation posing analytically solved however really equation solved ndsolve boundary condition infinity asking possibility solve equation numerically according different kindly advice numerically solve ode unbounded region impossible practical way shooting method replacing infinity numerical result agrees well exact solution x airyai x
