possible numerically solve differential equation smooth data involved example following instruction return error ndsolve bvdisc ndsolve u x unitbox x u u u x ndsolve bvdisc ndsolve currently able solve boundary value problem discrete variable suppose discrete variable mean discontinuous function maybe problem completely different error reported mathematica finite element framework able return weak classical solution definitely able deal simple equation maybe need enable option method please note know dsolve u x unitbox x u u u x result complex scenario cannot hope get analytical answer
