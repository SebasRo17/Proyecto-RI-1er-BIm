underlying function f x z computationally intensive smooth continuous needing find function value along line xyz currently calculating f discrete step wondering way get mathematica automatically chose step size work interpolating function based input like accurate need initial step size thinking would kind work like mesh function plotting evaluating function often area higher complexity anyone idea start
