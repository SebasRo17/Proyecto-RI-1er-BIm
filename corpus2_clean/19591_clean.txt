working problem integrate mathematica function siegeltheta second order directional derivative using function work well something go wrong try differentiate want take second order derivative respect vector siegeltheta omega dot twice vector want two component vector omega matrix omega x z frac sqrt z pi begin pmatrix x x x end pmatrix differentiating want let since know take derivative respect vector tried component wise using omega siegeltheta omega similarly derivative respect second component problem get resulting function take numerical value even evaluating single point upon integrating also get error message saying integrand take non numerical value whole region x x z specific regarding integration tried using nintegrate omega x z x x z question thus somehow specify taking derivative want omega time matrix vector two component case also something happening differentiation aware stop function taking numerical value something wrong approach integration far expert mathematica would appreciate help could get
