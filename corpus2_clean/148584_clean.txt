first large ish open gl making simulator sort got much basic functionality working recently ran problem since realized originally designed program simulator stored position texture draw etc became problem however began creating lot object quickly realized wrote class reload new instance texture instance fix considered making simple texture database sort would contain pointer single instance object texture instance would copy upon creation problem lot different class simulator create object hesitant simply store texture database top program hierarchy pas every creates feel get complex fast instead feel would better global container would keep track texture pointer sure could store pointer without instantiating instance container would require passing place hoping elegant simple solution overlooking otherwise try way described alternatively seems restructuring simulator would best question appreciate advice
