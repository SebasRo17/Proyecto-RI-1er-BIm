watching national geographic series surprised fast large project completed preliminary work design specification etc done paper realization huge project take year sometimes month example airbus formally launched dec num num early march num aircraft already tested go huge oil skyscraper etc comparing delay software industry help wondering project slow precisely cannot fast scale given enough people project airbus present major unforeseen risk first aircraft built still push limit technology thing worked well smaller may work larger one due physical constraint way new technology used used yet example available num boeing num done risk related human resource management general people quitting middle project inability reach person vacation ordinary human error etc risk people still achieve project like large short period time despite delivery delay project still hugely successful high quality come software development project hardly large complicated technically term management slightly less unforeseen risk real world still project slow late adding developer project solution going team ten developer two thousand sometimes allow deliver project faster sometimes sometimes harm project increase risk finishing still delivered may often contain lot bug requiring consecutive service pack regular update imagine installing update every airbus twice per week patch bug original product prevent aircraft crashing difference explained due exclusively fact software development industry young able manage thousand people single project order deliver large scale nearly product fast
