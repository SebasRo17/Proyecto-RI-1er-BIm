trying solve linear ode variable coefficient given term integral numerically equation form u u int sqrt e tau sin tau tau integrand could pretty much well behaved function general cause mathematica choke given integrate eventually say know lack analytic handle coefficient equation essentially disqualifies analytic solution equation however given perfectly able numerically compute coefficient mathematica ought able numerically solve equation initial guess would simply indicate integral done numerically ndsolve u nintegrate sqrt e tt sin tt tt u u u simply output error nintegrate nlim tt valid limit integration also tried plain integrate setting generateconditions false none work also take long time return error assume trying symbolically solve integral specifically want someone provide way make mathematica understand need buckle calculate
