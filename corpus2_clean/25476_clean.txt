really understand behaviour default argument execute command mathematica f f b f x p x p p b b swapped explain different behaviour compared following f f b f x p x f p b f f b f x p x p p b f f b f x p x p p b similarly f f b f x p x p p b f f b f x p x f p b f f b f x p x p p b f f b f x p x p p b mathematica help understand mathematica return default value argument inputted still cannot make statement sense besides obvious observable output reordering really understand logic behind relate sum multiplication useful situation thanks
