question concerned graph functionality newly implemented mathematica already used graphplot layeredgraphplot previous version principle appreciate new capability however still wonder current implementation complete e g code try use vertexcoordinates vertex according documentation graph work vertex property vertexcoordinates vertexsize property vertexcoordinates property vertexcoordinates graph vertex undirectededge undirectededge graphlayout layereddrawing layeredleft option within property e g vertexsize work correctly vertexcoordinates effect whatsoever vertexcoordinates work option graph property particular vertex concern relates graphlayout particular suboption packinglayout also seems influence whatsoever e g use layereddrawing suboptions layeredleft layeredtop create graph experience
