large module process 10k request response per second every request json need process verify database generate response basis db query example num get req1 next process req processdata req1 num processdata req1 var j json parse req1 body read db three time process json build response j var select collection set nosql num document check condition etc var possible send response req1 send b num major problem written inside process synchronous depends upon previous call back many condition check used several time good put large processing synchronous way inside node write using async time scenario got deadlock condition avoid behavior async like step affect performance series reduce latency
