looking sorting algorithm work large amount e work even whole set cannot held memory candidate found merge sort implement algorithm way scan set merge without holding memory variation merge sort mind described article section use tape drive think good solution complexity n x log n curious know possibly faster sorting algorithm work large set fit memory edit detail required answer need sorted periodically e g month need insert record sorted incrementally example text file num gb utf num text wanted solve problem general even file say num gb database due constraint cannot dumped others text file read text file format text file new character record separator one possible improvement mind split file file small enough sorted memory finally merge file using algorithm described
