mathematica find asymptotics function following sense log n log sqrt log n sqrt log n would like know asymptotic approximation n large simple function within constant multiplicative value limit n rightarrow infty instead log n log sqrt log n sqrt log n know log n log sqrt log n sqrt log n sqrt log n tends constant value question could use mathematica discover sqrt log n right answer second case find whatever right solution first case trial error happen know right answer first case somewhere log n log epsilon n
