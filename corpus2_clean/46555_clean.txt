feel slightly foolish asking close trouble anyway asked question two day ago regarding finding length contour like find area read played around information difficulty contour plot look something like area extracted individual contour f x via method given chris would like find area bounded contour plot region simple way reference using contour plot following function q r piecewise r r r phi r pi q r v r q r r co phi r x piecewise x x x x f x x v sqrt x arctan x q sqrt x contourplot f x x regionfunction function x x plotpoints contour range
