trying prove quintic polynomial p x x x x x x admits three real root unfortunately descartes rule sign help since sign change polynomial coefficient expression depend number parameter assigning numerical value parameter mathematica factor polynomial product either three monic linear polynomial quadratic polynomial negative discriminant one monic linear polynomial two quadratic polynomial negative discriminant confirms think since mathematica factor quintic coefficient numerical wonder implies also factor quintic expressed symbolically case ask mathematica
