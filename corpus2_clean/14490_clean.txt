get neighboring vertex first tried gg gridgraph vertexlist neighborhoodgraph gg absolutetiming really slow much faster still us new graph package union vertexincomponent gg vertexoutcomponent gg absolutetiming believe mimic neigborhoodgraph approach still much faster using neighborhoodgraph vertexlist subgraph gg union vertexincomponent gg vertexoutcomponent gg absolutetiming last two approach also faster neighborhoodvertices graphutilities package need graphutilities neighborhoodvertices gg absolutetiming working large graph need manipulate quickly several interactive information visualization tool tip neighborhoodgraph slow best use new graph package speed issue
