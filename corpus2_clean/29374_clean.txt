love using graph structure store visualize data mathematica consider following simple example creating graph object weighted directed edge already laid graph tree structure using option layeredembedding orientation top rootvertex found documentation graphlayout since representation useful particular need vertex edge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge directededge weight graph vertex edge edgeweight weight edgelabels mapthread rule edge weight graphlayout layeredembedding orientation top rootvertex edgelabelstyle directive blue graph get option look like following enter image description edge weight put label edge length due option specified would like obtain graph object edge scaled according edge weight keeping tree like layout graph read documentation graphlayout several documentation page edgeweight treegraph etc possibility found far use option springelectricalembedding edgeweighted true graph object however destroys tree like layout want keep graph vertex edge edgeweight weight edgelabels mapthread rule edge weight graphlayout springelectricalembedding edgeweighted true edgelabelstyle directive blue graph object look like enter image description question way combine tree like layout graph weight scaled edge mathematica think one would change vertexcoordinates embedded graph easy access current vertexcoordinates using graphembedding figure change appropriately
