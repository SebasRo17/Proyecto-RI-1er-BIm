came across somewhat surprising behavior simplify today something simple let take two cubic polynomial know value bysum sum k k n n n n bybernoulli bernoullib n bernoullib n n n done anything simplify two polynomial surprise look different however simplify help less might think bysum bybernoulli simplify n n n n n n mathematica still figure ask simplify form different bysum bybernoulli simplify true somewhat surprised fullsimplify work expect sort problem expect need worth mathematica window x
