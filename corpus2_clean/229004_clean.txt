heuristic mind allow score based novelty would like work real ish time case mean novelty sense source something like video want know statistically significant change stream example consider video scene camera turning right long velocity turn constant considered novel uninteresting bird fly past opposite direction part frame bird flying past would considered novel would assigned high score score assigned per 16x16 block pixel bird reached center frame might look like num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num understand algorithm part video compression block motion compensation global motion compensation result algorithm seems difference image would need digest average difference want simple hash given matrix first frame video history would maximally novel cool thing would assign score whole frame interesting frame break smaller block interesting block another set like quadtree summarise short cut get series frame single hash frame based recent frame better way aware refinement reusing example matrix 3 sample novel block bird frame bird whereas sample 1 still somewhat novel longer bird much block returned would expected background lead believe kind accumulating effect solution last frame need taken account
