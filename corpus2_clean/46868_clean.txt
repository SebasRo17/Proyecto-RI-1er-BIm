want know velocity point p given know coordinate p x l co theta l co theta theta calculate frac dp x dt achieve velocity point p x coordinate trial px l co l co like give variable value theta theta l l px l l however mathematica give result sin sin evaluate theta theta respectively use command fullform fullform derivative question mathematica cannot full evaluation fix enter image description
