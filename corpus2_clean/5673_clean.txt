wanted know computer calculate basic function like sqrt first checked human found use something called newton method basically iterative method find root number efficiently reproduced mathematica sqroot x assump precision n nest x assump precision timing give timing sqroot second using precision sqrt give timing n sqrt second meaning mathematica us entirely different operation calculate root number like ton elementary function like factorial ab solve sin co result similar fast result compared slower human result using slower loop iterative method find compendium back code support function make faster actual procedure p related mathematica based function theoreticalcs se
