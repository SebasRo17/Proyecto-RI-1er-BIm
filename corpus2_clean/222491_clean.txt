writing card board game since game lot card interact different way player become sort bloated different field used keeping track specific card need however every card used every game many field used instead several field probably used majority time thinking writing sort field map could dynamically create field needed one card required player store list could create one store player field map could get little messy though type key use string plain object always list would probably map would put cast key whose identity based also contain field could cast result kind like idea since mean mess player every time make new card also seems kind inefficient inelegant terrible idea
