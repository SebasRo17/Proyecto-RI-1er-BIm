edit ok people said unclear asking asking feedback design example user story group admin website want notified user group uploads file group easiest solution would handling upload directly create email message send however seems like really appropriate level separation concern instead thinking separate worker process nothing send notification website upload handle receiving file extracting metadata like filename writing database soon done handling file upload two thing writes detail notification sent subject filename etc dedicated notification table also creates message queue notification sending worker process monitor entire sequence shown diagram question see drawback design better design team want use azure worker role queue table storage right call use component design unnecessarily complex quality attribute requirement easy easy maintain easy runtime auditable history available notification sent etc monitor able quality attribute think designing original creating cloud application azure least num component first source component example ui website action happens condition met trigger second component worker perform job job detail metadata associated plan store azure table storage pattern considering enter image description step num condition job met num source writes job detail table num source put job queue asynchronously num worker accepts job queue num worker record table num queue mark job marked progress num worker performs job num worker update table detail including num worker report completion queue num job deleted queue please comment let know right better pattern example sake consider work sending notification email whose template field filled detail mentioned pattern
