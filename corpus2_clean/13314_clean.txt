made lot progress problem last day thanks help received think upto final step greatly improving performance nintegrate setup integral look like int x f x mathrm x exp ix exp omega x phi x refers complex conjugation exp ix slowly oscillatory compared everything else x x f negative typical value might closer get problematic thing get x x h similarly bigger omega get oscillatory thing function x x x h x x h x x h text arctanh left x h x right satisfies frac dt dx frac left frac x h x right phi r frac r r r phi r left frac omega r r frac r r right phi r r x x h transformed ode x possible using information construct differentialmatrices kernel levinrule turn possible possible tell mathematica use levinrule finite range integration one factor becomes non oscillatory lump amplitude
