trying solve system nonlinear differential equation condition bit weird two differential equate equation different boundary condition third differential equate something else background problem trying solve related concentration function time reaction code put less straightforward keep getting true tried using dsolve ndsolve unable get graph three concentration profile need analytical solution graphical one ndsolve kf b kb c b kf b kb c c kb c kf b b c b c kf kb constant already equated code keep resulting ndsolve true true true b c b c thinking multiplying two function together solved ode way appreciate input hint guide direction thanks something unclear lacking proper question asking etiquette please let know
