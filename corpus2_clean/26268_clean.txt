week market people work wanted put qr code shopping cart handle tested qr code work noted cylindrical curvature even small distorted image cell phone read diagram test qr code qrcode thought would nice thing mathematica try figure could print qr code way attached cylindrical form would like normal square least angle tried simulate would plotted handle using texture get qrcode import revolutionplot mesh none plotstyle texture qrcode texturecoordinatescaling false lighting neutral imagesize cylinder qr code code doc texture tried adapt without success revolutionplot plotstyle texture qrcode mesh none texturecoordinatefunction ax false lighting neutral imagesize aspectratio texture anyone know distort qr code way believe equivalent projecting texture onto surface using projected image update problem similar difference cylinder anamorphic illusion example plane
