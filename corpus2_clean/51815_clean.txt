used locator pane derive position vertex picture picture maryland power grid vertex generator load power system clicked vertex recorded returned vertex number x po po recording vertex list data list would like graphically plot network relative coordinate output would like graphically create minimum spanning network load either certain color shape generator another distinct color shape would like run calculation monte carlo simulation create adjacency matrix possibly even mess around markov random field need help figuring graphically represent color shape distinction load generator produce minimum spanning network output received input code im import module picturesize bigger imagesizes picturesize value imagesizes imagedimensions im bigger dynamicmodule pt imagesizes imagesizes bigger tableform button record appendto value pt locatorpane dynamic pt dynamic graphic join inset im plotrange imagesizes imagesizes bigger imagesizes imagesizes bigger imagesize picturesize dynamic n pt dynamic matrixform value enter image description output finally got work graphicslist table rectangle mpg mpg length mpg graphic graphicslist returned enter image description want way get minimum spanning tree get adjacency matrix idea
