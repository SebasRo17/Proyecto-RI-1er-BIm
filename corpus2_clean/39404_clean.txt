would like calculate uncertainty nth eigenstate dim harmonic oscillator obtain result solve integral int infty infty psi x psi dx psi n x frac e frac x h n x pi frac sqrt n n h n x hermite polynomial degree n physicist version implemented mathematica mathematica equal integral n e x x hermiteh n x sqrt n manually give n get mathematica solve integral without specifying n used assuptions n integer n anyway solve similar integral mathematica edit thanks answer mentioned looking way let mathematica solve problem analytical
