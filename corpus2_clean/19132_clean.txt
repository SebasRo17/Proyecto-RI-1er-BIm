solution homogeneous second order linear ode generally constant time one function plus another constant time different function sometimes one solution function singular e blow value independent variable example bessel ode one looking nonsingular solution way mathematica discard singular function required solution nonsingular would helpful case large number ode generated otherwise lot human intervention needed proceed case ode specific solution found dsolve singular solution obvious inspection want see mathematica used remove singular solution
