probably wind fairly simple question need background first modelling various hardware switch turned switch configurable allowing user specify numeric value sent hardware signal turn switch public switch public id get set public config get set public turnon id config public turnoff id config public public get set public get set far good need model new switch turned also temperature threshold set seems sensible inherit switch configuration also need extending include min max permitted temperature e g public public get set public get set specialised switch look something like public switch public temperature var config temperature temperature id temperature feel right cast config property sure must slicker oo solution think analysis paralysis set see wood tree worrying nothing casting acceptable solution scenario
