would like put tick mark curve trivial example managed put tick clearall fx fy fx fy parametricplot fx fy aspectratio automatic frame true ax false epilog table line fx fy sqrt fy fx fx fy sqrt fy fx mathematica graphic began write module wondered done properly looked could find idea module enable epilog statement look something like epilog curveticks fx fy tmin tmax tinc input curve suggestion specification follows process involve taking derivative get tangent turning degree could done taking derivative function begun using line make curve alternatively may method using mesh taking derivative tick mark seems expensive trivial example length tick mark default input tick line stick equally side curve aspect ratio plot automatic line rotated still perpendicular curve method labeling tick mark done already somewhere thanks
