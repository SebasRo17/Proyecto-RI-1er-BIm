recently disputed colleague following situation developed framework process resource although really important go simplified pseudo like algorithm processor processor execute foreach resource r domainobject r processor process interface processor process domainobject algorithm entry point framework resource representation content filesystem method reading file file important domainobject declaration omitted representation content file depicted resource domainobject filename inside processor represents business logic layer domainobject processed stored database forth content supplied others know file contain converted domainobject real work framework store one domainobject one file argue file colleague mine want file propagated processor potentially layer easy logging message throw exception contains file something go wrong processing maybe write message like domain stored file come filename processed successfully see point colleague convenience sure break design encapsulation processor module really aware origin domainobject today store file one domainobject per file tomorrow maybe use something else something necessarily filename claim better catch exception algorithm execute rethrow exception filename log filename log file less readable encapsulation broken understanding design v clearness could please share opinion right wrong sacrifice design clearness log btw promised colleague ask question read possible answer together thanks lot advance nice day
