wondering way restrict motion rotate mouse cursor moving around plot example want direction cursor correspond pulling z axis toward away camera x direction rotate graphic around z axis something similar using manipulate graphic sphere sphere arrow text x arrow text arrow text z viewvector co sin b sin sin b co b viewangle degree sphericalregion true boxed false pi pi b pi pi sliding rotates graphic around z axis rather viewpoint sliding b pull z axis edit make description clearer dimensional viewvector seems changed somehow dimensional double arrow rotation cursor clicking dragging plot even sure possible possible restrict euler angle e g rotation z axis inclination x plane changed third euler angle natively controlled additional rotation cursor available put cursor corner
