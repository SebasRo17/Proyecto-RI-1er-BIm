trying tweak ndsolve function perform one elementary integration step using explicitly selected stepping algorithm via method option possibility crucial since performed step like check condition modify state vector continue integration best knowledge operation possible pure ndsolve therefore looking alternative solution far managed come following solution please note order method selected mimic case lot internal step equivalent higher order longer integration period tmax eq x x x x x tmax method explicitrungekutta differenceorder block state option timer option maxsteps infinity method method state first ndsolve processequations sequence eq option timer first timing ndsolve iterate state tmax timer state currenttime forward state timestepsused forward state solutionvector forward block state option ctime ic dt count timer option maxsteps method method state first ndsolve processequations sequence eq option count ctime state currenttime forward timer first timing ctime tmax quiet ndsolve iterate state tmax ndsolve mxst ctime state currenttime forward ic state solutionvector forward dt state timestep forward state first ndsolve reinitialize state x ctime ic x ctime ic startingstepsize dt count timer state currenttime forward count state solutionvector forward timing result optimistic situation worse one want use step size previous step startingstepsize dt commented reinitialize better efficient way
