writing large number reasonably simple object would like created compile time would think would able able figure c could following include stdio h typedef struct b c info info list num num num num b num sizeof list sizeof list printf n list c using c constructor called rather layed memory include iostream using std cout using std endl info const const b const c public info const const const const get const get b b const get c const c info info const const b const c b b c c info list info num num info num num b num sizeof list sizeof list cout list get c endl see information available completely instantiate object compile time assume missing something
