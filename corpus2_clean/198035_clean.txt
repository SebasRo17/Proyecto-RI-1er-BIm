problem algorithmic competition year back simple description see algorithm solve efficiently looking implementation general idea solve problem description would like build domino chain tile given domino two tile joined iff number appears adjacent side always possible therefore minimum number tile necessary add build chain n pair integer range num num n num algorithm nlogn worst many tile least added example num num num num num num num explanation num num num num num num impossible build chain without adding tile adding one tile num num stand creates correct chain containing tile therefore answer num
