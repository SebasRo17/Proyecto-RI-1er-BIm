suppose two thread communicate asynchronously sending message thread kind message queue question low level expected efficient way manage memory think several solution num sender creates via new receiver call delete num memory pooling transfer memory back sender num garbage collection e g boehm gc num object small enough copy avoid heap allocation completely num obvious solution use prototype chance already good enough independent specific problem wonder technique promising optimizing performance would expect pooling theoretically best especially use extra knowledge flow information thread however fear also difficult get right lot tuning garbage collection quite easy add afterwards solution num would expect perform well guess practical solution num turn inefficient object small simple copy might fastest however fear force unnecessary limitation implementation supported message want avoid
