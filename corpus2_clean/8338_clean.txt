suppose time n matrix real simplicity singularvaluedecomposition yield matrix u sigma v u sigma v top u sigma v top u sigma v top cdots u u u ldots vector column matrix successive approximation given rank matrix u sigma v top etc wanted make function compute found sort messy manipulation due mathematica matrix structure lack knowledge use tentative function input matrix optional argument n saying many rank matrix summed function meant numerically fast anything perhaps would use educational tool examine different approximation etc point sum function would like know efficient perhaps cleaner way matrix multiplication rankoneapprox n block u sig v u sig v singularvaluedecomposition sum sig u transpose v n
