function sum two cosine term frequency x co w b co w b simplified single co hand calculate equal co w b sqrt co b co b sin b sin b b arctan co b co b sin b sin b check pick number see plot lie right top would like mathematica give simplified one term form rather sum figure make happen generally would like many term expression including sin well co able simplify tried obvious thing like trigtoexp x trigexpand x fullsimplify x mathematica seem want combine single co term even supply numerical value constant b b still simplification help appreciated
