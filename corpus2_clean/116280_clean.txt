team developing enterprise level application devised architecture best described expression tree basic idea leaf node tree simple expression perhaps simple value string node closer trunk get complex taking simpler node input returning complex result parent looking way application performs task creates root expression root expression divide smaller unit creates child expression evaluated use build result subdividing process continues simplest leaf node two important aspect architecture must possible manipulate node tree built node may given new value work change result node need propagated back tree root node application must make best use available processor ultimately scalable computer grid cloud node tree often updating concurrently notifying interested node tree get new unfortunately liberty discus actual application aid understanding little bit might imagine kind spreadsheet application implemented similar architecture change cell table propagated place cell need result spreadsheet could get massive applying multi core multi computer distributed system solve would benefit got prototype expression engine working nicely single multi core pc started concurrency issue expected taking much care far time start thinking migrating engine robust library lead number related question num precedent expression tree architecture could research num programming concept consider realise approach many similarity functional programming style already aware concept using future actor others num language library study question inspired accidental discovery scala akka library good support actor future distributed workload etc wondering anything else looking well
