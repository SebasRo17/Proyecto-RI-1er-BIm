example seen graph vertex mathematica usually explicit small integer however wolfram documentation say vertex arbitrary expression eg george x london nevertheless seems vertex always referred number position vertex expression vertexlist gr confusing example build graph like using nonconsecutive vertex number graph still refer vertex made vertex number equal creation order built graph strictly consecutive vertex number graph understanding correctly
