understand concept deadlock well enough given problem like one sure go solving draw resource allocation graph sure solve better formal way solving consider system five process p1 p5 five resource r1 r5 resource ownership follows p1 hold r1 want r3 p2 hold r2 want r1 p3 hold r3 want r5 p4 hold r5 want r2 p5 hold r4 want r2 system deadlocked justify answer system deadlocked list involved process
