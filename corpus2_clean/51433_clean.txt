want set work year old calculus student access mathematica aim create worksheet rational expression decompose partial fraction structure want use rely partial fraction appearing one question e overlap want speed process adding rational fraction x x hoping could resolve mathematica x x x without bracket numerator denominator ala work every case albeit fairly trivial instead using together yield x x x expandall split though horribly multiplies bracket denominator x x surely add two rational expression fully expanded rational expression decreasing power x
