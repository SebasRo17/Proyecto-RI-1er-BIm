ok nice plot oscillating motion read stuff graph thought would cool show dot curve hit x axis little label showing coordinate thus get direct measure period oscillation know equation quite point exercise anyhow code using clear x x v v clear x x v v ti tf delta x ti x ti v ti v ti k kc f k x kc x x f k x kc x x v delta v f delta v delta v f delta x delta x v delta delta x delta x v delta delta ti tf delta x data table x ti tf delta x plot listplot x data axeslabel x joined true get nice graph tried using nsolve get output think nsolve must geared understand rank beginner mathematica ok assume stupid know likely efficient way curve lab exercise tho testing simulation real data thanks
