let say graph code generate graph end sample graph extract leaf comming let say cluster e sample graph guess first extract subgraph cluster root vertex sample graph filter result last part easy finding hard get extracting subgraph tried using subgraph function like subgraph mygraph undirectededge cluster get want sample graph probably trivial seeing kind help would super useful thanx used create graph need hierarchicalclustering makeclusteredtree data leaf opts optionspattern module cluster expr ett edge optsgraph filterrules opts option graph optsagglomerate filterrules opts option agglomerate cluster agglomerate data leaf optsagglomerate expr replace cluster cluster b symbol cluster tostring b infinity ett sparsearray expressiontotree expr edge undirectededge ett graph undirectededge edge graphlayout layeredembedding rootvertex undirectededge edge vertexlabels name optsgraph imagepadding full data makeclusteredtree data tostring data linkage average final note makeclusteredtree function completely based post highest high five kguler changed little bit original purpose another little bit post using complicated data huge tree originally visibly label leaf changed vertexlabels example show name node
