encountered difficulty getting bsplinesurface export stl following code work generates triangulated polygon mesh nurbs spline adapted bsplinesurface example cpts table j randomreal j b graphic bsplinesurface cpts export surface stl b stl however decreasing number control point dimension cpts table j randomreal j b graphic bsplinesurface cpts export surface stl b stl result geometricfunctions bsplinesurface deglen message text found export nodta graphic contains data exported stl format failed mathematica version success exporting bsplinesurface stl dependent number control point reliable way get arbitrary spline surface export stl convert graphic containing bspline polygon primitive export d seems somewhat related though identical aware mathematica cannot actually export nurbs surface triangulation suffice happens already surface control point
