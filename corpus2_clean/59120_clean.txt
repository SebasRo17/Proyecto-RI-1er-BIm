seems common task surprised found much suppose expression f spherical coordinate r theta phi want compute partial derivative f respect cartesian coordinate x z result expressed r theta phi solved defining following function mathematica myd f n integer n n jac transpose coordinatetransformdata spherical cartesian inversemappingjacobian r theta phi jac n f r theta phi compute frac partial f partial z writing myd f take example f r get frac partial f partial z myd f frac partial r partial z frac z r frac r co theta r co theta wondering really way go mundane task suspect nicer functionality built mathematica aware anyone idea
