developed standard elo implementation found problem running player num num game season since first season already completed starting rating system game know rank player elo rating least close problem implementing base algorithm outlier way since num num game first thought remedy situation implement around process taking end result elo rating one cycle use starting point next cycle individual player repeat cycle average max deviation elo rating previous current cycle greater x helped resolve big outlier still smaller outlier still comfortable example num division division num guy ranked num based elo end ranked 5th division num guy ranked num 3rd top num division actually pretty close except kind outlier modify algorithm approach take try reduce outlier side note num division num guy num end num actually ranked num entire season rating system know one calculated may calculated could based know x player good ranked num side note num made modification algorithm want weight win loss dominant player beat player b num num want weighted heavily especially rating close rating apart already greater b elo change much anyway since expected win first place instead using k factor num like original formula us changed num score difference num max k factor would num num num biggest win multiply num add num strategy could implement include weight result well correct outlier without front everything home try sum scenario division num elo rating num num elo rating num num elo rating num num elo rating num num elo rating num num guy beat num win tournament body work seems complete num guy aka played beat stronger opponent num guy maybe weighted k factor throwing num lot win num num point num win higher margin say num num point maybe need play around weighted k factor see get calculated result closer actual result
