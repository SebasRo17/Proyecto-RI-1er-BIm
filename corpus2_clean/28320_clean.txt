quick question simple somewhat hard explain using specific eigenvalue large x k dependant matrix found eigenvalue interest various k sorted distinct list need interested eigenvectors question way solve get eigenvector one specific eigenvalue guess could use eigensystem let mathematica find pick evec corresponding eval already found seems somewhat stupid though need others hand solve look also like overcomplicating problem well using inbuilt algorithm find eigenvectors anymore besides first try successful giving error message saying something badly conditioned matrix giving large numerical error help would much appreciated thanks edit using eigensystem showed result eigenvalue eigenvalue different th digit result eigensystem get around
