trying develop ai card game bit stuck technique algorithm use assumption game card distributed player randomness mean every player choose card play random process occurs distributing card beginning game restriction card played card already played player win trick play first e g player num play card player num play card win player num play card player num play know lot hint rule e g know player card b c play help win game thus first wanted use bayesian network describes rule problem know probability assign could compute heuristic using history played game human second problem likely know rule implicit rule needed ai find optimal play unsure would good way develop ai card game also wondering others technique would best fit problem instance look minimax maybe pruning algorithm would good option problem quite unsure since important play beginning game highest unknown parameter card played yet
