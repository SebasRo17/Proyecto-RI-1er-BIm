writing piece software communicate bunch device via i2c bus device going need sort module handle communication conversion sensible way operation device module perform drastically different concern i2c bus control fear sharing bus example device module instantiate new i2c bus control result hard follow sure object would communicate interrupt bus however sharing fear end huge control hard maintain extend lean towards control device module would hold map operation like list tuples function expected result value range i2c control could iterate dictionary write read result bus move next result expected range sound like state machine design sure really generalize operation enough suppose question boil anyone good suggestion design pattern
