hello mathematica expert would like play around simple variable transformation test claim wonder mathematica like way specific case transformation x mapsto x equiv begin case x qquad x ge x pi x end case x pi pi get moved x pi far found two equivalent way representing xprimed x x x x anotherxprimed x x heavisidetheta x heavisidetheta x x seem reasonable plot xprimed phi phi axeslabel original variable x transformed variable x plotrange plot transformation work expected make plot thing like plot co xprimed x x axeslabel original variable x co x plot transformed variable transformed domain e co x x x axis suspect smart way mathematica specifying domain variable map coordinate transformation like seem find anything
