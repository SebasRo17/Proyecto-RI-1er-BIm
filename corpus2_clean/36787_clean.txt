integration result integrate r sqrt x r gamma r sqrt r gamma x hypergeometric f gamma gamma gamma gamma r gamma x r sqrt r gamma x gamma first case put x gamma result get sqrt r r sqrt r sqrt r r r sqrt r second case hand answer integrate r sqrt r r sqrt r r different previous answer second part question maple give hypergeometric f gamma gamma r gamma x r result integration answer mathematica maple different draw integration result versus r obvious different miss thing edit first case result r second case result r edit result mathematica maple enter image description edit solution help va ek poto ek seems difference mathematica maple output also case case constant value also one us following relation convert maple output mathematica one enter image description case second term constant value
