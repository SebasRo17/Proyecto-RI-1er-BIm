think special problem sure search answer thought would try working called fitzhugh nagumo model describes simple neuron following equation u v v u v u excitation threshold greater system called excited state one fix point trajectory lead ndsolve function problem computing every initial condition want e g following ndsolve u u u v v u u v u v maxsteps system excited little nothing special happens relaxes back fixpoint excitation large system make loop relaxes would exactly neural pulse problem tell mathematica excite system reach fix point already found evenlocator function give value u v close fixed point method eventlocator event u eventaction value event control close system fix point want dynamic variable u v jump new point threshold start move dynamic question use eventlocator want eventaction right instrument possibility simulate excitation something continuous would nice totally wrong direction maybe important state use mathematica moment update thanks help solution interesting also want solve problem dimension special case another problem travelling pulse excitates element element need another trick simulate something like studying solution idea diffusion course need something like virtual excitation neighbor restart pulse maybe possible simulate two neighbor something like small model dimensional approach maybe help term simulating virtual diffusion know mean point interesting would save resource well compared full model otherwise probably would make sense model think
