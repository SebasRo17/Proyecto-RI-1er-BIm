like way mathematica hide multiplication symbol two variable appear adjacent multiplication space always sufficient clearly see fact two variable therefore would like either increase space adjacent variable make multiplication operator explicit output note inputform suffice still want part expression formatted usual thing seen erroneously remove parenthesis thus changing meaning expression would like avoid far got far edited time make easier see difference necessarily want apply everywhere setattributes visibletimes orderless makeboxes visibletimes standardform makeboxes standardform makeboxes visibletimes numericq b standardform makeboxes time visibletimes b standardform makeboxes visibletimes standardform makeboxes interpretation infix hold time standardform try hide operator one argument numeric test b c exp block time visibletimes b c exp give particularly satisfactory output think agree first expression easy notice multiplication b would also nice resulting output cell could copied pasted evaluated back input similar original also suspect precedenceform may able help figured get work context yet
