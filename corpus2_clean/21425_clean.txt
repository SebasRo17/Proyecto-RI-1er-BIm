ok working problem week driving crazy trying solve system two differential equation x using time elimination method tfrac x tfrac tfrac dx dy reduces system single differential equation x tricky part initial condition need defined steady state system x s s x slope point undefined since dx dy s construction seen two common way dealing first involves finding kind approximation solution slightly perturbing correct initial condition x always well defined example suppose system defined yss xdot x ydot x log yss find solution using xdoty xdot ydot x x ndsolve x xdoty x yss xss x yss yield following result x purple blue diffeqns example png notice solution blow come within s second accurate approach overcome ill defined slope steady state via application l h pital rule mathematica usually deal passing piecewise function ndsolve e g ndsolve x piecewise xdoty yss xdotyss yss x yss xss x yss xdotyss x s single scalar value calculated application l h pital rule yield following result system diffeqns example x well behaved throughout problem approach always seem work well particularly differential system get first perturbation method give approximately correct looking result second l h pital method always give following error ndsolve ndsz yss step size effectively zero singularity stiff system suspected given first approach cause error second approach using differential equation derive value slope single point always viable approach think would causing system suddenly become stiff idea
