reached design architectural issue large application working point writing solution product consist client server information system whose implementation built rest paradigm particular use case defines use multiple resource available server side order process actual information sent client side think massive processing queried resource present certain order almost like huge sorting algorithm due fact resource used algorithm available server side fulfill purpose client fact massive processing power needed perform practical reproduce client side also prevent possible reverse engineering fulfill requirement need implement local storage client side application mean would need present sorted information even network available order present considering possibility duplicating database table resource table used store already sorted result point advantage disadvantage approach best practice going needed consideration also open design pattern used solve problem aware
