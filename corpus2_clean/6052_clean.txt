want calculate following recursive sequence alpha co alpha co alpha cdot co beta sin alpha cdot sin beta cdot co gamma mathematica try endrecursion beta import beta txt list beta beta endrecursion gamma randomreal pi endrecursion alpha alpha arccos co alpha co beta sin alpha sin beta co gamma result table alpha endrecursion value beta imported generated another formula important question value beta found problem calculation result slowly take iteration need iteration time several list beta value recognized calculation much faster skip co alpha first sin alpha nd summand take iteration unfortunately falsifies result cannot understand much faster one time alpha right side equation something wrong way increase speed calculation would glad help
