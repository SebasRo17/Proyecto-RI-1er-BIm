make question easy follow let give symbol couple attribute attribute f flat attribute orderless consider following f b g c f e h j k give f b g c e h j k expected since f flat wrap unevaluated around f f b g c unevaluated f e h j k give f b g c unevaluated e unevaluated h j k understand happened use trace f b g c unevaluated f e h j k trace f b g c f e h j k f b g c e h j k f b g c unevaluated e unevaluated h j k finally let also wrap unevaluated around f b g c unevaluated f e h unevaluated n j k f b g c unevaluated e unevaluated h unevaluated n j k come question confusion case f unevaluated head removed element f flat attribute spliced unevaluated head replaced element f according standard evaluation process part expression form unevaluated expr replace part expr keep record original expression later replace unevaluated head shown expression expr head flat attribute expression get spliced e actually get evaluated saw orderless attribute expression remains unevaluated described evaluation process flat attribute supersede unevaluated case according standard evaluation process missing
