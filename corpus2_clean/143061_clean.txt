problem x positive integer resource r n potential target want distribute r n target interesting way interesting mean target may get r rarely near even majority target getting near x n resource least small chance one target getting r bad solution naive approach would pick random target give one r repeat x time would result even approach next idea pick random number num x give random target result large number least x num average given one target question algorithm used frequently want distribution interesting uneven surprise wear user good algorithm something two approach fit definition interesting
