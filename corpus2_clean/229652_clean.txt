recently spent lot time trying dive understand javascript promise especially adhering promise spec trying understand whether promise actually give developer additional tool specifically compared cps based async whether mostly syntactic sugar tool reduce verbosity streamline behavior one argument heard promise handling case using async library easy execute async waterfall function waiting prior complete wrapped try catch handle synchronous error since neither promise async handle async error passing caught error handler situation promise async behave identically regarding semantics gist showing behavior another argument heard promise future proofing method sync asynchronous later theory return promise matter modified later since sender receiver modified adhere promise contract argument stated modifying sender receiver use cps contract even synchronous future proof mind use case think solved optimally promise usage really case preference desire reduce verbosity reduce chance
