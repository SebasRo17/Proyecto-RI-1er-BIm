system expression matrix correspond increasing order precision theory expression quite complex require line code produce equal size dimension increase monotonically order theory reason resigned creating single cell produce order suppose already function f x x x x f x x x x x would like produce new function g something x g x f x g x f x accomplished way form conditional argument function something like g j x j f x f x work course first argument actually assigned j guess surprised work define g x g x individually work
