trying simulate simple circuit mathematica equation circuit r dfrac dq dt dfrac q c f sig definition f sign function seems work since plot good newfsign oddq floor subscript v max co subscript v max plot f sign definition solution ndsolve r q q c newfsign q q try plot command plot q c plotrange getting result would expected given forcing function f sign plot ndsolve value using subscript v max r c missing something
