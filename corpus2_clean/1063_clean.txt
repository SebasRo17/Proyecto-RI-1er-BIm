problem using mathematica solve operator sometimes lead output involving positive negative root say solving variable n happening simply defined function radial followed implementation solve function radial n l r laguerrel n l l z r n z r n l exp z r n solve integrate n radial r r r infinity assumption z z real n n z sqrt n z sqrt mathematica kind enough give positive negative root want would like suppress negative root leaving positive root solution e n z tried include couple thing tried suggested kind people chat inserting n assumption resulted two root inserting n n real section resulted two root inserting n following combined possible permutation try resulted answer given error hopefully simple way fixing convoluted input syntax however benefit community suggestion welcomed particular case simpler better
