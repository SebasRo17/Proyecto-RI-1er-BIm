expecting real angle using vectorangle passing real valued vector however obtained complex angle vectorangle return expecting pi essentially half circle guess precision number result imaginary portion possible solution using round result work case future case might imaginary part larger using result better solution interestingly using round vector sufficiently small value result exact solution example rounded nearest got exact value pi going forward probably take real part result expected behavior mathematica function
