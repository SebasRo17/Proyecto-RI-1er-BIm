couple abstract indexed quantity differential element dx dx mu e mu x mu de mu du du mu e mu u mu de mu compute expression dx du cdot dx du dx cdot dx manually paper contracting product appropriately taking difference however evaluating end result specific parameterizations basis representation becomes messy done euclidian cartesian cylindrical coordinate case seems perfect opportunity symbolic computation engine trouble starting mathematica book hint tensor expression represented list expression form require specific dimensionality still symbolically manipulated paper use list list specific dimension example guessing could use explicit representation upper index coordinate like x x x x u u u u define metric tensor lower index coordinate know represent basis vector e mu mathematica though even restricted euclidean space sort computation within scope mathematica one setup variable
