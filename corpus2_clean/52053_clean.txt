say g x p x frac e frac mu log x sigma sqrt pi x sigma log normal density function wiki find e since e int infty f dy int infty g x f x x dx need find f px simplify pdf lognormaldistribution mu sigma x x integrate log x px x infinity assumption sigma unfortunately mathematica cannot evaluate integral closed form expression quite sure else solve appreaciate help get evaluation step edit also tried code result expectation log x x distributed lognormaldistribution mu sigma
