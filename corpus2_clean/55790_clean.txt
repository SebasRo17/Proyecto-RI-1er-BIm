trying numerically find equilibrium maximum function using differential following simplified version myequilibrium p last mypreviousstep ndsolve p mypreviousstep whenevent mypreviousstep stopintegration infinity stepmonitor mypreviousstep mypreviousstep myequilibrium correct function constrained positive included requirement however seem work myequilibrium ndsolve also go exactly real non simplified version contains differential another reason want procedure stop myequilibrium finally often get ndsolve mxst maximum number step reached point ndsolve ndsz step size effectively zero singularity stiff system suspected would typically solve issue thanks
