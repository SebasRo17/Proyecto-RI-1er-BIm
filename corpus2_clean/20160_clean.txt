working project number independent variable fixed consider problem n independent variable boldsymbol r want perform different thing amongst want consider multidimensional integration etc variable definition first question regarding topic definition variable perform algebraic manipulation first though use variable n table x n however situation e g block cannot use variable use x x e g block x x give error current naive solution use variable n table toexpression x tostring n standard solution sum integral question also hold problem computing integral arbitrary dimension tell mathematica compute integrate f r r rn r r g r rn h r r rn time interested numerically compute integral nevertheless tell mathematica tried simple naive integrate table variable give error
