design pattern dealing overlapping ui action animation example num let say interactive table row expands reveal extra control user click vice versa click user click row expand animation progress want stop animating shrink back original size place stopped num set row example num inside group last row deleted want group shrink remove callback however group shrinking user could still add another row happens want group stop shrinking expand correct size add row num sorting ui example num user click sort button row shuffle animate new position however still want user able click table row delete row everything else ui allows ui behave sensibly shuffle animation taking precedence could automatically fast forward animation ui element new action performed block user animating ui element seems inelegant user really admire uis stutter block want uis word behave like real object like application seems need constraint action animation order make robust system example might need ensure change state model happen callback animation example num delete group model soon user click button delete last row done end animation end animation otherwise user decides add another row delete animation reverting group delete would difficult might also need design animation system way two animation two different action overlap mutually exclusive property would continue animating word user sort table row expanding click width expansion stop row moving new position starting default animation row deleted another action implicitly cancel delete fade stop animate back even though action might necessarily know also higher level issue animation visual property change v action sequence event potential model change include animation example num delete last row clearly action since end result group get removed however ui library add callback animation two also issue game need trigger grenade throw character throw animation finish represent place grenade throw timeline without mixing model view still allowing animation slow speed based external factor think head hurt convinced somebody already thought lot carefully idea moment mostly interested web ui also interested general approach future non web project
