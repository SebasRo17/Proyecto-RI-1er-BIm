know mathematica really powerful come functional operation like applying list task list variable sometimes feel like powerful tool come looking number large range like use regardless always use loop sure effective way looking elegant effective way let give example question find smallest positive integer whose sum digit squared greater rather sloppy solution myint mysum sumlimit mysum sumlimit mydigits integerdigits myint mysum total mydigits myint myint myint answer clearly see method quite slow said instead would take quite long time find obviously better way solve problem brute force basically like elegant implementation brute force method
