sorry question basic know even search look obvious place thought nothing background whatever context might provide working certain ring function r langle p rangle p ax z ax z mathbb c x z e normally think coefficient x actually keeping variable hoping generalize calculation explain theorem hilbert know r finitely generated importantly free mathbb c p p p cohen macaulay want know ultimately compute hilbert series coefficient positive tell pick generator sorry information relevant ok well particular say think generator p p meaning polynomial like p unique expression form f p p p f p p p p f p p p p p f polynomial care show uniqueness given p systematic way mathematica solve polynomial f bound degree give pretty tight bound degree f help would much appreciated
