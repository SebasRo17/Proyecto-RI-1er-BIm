would like implement algorithm created using free cdf document interface idea user give input value maybe sort text box possible slider would also apply user finished inform input value start algorithm pressing sort button possible action make algorithm start computing algorithm finished would second later user see cdf document numerical result plot could interactive matter process supposed transparent black boxed user specifically want user see code algorithm important point input box result looking internet able find getting started cdf tutorial something similar question possible build app free cdf format provided algorithm already programmed mathematica series step basic place start learning create cdf document step step edited aug far understand reliable way create working free cdf document embedding code within manipulate interactive command wonder sort embed quite simple algorithm several step starting input info finishing numerical graphical output within manipulate sentence edited aug playing around found thing like allowed manipulate f x sin x plot f x x f mean work connect several expression also show graphical numerical result going continue trying thing manage get result want post answer question course suggestion help comment still welcomed
