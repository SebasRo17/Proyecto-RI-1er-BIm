need series expansion fairly nasty function derivative f x b x sqrt hypergeometric f sqrt sqrt sqrt x f left x right x left b left frac x right frac left sqrt right f left frac sqrt frac sqrt frac sqrt frac x right right frac x b positive real number know x gg interested series expansion f f inverse power x series f x infinity normal dfrac b left dfrac x right dfrac sqrt left dfrac x right dfrac x series f x x infinity normal b left dfrac x right left dfrac x right dfrac sqrt problem figure get simplify need get form c x c dfrac c x p constant c p series expand term x denominator guess power irrational get answer desired form could pen paper course would love code using assumption x b seem make difference help appreciated
