dsolve try solve differential equation sometimes smart enough generate condition according different possible value parameter consider following minimal example x x dsolve x x x result x sqrt tanh sqrt sqrt c would wrong leq one may argue result correct sense complex tanh function bother think definitely normally want problem hand integrate use assumption explicitly state range parameter dsolve provide option way achieve similar effect tried use boole etc failed
