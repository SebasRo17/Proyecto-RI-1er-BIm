learning ruby recently following experience written small tool num line inexperienced ruby programmer used several loop build array array e g g l g size num r new l cond g r push g end num end r contains result discovered functional style g r g select g cond g r contains result immediately replaced loop construct like select take drop decided use functional style ruby whenever possible try avoid imperative style another example c tend use class method everywhere use function small utility task private implementation tend think oriented working c avoid procedural style almost completely general working given project given language tend pick one paradigm stick throughout project find make uniform easier read imo important especially production yet often think maybe explore try different possibility offered language e g use different paradigm try different solution involves overhead coding make procedural oriented imperative functional reviewing debugging want increased complexity question also tend select preferred programming paradigm coding stick tend explore mix different paradigm mix different paradigm feeling overhead term fast write added complexity switching different mindset matter learning even productive mix different paradigm structured way e g apply paradigm specific problem e g functional query oriented architectural aspect
