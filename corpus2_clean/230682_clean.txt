currently developing math physic program need calculate two vector overlap one another one vertical fast algorithm came far lot repeat eg let say vector v1 num num num num v2 num num num num first parenthesis coordinate starting second coordinate vector reach want result take overlap num num far idea came expand vector list point compare list e g v1 list would num num num num num num
