want compare two matrix use mean squared error following code mse mat mat mat mat flatten mean code correct method compare two matrix update thank answer actually want determine unknown parmeter comparing model data matrix contains empirical data whereas matrix calculated model unknown parmeter idea calculate set theoretical matrix different value parameter theta compute mean squared difference empirical theoretical matrix theta best theta one mean squared difference minimum make sense better way
