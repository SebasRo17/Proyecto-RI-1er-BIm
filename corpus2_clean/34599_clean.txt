first want solve equation f x supplying value x suppose obtaining analytic form x difficult want plot root numerically calculated function x using following plot findroot x x x got something like following enter image description omit since terribly complicated update f x form sum n n x ny n high basically make solve impractical result satisfying except small number point near setting another initial starting value findroot might option tedious often cannot find value fit whole range x question suppose stick initial value way eliminate anomaly point plot numerical result better way deal kind numerical problem general
