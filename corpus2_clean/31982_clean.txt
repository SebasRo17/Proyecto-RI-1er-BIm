second order reaction diffusion type ode form frac r frac dr left r frac dc dr right frac ac c k k constant c function r know following c r omega c r n c r n r r n position omega known constant model behaviour using ndsolve take two condition type ode example give potential curve boundary r n r eqn r r r r r r k ndsolve eqn rn ro omega r rn ro give one curve readily plot however instead tell ndsolve use different condition like ndsolve eqn rn ro omega r rn ro get different curve however suspect getting curve regardless problem narrowing unique solution array possible solution way make mathematica take three bcs also open possibility fundamental mathematical error perhaps bad assumption part please mean point missed thanks advance grateful advice
