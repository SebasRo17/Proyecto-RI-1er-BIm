new mathematica might asking trivial question although able resolve several day trying optimize x matrix variable certain evaluation function evaluation function defined sumcenter v v v v v v v v v v v v sum n func v v v v v v v v v v v v func time dependent outcome matrix little long tried write function used matrixexp tr guarantee give near accurate number although generates small amount imaginary number supposed function n might necessary used nminimize find optimal value variable nminimize sumcenter z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z stepmonitor print step z z calculation begin even though put stepmonitor show first step made rather simple version x matrix variable worked perfectly would like figure might causing problem
