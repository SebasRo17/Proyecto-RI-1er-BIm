first question site hope written understandable way let start aim plot certain parametric region x coordinate given following formula first write function define particular potential u two variable calculate derivative thing like since need later construction plot formula last three one appearing following line code epsilontemp u u u etatemp u u u inttemp u u u epsilonhelp u epsilontemp u etahelp u etatemp u inthelp u inttemp u write potential infinite series mathematica recognizes sum two polylog function u sum co n n n infinity following equation call always b must find value frac b epsilontemp u b equation written simply way code right found piece code job perfectly particular starting point chosen plot equation order find approximately root phiendtemp b numericq findroot inthelp u x sqrt b x maxiterations infinity compiled false order work easily quantity defined interpolatingfunction following way phiend b functioninterpolation phiendtemp btemp btemp b next step consist solving numerically differential equation two parameter one enters simply equation enters initial condition new command mathematica parametricndsolve used phicmbtemp parametricndsolve efolds b inthelp u efolds j efolds b j compiled false phicmbtemp b j efolds b j efolds phicmbtemp last step use function defined previously initial condition differential equation following way phicmb b efolds phicmbtemp b phiend b efolds code work perfectly also tried plot phicmb b efolds b efolds value want give result expect non numerical analysis equation turn parametricplot function x coordinate following parameter region b efolds nsplot u b efolds b etahelp u phicmb b efolds b epsilonhelp u phicmb b efolds rplot u b efolds b epsilonhelp u phicmb b efolds wrote last explain problem problem try calculate thing like actual plot use c quantity b n quantity efolds nsplot u mathematica return apart imaginary part problem compatible expect non numerical analysis problem however try something like table nsplot u n n give number like completely possible result quantity note list appears quantity evaluated efolds totally different chose post issue using table instead parametricplot since problem appear already using table anyway code tried use also plot nsplot u n n give like table strange number parametricplot nsplot u c n rplot u c n c n give strange plot see something wrong code tried simpler potential namely co frac b solved pen paper tried parametric plot firstly using analytical solution using code result exactly identical maybe problem small imaginary part imaginary part co potential turn exp maybe mess calculation simply calculate something like nsplot u give correct result really know problem anyway hope give hint thanks giovanni p used compile false ndsolve recalled sometimes best use dealing numerical calculation hope problem
