love mathematica would love able use data analysis task one type analysis find almost trivial r idea approach mathematica say csv file containing hundred thousand people ranked preference item format like gender x x x male female case female liked item x item x row sample data found want plot histogram rank gender assigned item r use reshape ggplot something like library reshape library ggplot merged data read csv merged data csv melted melt merged data id ggplot melted geom histogram aes x value density fill factor gender binwidth position identity alpha facet wrap variable theme legend position bottom scale fill discrete name gender get nice graph like histogram key thing individual plot end axis bound even though bound data plot make comparison really easy would go something like mathematica get rid r workflow edit clarify example gender simplify problem something easier explain looking solution automatic possible involve enumerating source possible value gender field involve hard coding source bound plot etc ggplot box looking reusable approach something similar
