suppose three class p c1 c2 composition strong aggregation relation p c1 p c2 e every instance p contains instance c1 instance c2 destroyed parent p instance destroyed association relation instance c1 c2 necessarily child p implement c normally define three class p c1 c2 define two member variable p boost shared ptr c1 boost shared ptr c2 initialize newly created object p constructor implement relation c1 c2 using boost weak ptr c2 member c1 boost weak ptr c1 member c2 set later via appropriate method relation established also would like link c1 c2 p parent good way implement current idea use simple constant raw pointer p const set constructor p turn call constructor c1 c2 e something like c1 public c1 p const p paren p private p const parent p public p new c1 private boost shared ptr c1 honestly see risk using private constant raw pointer way know raw pointer often frowned upon c wondering alternative solution
