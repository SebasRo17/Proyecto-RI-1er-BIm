build multi threaded system handle event game sort independently different thread based priority good idea info begin work porting mid sized game flash as3 continue development multi threading capability small bit background game game contains numerous asynchronous activity world updating game environment constantly changing based set natural law force procedural generation terrain npc quest item etc top effect player interaction environment programmatically calculated real time based set constantly changing stats natural law force thing going asynchronous manner seem lend multi threading well question build kind central engine handle stacking event triggered dynamically sort amongst available thread would good idea example essentially every time something happens ie magic missile generated spell bunch plant need grow next stage instead processing task right adding new list managed object send reference event core event handler throw stack currently queued event sort order according urgency split number available thread fast possible multithreaded execution
