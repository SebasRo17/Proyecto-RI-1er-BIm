possible use interpolating function parameter model nonlinearmodel fit integrated method fitting similar question already posted earlier find best parameter fit data model interpolating function however answer covering whole fitting procedure based method since question value best fit parameter difference asking use possible mathemaca method fitting nonlinearmodelfit find best value parameter also chi confidence region correlation matrix many thing use could calculate want use integrated method one defines model form model x b c give real number set parameter value b c value x mathematica know play instead model defined model b c give set numeric value b c pure function function x range explain mathematica use nonlinearmodelfit one thing could redefine pure function model b c model x b c would require calculating whole slope model b c taking value one point x repeating procedure every point x take long one big set data point error fit better idea
