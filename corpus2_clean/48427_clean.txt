generating set random coordinate ok e g position randomreal radius graphic red sphere position radius plotrangepadding lighting neutral random point want add constraint distance point nearest neighbour fixed good way thinking would like generating virtual molecule atom close far apart otherwise bonded prototype made c back iterated adding new point time randomly generated coordinate happened fit constraint example first placed single point random coordinate called created new point j random coordinate defined distance point point j euclideandistance sqrt position position j position position j position position j constraint based bondlength bondlength euclideandistance bondlength satisfied add point j start new point k comparing distance nearest neighbour course could j repeating seems somewhat inefficient quick dirty prototype coming c background mathematica good way mathematica involve loop update courtesy yves klett question lower bound efficient way generate random point predefined lower bound pairwise euclidean distance mind spot search posting go away play tomorrow apply scenario post come done though answer meantime fine add learning experience
