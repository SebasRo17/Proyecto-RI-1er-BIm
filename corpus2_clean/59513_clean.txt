interested count number real root random polynomial instant put result table plot graph generated million random polynomial following gaussian distribution mean variance used command r gaussiandistribution randompol n sum r x j j n solve x countroots x command countroots apply say generated random polynomial univariate seems awkward manually paste generated random polynomial countroots command instead using link work want million random polynomial practical already used tableform remove thought problem brace since random polynomial generated using command randompol n sum r x j j n inside brace countroots command require brace failed work please help
