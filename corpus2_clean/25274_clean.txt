fairly complicated set coupled non linear integro differential equation trying solve using ndsolve equation dot x big x big n left text sign x x right big x big n text sign left big x big right co pi alpha int limit xi alpha dot xi xi initial condition x may notice last integral nothing definition fractional order integral order alpha implement system equation mathematica follows alpha n tmax intermediate real real evaluate integrate xi alpha xi principalvalue true solutionofsimultaneousequations ndsolvevalue x ab x n sign x x ab x n sign x co pi alpha intermediate x x tmax use following bit code plot result solutionforx solutionofsimultaneousequations solutionforxfn solutionforx solutionfory solutionofsimultaneousequations solutionforyfn solutionfory plot solutionforxfn solutionforxfn tmax plotstyle automatic plotrange full essentially defined function called intermediate real real function called ndsolve everytime value integral required however solution get code make physical sense main concern way implemented integral notice integral required value time however currently code pass single value integral completely different correct ensure integral performed time understand using something like euler forward scheme starting ensure integral performed value prior time better way solve integro differential equation
