need solve sequence equation want starting point new findroot solution earlier findroot increased decreased bit following way data step solve counter c x x findroot f x c c f x c c x b step solve counter c x x findroot f x c c f x c c x b starting point b b something find trial error step counter c x x x b know root monotonic c therefore want new start point previous solution perturbed much less previous solution relative solution finally solution would like store list could math already know use table feed previous solution new start point sol table sol x findroot x x x sol sol know enough mathematica loop command figure use previous solution difference previous solution one start point also know counter stop like counter stop solution first hit particular region example stop x counter c basically like loop stopping condition function counter root calculated far suppose complicated stopping condition hard figure appreciate someone tell run loop simple stopping condition like x unless ofcourse c edit new stuff implementation kguler solution method ok following kgluer comment tried mimic suggested sort working entirely sure going wanna absolutely certain error free implement actual problem ok go f table x x contourplot evaluate f x enter image description want give findroot start point start distance look first solution computes solution want look next solution near first solution difference first solution previous start point look solution near forth parameter superfluous problem threw actual problem like data show non trivially sol add counter data nestwhilelist x x findroot x x x x sol add counter code give following output look like want still fully understand many thing like would change altered th input nestwhilelist nestwhilelist test function know look counter sure thing understand help writing good code explanation greatly appreciated thanks
