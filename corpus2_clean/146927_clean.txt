working recently interface cm use presented question design think applicable number situation essentially extracting information cm transforming information object use programatically purpose consists two step num retrieve cm dal use essentially specifying cm want connection logic anything like num map parsed c object basically two way approach one call multiple method public ienumerable myobject myobjects getmyobjects stuff myobjects private static ienumerable myobject getmyobjects ienumerable list myobject new list myobject stuff map myobjects private static ienumerable list new list stuff get want multiple call one public ienumerable ienumerable myobject myobjects getmyobjects stuff myobjects private static ienumerable myobject getmyobjects ienumerable private static ienumerable tempted say latter better former getmyobjects depend explicit calling step executed retrieve object concerned first approach kind oriented version spaghetti hand two helper method never going used outside sure really matter whether one depends furthermore like fact first approach object retrieved one likely anyone working care object retrieved need retrieve object daisy chained helper method hide exact step needed retrieve practice actually method still able retrieve collection want one one method right wrong simply matter preference context dependent
