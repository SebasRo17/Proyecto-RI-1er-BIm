many others guess struggling handling context within mathematica working new package definition usual syntaxt specified mathematica documentation beginpackage example entry point begin private definition end endpackage want use symbol generated another notebook saved dumpsave efficiency code notebook thus dumpsave mx file symbol symbol symboln import symbol package look like beginpackage example entry point begin private dumpget mx file definition end endpackage already catch symbol automatically loaded private context package example private code snippet original context notebook mx file generated global case thus need convert symbol either private context package definition would following statement example private symbol global symbol example private symbol global symbol example private symboln global symboln remove global symbol global symbol global symboln save symbol already right context using example private symbol symbol example private symbol symbol example private symboln symboln dumpsave mx file example private symbol example private symbol example private symboln generating notebook would preferred solution need clumsy setup want symbol global context symbol visible outside package necessary may cause shadowing problem question quick way copy symbol one context another something like set evaluate example private global symbol symbol symboln would preferrable however statement work idea
