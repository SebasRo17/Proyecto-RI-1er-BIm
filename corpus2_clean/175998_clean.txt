somewhat simple specific question implementing transport layer sip uac expect response request socket sent request let udp tcp listener pick response route correct transaction rfc seem say anything matter seems especially using udp connection less let listener pick response seems sort counter intuitive particularly seen plenty uac implementation depend listener transport layer also implementation looked receiving responding socket would tend indicate client expecting reply socket sent request clarification suppose transport layer consists following element tcpclient sends request uac via tcp sends request uac vid udp receiving request dispatching transaction layer via tcp receiving request dispatching transaction layer via udp obviously client sends request question receives response client waiting recv call socket used send request server conversely server receives request sends response client break role member bit update packet capture sip invite transaction server client server invite request used port num via header num port listening would seem indicate receiving response request sent request valid reasoning
