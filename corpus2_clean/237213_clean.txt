background information building 2d maze generator tried prim algorithm wilson algorithm recursive algorithm generating maze however satisfied difficulty decided create decided two thing make maze hard first maze lot intersection choice make second cause lose way decided create tree represent intersection dead end maze connect node tree randomly generated path user problem begin generate cell maze tree may find node room need connect create child fix avoid problem thought seems like might way dividing maze section subdividing still guarantee enough room end division could also try start small work way smaller area creating connection could still pathing issue enough room connect section together even creating really long path section using hexagonal grid solution guy come rectangular grid easy transfer hexagonal one sure posted theoretical computer science section opted general one
