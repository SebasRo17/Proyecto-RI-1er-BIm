attempting calculate mean curvature surface defined function x function rather simple f co x l sin x l co l calculate mean curvature mean curvature l f co x l sin x l co l f x f f x f f x f f x x f x f plot surface defined f plot f x l l enter image description plot kappa plot x l l enter image description entirely sure whether post question math se mathematica se mathematica se since mathematica component correct ask seems rather trivial anyone suggestion better way perhaps plot better way little background trying prove quantitatively different initial condition created surface like f would engender different amount curvature fluid dynamic problem
