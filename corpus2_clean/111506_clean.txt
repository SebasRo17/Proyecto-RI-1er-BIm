recently started putting version control lab working svn code github obviously git using version control used something like folder library inside many folder version number every time wanted start working newer version would make copy last version change new version start implementing however seems way redundant folder put version control apart redundancy someone want get latest version would downloading version import clone see many way version control since new know would maintainable num using tag understood tag correctly would branch commit whatever change got tag version want get working copy get one certain tag correct wrong num branching version branch would development branch every stable version made let say v1 num create branch version never commit way want download certain version get branch although said never commit may possible bug fix commit old version branch keep old version running example current version v2 num people want use v1 num get another branch v1 num namely v1 num commit bug fix keep version v1 num commit bug fix branch would look like v1 num v1 num v1 num v1 num v2 num dev way branch every minor version update note graph v1 num v1 num created v2 num released part development v1 num v2 num think support older version num branching development opposite previous branch would latest stable version whenever working new version create branch development work stable merge branch case branch would look like dev latest version probably one need done conjunction tag right question anyway question based experience method prof practical known best possibly figure thing commonly done
