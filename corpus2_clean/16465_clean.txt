would like linear progression recursive relation consumption function combining program skill sparse knowledge mathematica thinking loop follows capitaldelta cp cp capitaldelta subscript yl subscript wl subscript cp subscript cp capitaldelta cp cp subscript cp w subscript wl capitaldelta subscript yl cp subscript wl w subscript cp cp though work edit clearifying function one determines consumption cp one determines fortune wp recursive need determine consumption determine fortune cp delta wp cp wp wp cp symbol state data lagged meaning last year value initially append following data variable order loop start since would like project value cp wp ten year ahead wp cp delta would like make loop iterates function time whereas iteration automatically assign newly calculated value lagged variable wp wp vdots would like delta increment year automatically well possible please ask question still unclear objective purpose whole head ache mine make prototype consumption model given society therefore would like able write acquired data graph percentage change different variable axis year projection x axis e short consumption equation defined dlog c dlog log w log c whilst fortune equation corresponds w w c reason used annotation wanted linearize consumption equation purpose placing equation matrix system correspondingly dlog c log c log c delta c l text c l log c firstly though wanted get work initial value lagged variable set first example left parameter simplify projection system worked wanted add hope clarifies well enough objective end edit end solve
