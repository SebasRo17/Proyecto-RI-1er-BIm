x point supposed form ellipse point point listplot point want numerically fit ellipse around point tried use nminimize method least square shown q issue problem x related parametrically directly like problem worse ellipse center tilted use nice left frac x right left frac b right use equation found wikipedia surprisingly without citation ellipsewiki strategy generate x equation equation specifically x x x xc yc b would use nminimize optimize square difference point ellipse would eventually get back xc yc b curlyphi every single value tried find elegant way using nminimized parametric equation believe multivariate example nminimized documentation exactly parametric equation see also linked q example code find xc yc b tlist toexpression tostring range equation join mapthread xc co co curlyphi b sin sin curlyphi point tlist mapthread yc co sin curlyphi b sin co curlyphi point tlist solution nminimize equation join tlist xc yc b curlyphi equation ellipse look like show tilted ellipse disk drawn using disk rotate graphic yellow rotate disk xc yc ab b curlyphi solution starting point point listplot ellipse outline plotted parametric equation parametricplot xc co co curlyphi b sin sin curlyphi yc co sin curlyphi b sin co curlyphi solution pi plotstyle red point ellipse corresponding listplot xc co co curlyphi b sin sin curlyphi yc co sin curlyphi b sin co curlyphi solution solution plotstyle red ax true ellipse even though got want feel clunky way solve problem least need solve needed xc yc b another issue reason value supposed long axis negative smaller magnitude axis rotate angle ellipse crazy high radian tried apply constrains nminimize degree curlyphi degree kept getting error nminimized error ellipse wiki reference lastly really appreciate general comment make code better still beginner mma probably could tell zeal pure function example reading chapter
