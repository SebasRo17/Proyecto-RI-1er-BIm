previous question mine asked whether mathematica built routine could determine isomorphism two k chromatic graph determining whether two k chromatic graph isomorphic respecting vertex coloration response user whuber came really neat clever technique add complete graph module original k chromatic graph comparison isomorphism exists two k chromatic graph iff isomorphism exists monochromatic form attached module whubar point allows one proceed using mathematica built function isomorphicgraphq findgraphisomorphism like ask slightly different question let g g two k chromatic graph e graph vertex independently assigned one k unique color open method implementation mathematica like know g g equivalent rather simply isomorphic word like know isomorphism exists monochromatic version g g isomorphism applied k chromatic form work without color reassignment possible replace colored vertex monochromatic widget positive result isomorphicgraphq findgraphisomorphism imply equivalence k chromatic form g g also answer false isomorphicgraphq return empty set findgraphisomorphism necessarily indicative isomorphism algorithm simply time number graph component large would extremely helpful know latter true since would require write implementation
