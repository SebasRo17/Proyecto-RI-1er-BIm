watched talk daniel talk advantage structural typing compared scala an nominal typing one example difference would following public interface foo public length public interface bar public length foo f bar b f course would compile compatibility foo bar determined structural system hand could declare type equal compatible thus amongst thing allow checked duck typing think understand advantage structural system wonder would invalidate safety example like following foo bar def b bar def getbar bar new bar val foo1 new foo val foo2 new foo foo1 foo1 getbar compile foo1 foo2 getbar compile understanding correct structural system last would compile well disadvantage respect safety
