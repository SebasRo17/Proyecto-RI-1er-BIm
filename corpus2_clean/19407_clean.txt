noisy data like analyze derivative function data approximately match interpolation normally great work well data table x sin x randomreal x pi almost sin x xi interpolation data plot xi co x see derivative expected think interpolation work co x case obvious curve sin x family would trivial fit take derivative fit data actually collected know function assuming high order polynomial may fit well almost certainly incorrect assumption way plot derivative cleanly without requiring knowledge function possible tell interpolation need hit every point exactly
