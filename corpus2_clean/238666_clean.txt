design pattern well known algorithm build simple map road city block idea target describe constraint context matrix represents rectangular map possible city block represented rectangle eg 4x3 1x6 possible road size eg num num block never connected meaning always road result would like num num num num num example num block num road intend place block possible road go would ok could lead place block fit would like know something state art algorithm
