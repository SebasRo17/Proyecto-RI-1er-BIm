pizza picking problem circular pizza pie n slice slice area e area different pie piece alice bob take turn picking slice rude create multiple gap pie consider allowed thus eater restricted taking one two slice adjacent open region alice go first seek much pie possible would dynamic programming algorithm determine much pie alice eats alice bob play perfectly maximize pizza consumption understanding general dp problem go forward finding sub problem visualized using recursion tree tightly using dag finding lead find sub problem given set need maximize area slice eaten alice depend choosing permutation pizza slice n num permutation choosing max area slice two option available every n num turn alice get give u total area slice permutation need find area slice permutation maximum somebody help go forward
