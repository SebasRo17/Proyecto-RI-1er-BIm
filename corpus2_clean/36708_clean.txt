currently working solving seir model data cdc created function calculate square difference model want create table value variable combination along goodness fit characteristic square difference getting alert running function ndsolve computed initial value give zero residual differential algebraic system component different specified need satisfied giving initial condition dependent variable derivative recommended sound like something could ignore want mess anything also big question recommendation make creating table value efficient rather waiting half hour work clearall global cdcdata listplot cdcdata p interpolation cdcdata plot p population squarediff mu beta alpha nu sol first ndsolve mu population mu beta population e beta population mu alpha e alpha e nu mu r nu mu r r e e r sum cdcdata j cdcdata j sol j length cdcdata value flatten table b c squarediff b c b c
