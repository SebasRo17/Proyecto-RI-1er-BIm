modifying application cleaner client server split allow load splitting resource sharing etc everything written interface easy add remoting layer interface using proxy everything worked fine next phase add caching layer interface worked fine speed improved much would expected inspection became clear going feel sure behavior seen many time probably design pattern solve problem eludes even sure describe easiest explained example let imagine interface interface list ithing list ithing id call fill list returning interface implemented client proxied remoting client call remoting server turn call implementation server client server layer also cache client interface client cache remote client remote server server cache server interface call client interface call passed client cache fault call remote client pass call remote server call server cache also fault call eventually passed server interface actually get ithing turn server cache filled finally client cache also called client interface client cache get returned immediately second client called b would fill server cache b well client cache first client call b client cache fault server cache one would expect work well let call c work would expect calling twice subtlety call cannot directly make use cache therefore sequence call client interface turn call remote client remote server eventually server interface call fill list returning problem call satisfied server ideally satisfied client imagine client server link really slow becomes clear client call efficient server call client cache example contrived illustrate point general problem cannot keep adding proxied layer interface expect work would imagine soon call go proxy subsequent call proxied side rather self side failed learn learned something correctly implemented used ejbs seems example may confusing problem nothing cache efficiency illusion created use proxy aop technique general whose implement interface assumption call might make call example public inetaddress tostring public getstring get call getstring result depends running add remoting proxy result could different call getstring initial call get actual called find confusing wonder control behavior especially use proxy may third party concept fine practice certainly expected missed point somewhere
