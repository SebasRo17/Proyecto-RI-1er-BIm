noticed documentation vertexconnectivity defined following vertex connectivity graph g smallest number vertex whose deletion g disconnect g cyclegraph expect one need delete least two vertex make resulting graph disconnected please correct driven wrong intuition opt vertexlabels name imagepadding graph cyclegraph opt graph undirectedgraph graph opt row graph graph enter image description strange mathematica returning intuitive value graph graph vertexconnectivity graph graph one make graph disconnected deleting one vertex someone shade light issue edgeconnectivity though give understandable output graph
