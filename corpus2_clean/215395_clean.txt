working project implement kind world simulation square 2d world agent live world make decision like moving replicating based neighbor cell world grid extra parameter based state world looking structure implement project concern implement num time sequential using openmp using mpi use structure quite good first thing come keeping 2d world storing agent reference simulate world time slice checking every cell iteration processing agent found cell downside 1000x1000 world num agent overkill sequential parallel version check cell look possible agent use quadtree store agent get information neighbor cell please let know elaborate
