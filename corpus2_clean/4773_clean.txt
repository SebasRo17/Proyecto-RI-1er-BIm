using several mathematica package numerical inverse laplace transforms known expressible closed form expression tilde f confronted difficult problem obtain tilde f table like f f f etc able find package inverse laplace transform tabulated data saw one ancient discussion forum say inverse fourier transform used see possible would greatly appreciate anyone done something like knew appropriate package suggestion workaround edit getting tabulated result transformed function tilde f frac frac tilde g tilde g tilde g int infty h x dx know h x integral x cannot done analytically numerically end tabular data tilde f
