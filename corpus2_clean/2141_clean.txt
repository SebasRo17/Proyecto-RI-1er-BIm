frequently come across following problem rewrite complicated partial differential equation clear way would like create order collecting term equal example rather messy equation frac l f x l f x lambda f x written clear text newform f x f x frac l l lambda question determine coefficient given pde make tangible suppose partial differential equation f x quadratic f order derivative derivative written sum j k l j k l x j f k l x sum j k l n b j k l n x j f k l x f n x want use mathematica rewrite pde form e replace calculate coefficient include term zero coefficient new form create replacement rule coefficient check new form writing eq indeed equivalent point established point easy check following add zero oldform newform substitutionrule give idea term appear pde small l f x l lambda f x l f x l lambda f x l f x small f x f x f x f x f x inputform toy pde eqn l f x l lambda f x l derivative f x l derivative f x l lambda derivative f x f x derivative f x derivative f x derivative f x derivative f x convenient copy notebook form eqn l f x l lambda f x l derivative f x l derivative f x l lambda derivative f x f x derivative f x derivative f x derivative f x derivative f x update pillsy gave nice solution exactly see kind power x partial x partial contained example pde use code add total coeffrules j k l coeff subscript j k l x j derivative k l f b j k l n coeff subscript b j k l n x j derivative k l f derivative n f give small f f f b f f f b f much easer see kind pde one thing would like ask avoid double counting term result example factor f work think time integer b b time b integer b small f f f b f f f b f
