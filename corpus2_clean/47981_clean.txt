mathematica easy conditionally suppress plotting individual line using plot x x exp x x exp x false x check recommended rahul x plotstyle thick frame true enter image description verbosely using piecewise indeterminate plot piecewise x x indeterminate piecewise exp x exp x x indeterminate piecewise x false indeterminate check recommended rahul x plotstyle thick frame true enter image description reported neither method work version least osx furthermore reported attempt using conditionalexpression also fails plot conditionalexpression x x conditionalexpression exp x exp x x x plotstyle thick frame true plotting zero reported work hardly solution plot piecewise x x piecewise exp x exp x x x plotstyle thick frame true enter image description indeed bug version workaround affected system
