simple domain num object model part clear child parent relationship parent multuple child going immutable however point need fetch set object given able fetch specific certain label going model generic map abstract object model adding model stick map asks parent object stick map etc likewise delete delete class called child way query specific class generic without writing logic hunt thought next thought rather use similar framework save cpu looking child manner already store object claimed x parent delete say give child x however assumes x know something object class effectively child put via reflection mostly brittle one presume certain going claim parent model clarify let say node edge edge would report node parent node say give object claimed parent edge logic even though never anything ensure edge using node wrong note small system know great abstraction pattern huge system mostly think worth implementation cost less explicit simple system
