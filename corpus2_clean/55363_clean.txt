mathematica row texform work harmoniously x sqrt b arcsin c row texform x sqrt b sin c latex x sqrt b sin c unfortunately broken recent version mathematica return texform unspt texform templateslotsequence supported error reported version well attempt workaround substitute grid row latex code generated different x sqrt b arcsin c grid texform enter image description format differently begin array ccc x sqrt b sin c documentation texform indicates extensible rule format could fine rule worked manually convert single row follows stringjoin tostring texform x sqrt b arcsin c x sqrt b sin c though note one must copy plain text however attempting make format rule result double conversion get enter image description indeed bug believe best work around problem preferably automatic
