list consists sublists equal length outer list regarded multiset permutation sublists matter repetition order sublists matter except permutation applied sublists also matter problem want write function test whether two list equivalent rule obvious solution would course generate inner permutation one set seek one outer permutation course gotten rid sorting feel simpler efficient solution seem able figure make concrete example like get e g following result equiv true get second first exchanging first last element sublist hand equiv false common permutation transforms first second course also want equiv true sublists permuted outer list also equiv true combine permutation sublists common permutation element list best way write equiv function
