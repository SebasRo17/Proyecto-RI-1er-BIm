working special algorithm implement accurate effective mass calculation hole carrier silicon mathematica rather involved algorithm us incomplete fermi dirac integral form mathscr f j x b frac gamma j int b infty frac j e x mathrm dt fincomplete j x b gamma j integrate j e x b assumption j call function b yield complete fermi dirac integral representation nicely implemented polylog function within mathematica fincomplete j x polylog j e x however one want evaluate incomplete fermi dirac integral expression stay unevaluated indicating straightforward solution available fincomplete j x b integrate j e x b assumption j gamma j question idea multitude mathematical function within mathematica could leveraged implement incomplete fermi dirac integral could nielsen generalized polylogarithm function mentioned within mathematica help system service anybody integral already implemented series expansion quoted web e g computation complete incomplete fermi dirac integral however reference quote series expansion converge rather slowly would like leave implementation reference last resort since would take time maybe easier way mathematica thanks advance help
