suppose list l b c e f would like remove one pair x function check x return x nothing particular pair function return order list important example check c e c check f f check combination empty final list b e know write loop index based removal slicker way using mathematica list manipulation function edit check function non overlapping usage case problematic overlap say check e check f f e f remain since removal assuming position earlier f pair formed f
