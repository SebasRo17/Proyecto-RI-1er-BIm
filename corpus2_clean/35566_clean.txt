ugly looking equation wish solve specific circumstance using dsolve write dsolve p r r rc r l log rc r l l r sqrt l rc arctan rc r sqrt l r p rc p r r yield long ugly expression involving imaginary number polylog function fair enough trying simplify telling look realistic case r r c always real positive p also r c r r c r always positive number l also always positive order magnitude smaller r r c attempted use full simplify assumption expression u fullsimplify rc r rc r l p simplifies expression somewhat still clunky imaginary part suspect simplified tried refine yield better expression possible clean accept complex looking expression give real answer cannot simplified thanks
