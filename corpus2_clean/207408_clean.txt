read genetic algorithm usually always applied chromosome bit problem involves maximizing take integer value integer first encoded bit mapping necessary seems could take chromosome integer apply crossover mutation directly take num integer input apply genetic operator integer rather bit b number bit needed encode integer reason done perhaps algorithm would suffer problem defined coarsely problem defined shorter chromosome using bit curious anyone better answer
