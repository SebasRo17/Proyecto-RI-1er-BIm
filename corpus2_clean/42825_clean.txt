trying understand basic image transformation attempted code image resize function us bilinear interpolation checked work mma imageresize resampling bilinear command result similar following minimal example demonstrates fully understand mma algorithm let im x picture grayscale value common sense knowledge bilinear interpolation tell resizing image x give however imagedata imageresize image resampling bilinear return resizing x give middle term equally spaced apart first last two element spaced apart resizing x give confuses first last two entry repeated result similar matlab produce though octave told produce think right entry equally spaced apart checked two image editing program one gave result similar mma one gave result similar exactly common sense anyone explain mathematica implementing bilinear interpolation
