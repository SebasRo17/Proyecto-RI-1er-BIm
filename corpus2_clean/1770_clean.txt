question regarding use parallelize help one read parallelize table expr iter equivalent paralleltable expr iter give result table except side effect computation ok easy code use conditional inside table arraya table randomreal arraytobefilled constantarray parallelize table arraya arraytobefilled arraya arraytobefilled arraya method automatic timing get useful result except unaltered initialized array use code without parallelize work fine even faster since real code principal calculation take time evaluation hoped could increase speed using parallelize seems either understanding something wrong something wrong parallelize somebody tell case also would happy somebody could tell better way could increase speed code example
