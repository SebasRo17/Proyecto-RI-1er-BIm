using mathematica mathematica default plotstyle coloring plot listplot example suppose series nine function stored list function mathematica style different curve cyclic way think default cycle blue purple dark yellow green example function table co x plot function x pi co x co x co x co x co x co x co x co x co x plot nice suppose want color multiple curve using sort gradient perhaps one gradient colordata possible plot listplot could somewhat manually example wanted blue gradient could write following although choice color could somehow improved plot function x pi plotstyle lighter lighter lighter lighter blue lighter lighter lighter blue lighter lighter blue lighter blue blue darker blue darker darker blue darker darker darker blue darker darker darker darker blue plot however becomes complicated many curve want use complex gradient rainbow e g colordata rainbow temperature map e g colordata temperaturemap etc suggestion
