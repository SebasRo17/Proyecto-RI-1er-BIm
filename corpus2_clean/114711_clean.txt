one look perhaps older manual drool rule engine one illustration added solving puzzle miss manner puzzle manual drool puzzle naturally formulated solved using prolog recent constraint programming language one wonder would anyone would use drool purpose added prolog cpl give case ability naturally formulate puzzle set logical predicate automatically search space solution cpl efficient respect added product drool mean besides bell whistle taking example excel file translating set rule specifically prolog implement backtrack search clp implement backtrack search constraint propagation therefore instead searching speak whole cartesian product space individual variable prune away large portion product space make effective useful prolog clp discussed literature hand clear rete algorithm cache set rule form structure thus understanding making effective evaluate input changed giving mean update structure incremental change difficult understand basic idea even compared prolog clp unfortunately hard find good reference view rete algorithm wider context documentation drool unfortunately informative respect could find rete algorithm leap algorithm descendant drool leap provide efficient way matching rule pattern domain especially efficient datasets change entirely rule engine remember past match algorithm battle proven efficient compared battle proven could one point real world application would appreciate one could throw light subject give valid reference
