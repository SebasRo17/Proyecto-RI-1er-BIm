integrating difficult function using conditional output place bound parameter ensure integrability seems condition returned following simple example illustrates issue perform integration integrate exp b infinity receive correct output conditionalexpression b b perform integration integrate exp x b x infinity infinity receive conditionalexpression b condition parameter b ensuring integrability returned case mathematica return condition associated last integration step thanks
