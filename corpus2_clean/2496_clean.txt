currently problem floating point function give intermediate result example e kp x x xj get passed another function fill value mathematica reacts sqrt error however see factor cancel factor denominator give result thus well defined idea let mathematica cancel factor tried simplify fullsimplify assumption work cannot change much function intermediate result example post intermediate result also occur sometimes problem sometimes work fine
