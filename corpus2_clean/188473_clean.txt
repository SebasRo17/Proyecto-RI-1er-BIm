assume desirable base pure interface using num example better approach using abstract virtual definition advantage abstract version probably look cleaner force derived give hopefully meaningful implementation advantage virtual version easily pulled module used testing without adding bunch underlying framework like abstract version requires abstract version public abstract public abstract returntype method1 public abstract returntype method2 public abstract returntype methodn implementation stuff virtual version public public virtual returntype method1 returntype public virtual returntype method2 returntype public virtual returntype methodn returntype implementation stuff
