several class reasonably complex acyclic dependency graph dependency form x instance contains attribute attribute set initialization never changed constructor couple parameter know proper parameter pas constructor object contains outer top dependency hierarchy e depends currently ui layer creates outer instance parameter outer constructor derived user course outer process initialization creates object need turn create object need new development user know dependency graph may want reach deep set value argument passed constructor inner class essentially overriding value used currently change design support could keep current approach inner class created class need case information user override would need passed outer constructor complex user override structure perhaps user override could full logical representation dependency graph override attached appropriate edge outer would pas user override every creates would initializing lower level object find location graph check user requested override constructor argument alternatively could rewrite object constructor take parameter full object require thus creation inner object would moved outside whole hierarchy new controller layer lie outer ui layer controller layer would essentially traverse dependency graph bottom creating object go controller layer would ask higher level object parameter value lower level object whenever relevant parameter provided user neither approach look terribly simple approach problem come enough past pattern read using think matter much design level
