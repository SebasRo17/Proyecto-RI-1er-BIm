suppose want implement function solve basic elliptic problem using finite element degree example normally user function interested numerical solution elliptic problem e value solution proper grid user call something like u ellipticdirichlet range sometimes caller function may interested internal detail computation example linear system formulation problem e stiffness matrix k load vector f ideally function return ancillary data tagged way user function get data simply roubust want fuction return everytime solution ancillary data list like following pseudocode u k f ellipticdirichlet range way handle situation think following way using option argument tell function return clean opinion option would preferable keep main result distinct ancillary intermediate computation data returning object property like linearmodelfit example probably best idea make function result difficult use understand casual reader using sow sure use case sow example legal sow function one reap documentation say nothing way accomplish task update anything matlab fan asking common scenario matlab simple consume provide function return differently shaped answer different level detail example matlab call function syntax like x u ellipticsolve interested x grid used solution u grid vertex call x u k ellipticsolve occasionally also interested stiffness matrix k linear system used solve problem also call k ellipticsolve interested stiffness matrix k think function ellipticsolve also optimization computation recognizing output requested basically whish able something like
