question size plot mathematica working differential equation simplified model heat transfer building programmed set initial temperature using slider initial temperature go series calculaions resulting graph slider next look like plot great plot little small guy know way make show bigger default manually would really like mainly way sure always size look neater report also even though used dynamic slider graph change instantly presumably parameter first used solve function result used plot way make graph plot change instantly complete code look like heat transfer co fficient matrix mostly dependant wall area eve eigenvectors eva eigenvalue use part manually enter initial temperature want overrule slider solve eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c eve c c c c c us eigenvectors solve needed co fficients probably way efficiently using loop sort know cc c cc c cc c cc c assigns value solve may used later verticalslider dynamic dynamic verticalslider dynamic dynamic verticalslider dynamic dynamic verticalslider dynamic dynamic plot cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva cc eve e eva plotrange plot result could probably done loop know help greatly appreciated thanks advance
