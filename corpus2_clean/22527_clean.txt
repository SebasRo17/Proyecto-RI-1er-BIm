attchd graphic called chromograms represent set discrete state continuous time ie discrete event signal generated mathematica osx cinema display top row independent signal bottom two chromograms red green show segment top row agree green temporal coding differ red rectangle left right position encoded timestamps even begin event end x axis timeline second graphic show window enter image description problem note red rectangle bottom row corresponding hole complementary green signal error mathematica graphic rendering closer inspection reveals hole problem becomes extreme zooming graph larger time window next figure data shown window enter image description stiff scale graphic many instance problem closer inspection show red green event signal partition time axis red green rectangle never overlap problem unrelated choice color flipping red green still show upper signal problematic seems rectangle rendered thick overlap option method one could use control issue potentially generating complementary set interval event actively rendering white may work tested would hack case
