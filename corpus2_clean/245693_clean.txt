num imagine got finite deterministic automaton defining finite regular language l consisting n word num first question would determine number word n num want enumerate word e create like f num n l suggestion following restriction apply n may large enough instance num 9a z num yield n num num different combination storing memory option want able persist state instance compute f x store needed intermediate db time later compute f x num done simplification fixed length word suggestion arbitrary dfa suspect common problem algorithm reference welcome thanks
