r package called timp package someone fit data model gui timp called glotaran fit data package take much time get answer consisted lifetime amplitude fluorescence spectrum sample however try thing mathematica global analysis fitting different data set different model parameter common lifetime take longer mathematica eats huge chunk ram bottom line mathematica fast timp want know happens due written mathematica language timp package use different algorithm objection would expect mathematica much better job supposed heavy mathematical operation expensive expect much higher quality personally considered mathematica tool various heavy computation point putting much energy time mastering mathematica learn specialized software achieve goal
