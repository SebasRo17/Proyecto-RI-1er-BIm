f sqrt sqrt co sin sqrt sqrt co sin function identically real value however fullsimplify f real spit back original function also tried trigreduce trigexpand etc avail make mathematica simplify thing like interested playing w ellipsis f represents sum distance focii minus actual value sum distance focii general case x co b sin focus b sqrt b f sqrt x focus b sqrt x focus b f constant real b probably b thing get bit complex case
