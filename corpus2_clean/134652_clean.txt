trying design small project right way trouble task need realize multiplication big number using fft first class largenumber field abstract maybe interface would better c c public virtual field z p public virtual field largenumber use z p modulo p c c complex class correct c c z p mul sum function multiply largenumber object another task interesting difficult need calculate operation time big operation take also need throw message create log solve problem also great comment pattern best practice class largenumber private length vector short number public prototype largenumber clone get length const vector short number const static static largenumber create new largenumber static const largenumber constructor largenumber largenumber const largenumber obj explicit largenumber len explicit largenumber vector short largenumber destructors largenumber kill operator largenumber operator const largenumber largenumber operator largenumber operator bool operator const largenumber const field private inline max const const b b b inline min const const b b b need mod num p num largenumber const largenumber mod largenumber public virtual field virtual largenumber sum const largenumber const largenumber virtual largenumber sub const largenumber const largenumber virtual largenumber mul const largenumber const largenumber virtual largenumber pow const largenumber const largenumber virtual bool prime largenumber
