wonder could make graph scale automatically vary size vertex would like visualize information graph vertex e g additional info like weight would like visualize vertex drawn different size however define size graph keep original opposed new layout graph becomes invisible graph undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge show standard graph add weight graph undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge vertexsize show scaled would like graph would like nice thought graph currently working see one vertex hit neighbour would expect mm reposition vertex bit scale node course done dividing vertex number manual work see look best hope another way example
