widely us built in module method len instead length filter f instead filter f str num instead num str map foreach etc prevent nice chaining possible language like ruby scala sorry artificial example list map f filter g length would need either split several line list something else map f list list something else without blah filter g list something else length len list something else without blah single expression look readable len filter g map f list considered pythonic chain method people usually extend class dozen helper function make easier
