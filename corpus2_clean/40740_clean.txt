spiral trying place circle along outside archimedean spiral shown archimedian spiral pi parametricplot co sin plotstyle red circle circle placement effectively trying use law cosine determine change angle found path would contain circle center f co sin using law cosine following law cosine example seems pretty straight forward right well went solve angle alpha mathematica seems trouble code seems work fine subsequent evaluation seem go smoothly fact evaluation contain pi seems fail evaluation distance point show angle distance question wrong expect also efficient correct method solve angle end product thanks kennycolnago response final product
