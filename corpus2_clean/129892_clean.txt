let say 50k point randomly allocated 3d space according volumetric part space point closer together part away every point random color represented integer example would like find point within certain general distance different color fastest way compute non mandatory detail end goal remove point color collision would like remove color possible however mandatory could simply remove color involved collision though could result lower quality result distance need exact instance exact collision radius represents perfect sphere would fine collision radius shape say cube also fine trigger happy solution fine point get detected even close want happen often cannot accept point close detected also sure family algorithm devoted life come name knowing algorithm would immensely helpful
