trying generate simple ar process mathematica using arprocess function process must following format alpha beta however reading mathematica help file post arprocess mma se find way correctly generate process seems arprocess function cannot deal alpha term process instance consider process described normally distributed mean variance e sim n use arprocess get mean arprocess variance arprocess consistent ar process form would like able though arprocess function calculate mean variance process order get mean variance way achieve mathematica
