writing javafx gui program user configuration embedded system device device connected wired wireless serial connection num reliable therefore user make setting change gui program sends set message device must verify set question program structure useful purpose current approach called sync contains two variable related particular setting one bound setting appears gui another setting received device property sync describes two setting device setting newer gui setting newer field decoration bind setting button called set sends set message device continually poll device setting stored sync decorator give feedback user whether setting synced like something bit elegant sync take care sending message checking setting set specific question remove set button sync update device whenever valid setting decoration enough indicate whether setting set would dialog box better general question best practice approach problem common class would useful alternative design edit constraint like keep device dumb possible implemented custom protocol crc ack retries message buffer etc albeit two embedded system software modified different beginner arduino project want keep logic even validation gui side
